            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage, and if there is any, I would just go over it again with the Bellabe.</li>

            <li>I feel like this would do a great job.</li>

            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t seem to grip shorter hairs, although I&#x27;m still learning.  </li>
            <li>Works great price for this beauty aid</li>

            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>100% honest!</li>
            <li>This is the most awesome tool!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that the best way to use this is to wash your face before using it and after use, be sure to use an astringent.</li>
            <li>good delivery service, great product</li>
            <li>was impeccable a week ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found something so awesome!</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>This will remove hair as stated, but I do not find the process particularly pleasant.  </li>
            <li>and it is great for removing those fine hairs!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for ripping out those fine downy like hairs.</li>
            <li>this is the perfect tool for me for cleaning up those fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li>Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li>I read good reviews on this product but when I tried it</li>
            <li>She loved it and that&#x27;s all that</li>
            <li>It took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how to get the hair to come out.</li>
            <li>Just throw it in your makeup case and you&#x27;re good to go when traveling.</li>
            <li>good, but need to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>I washed my face and still my face was tingling, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>This does hurt and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of ripping out the hair once you get the hang of how to twist it.  </li>
            <li>I loved the feeling it gave me after using.</li>
            <li>... I like to think I have  a good tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>I watched the &amp;#34;demo&amp;#34; on Youtube so I had a good idea about how to use the Bellable.  </li>
            <li>This product works just as good as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Did a good job.  </li>
            <li>which was good,.</li>
            <li>This tool is a good way to remove your hairs without shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>I would have loved this product and kept using it</li>
            <li>always good features.</li>
            <li>Loved this thing.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, it works really good.  </li>
            <li>but once you get it it should be good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>A good tool.</li>
            <li>this product is good and has been helping me a lot.</li>
            <li>Sea Breeze is a good one since it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good an no visible fuzz or hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived today, and to my surprise, I&#x27;m delighted with it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Braun and it has been good.  </li>
            <li>any hair removal that pulls the hair from the root will not feel good, no matter what.  </li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>this is so good for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>It was a bit tricky to use,but I feel that one must work with this item to get good results.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s start with the good.  </li>
            <li>But, for the price, this is good.</li>
            <li>In the meantime....it&#x27;s a good thing someone invented tweezers.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>It is good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to have in your hair removal arsenal.  </li>
            <li>but thats it as I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li>I did a fair bit of research and watched the youtube videos before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>and it came in on good time.</li>
            <li>The material is good though.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Works good, does sting in areas you aren&#x27;t used to plucking, but after a couple&lt;br /&gt;weeks</li>
            <li>Good ole USPS</li>
            <li>Love this its awesome and its easy to use!</li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>The hair for the most part has gotten finer and finer and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this &amp;#34;analog&amp;#34; device, and I&#x27;ll no longer pay for salon services.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews about how great it is</li>
            <li>many others,I am happy with it and regret not getting one sooner.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>If you use the hair remover at the right angle, it will work the best!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product!</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>After reading through tons of reviews I decided to purchase, and am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>I like the Bellabe so much better than waxing!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>ALWAYS make sure to cleanse and close the pores after use!</li>
            <li>I have had this thing for about 7 weeks and have not been able to pull one hair!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love My Bellabe!</li>
            <li>and I love that it lasts six months to a year!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it removes hair like it says it does, but the pain of pulling hair from your face takes some getting used to!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get better results with scotch tape!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t have to bother with, or buy, any more wax!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I received it and it took me about 3 days (30-45 minutes a day) to get a 90% hair free face!!  </li>
            <li>but saw this and decided to give it a try and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>worked great cleaning was easy</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly and it came with great directions....</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A much more pleasant tool to use now.</li>
            <li>The positive about this purchase is that I understand THREADING and found a woman who does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy tool to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>Very effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She looked amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>After using it I was amazed at how smooth and hair-free my face looked, the results were great for having used it once and for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>A great investment in a smooth face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it works.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>but the time saved is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it was amazing.</li>
            <li>works amazingly for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing you can watch people do this on video&#x27;s and not grimace in pain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing because hair you can&#x27;t even see will be plucked.</li>
            <li>is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I do wonder if over time the product will lose tension and no longer be effective...</li>
            <li>If you remove hairs on your face at all you should own this.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s the handiest device I own.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it grabs the finer hairs better than the darker thicker hairs.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand why so many people would say they loved their Bellabe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great as all the reviewers love it, and it did its job</li>
            <li>The ad states \\&quot;Effective.</li>
            <li>Fill up the tub with warm water and bath salts, and relax for a bit.</li>
            <li>This product is effective and inexpensive; however, it can aggravate the skin, and it hurts like a mother.</li>
            <li>It is portable, cost effective and saves me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>Interesting product, its like a spring, gave it 3 stars because its good but just not for me.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is effective and seems to remove the hair longer than tweezers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, an effective product and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was compensated for this review but the opinions are completely my own.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To me, it works a great deal better than wax as you are able to remove all of the hair with just this spring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to not have to stand/sit in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li>liked this so well</li>
            <li>I washed my face thoroughly with cleanser and warm water.</li>
            <li>I have picked up some of my own techniques as well.</li>
            <li>kind of...awkward to the face my hair kept getting caught in it...</li>
            <li>and I can do it in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>nicely packaged too.  </li>
            <li>Okay, they did a good job</li>
            <li>skin looks so nice</li>
            <li>This really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was quite impressed with how well this funky wire/spring thing works.  </li>
            <li>Great, great buy and works very well.  </li>
            <li>If your like me, you like anything you own to be &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; be it a hair remover or shoes...</li>
            <li>However, my thoughts and opinions expressed here are 100% my own and honest.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute case which is good too.</li>
            <li>However, it is effective.</li>
            <li>I turned to Amazon to see what kind of a solution I could find.</li>
            <li>It is nice though saves u from paying 20$ at a salon</li>
            <li>There are some parts that it can&#x27;t get and it does kind of hurt.</li>
            <li>After perseverance and reading the instructions again, I found it remarkably effective.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice if it would have worked though.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have the grip for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly effective with pulling out the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Every woman should own one of these.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating because I cannot honestly say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; tearing at my face.  </li>
            <li>It kind of hurt.</li>
            <li>Honestly wish I&#x27;d never tried this product, it ruined my face.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions as they said--but it just isnt effective</li>
            <li>Excellent product and very well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even going to try to be kind.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like the springs you find in toys around the battery terminal - but longer and tighter.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel the product is as spectacular as it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li>Does not reliably or effectively remove hair at the root .</li>
            <li>So it will very effectively remove fine fuzz.</li>
            <li>This is surprisingly easy to use and so effective!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of great reviews and boy, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>And surprisingly, it pulled very fine hair from my lip area that I wasn&#x27;t really able to see.</li>
            <li>I watched a video from Youtube first, which helped, because frankly, the package directions weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wax anymore but kept the wax for nose hairs, because it is excellent for that and not slow torture like plucking them.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product thanks &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on more flawless, looks smoother, I really can see a difference.</li>
            <li>With so many good reviews I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found the product to be very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>After I ordered one, I ordered 3 more and am going to order more!  </li>
            <li>I thought that the &#x27;invisible&#x27; fine hairs would hurt, but those were the easiest, so that&#x27;s a good place to start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>The perfect solution to an age old problem.</li>
            <li>LOL HAVE FUN...</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is the easiest and most effective I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>and the REM is much more effective.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and excellent product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to find a mirror and a good light, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is the most effective and the easiest tool for threading.</li>
            <li>But this is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is really effective.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a warm cloth to soften the skin and make the hairs come out.</li>
            <li>Since then I have tried so many things to effectively remove hair, it is almost embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I would have to wear my glasses, turn on a bright light, and use a 10X magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the longer the hair, the more effective the product is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Way cool!!</li>
            <li>Not for very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and works well!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and takes out a swath of hairs at the root - hairs you don&#x27;t even know you have until the sting - it brings tears to my eyes (which is where some may draw the line but not me!)</li>
            <li>Once you get used to this, it is easy to use!</li>
            <li>Would not recommend unless for very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Need to figure out a good way to clean it after use.</li>
            <li>Fast, practicaly pain free and priceless!!  </li>
            <li>i love this product very easy to use.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I experienced a bit of pain - but it gets easier every</li>
            <li>I was looking for an effective, inexpensive way to better remove facial hair and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy at first.</li>
            <li>Product is great - really works!</li>
            <li>It was great at first</li>
            <li>Too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer advises (wisely) that you wash the area before and after using the device, and that you end with a toner--presumably to make sure the pores and hair follicles are clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin does not break out and in fact, feels very smooth and silky after each Bellabe use.</li>
            <li>Takes the hair off our face to make it very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Your technique is very important.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>So easy and effective</li>
            <li>It is nice, but I just wish I can remove the hair inside the springs easily.</li>
            <li>I can deal with that if it is easy to use and effective</li>
            <li>Effective, easy to use and prefer over waxing.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick and I loved buying and ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly blond mostly fine hair and the Bellabe took most of them out!</li>
            <li>Love this &amp;#34;threader&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threading is definitely becoming a more popular way to eliminate hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m really happy with this, it did a good job (sensitive skin), and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy!!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such a wonderful, practical effective product!</li>
            <li>Better for coarser hair</li>
            <li>Okay, this thing works too well.  </li>
            <li>It works ok if you continue to use it.</li>
            <li>10xs better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more confident about bring close to my husband.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies a lot better now also.</li>
            <li>This is a magic wand, it takes out more hair than I knew I had.</li>
            <li>I have used the Bellabe facial hair remover and found it to be an excellent mechanical hair remover.</li>
            <li>We are both pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I bought Bellabe because of the reviews, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It hurts like a mug, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I love these and wish that I had known about them years ago.</li>
            <li>It gets all the hair, even the most stubborn ones, most of the time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooo glad I won&#x27;t need to buy the creams anymore.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could manipulate it better to make it work on my chin.  </li>
            <li>, it gets better.</li>
            <li>There is a stinging sensation, but more gentler than wax removal.  </li>
            <li>I went online to the Bellabe site and read more about it.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>This sounded like the perfect item to painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li>, what was to love about ripping hair out of your skin?</li>
            <li>Also at the jaw line it takes more time with the Bellabe to get those hairs, I think it is the angle.     </li>
            <li>But it does get better.</li>
            <li>Make sure to disinfect before and after with Witch Hazel</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Also, you might love if you do not mind the idea of tapping hairs out of the spring after use---good luck with that.</li>
            <li>On the up side, my face feels really smooth (and warm from the hair</li>
            <li>I am sure the better</li>
            <li>My makeup applies easier and my face looks much better.</li>
            <li>I have been tweezing for 40 years, and I can&#x27;t even feel that any more.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I would spend many hours a week tweezing.</li>
            <li>Love the cylindrical cover it comes with too :)</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it accomplishes so much more in the time it would take to go at it with tweezers or waxing.</li>
            <li>This is even better than tweezing because the spring catches hairs I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>The results are long-lasting and I&#x27;m confident I don&#x27;t have hair anyplace on my face where I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li>I love this tool and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It smells of cheap metal, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s some kind of nickel-alloy metal</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than waxing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than waxing, it gets everything.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews saying that once you get used to it, it will be okay.</li>
            <li>I never thought this product would work, but I saw so many favorable reviews, I could not resist.</li>
            <li>Better than a razor.</li>
            <li>I hope they come up with something that can be used on eyebrows :)</li>
            <li>I used it on my upper lip and it worked great!  </li>
            <li>but it gets easier the more you use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it is honestly better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>and I love that I can do it as often as needed, no calling for appointments, etc.  </li>
            <li>You can do it while you are watching your favorite movie.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than tweezers or wax in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>so laser removal is not an option and waxing caused many bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li>Ariane Bashimbe   love this item</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE my Bellabe.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take more than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>It only took a couple of minutes to get the hang of using it, and the results were awesome.  </li>
            <li>but...it does cost more.</li>
            <li>yeah sure it works  ,</li>
            <li>Then, you are able to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this product, I was able to do all of the hair within minutes without any issues or even the thought of taking a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was eager to give this a try in hopes of being able to retire my tweezers and magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing does, and it gets the job done a lot faster.</li>
            <li>I wonder if a tighter spring would do the job better.</li>
            <li>But no ingrown hairs :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had much better results with Epicare.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have tweezed plenty of times, but this hurt more then tweezing.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing.</li>
            <li>so much better than tweezing...</li>
            <li>I just need more practice.</li>
            <li>and also it could not make sure will those hair come out again</li>
            <li>Tweezers is a better bet or an eppy.  </li>
            <li>I have used my Bellabe for more than a year</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than a year</li>
            <li>It just hurts… more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>It works better than anything I have ever used which includes depilatories, friction, trimming, etc.  </li>
            <li>I wish others better success!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>perhaps if you have thicker hair it would work better?</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just order 2 more for friends.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>and it gets out most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Sure beats going to a salon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than waxing.  </li>
            <li>It took me about 3 sessions to get all the hair off my face, and there was much more than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it could be any better than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had one before and glad I found them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product works OK.</li>
            <li>Smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>You will feel the hair being removed, the directions say a tingle, I say more than a tingle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truthfully, watching a YouTube on how to use the Bellabe is the most helpful.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure people want to know about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Not all, but most.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does hurt but any hair remover that you can expect to work is going to :)</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on this product and viewing a demonstration on Youtube, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I think this is more a comfort tool.</li>
            <li>okay but no miracle.</li>
            <li>You just twist it and watch it remove many hairs in one swipe.  </li>
            <li>I bet the 100 or more dollar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>is the most tender.</li>
            <li>TYVM Amazon, for having this product for sale! :)</li>
            <li>THE TWEEZERS WORK BETTER</li>
            <li>you basically figure out how to use it around the top of the eyebrows, chin, neck etc.</li>
            <li>Yes it nips when removing hair over top lip....</li>
            <li>the more I used it.</li>
            <li>If you want to remove hair off your face stick with threading its way faster and removes alot more</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you learn how to thread your own hair, its cheaper, plenty of online tutorials are available.</li>
            <li>truly love this hair remover.</li>
            <li>love that I can use this to remove hair while I watch tv, ride in the car, etc.</li>
            <li>It worked well, however, I did find going over the areas three times and I kept finding more hairs to pull.</li>
            <li>I get a more matte finish with my makeup by removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know they would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona</li>
            <li>Love the products.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I think this is 100x better then messing with creams or razors.  </li>
            <li>Way better than wax.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I knew it would hurt....</li>
            <li>but like many people I&#x27;m sure don&#x27;t like any product to make them breakout</li>
            <li>But, as others have stated, thicker more stubborn hairs are reluctant to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tweezers work better.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>I used to bleach before I got this, and I can say for sure that I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will stick to tweezing until i find something better.</li>
            <li>I know that most women have peach fuzz, but I looked like a wookie.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic hair remover alternative!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>not having to duck my head and hide embarrassing hairs makes me a more confident person.</li>
            <li>But this works better.</li>
            <li>Cheaper and more efficient.</li>
            <li>I love the finished product -- way better than wax.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this through snagshout to test and review.</li>
            <li>I like it better than threading.</li>
            <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing and the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>But it does get rid of most of it so the hair isn&#x27;t visible.</li>
            <li>It does the job ok.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Love love love this gadget.</li>
            <li>I used NADS for my lip and my eyebrows for many years.  </li>
            <li>- it really works great.</li>
            <li>I like this much better than waxing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a drinker, I recommend doing a shot and putting on some of your most inspiring tunes while you go at it.</li>
            <li>Glad I got this product</li>
            <li>but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This mostly trims face fuzzies it doesn&#x27;t remove them.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I was able to sit and watch TV while using.</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>you will love it too.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with my Bellabe Facial Hair remover!</li>
            <li>This thingymajiggy is the best invention for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to try it one more time.  </li>
            <li>So glad I got this thing.</li>
            <li>I just received this tool and I&#x27;m pleased at how it works.</li>
            <li>Its been two more days</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for a lil more.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things.</li>
            <li>On a whim I decided to try this, and finally am pleased with a hair removal method.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that there are a variety of colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>If I lose this one, I&#x27;ll pay more for the REM.</li>
            <li>because I want it to work:)</li>
            <li>Granted, most hair-removal does hurt, so take that with a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than using tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It helps to puff up your face anywhere you can to make it more taut; the spring grabs the hair better that way.</li>
            <li>I bought this as an alternative to waxing and it works OK.  </li>
            <li>Love Love my bellabe</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work compared to waxing or plucking.</li>
            <li>and you get more hair each roll than just one by tweezer.</li>
            <li>Much better than tweezing.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and it works!</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It takes minutes, literally, and it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than the Bellabe.  </li>
            <li>I am hooked for life.  :-)</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange of my unbiased and honest review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>there is more that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>My wife is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the more course hair, but it could be me still getting accustomed to using it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Ok, it hurts...</li>
            <li>I love this roller, it captures all of the hair in</li>
            <li>I guess my one reason for not giving it 5 stars is more an issue with how I thought it would come.</li>
            <li>This product is a great way to speed that up, and you don&#x27;t even really need to park yourself in front of a magnifying mirror forever.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with this</li>
            <li>I would have time to look semi ok again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every now and then I need to use my tweezers to remove a couple of hairs that I wasn&#x27;t able to getwith the Bellabe.</li>
            <li>but now I love having it.</li>
            <li>Some areas hurt more than others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure laser hair removal or maybe something like</li>
            <li>the no no may do a better job.</li>
            <li>stumbled across this product when I was looking into more permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li>Do not get this  unless you love pain.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe that more people don&#x27;t use this tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a magic tweezer/epilator.</li>
            <li>Hopefully with more practice I can get the more stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>Best facial hair product remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done waxing/threading for years now and couldn&#x27;t even use this for more than a couple &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; before my eyes started watering</li>
            <li>Mostly seems to grab the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Not too sure yet about the product yet.</li>
            <li>which is where I am most prone to get them).</li>
            <li>But, for the most part, it works much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they were always there</li>
            <li>nothing more</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this instead of NoNo</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and watch the remover leave your face hairless and smooth!</li>
            <li>That way the hairs will grow out and better hair removal will be achieved.</li>
            <li>This also helps the hairs come out even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Bellabe for many years now.</li>
            <li>Ok, it is not my favorite tool for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to figure that one out.  </li>
            <li>But I find I still pull out my tweezers most often.  </li>
            <li>The best way to get rid of unwanted facial hair at a fraction...price.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one satisfied customer</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and tried this.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>And like others say the more you use it the more you do get used to it.  </li>
            <li>It better just to wax.</li>
            <li>I got my product for free by giving an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>I have so much more confidence now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never had such an awesome experience when dealing with customer service in my life.</li>
            <li>just can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this company.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much better than getting your face waxed and dealing with breakouts...not to mention the expense.</li>
            <li>it does an ok job.</li>
            <li>I love this spring thing.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted something that removed more than just upper-lip hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I paid what I did</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a smooth and silky face for the rest of your life!</li>
            <li>If you have light-colored facial hair, you can&#x27;t use a laser, so this is a perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Works better than I had hoped .</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>muaahahahaahaha :-)</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li>In fact, shaving gives me more skin irritation than this</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably have to shave most of it and remove the rest in patches</li>
            <li>It takes longer and more hairs come out at one time.</li>
            <li>What a FABULOUS tool!</li>
            <li>I cannot begin to say how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for chin, upper lip and face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than stringing but just keep in mind, it requires both hands.</li>
            <li>Would be better to get a wider one to get more area</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your face before and after use this thing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li>So smooth!  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; was caused by taking a blood pressure medicine which made the hair more prevalent.  </li>
            <li>must have for every women, love this product</li>
            <li>but I am glad I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the best as a control-hair removal product.  </li>
            <li>; I now wonder how many of those were working for Bellabe.</li>
            <li>I think the epilator hurts more on my legs than this product does on my face.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it and was amazed at how it worked.</li>
            <li>and I have been dealing with it in many ways</li>
            <li>Where hair is longer, jaw or cheeks, it seems to do OK.</li>
            <li>I found the cleaner you keep it, the better it works.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase 2 more</li>
            <li>the more you use it.  </li>
            <li>I practiced many times, since I know you need to &amp;</li>
            <li>Much better than waxing, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>and i love it already.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Like many others have posted,this thingie works and I WISH I HAD purchased  it a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>whatever reasons,post menopause maybe,my skin texture became coarse looking and a fine growth of hair /peach fuzz appeared seemingly in every enlarged pore--an omg moment !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Loved this right away.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it is very easy to use and it removes hair quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>For me, this is the best solution I have found to my facial hair, it does a much better job that the electric epilador, gets all the fine hair and that one stray hair.  </li>
            <li>I must say that I am super pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>This product was pretty good on my suborn hairs.</li>
            <li>And, it did not feel good at first.</li>
            <li>Now I feel more confident I can enjoy life more than before.</li>
            <li>I am SO EXCITED about this product!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the results!!</li>
            <li>The bellabe is really good at getting those fine tine hairs you can&#x27;t see and plucks them right out, root and all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take me more than two attempts to master the technique - it is easy to do.</li>
            <li>Removing the hairs means I can get that clingy waterproof sunscreen off more easily.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use and gets most of the hairs.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, travels well as it fits into most makeup bags and almost painless.</li>
            <li>This works okay, but it sure isn&#x27;t a comfortable procedure.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it very much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a okay product if you are removing fine hair.</li>
            <li>I do have to use this product a once every week or week and a half vs. every three weeks at the salon, but the convenience of doing this when I want is priceless, plus the money I&#x27;m saving makes me feel a lot better. :-)</li>
            <li>but clean well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this super affordable device works!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is easy to use, and easy to take with me on trips.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to store away or carry with me, and my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of twisting the right way on the ends of the device, it removes the hair and leaves your face feeling smooth!!  </li>
            <li>At my age i have a lot of facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; and for that the Bellable does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s important to know that some areas of the face are just much more</li>
            <li>I look cleaner, neater and more smooth.</li>
            <li>I love how it removed all of my peach fuzz and let my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have PCOS, are prone to cysts, or have sensitive skin, I greatly caution you against using this product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s kind of fun, but that could be just me.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S GOOD AND DOES TAKE ALL HAIR AWAY FROM THE ROOT, BUT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME.</li>
            <li>It works really well, surprisingly.  </li>
            <li>took a chance on this (I&#x27;m willing to spend about $20 to try stuff out) and it worked great, right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Certainly faster than shaving or plucking and more cost effective than waxing.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t hurt, it actually felt good!</li>
            <li>Quick, easy!</li>
            <li>I have tried every other way to remove the hair from my face and this works the best of them all!!!  </li>
            <li>I think I was mostly upset because I was so excited to try the Bellabe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bellabe is sturdy and easily controlled.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It is very quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to just roll and use while watching TV.  </li>
            <li>not so easy to use...and</li>
            <li>its so easy to use</li>
            <li>After a while, it is easy to use and the pain subsides.</li>

            <li>This is so easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to do while watching tv or waiting for the coffee to brew.</li>
            <li>Easy.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s  easy to carry if you need to travel.</li>
            <li>Really, it does work marvelously, but if you have obnoxiously sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how this tool works &amp; how easy to use....</li>

            <li>It can be addicting to use, I can easily spend 30 minutes in front of the mirror removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my Bellabe for close to two months and most days I feel it leaves my face smooth and hair free,  </li>
            <li>It does a really great job and the effects last quite awhile, it&#x27;s definitely better than plucking with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>easy to use works well</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>It is easy to use, although there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li>This product works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I found this easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li>Once you use it, you&#x27;ll see how easy it is to maneuver for faster threading.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, affordable and you can do it in the privacy of your home.</li>
            <li>easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and compact.</li>
            <li>The Bellabe, according to the reviews, looked like it might be the answer to my problems with an easy, at-home care system, but it was not.</li>
            <li>Bellabe is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure that your skin is clean and moisturized</li>
            <li>Using the Bellabe though really is easy</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>it looked easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just keep looking for a removal cream that works &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave burns on my face (that&#x27;s not too easy to do though).</li>

            <li>I just had to do this one because I was so amazed at how well it works and how easy it is.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>WOW, this works GREAT and FAST!!!</li>
            <li>Once I turned the handles the RIGHT way :), it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and this one is by far the most effective yet.</li>
            <li>It does a good job along side of face (like in the picture) or above the lip, but where I need it the most, along curve of chin where hair is more bristly, it won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li>This product is super easy to use and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, and so quick, I can even use it while I&#x27;m doing something else -- saving me even more time.  </li>
            <li>The results are well worth the very quick pain you feel, believe me!</li>
            <li>It works perfect to remove the fine down hairs as well as the ones I can see.</li>
            <li>: It says the Bellabe is good for a year or so, and that after that you should get a new one.</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m expecting this item to pull too fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>but once u get used to the pain, u are fine...</li>
            <li>The fine vellous hair on my face had to go.</li>
            <li>Did under my brows which have permanent makeup, but I like that it removed the fine peach fuzz hair that shows up in my pearly eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This product will easily work for people like me (light peach fuzz) to people who are on the darker end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>Remember to TWIST the remover after bending it and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I just have that baby fine</li>
            <li>so I apply an ice pack afterwards and its fine after a minute or two</li>
            <li>really fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe is that it removed all of the hair including the baby fine ones which my epilator never removed or couldn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine tool.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>That night, I continued with the chin and some fine downey hair on the lower jaw area.  </li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It does take out the fine hair.</li>
            <li>It appears to grip even fine hairs on the skin and extracts them without pain.</li>
            <li>Some hairs wouldn&#x27;t pull out at all, maybe it has something to do with how fine my hair is.</li>
            <li>It did hurt more the first time I used it, but the pain is getting more tolerable.</li>
            <li>this does not remove fine fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>Useful and pretty good results</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone with fine hairs like mine.</li>
            <li>This did not have the ability to grasp fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and discreetly too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;so would rather use a shaver which does a better job and is quick</li>
            <li>However, it is a quick &#x27;Ouch&#x27;!</li>
            <li>I love this quick touch up hair removing product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick!</li>
            <li>but it is super!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much you can see the hair but more like a shadow the very fine hair creates.  </li>
            <li>and it was good for the first couple of tweezings, but honestly, I think using a tweezer is more effective and less time consuming.</li>
            <li>Whole face- smooth!!</li>
            <li>It more than paid for itself on the very first use.</li>
            <li>My wife said the product works good and it arrived a day early!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, fast, effective, saves me time and money not having to get waxed.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best for all the fine little hairs.  </li>
            <li>Now I can see my smooth skin instead of those fine, baby hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything was fine and my skin felt smooth.</li>
            <li>It takes some doing to get the hang of it, but it does exactly what it claims and very easily.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This little doo dad is awesome.</li>
            <li>This little tool is awesome!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome I can feel and see it pulling my little peach fuzz out not one by one either like twizzers</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of this little device, it does the job wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I love this product-very easy to use and not very painful.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge money saver.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t accurately get the eyebrow hairs with this tool.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great solution for hair removal and a big time saver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it does work.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face feeling as smooth as silk (almost).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, too.</li>
            <li>Its cheap too...</li>
            <li>It does leave your face baby&#x27;s butt smooth, and  sometimes I still have to pluck one of the coarser hairs.  </li>
            <li>Something monotone like a movie will calm you better than a show with commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>My face feels and looks smooth.</li>
            <li>It works great on my upper lip tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product overall.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me I found the Bellabe and tried it.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results and now only spend 20 mins a week removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>The results are a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the money and safe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean</li>
            <li>A great way to get rid of hair above the lip and on the chin.</li>
            <li>It seems sturdy and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is</li>
            <li>They work very well nice item.</li>
            <li>your face is so smooth I broke out in tears</li>
            <li>and i get a lot of light hair on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I am incredibly happy I went with this rather than a cream, will definitely be recommending this product!</li>
            <li>What a difference and so much cheaper and effective than waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I removed the lip hair (which wasn&#x27;t comfortable, but I hiked up my big-girl pants and just DID IT.</li>
            <li>This bellabe Facial Hair Remover works great.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no way a spring is worth more.</li>
            <li>This cheap product basically rips the hair out of your face.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it does do a really great job of removing any unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li>I got it today, and now my face is almost completely smooth.</li>
            <li>If you want to feel really smooth (I smoothed on face cream after I was finished</li>
            <li>and I now can&#x27;t believe just how smooth my skin feels)</li>
            <li>Bellabe is lighter in weight,  too light for my preference.  </li>
            <li>I primarily got this to take care of my sideburns since they seem to be getting a bit out of control.</li>
            <li>What I wanted to remove was from my jawline and on my cheeks--fine light hair.</li>
            <li>So, for me.. works great all over the face.. the upper lip?</li>
            <li>The videos I&#x27;ve watched on YouTube say your face can be smooth in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Great product, actually works and unlike others, it did not hurt.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m still learning how to use properly, but I&#x27;ve experienced some prickly stubble.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m a fan and happy with this decidedly unsexy but necessary purchase.</li>
            <li>Great for upper lip hair removal</li>
            <li>This item is great because it pulls the multiple hairs out at the root like waxing and unlike a razor</li>
            <li>this is so simple and works sooo great.  </li>
            <li>and my face is smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>No redness but don&#x27;t expect it to be pain free</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and it ssems my hair growth has slowed.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and no irritation at all from using.  </li>
            <li>I have used it primarily on my chin.  </li>
            <li>However, sometimes they&#x27;ll come in darker than I&#x27;m comfortable with</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it?  </li>
            <li>It is painless, fast and effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a tube with detailed use and care instructions</li>
            <li>Also, it delivers - the hair is gone, and the skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>The Bellabe is easy to clean and makes no messes.</li>
            <li>works great on upper lip, chin, cheeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and makeup is easier to apply.</li>
            <li>only takes one time to see how great of a product this is.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing hair, especially on the sides of the lip.  </li>
            <li>recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li>This is so much quicker than having to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li>I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend watching tv while I was using it and was completely comfortable.</li>
            <li>because THAT is precisely what this product is, a cheap coiled spring.</li>
            <li>I would beware of the cheap china knock-offs.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on removing the smallest of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>importantly, it beats the pants off waxing/shaving/bleaching or anything else.</li>
            <li>The Bellabe facial hair threader works great (fast, easy-to-use, effective, inexpensive, virtually painless for me).  </li>
            <li>My skin stays smooth.  </li>
            <li>I will keep trying and update my review as I see fit.</li>
            <li>I am now free to use any makeup I please.</li>
            <li>Liked much by my wife.</li>
            <li>It kept my face smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li>and I refuse to use waxing creams because those burn and damage skin over time, and being as fair and sensitive as I was</li>
            <li>is low but waxing is the best option as it is fast and removes hair in one go.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellable Facial Hair Remover for and awesome product.  </li>
            <li>While the hair removal is effective, the ensuing female circumcision was almost as effective.  </li>
            <li>Which is kind of frustrating because I would except excellent quality when spending $15 on a spring....</li>
            <li>I laughed out loud how I was so duped to buy this thing -</li>
            <li>I have had no problem with irritation (redhead, sensitive skin) and it is so nice to be able to use it whenever I want.....</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellabe for making such a great product!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for such an awesome product!</li>
            <li>For people who don&#x27;t get along with the instruction sheet well and don&#x27;t have a very good right and left hand co-ordination, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and very fast and even better</li>
            <li>Thinner hairs are a bit more tricky, but once you get them at the right angle, it gets those too.</li>
            <li>have fair, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would cause swelling or severe redness, but was excited when neither happened.</li>
            <li>but once you do, this is a simple and very effective device.</li>
            <li>This is not something that is very exciting to me.</li>
            <li>This will be very useful</li>
            <li>A very handy DIY and a reliable solution to facial hair removal!</li>
            <li>-15-12&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few months now and the results are fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a few more to always have!!!</li>
            <li>It works fine, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>While it does not do well on  course hair, it removes all of the finer hairs on my face for a smooth clean look.  </li>
            <li>When you are finished, just spritz the Bellabe with alcohol to keep it clean and oil free and store in the given container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and</li>
            <li>I was looking for something quick and easy I could use at home.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, and you can feel it working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, quick, easy to use, removes hair from root</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Using the Bellabe is super easy once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>It is safe, fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to look in the mirror to use it; I keep handy and use it frequently.</li>
            <li>This is a unique hair removing system for the face.  </li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased, the hair was pulled from the roots and has not returned.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying so many different items and products to rid myself of that pesky facial hair, I am finally happy with something!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li>I could get both the super fine and the courser hairs.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sure how to use it or getting the best results, there are videos online you can watch.</li>
            <li>super fine-</li>
            <li>This thing didn&#x27;t catch ONE hair, and I am pretty sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>i like parrissa hot wax way better.</li>
            <li>But it does work, but it takes practice and is not all that user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I rated these higher because for the most part you don&#x27;t need to go around mustachioed.</li>
            <li>I even think this thing is fun!</li>
            <li>Yes it hurts but it is sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get my Bellabe.  </li>
            <li>In my 10+ years of purchasing on Amazon, I have never found a product I was so excited about that made me want to write a review the day I received it.</li>
            <li>Still worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>But I did it all, and the next day, I was pleased because my skin felt smoother and my makeup went on better and looked better.</li>
            <li>This is a really unique item.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll get use to it over the period.  </li>
            <li>I got this in the mail today and of course I was excited to see if it worked but not looking forward to the pain.  </li>
            <li>But I was so excited that something was happening</li>
            <li>But the discomfort is minor and the results great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off I am an African American woman aged 26, I was 25 when I bought this product, I am a healthy and beautiful woman with great skin (no acne or anything!)</li>
            <li>I will warn you, it hurts like hell at first, but the more often you use it,</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best facial hair removals so far!</li>
            <li>Pretty painless and safe.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it more than the first time.</li>
            <li>, I have found that the discomfort is WELL WORTH IT in the end!</li>
            <li>With pretty plastic handles on the end :)</li>
            <li>not as user friendly as I had hoped</li>
            <li>Love it, really works!</li>
            <li>Mostly good for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>so when I was offered this little device I was more than happy to try it</li>
            <li>I was able to remove a lot of fine facial hair on my face very easily.  </li>
            <li>Having this little gadget is great because it&#x27;s easy to travel with and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The face hair remover is so great for women, even my little sister loves to show her clean lovable face.</li>
            <li>I clean mine before I use it and use a toning acne product on my skin after.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kept clean between uses</li>
            <li>No matter how clean I keep my Bellabe, no matter how clean I keep my face, and</li>
            <li>I have tried all the tricks of the hair removal trade and must say this is by far the best facial hair remover ever.</li>
            <li>And then I was only able to use it effectively 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li>The spring eventually does stop grabbing hair as effectively, but you get enough usage out of it to more than cover the cost.</li>
            <li>Realistically, I am thrilled to have the perfect answer to an ongoing, and highly irritating, problem!</li>
            <li>, also, it speaks the truth when it tells you to clean your face thoroughly before and after you use it, because you WILL break out if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Have had it for a year and clean it with a spray of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Now I can remove facial hair safely in the comfort of my own home without having to pay for threading again .</li>
            <li>I did notice I break out if I don&#x27;t clean my face after.</li>
            <li>skin has to be clean of any oils or the coil won&#x27;t catch the hair.  </li>
            <li>Read the instructions and tips, they tell you the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s and how to clean it.</li>
            <li>My tips are:  Get a clean, unused toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>With the remaining hand, take the clean toothbrush and brush the spring out on all sides.  </li>
            <li>I was curious to know what it was since most of the reviews were good</li>
            <li>It was also suggested that I clean the Bellabe each time with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>fabulous, quick and clean alternative to wax.</li>
            <li>But it does the job for a clean finish.  </li>
            <li>I used to use creams and bleaches, but after a while, my skin got more and more sensitive to using them</li>
            <li>Just be sure your head hair is completely out of the way :)</li>
            <li>It does hurt more so the first time because more hair is being removed at once, but, it is very time saving.  </li>
            <li>the skin around eyes are more sensitive, so it would be better to stick to a nice old pair of tweezers and tackle on hair at a time.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very smooth and is so much faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these exact products elsewhere, and as much as I dislike the epilator (because it hurts), I love it!  </li>
            <li>It really works well on the chin and on side of your face (without pain) and can very quickly leave you smooth hair free.  </li>
            <li>yank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find that holding it at certain angles pulls the hair better.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it most certainly does.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this little gizmo is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>what once worked wonderfully now it&#x27;s hard to get it to work at all</li>
            <li>and I was super excited it didn&#x27;t hurt,</li>
            <li>Once you get the motion down, it is very handy and relatively easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I actually had tears coming from my eyes, but I persisted because I knew if I could get through it, the results would be good and each time it would get easier.</li>
            <li>, it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out, but this tool is more gentle than I</li>
            <li>It works OK, but sometimes leaves hairs under the chin that I can&#x27;t see very well.</li>
            <li>All of that has been true for me.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li>This quite surprised me honestly.</li>
            <li>not really painful</li>
            <li>Way more than I even realized were there, really.</li>
            <li>But this is not painful.</li>
            <li>Good for removal of peach fuzz not slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll have to go over the area many times, doesn&#x27;t really grasp.</li>
            <li>it felt good to have that abhored facial hair pulled up by this spring!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like I was ripping out a full on mustache.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth it for a hair - free face.  </li>
            <li>It still hurts more than waxing but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>SOOOO much faster than plucking and way better than waxing, IMO.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that all, the pain that went along with it was almost too much to handle.</li>
            <li>so I thought this will be good at work and while in front of the TV, but there just does not seem to be the leverage to actually pull what it might grab.  </li>
            <li>Bellabe sounded like a dream come true, and, feeling optimistic, I ordered the two-pack.</li>
            <li>I love to tell my friends about Bellabe and highly recommend it to them!</li>
            <li>Product works effectively thus far.  </li>
            <li>The best facial hair remover ever, the hair does not grow back as quick as waxing,and does a fine job on that &amp;#34;peach</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not painful to use&lt;</li>
            <li>The whole time I use it, I think &amp;#34;Beauty is pain, beauty is pain!&amp;#34; but I wish it worked better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got thick rogue hairs to contend with, then tweezers will still be your best bet.  </li>
            <li>Age and hormones gifted me (thank you so much) with never-before peach fuzz on both cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work on more course chin hair.</li>
            <li>and they work a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>My mom purchased this product shortly after me and she has also loved the results.</li>
            <li>If you are good at following instructions, then you can challenge yourself.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that it does a good job on some places, for example the upper lip, &amp;</li>
            <li>a back up pair of tweezers is a good idea for me.</li>
            <li>or if it came with numbing solution (not a bad idea).</li>
            <li>Not bad though</li>
            <li>But after you get use to it it is not bad.  </li>
            <li>But not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did have a lil redness but not bad.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>This took some time to get used to - first making sure it goes in the right direction and also bending it just so.  </li>
            <li>Bellabe is simple, easy and effective.</li>
            <li>It did everything I hoped it would and more, and there are no negative effects on your face (lightening, scarring, pulling, etc.)!</li>
            <li>I love that I use Bellabe as part of my makeup routine in the morning, and my skin is very soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing makeup, as it seemed to just emphasize the hair, and never seemed to look right.  </li>
            <li>My best recommendation is to do a little bit at a time--don&#x27;t try and do a large area at one time.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;d recommend it, but I think I&#x27;ll try the easy treading tool Amazon sells and see how that works at consistently pulling hairs out by the roots...</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, but isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks - either that or</li>
            <li>not that easy to use at first either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this thing and feel all excited that my face is so smooth and pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this little gadget!</li>
            <li>The remover is easy to use with just a bit of practice, and possibly does a much better job on hair that is a bit longer or perhaps not so fine.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this very inexpensive little &amp;#34;beauty tool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But once your eyes stop tearing and your breathing returns to a normal pace, you realize this is actually very fast an effective tool.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon, seriously.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, and it does miss a few of the finer ones but it gets a majority of the more visible kind.</li>
            <li>The best part of all -- I was done in less than 15 minutes and my face and neck feels totally smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and it does the job quickly and practically painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Tweezing, but, quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the quick ripping of the hair out that causes some trauma to the skin?</li>
            <li>If you are looking for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>Just be patient.for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>but I quickly realized that it is not something that I plan on buying again.  </li>
            <li>You can actually see the hairs being pulled and leaving the skin smooth and there was no irritation on my skin and no breakouts which I really liked.</li>
            <li>you know, like you rip off a band-aid quick just to have it over with).</li>
            <li>When using this tool I wash with warm water before and after, then use a light non pore clogging oil such as the ones mentioned.</li>
            <li>will make a quick comment on the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Ok, so I will admit to having a low pain threshold to start, but after reading so many reviews I decided to give it a try as I am now discovering unwanted hairs since I&#x27;ve hit 40.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very simple device, but sometimes simple is best.</li>
            <li>A quick way to remove hair.</li>
            <li>Just do it quick.</li>
            <li>Waxing hurts but it is over quickly.</li>
            <li>but I watched a quick YouTube tutorial and had no problem.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I find tweezers to be a lot more of a tear jerker than this particular system.  </li>
            <li>favorite thing about this particular device is the options you have.  </li>
            <li>but it gets 90% of them and quickly.  </li>
            <li>They quickly replied and suggested I use witch hazel before and after using Bellabe.</li>
            <li>So the quick rundown is:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I can really quickly touch up at home whenever I want.</li>
            <li>It remove chin hair quickly.</li>
            <li>I just got the Bellabe in the mail today and was so excited I ran to use it right away.  </li>
            <li>I just used it today for the first time, and after a quick use I can feel how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>As another woman with facial hair issues, I have searched for many years for something that is effective, painless, fast, and produces long-lasting results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very much like having threading done by a pro!</li>
            <li>Overall though, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I got results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and only wish I knew about it years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure but I had a rash for a long time until I stopped using this for good.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing in the long run.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t clean it with alcohol, I did that with my old one at one point</li>
            <li>I think if you have PCOS, this product would be great combined with Vaniqua (a Rx cream that slows down hair growth) and balancing out your hormones with weight loss and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, i can live with the pain.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and it really removs the hair</li>
            <li>worked fast takes a min to get the hang of it then its easy as pie.</li>
            <li>First of all, cleanse your fair, whenever you pull the facial hair out by its roots, you are prone to infection if your skin has makeup or any impurities on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take my word, it is completely worth the quick tugs and tingles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I loved it the first or second time</li>
            <li>The coil is very flexible and bends easily to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use - it really &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; and removes even the finest hairs.  </li>
            <li>It was fast and easy, and the included instructions were no problem to follow.</li>
            <li>The skin is very sensitive here and pulling many hairs can sting.  </li>
            <li>This works great except on coarse black hairs - did not remove but otherwise love it!</li>
            <li>So I decided to search here on Amazon for any other hair removal options and I found this amazing product!</li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s stellar!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like tweezing only getting many more hairs in one rolling pull.</li>
            <li>You kind of get used to it after a minute though - kind of like you get used to the pain of tweezing after the first few plucks</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>On first try it worked so WELL!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>try it - its better than paying $$ for frequent threading!</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit at first, but it&#x27;s a lot faster then tweezing!</li>
            <li>Oh yes, I had my share of a scabstache, you know when the hot wax is ripped off and takes some of the skin!  </li>
            <li>Its amazing how something so small can be so effective and useful.  </li>
            <li>I should have known that pulling the hair by the roots from the skin on my upper lip was not going to feel nice, to put it mildly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive, highly effective, and quick way to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>By removing my facial hair I can get the sunscreen off much more easily now.</li>
            <li>It removes unwanted facial hair quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I was able to remove all my unwanted hair in less than 10 minutes in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>This tiny little spring does the job wonderfully and was super cheap.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t really pull the hair from the root but cut it off.  </li>
            <li>Would be great if it was a little sturdier.</li>
            <li>Works great if u can tolerate a little pain.</li>
            <li>so this little tool is a godsend compared to anything else I used, works great on the chin, basically everywhere....</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>However, for me it only grabs the fine hairs and not the more course hairs.</li>
            <li>I believe it does a fine job on most facial hair on the chin,where I used it.</li>
            <li>I think perhaps most of my facial hair is too fine for the spring to grab it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine and blonde that it&#x27;s virtually invisible, but I can feel it when I touch my face, and if I can feel it, anyone else touching my face can, too.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and very effective in removing the facial hairs on the upper lip and chin area.  </li>
            <li>The product is super easy to use and it removed all the fine fuzzy hair on my upper lip and chin area quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I managed to get most the hair off my chin - takes all the little light ones and most of the thicker ones too.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I&#x27;m tweezing and it&#x27;s faster &amp; more effective than waxing because if it misses a few hairs I roll it over the area again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being in a calm state of mind before you start will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this product prior to buying it and found it to be amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing how different my makeup goes on without all of that fuzz.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool to remove facial hair!  </li>
            <li>Removing all that hair really helps my makeup go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I used Witch Hazel to calm the skin redness when I was finished.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal.</li>
            <li>It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal.</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy the Bellabe.</li>
            <li>Love it, has a tingle, but it made my skin so soft after one use.</li>
            <li>buy this bellebe product, it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, a washcloth or tissue wrapped around the handles provide enough protection that I&#x27;m able to use this as I wish.</li>
            <li>Still, the product is easy to use and does a decent job.</li>
            <li>but I used to just tweeze as that was the only free, and hassle free technique I knew until I came across this tool!  </li>
            <li>The best advice I have is to really play around with the Bellabe, using different techniques on different parts of the face.</li>
            <li>I will need to get used to it a bit better, couldn&#x27;t do my whole face in one sitting but expect it to go better in the next sitting.</li>
            <li>it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is a simple and effective way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s something I think is quite useful.</li>
            <li>This has just been so handy to have for removal of the stray facial  and neck hairs and peach fuzz ...</li>
            <li>soo worth it.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled that I found Bellabe and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise it for sideburns or more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday, and so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This is something that I cannot utilize on a frequent basis, its better for every once in awhile.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and effective.</li>
            <li>thought it&#x27;d be worth the pain</li>
            <li>My nieces and I tried this product I found it painless while they were more sensitive to it and had to force themselves to endure.</li>
            <li>looks far more smoother than when the hair was there.</li>
            <li>It hurts, it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was given enough this product to test and return an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>You just twist it as you move it back and forth over your face, and it&#x27;s extremely effective at removing the hair.</li>
            <li>The hairs hurt while they are being pulled out but the pain is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>my husband, who rarely notices any cosmetic improvement I&#x27;ve made, asked that evening &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, it is so worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I am usually a total klutz with tools of any kind.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, it was actually fun ...</li>
            <li>I know, how fun can it be to rip your unwanted hair out by the roots?</li>
            <li>Simple product and does the job quite effectively.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $14</li>
            <li>So worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>I still have not had a lot of success with it.</li>
            <li>but i guess its worth it.</li>
            <li>Truly worth $15.</li>
            <li>and it sure did make my eyes water using it in a sensitive area</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things, professional waxing, over the counter waxing, bleaching.</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>Back to the drawing board in search of something that really works for those of us that aren&#x27;t fair haired.  </li>
            <li>it makes the momentary torture worth while.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I rarely take time to write reviews</li>
            <li>Worth it if you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the area around my mouth is more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful but not quite as useful as I wish it were.</li>
            <li>My evaluation is that if you have waxed your lip/chin area before and survived, then this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s worth it to save money.</li>
            <li>That area is more sensitive for me.</li>
            <li>This tool is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>At $15.00 it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>but I decided the end result would be worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the price and not worrying about running out of a cream or wax remover.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Felt the price was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on removing all the hair (started using it yesterday), but I think it will be worth the pain and</li>
            <li>Simple to use and effective -</li>
            <li>For me, the fact that I can use this as needed and without doing damage to my skin, makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>I just received mine and went right to work with it on my little mustache, lol.</li>
            <li>I sort of panicked because I thought I had an allergic reaction but the 2 pimples appeared right under my nose area which is the most sensitive.</li>
            <li>It may be a different experience for someone who is more familiar using this method for hair removal.</li>
            <li>It is quick, and I control exactly where I want the hair to come off.  </li>
            <li>but your face will de-sensitize pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Its not big, which makes it easy to carry with you and its also easy to use.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for much regrowth to use it, and it is just as effective as waxing or threading but insanely less costly and more convenient than going for a professional service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it 1 day, but it certainly is quite easy to get the hang of, and works much better for me than waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li>right now I look as if I am a teenager with severe acne.</li>
            <li>just right in order to remove the hair from the roots.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>I saw a infomercial on TV while visiting my mom and immediately wished I had it right then and</li>
            <li>I broke out right after using it and that never happens with tweezing.</li>
            <li>NOT FOR EYEBROWS, says so right on the package</li>
            <li>Oh this strips off the hair all right.</li>
            <li>no one in their right mind would put themselves through it.</li>
            <li>This is one of those things that you will go to your mother/sister/friend and say: OMG you have to try this thing!&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve, but once you get the twist just right</li>
            <li>And I can go right out</li>
            <li>no gain right?</li>
            <li>Worked right out of package.  </li>
            <li>You just have to do it right or will break the hair without pulling from the root.</li>
            <li>I opened the package and used it right away</li>
            <li>After one use I was used to it right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>And the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li>It works but need to practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>so you know how to get the technique right.  </li>
            <li>right or else</li>
            <li>price was right</li>
            <li>I just received my Bellabe in the mail today and used in right away.  </li>
            <li>On any given day, I&#x27;m pretty much hair free.</li>
            <li>One just thinks of a pleasant subject and all the discomfort goes away.</li>
            <li>First as a teen, I noticed some hairs appearing when I didn&#x27;t want them to appear, might be nice for the boys but</li>
            <li>and I am more interested in thinning my mustache as opposed to completely removing it.</li>
            <li>Not painful at all (and obviously quite satisfying).</li>
            <li>It was really great with the small, fine hairs though, which is exactly what I was hoping for, since using the Epilady on my face was absolute torture.  </li>
            <li>:) Just a tiny sting, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>but I give full credit to the genius who invented this gadget for pure creativity and marketing.</li>
            <li>The acne has gone down a bit--but I now have marks and feel incredibly self conscious going anywhere considering my face</li>
            <li>Okay, Here is a MAJOR  warning for this product and products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is only good for the fine hairs above your lip.</li>
            <li>The only thing I found accurate in the manual, is that it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to point out that tweezing is probably one of the best solutions when it comes to facial hair because it gets the hairs at the root, meaning this wear and tear on the follicle will begin to damage it, and thus, result in less growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to point out that tweezing is probably one of the best solutions when it comes to facial hair because it gets the hairs at the root, meaning this wear and tear on the follicle will begin to damage it, and thus, result in less growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bellabe for a few months and have found it to be easy and effective for me.  </li>
            <li>It was fast and easy and did what it promised with no messy clean up.  </li>
            <li>I was able to clear most of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I still on occasion will get this out to use, but it is pretty rare.  </li>
            <li>and it was very hard to get rid of but now with bellabe hair removing is so much faster easier and best of all cleaner!</li>
            <li>Never worked on me, it exfoliated my skin and in certain spots on the face made it more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have some very fine hair on my jaw and above my lip area.  </li>
            <li>Essential and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>It works well enough on very fine hair</li>
            <li>Who would have thought this little tool would achieve such great results!</li>
            <li>I chose Bellabe even though there were fair cheaper options because honestly, when it comes to my face, I can spare the few extra dollars to get a product thats on the higher end of the spectrum and won&#x27;t take a month to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might love this product if: you&#x27;re good at patting your head with one hand, rubbing your belly in circular motions with the other hand, and jumping rope---all at the same time.</li>
            <li>this is really worth a try but the price is too much but is really worth it and help you remove all your hair from your face but don&#x27;t try your eyebrows&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my chin, cheeks and lip area, but was not precise enough for my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a great product, and I would purchase another one, if something happened to my current Bellabe.</li>
            <li>It not only cleans the spring, it works better when fresh.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have had no problems at all with my skin reacting (which it would surely do with a hot wax or a peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to go over my face several times today to get everything, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with every first time user.  </li>
            <li>It probably works great for younger people, but I will say that it did work well enough for me to have somewhat smoother skin</li>
            <li>Sometime I get my eye brows waxed, but my skin is sensitive and burns easily.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re in our 40&#x27;s, and this item seems desiged to help remove the inevitable peach fuzz and occasional wayward hair that can start to appear around this age, to the great dismay of the woman who experiences it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Bellabe grabbed all the hairs except for the very shortest, finest ones, which gives a much more natural appearance.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, hair removal is not comfortable, but the Bellabe is a wonderful, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I am sure this isn&#x27;t for everyone, but if you can muscle through the initial pain, the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Maybe if someone has long &amp; fine hair that might work I don&#x27;t know, but otherwise a tweezer is a whole lot better in every way.</li>
            <li>This device works very well for me and now that I&#x27;m used to it, the pain is not nearly as bad as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, and quickly.</li>
            <li>Tweezee is good but my upper lip area was way too sensitive for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied but after a few days, I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>The hairs are not small and light like they</li>
            <li>All the directions for use are on the label of the container (which was super clean and nicely packaged), and there&#x27;s also a small information sheet on cleaning the Bellabe.</li>
            <li>Using tweezers simply doesn&#x27;t do it for me anymore, too many stray hairs that I don&#x27;t always see right away.</li>
            <li>It takes no time at all, removes hair pretty much without exception, and it does not require a mirror or special glasses and light to see hair that my old eyes cannot focus on.  </li>
            <li>Thankyou so very much</li>
            <li>but I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, which is always a plus!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very  light colored hair above my lip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far more effective than waxing, and without the mess, discomfort, or skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>I just wipe with a little astringent after and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>Get good at the technique of twirling this little gem</li>
            <li>Seriously, it is now nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of other solutions, including Nair and waxing, to my embarrassing dark-ish upper lip hair and after only a couple of days of owning this I can say with confidence that this is the best method available, in terms of return value for its cost.</li>
            <li>It can cover a large area of longer hairs, pretty much as useful for hair removal as duct tape placed onto and ripped off of hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the chin and cheek areas but no matter how hard I try</li>
            <li>This little tool does a great job of getting all the light hairs around my chin and that upper lip area.</li>
            <li>I have a little more peach fuzz than most women and this thing really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, as it seemed so much more convenient and cheaper than buying those little waxing kits or going to have threading</li>
            <li>I recieved this at a free/discounted price for an honest revie, and i must say, i love it, of course its a little painful but works great :-)</li>
            <li>but it works really well!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this miracle wand!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hurts so at first</li>
            <li>I would recommend using something like the NoNo or waxing for the first time and then using this thing to keep any regrowth under control.</li>
            <li>Bellabe can cause a breakout, but it doesn&#x27;t if I use restraint, use it only where it&#x27;s most needed, 1 or 2 rolls over, and not get overeager and pull out every bit of hair I can find.</li>
            <li>FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ME, BUT</li>
            <li>Above my lip area bothers me the most.  </li>
            <li>The first time will hurt like no one&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>But I couldn&#x27;t stop using it because it really worked!  </li>
            <li>I love it and am on my 3rd one!</li>
            <li>That was funny.</li>
            <li>I love the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal.</li>
            <li>It stings a lot (no worse than waxing), but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit at first.</li>
            <li>I found Bellabe because I looked up hair threading and decided that for $15 I was willing to give it a go.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it hurt.</li>
            <li>The leaning curve on using this takes just a minute or two and the results are stellar.</li>
            <li>The thing that bugs me the most is that the hair starts growing back in before the pimples have even fully cleared!</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know/aren&#x27;t sure how to use it, google a video for proper use.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m willing to bet</li>
            <li>Pulls hairs out pretty well when used correctly..</li>
            <li>(Remember the first time you did your eyebrows?</li>
            <li>in mind that there is a bit of learning curve when you first use it.</li>
            <li>Go slowly at first.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it came exceptionally fast!</li>
            <li>Just wish it could do more for coarse hair!</li>
            <li>I love my Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li>Not painless but works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>It was time consuming the first time, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Does it work pretty well?</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it hurt a bit&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>but since I plan to use it more regularly now, it won&#x27;t be pulling out&lt;br</li>
            <li>Throw out that hot wax.</li>
            <li>I am working the courage to finish my upper lip - that hurts the most.  </li>
            <li>Hurts like the devil at first</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellabe!</li>
            <li>(Real or imagined!)</li>
            <li>but I use it after a hot shower, so it&#x27;s not as noticeable.....</li>
            <li>I intend to order several more and keep one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>Those are really coarse ones, but I am sure it will be no problem.</li>
            <li>It seemed to have worked the first time I used it but not thereafter.  </li>
            <li>My first tool of this type was the REM Spring which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>It does a much better job than the facial attachment of my electric epilator.  </li>
            <li>the fact that this will not harm any layers of skin like hot wax can do.</li>
            <li>The benefit with this, however, is that you can go over an area as many times as you want without pulling or tearing skin, which is a risk with waxing the same area of skin over and over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once every two weeks for myself personally.</li>
            <li>At first, Bellabe was not working because I was not doing it correctly.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, I use this on my upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>Gets those hairs and really works!</li>
            <li>I first went on Youtube to see some videos on how to use it and tried it myself.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get all of the tiny hairs but gets 100% of the most noticeable longer ones.</li>
            <li>Funny that the girl on youtube didn&#x27;t flinch one bit when using it.</li>
            <li>After 2 years, I&#x27;m glad to finally find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works pretty darn well</li>
            <li>but it works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>mine went into the trash can after the first week of trying to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty klutzy</li>
            <li>First hold the handles between your fingers and bend into a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty used the pain of hair plucking after years of doing it -</li>
            <li>The Bellabe really works!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>It works but really hurts!</li>
            <li>the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>have more facial hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the actual pain is from not being used to it.</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to use at all</li>
            <li>The famous 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my upper lip…</li>
            <li>I feel like I really just won the lottery here!</li>
            <li>I have suffered with excess facial hair and hair removal for too many years to count.</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li>It really WORKS!  </li>
            <li>It hurts so much!</li>
            <li>but it turned to be a risk that was very well worth it.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>My dog ate my first one.</li>
            <li>$15 for a spring with some plastic bits is a bit pricey, considering the materials, but laser treatment cost me a lot more and it didn&#x27;t deal with the blonde ones.</li>
            <li>well at first yes, but i got used to it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>I used this item mostly for my upper lip and chin...</li>
            <li>and at first I didn&#x27;t feel a thing</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>Yes it smarts at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does hurt at first too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t catch all of the finer hairs.</li>
            <li>The first time is definitely the toughest because so many hairs are removed at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the sugar waxers for my upper lip - have to be heated, applied to the correct thickness, sticky, time consuming and sometimes has to be repeated because there are too many strays.</li>
            <li>This product did not work for me, it put bumps on my skin, after the first try, so I discontinued using it.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>It does hurt more on the upper lip-so I do suggest trying the chin area first.</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first, then it stings a bit</li>
            <li>I have found that the darker hairs don&#x27;t always come out on the first pass, but eventually the device does grasp them and pull them out.  </li>
            <li>but it really works!</li>
            <li>It really stings !  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I took the precautions of washing and exfoliating first, as well as washing the instrument, it was a no-go.</li>
            <li>This works really well!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to scream, but it worked really well!</li>
            <li>trimmers just cut the hair leaving stubble, Bellabe removes from the root leaving your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>You just need to get used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of hair being pulled at first.</li>
            <li>I had zero problems with any bumps developing (which I would sometimes get from waxing) and no danger of someone applying wax that is too hot.  </li>
            <li>First I was just rolling it and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not pain-free, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>This thing really does pull the hair out by the roots!</li>
            <li>The place to put your fingers is in a vibrant color which mine was purple and super</li>
            <li>For my chin however, I began to grow ingrown hairs after the first use.</li>
            <li>Also, I am noticing now a lot of the hair was simply cropped, and it feels almost stubbly (even though I made sure to use as instructed).</li>
            <li>I saw the first hairs grow off of my chin as a teenager.</li>
            <li>Excellent alternative to paying for expensive waxing and salon treatments.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you need it to you in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>yes at first.  </li>
            <li>It really hurts!</li>
            <li>I said using this doesn&#x27;t hurt (at first)</li>
            <li>I will never again endure this thanks to Bellabe!  </li>
            <li>Also it takes a lot of repeated going of the same spot over and over MANY times to remove hair.</li>
            <li>I love the product and have used it several times since I received it and the pain has eased some</li>
            <li>product seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do if used correctly.</li>
            <li>This will slide across your skin if it&#x27;s damp, humid or hot.  </li>
            <li>This product works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>Something you must stay on top of and do regularly to achieve the goal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on hair that&#x27;s never been removed before but when it starts to grow back, there&#x27;s no grip until it gets long again.</li>
            <li>The Epilady facial depilitator is a better investment.  </li>
            <li>It does get the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>it took 2 seconds to learn how to use and it hurt at first</li>
            <li>I prefer a GOOD tweezers that will grasp these firmly and leave no root to grow again.</li>
            <li>And even better: you can get rid of that light coat of feather down on the rest of your grace , the stuff you see</li>
            <li>Effective for removing fine facial hair, the mustache and peach fuzz that we women - especially those of a certain age - experience.</li>
            <li>BUT this is def a good tool for a fast fix because it makes the hair appear less noticable even if its not pulled from the root-</li>
            <li>so I can go out and live my life, but this product is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>No worse than plucking, right?  </li>
            <li>I do not have much upper-lip hair to deal with, but enough that it bothered me when I could see it, so now I can just take care of it with the Bellabe, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>It a good idea but not easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have found the positive reviews to be consistent with what this product delivers.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of tools in the past... tweezing, waxing, threading, bleach, etc, and this so far by far has been the best.  </li>
            <li>Just clean your face then sit down in front of your tv and roll this puppy over your face and before your show ends, your face will be smooth and virtually hairless!</li>
            <li>I know there are other women like myself who don&#x27;t go to spas or spent much time in salons or reading beauty magazines to learn what tools and techniques are available, yet we also desire to look as attractive as we can.</li>
            <li>Everywhere I had used the Bellabe with success, I had clusters of cysts growing, particularly around my mouth (</li>
            <li>i use it for upper lip hair removal and it does such a good job.</li>
            <li>and it is so nice not to have those wild hairs and baby fuzz on my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Then I started going over the super fine blonde hairs on my jawline, which I&#x27;m pretty sure just about everyone has, and those never really bothered me before, but when I started to use the Bellabe there I couldn&#x27;t believe how friggin&#x27; hairy</li>
            <li>The Bellabe was slightly less in price but had a decent amount of good reviews, so I wanted to compare.  </li>
            <li>If you are okay with using an epilator, this product might work for you but unlike an epilator this is a slow hair removing device and so can cause more pain.</li>
            <li>It really did take me 3-5 tries for it to be really effective.  </li>
            <li>ITS BETTER TO USE ONLY TO TOUCH UPS AFTER YOU GET A REAL WAXING OR THEADING.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that you can do it any time without all the fuss and mess of other methods.</li>
            <li>Of course it stings a little since you&#x27;re removing hair from the roots, but the discomfort lessens significantly over time the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Is pretty decent!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use and will save me so much money in the long run not going to a salon to get the hair threaded.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Bellabe from Amazon.com, prime shipping (yay, I love that) because I am a \\&quot;woman of a certain age\\&quot; with UBER sensitive skin who has never fared well with professional waxing.  </li>
            <li>- if you can stand plucking you&#x27;ll be able to handle this (though some areas of my face are a little more sensitive than others).</li>
            <li>While it definitely saves time and is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t consistently pull the hairs out by the roots-</li>
            <li>It also had a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>all of them were positive.</li>
            <li>I had no faith that this would work but decided to try it anyway because of all the positive reviews I had read.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from fine light hairs on my upper lip and chin and was able to remove all of these with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy with just a tiny sting that I can live with.  </li>
            <li>that pretty much sums up my thoughts about this product.</li>
            <li>However, after doing it 2-3 times after that first experience, it really didn&#x27;t bother me any longer.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this thing it was absolute torture.</li>
            <li>but I thought that this is the first product that really gave me the results it promised</li>
            <li>I looked at this product many times, read reviews, and mulled it over for a long time.</li>
            <li>Having said that,  this device is pretty gentle.  </li>
            <li>but you should get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>This product works really well, and handles exactly what I wanted to handle.</li>
            <li>Now, I was expecting some pain associated with a product that rips the hair out by the root, so I promise I&#x27;m not a complete fool :)</li>
            <li>That said, 4 days is still pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It does really hurt when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li>Pinches a bit at first, but it really works.  </li>
            <li>This thing hurts worse than plucking, but it is fast, a million times more effective, and inexpensive</li>
            <li>I almost never write reviews, but after using my new Bellabe for the first time today, I have to rate it FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li>It is important to clean it after every use and not let the metal part get wet, I think mine may be tarnishing a bit.</li>
            <li>The older that I&#x27;ve gotten, the more facial hair I seem to be getting.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve grown older, my facial hair has become more of an issue.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had more problems with hair above my lip and under my chin, and it gets all that too.</li>
            <li>My upper lip area seems to be a more sensitive area, so I have to do shorter hair-removal sessions, more often, to achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li>It was very good at it&#x27;s job but after a while it started leaving a lot of small spots around my upper lip area.</li>
            <li>This little tool works just like tweezing, but you get to pull many hairs at once!</li>
            <li>Not super well - but amazingly well for what it does.  </li>
            <li>Its an easy way for remove facial hair.</li>
            <li>but once you know, it is so easy to remove the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>Worth trying as long as you do realize that it&#x27;s not 100% pain free.</li>
            <li>So beware, if you have super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super duper sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>I make sure my skin is dry</li>
            <li>I have coarse dark hair and have tried just about everything on the market (with the exception of laser) without results that I have ever been happy with.  </li>
            <li>Finally, an easy way to keep up with the hereditary facial hair</li>
            <li>Then I realized I need to twist easy side and all of the sudden I was on a roll, literally!  </li>
            <li>It was so easy to use and removes facial fuzz without a doubt.</li>
            <li>This does work I definitely recommend it for anyone I saw it had a five star and tried it its easy to use</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with my Bellabe facial hair threader which arrived only 2 days after ordering it!  </li>
            <li>The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fairly easy especially in areas with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works good, but not on long facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Does not quite hold strong enough for the thicker chin hairs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is very effective on &amp;#34;scattered&amp;#34; stray hairs and I wish it was because tweezing is not a good answer.  </li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li>It was a very fast and effective way to remove facial hair for the larger portions of my face.</li>
            <li>This is basically a large metal spring.</li>
            <li>It certainly beat the cost of the No No.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to learn how to position the wire to get to certain places.  </li>
            <li>but they certainly deserve an award.  </li>
            <li>If you like this product I recommend an emjoi epilator for large areas on your face and body.</li>
            <li>The spring has to be twirled a certain way (counter clockwise) to get it to pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li>It does smart when you apply it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still certain areas on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of using it, I can tell you that I love it!</li>
            <li>Rolling the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover across the chin, neck, and cheek area is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>So fast and easy with lasting results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and it really will remove all the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>Great idea and really gets down to the last follicle!</li>
            <li>Sure, it pulls a little, but it&#x27;s done so quickly that it&#x27;s really not bad...definitely better than plucking each hair separately.</li>
            <li>This little gadget comes in handy to get the tiniest hairs off  face that you didn&#x27;t even realize were there, also sometimes I can&#x27;t seem to get certain hairs with tweezers and this pulls those out</li>
            <li>You can feel the pull and sometimes like a pinch as it grips and grabs the fine hair around your facial area.</li>
            <li>and it felt like I was ripping the tiny fine hairs out by the roots.</li>
            <li>, she seems pretty satisfied with the results from this device, although she uses other stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not work on fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>It definitely pulls all of the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem getting the hang of it, and unlike a lot of reviewers, it seems to work well on fine and coarse hair for me.  </li>
            <li>I recently started getting hormone replacement therapy and found that it caused me to have fine blond hairs all over my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li>hairs seem to be removed root and all so any regrowth has lessened and the regrowing 1s remain a fine tiny hair</li>
            <li>Definitely a decent alternative to waxing and hair plucking!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize that I had many very light and thin hairs on my face.</li>
            <li>I am close to 50, blonde/gray, mild to moderate facial hair depending on which strength magnification you use, I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>This little gizmo from Bellabe is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing little tool, wish I had brought one sooner.....</li>
            <li>Instead of getting burned with wax, this is an amazing little thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>These are amazing little gizmos.</li>
            <li>This little tool is amazing...</li>
            <li>I do feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance though, so this wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of passes to get the technique down, but after that, the BellaBe was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I seem to have inherited the same fine facial characteristics, and I leave the epilator by modern &amp;#34;lazy boy&amp;#34; chair...with glass of wine readily available.  </li>
            <li>Works great, as long as you can handle a little pain ;)</li>
            <li>To the good, this is a very small tool, could be easily and discreetly carried,  is very simple to use and works!</li>
            <li>It does an amazing job on the larger jobs, but you&#x27;ll still need another product to get those precision jobs such as your eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I attended enough sessions of electrolysis that I don&#x27;t have much for hair around my mouth or lips.</li>
            <li>I hate using it lol, but it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I get really really red and huge bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li>The product is made very well.</li>
            <li>The price is absolutely reasonable in my opinion but</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it worked very well.</li>
            <li>so it is going to hurt about as much as tweezing would.</li>
            <li>This brand seems to work very well for me.</li>
            <li>so much I am going to order another one</li>
            <li>The cream also only keeps you feeling smooth for one day.  </li>
            <li>For those wanting additional information on the product, there are several \\&quot;great\\&quot; videos available on youtube.    </li>
            <li>this really does remove the hair.</li>
            <li>so either I&#x27;m really hairier than I thought</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I grew up with an Epilady (torture device), so I was really scared to use it.</li>
            <li>REALLY helps to do something distracting while using this tool.</li>
            <li>Preventing them is MUCH easier than trying to get rid of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bellabe is really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really even need to use this anymore.  </li>
            <li>I would have saved so much time on this process.</li>
            <li>but I can handle it and much faster then one at a time</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>It does pull a bit but who wants unneeded hair?</li>
            <li>I purchased an item for several hundred dollars which the name fit the product...</li>
            <li>It stung on my upper lip, but no where else My skin has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>Hurts so much but gets hairs off after going over it a couple times</li>
            <li>I found that by varying how I was twisting and rolling, how much bend in the spring</li>
            <li>Too much information</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I really do like it</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it in pink, and have been extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It removes the hair very well</li>
            <li>once you learn how to use it it really gets rid of a lot of hair...</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the sting you&#x27;ll realize that this product works very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and much easier.</li>
            <li>and it still works very well.</li>
            <li>This tool really does the job.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I  have never broken out from using one.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s ripping hair out), but it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;as much hairs.</li>
            <li>I did my whole face</li>
            <li>It hurts, but it is very effecient.</li>
            <li>It works very well for that.</li>
            <li>But this hair remover is awesome, It was pretty painful the first time I used it, It made my eyes well up with tears</li>
            <li>too much peach fuzz to deal with</li>
            <li>I simply cannot take using this as my primary hair removal product.</li>
            <li>I know this is not the case for everyone, as I read some reviews saying it really hurt.</li>
            <li>Even before I moved, sometimes it would be a hassle to get to the salon, and doing it at home would have been so much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already told friends and family because it&#x27;s inspired me that much.</li>
            <li>but if used every day it  really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>It is much like plucking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I think is also because you don&#x27;t get much time to prepare yourself for the hair that is going to be removed.</li>
            <li>The coiled device gently pulls the hair from your face.</li>
            <li>It is much easier that tweezing.</li>
            <li>i did my mustache and three days later its still smooth...</li>
            <li>After a week or two, it really does get easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No pain and really did pull from the root.</li>
            <li>but it takes much time to get all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see that area, but I suspected I needed this product for it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this tool.</li>
            <li>hurts a lot, &amp;doesn&#x27;t really work,</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I only have light peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even imagine on how much I&#x27;ve saved on waxing plus</li>
            <li>i did my whole face  </li>
            <li>It lasts much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li>Very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Plus many hair removal methods are impractical since I want to remove hair from a wide surface area (the sides of my face).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li>i just sit there rolling it all over my face and even my friends noticed how much cleaner it looked.</li>
            <li>My wife didn&#x27;t like it, it pinched too much as it pulls the hair from her chin.</li>
            <li>But remember - it is pulling the hair out, feels much like waxing.</li>
            <li>I used it everywhere on my face except my eyebrows and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It also REALLY hurts</li>
            <li>This helps me so much.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really uncoordinated.</li>
            <li>Thanks to menopause, I now have a bit of a moustache.  </li>
            <li>Much faster than plucking each hair one by one with a tweezer which was why I got it.</li>
            <li>Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well as described.</li>
            <li>but you have to try and really learn how to use it</li>
            <li>It absolutely works for me.</li>
            <li>No batteries to worry about, this is going to save you so much money from going to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li>It really does work.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>but this is much faster than Nads and no irritation as with the chemical hair removers.  </li>
            <li>So much faster than tweezing one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the results with this hair remover and after a couple times of using it I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Does not work very well.</li>
            <li>and this does absolutely nothing to remove them.</li>
            <li>Too much labor involved using the Bellabe.</li>
            <li>this is much faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li>It really does</li>
            <li>I feel like I really just won the lottery</li>
            <li>This product did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>More&#x27;s the pity.</li>
            <li>I am DONE with that now, thanks to the Bellabe.  </li>
            <li>and I find the pain too much to deal with.</li>
            <li>Product came fast in mail.  </li>
            <li>You get used to it fast.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of this, I really like it.</li>
            <li>but it is much faster than tweezing and a lot cheaper than laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This thing works really well.</li>
            <li>Order came fast.  </li>
            <li>but it might be too much for some people.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely an A+ device.</li>
            <li>, I hope that it will be much easier.  </li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I always think in the back of my head that they can see my light mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>After that, you know what to expect and there isn&#x27;t as much hair to be removed so</li>
            <li>worked better than expected</li>
            <li>As the hair grows back, it is thinner and light.</li>
            <li>and I have been facial hair free for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>Really gets rid of the hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather tweeze my whole face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want everyone to know that this product really works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure after reading the wide range of reviews.  </li>
            <li>But it gets the hair out and works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that customer service was an absolute pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li>It made things sooo much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;it really does hurt.  </li>
            <li>I have really course hairs on my chin and throat from PCOS.</li>
            <li>Hurts too much to use again.</li>
            <li>but none seem to work for me very well.</li>
            <li>Using this thing really &amp;#34;smarts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li>Every once in awhile I could feel it grab a hair and yank, but the results were very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>, it is fast and efficient and I no longer have that unsightly mustache.  </li>
            <li>it takes too much time to use it.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Considering how much I use it, and how much I am going to save on not buying anything else, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li>really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Granted, it removed some of the finer hair that I wasn&#x27;t really concerned with</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, but I&#x27;m used to the feeling because I use an epilator for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>This product seemed really neat</li>
            <li>yet it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy that I don&#x27;t need a mirror and proper lighting to use.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product and it&#x27;s so inexpensive you can&#x27;t really lose.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bellabe --- would give you 10 stars  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it hurts that much, but I have waxed my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; before</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old and have tried many different types of hair removal products.</li>
            <li>Before I bought one for myself, I bought one for a friend who was constantly looking for an effective facial hair removal product.</li>
            <li>Well, like many of the reviews posted here, I have to say that it is uncomfortable, but it is effective.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s effective, but takes me multiple passes on the same tender area of skin</li>
            <li>Two children ago, I didn&#x27;t have the kind of luxurious facial growth that would require such a tool, but now I find myself in need.</li>
            <li>Go easy the first pass, particularly if you have long hairs on your jaw line.</li>
            <li>Watched this reviewed for a few years on a popular shopping channel</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a effective and inexpensive facial hair removal product.</li>
            <li>The Bellabe Facial Hair Remover effectively removes facial hair in minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, I have it handy enough where I can start doing it while sitting in traffic, or wait outside the school for my kids.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure it would exfoliate down to the bone.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair you can barely see, but I feel like part of the Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li>The pain is tolerable, the only time it hurts more is when you do your upper lip or right below your eye socket.</li>
            <li>Yes, it stings the first time I used it, but the more I use it, the less it bothers it</li>
            <li>And the hair grows back pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>While not easy to use, I was pleasantly surprised to find it works and the price is good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, takes some getting use to, &amp; have found plucking wit tweezers , nor as good as the small battery operated lady&#x27;s shaver I have, which which neither get smooth as using tweezers..tricky to use also, when rub back &amp; forth with it in a circle, it grabs the hair, the you pull remover out swiftly &amp; it pull hair out, but still leaves a little stub</li>
            <li>I mean, let&#x27;s be fair, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt.  </li>
            <li>Removes facial hair fast and easy, and with only mild discomfort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice in theory but seems to only work if you can hold it flat.  </li>
            <li>I love this and this product is so quick and easy, leaving not one hair behind!</li>
            <li>Then along comes this wonderful little tool and after very little pain, effort or time</li>
            <li>Oh, the other nice thing is you don&#x27;t have to wait until the hair gets a certain length before it will work like many of the items I have tried in the past, including waxing.</li>
            <li>Will come back to it later since it&#x27;s very easy to operate.</li>
            <li>There is a slight pinching while hair is being pulled out, but beauty doesn&#x27;t come easy!  </li>
            <li>No more waxing for me, I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I do actually love this little spring of pain because it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do which is remove all that unsightly hair from my face without taking up a shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>Like it better than other alternatives.</li>
            <li>(I was originally searching for facial hair removing cream, plucking takes foreverrrr</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;s lackluster performance was due to user error and will improve as I learn to wield it better.</li>
            <li>Other than the pimples I was satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i recommended to a couple other ladies and they love it too.</li>
            <li>originally used this product for my upper lip (which I have always had a hair issue for) and my chin (</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>i used it, and it does clean the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>It stings a bit on the real sensitive places like my upper lip and just below where my sideburns are but overall it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I advise using it after the shower since your pores are open and your face is clean.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of Bellabe because it seemed too good to be true, yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing little tool, I bought one for myself and my mother, she loves it too!</li>
            <li>I use some alcohol on a cotton ball to wipe it down after and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li>So I found the Bellabe and read many reviews and figured at the low price I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose...except facial hair!</li>
            <li>It really works and deserves the high ratings</li>
            <li>The best part is I can take care of this sitting down, standing up, laying down - with lots of light or no light at all.  </li>
            <li>I am lucky that even with my PCOS, I don&#x27;t get much acne on my face (mostly on my back and around my hairline).</li>
            <li>So take your lip in three stages (right side, left side, middle) and persevere practicing your technique of how fast you want to roll it, and soon you will have smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to get the less expensive one too, because the reviews were also really great!</li>
            <li>I am excited to get the less expensive one too, because the reviews were also really great!</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this tool, much more efficient than tweezing, and no long term side effects like scar tissue or damage to skin from waxing.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because of breaking hair off, but I can clearly see the roots when I pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves your face soft and smooth and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast.</li>
            <li>WOW, it REALLY works!</li>
            <li>I have to say that, for pulling out light soft hairs on the chin and upper lip, this works really well.</li>
            <li>Going back to my electric full body epilator.</li>
            <li>Your skin may be sensitive at first.</li>
            <li>This is such a cool thing to have.</li>
            <li>So I originally bought the REM and actually wrote a good review about it also, but I misplaced it and thought I&#x27;d try a different brand this time.  </li>
            <li>This is a really cool facial hair remover!</li>
            <li>I got a full 25c piece area cleared on my shin, and I only needed 2 band-aids to staunch the bleeding.  </li>
            <li>this gets the job done pretty good although i do have problems with getting extra small hairs.</li>
            <li>I was more concerned about the stray dark chin hairs that my husband (affectionately?) dubbed  my \\&quot;wiry hag-hairs\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My skin honestly feels softer and smoother and no more peach fuzz or hairs...</li>
            <li>I was paying $30 monthly for full facial threading.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Bellabe a couple of years ago, and I use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the plucking, but not painful except for above the lip.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it it did hurt and knew that it would because i had read the reviews and people had said that it would hurt because it is pulling the hair out and on your face its sensitive anyways.</li>
            <li>, it felt like tiny pricks, not bad.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to use this near/around your eye brows, as it&#x27;s hard to be precise and can end up taking a hunk of eyebrow out quickly!</li>
            <li>This is easy and really doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first use, when you remove all the little hairs at once.  </li>
            <li>My face is very smooth without all the facial hair and I am so thankful that I don&#x27;t have to daily \\&quot;pluck\\</li>
            <li>The trick is to keep rolling gently over little spots to make sure you get it all.</li>
            <li>It is also a great gift for elderly women who have a hard time seeing and plucking those stray hairs on their upper lip or chin.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other product (more expensive) and have not been as happy with there performance.</li>
            <li>I must say my skin has not felt this smooth in a very long time.</li>
            <li>The bellabe is quicker removes more hair with less amount of work.</li>
            <li>With this facial hair remover, I was able to easily remove my facial hair with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even us black girls :)</li>
            <li>easy to twist with rough hold...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use however it does sting which is to be expected</li>
            <li>It is not painless at all, there is more than just a slight tugging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with minimal discomfort which diminishes over time.</li>
            <li>My husband could see the difference before and after, and I was thrilled to see hair trapped in the coils with nearly every pass.</li>
            <li>I adjusted quickly to the initial stinging</li>
            <li>Prices vary, so I wonder if the more expensive ones (like REM) are better. . .     </li>
            <li>Wondering if upgrading to a more expensive model would get better results?     </li>
            <li>I found that hair does not grow back as quickly as plucking it with a tweeezer.   </li>
            <li>Obviously I used it correctly because many hairs were removed (especially the finer hairs just under my lip).</li>
            <li>This Bellabe gets most everything, and then I go back with the tweezers and get the ones that were too short for the spring.</li>
            <li>but you have to have a decent pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>It takes all the hair off my upper lip and leaves it smooth and   soft.</li>
            <li>The way my face is, if I skip a day or two the hair grows back no matter what (albeit lighter and not as quickly).</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of it</li>
            <li>and I figured it was worth the risk of only $16 if I ended up hating its very existence.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Bellabe Facial Hair Remover&#x27; may be &#x27;simple&#x27; but it is mighty!</li>
            <li>I tried a shaver but found that it leaves bumps on my skin and the hair grows back quickly.</li>
            <li>and it grows back really quick.  </li>
            <li>My face was red and sore for about 10 mins after but it quickly subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have acne in middle school, but since then ive got it under control, and my skins been great lately.</li>
            <li>Basically, based on the reviews ive read, if you are older, and have never struggled with acne, you should have no problem, but if you have ever struggled with acne, or have oily skin</li>
            <li>thing I love about the Bellabe Facial Remover, is it allows for multiple hairs to be removed at one time.  </li>
            <li>The photo leads you to believe you are getting more than one facial hair remover, however, for the price, you receive only one.  </li>
            <li>I only use it for my upper lip and chin, and it&#x27;s like magic and strip every hair off.</li>
            <li>It works like many tiny tweezers extracting hair all at the same time.</li>
            <li>Roll it in different directions to get as many hairs as possible.</li>
            <li>I can do this once a week, as a quick clean-up, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to grow back like waxing.</li>
            <li>The creams don&#x27;t get everything, they smell, they burn my skin if left on more than 8 minutes, and I get stubble the next day.  </li>
            <li>so I was afraid the Bellabe wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively remove the hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy, a little stingy at first</li>
            <li>It actually works best when you work with it by feel rather than sight, so I sat down to watch a little TV and used it while I watched.</li>
            <li>This works very well for the fine hair that grows on my face or other areas but anything course will not be removed by this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had not problems at all!</li>
            <li>I have significant light blonde peach fuzz on my upper lip, which has always bothered me, but waxing causes breakouts for me, and all attempts at hair removal on my upper lip have been very unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>Good product, but your hair has to be thick in order for it to work!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li>If not for the reviews I read about this product I highly doubt I would have purchased it.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this hair remover.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Purchased this with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>( i am a senior in high school)</li>
            <li>I have to say I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>It has been an embarrassing issue since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I have had high hope for this because I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals on my face</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and bought it based on it&#x27;s high reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This little thing WORKS for fine hair and peach fuzz that is too much to tweeze!</li>
            <li>hurts a little at first especially sensitive areas but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after a few more uses this slight sting will dissipate.</li>
            <li>It stings the most on the first use, but if used regularly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all because you have less hairs to pull out each time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little large for my upper lip area, but much more effective than this little gadget.</li>
            <li>Cute little hair-removing device.  </li>
            <li>Yes there is a little pain, not any more then tweezing.  </li>
            <li>Love this little thing as a filler in between waxing.</li>
            <li>This cute little device shaved 30 minutes of tweezer time from my life.</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little more than waxing</li>
            <li>Much better than those little baby hair clippers since it pulls the hair out by the root</li>
            <li>I held on to it and get a little better at maneuvering it each time.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product to see if it worked before I invested in an expensive epilator - and am very glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>might, with a little more use.</li>
            <li>&quot; I love this little tool and just saying that makes my husband jealous.  </li>
            <li>At most, it stings a little when the hair gets pulled out.</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts a little, but better than tweezing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like waxing</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, this innocent looking little &#x27;spring&#x27; get them all.</li>
            <li>This is an ingenious little device.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a little aloe afterward and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more pulling power when I purchased this.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little bit, but gets better over time.</li>
            <li>Seriously, just buy one already, it&#x27;s totally worth it. :)</li>
            <li>After the first go at my cheeks and chin area, i had red skin which then turned into large pimples.</li>
            <li>The upper lip did smart the first time I tried it there</li>
            <li>It seems to do better removing the fine hairs than the coarse, thick hairs, but that just makes it easier to tweeze the leftovers.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fine facial hair, and it took me multiple passes over an area to completely remove hair (about 20 minutes from start to finish).</li>
            <li>This little spring is effective, fast, and seems to produce long-lasting results, but is definitely not painless.  </li>
            <li>I love my smooth face, and no longer feel ashamed of my slight &#x27;mustache&#x27; or other shadows</li>
            <li>As I get older and lazier, I look for new methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li>Just surprised at how much it hurt.  </li>
            <li>It hurt so much I almost screamed out loud.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day without problems though (no break outs or irritated skin) but was quite surprised to feel how much hair I kept removing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am honestly surprised how much hair I keep pulling out.</li>
            <li>It easily removes facial hairs, even small fine ones and the thicker chin type hairs.  </li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced and surpassed my expectations so far.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much hair you need to remove, depends on how frequently you will need to use it.</li>
            <li>Use on clean, dry</li>
            <li>Looked weird but the reviews said it was great.  </li>
            <li>I prefer professional treatments but don&#x27;t always want to pay so much.</li>
            <li>and I was very self conscious of my mustache area.</li>
            <li>I also wipe mine clean with a dry cloth as I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tool, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I am not completely hair free, but much better than in the past.</li>
            <li>This hurts too much and my skin is too sensitive to use it.  </li>
            <li>My face felt like a chemical burn a few times from the creams, and I swore I would find a better solution.  </li>
            <li>The ripping of facial hair from the roots by the Bellabe is not a walk in the park, but the result is worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>AFTER A FEW MORE TRYS, IT DID NOT WORK</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about strange hairs when I go out.   </li>
            <li>That this removes multiple hairs at once (rather than tweezing one hair at a time) is well worth the short-term discomfort.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened it I thought this can&#x27;t be good but was I wrong.  </li>
            <li>I had been doing research on the No No for hair removal and most of the reviews were pretty negative, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300+ on a maybe.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my upper lip, it really hurt.  </li>
            <li>I moved to a place where threading was more expensive and they kind of sucked (I had been getting my upper lip threaded for years)..</li>
            <li>that this was a nicer, newer way to remove unwanted hair and could see it useful if I had a bigger problem with hair on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find it more tolerable after a few uses.</li>
            <li>I would say it hurts about as much as waxing, but only the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>When I saw this, the low price convinced me that it was worth</li>
            <li>It is kind of tricky to use properly and have hair above the mouth actually removed.</li>
            <li>I ordered a cheap on first, but then realized that I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>I ordered a cheap on first, but then realized that I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a few ladies on there who can show you how to use it before you buy it :)</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying this a few more times.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was a normal reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So worth it for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>but I still replace them within 9 months, plus, it&#x27;s always fun to get different colors!  </li>
            <li>, I think waxing was the only thing I haven&#x27;t had much success with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good that I did, so that the fallout wasn&#x27;t worse than it was...</li>
            <li>It took me quite a few tries, watching a u-tube video,and an email to the company, to learn how to use it effectively, and I still cannot use it under my chin/jawline with any measure of success.</li>
            <li>It can be difficult to maneuver it to pluck some hairs in certain areas but otherwise is very effective and leaves the skin feeling far smoother than a razor would.</li>
            <li>Other areas were fine.  </li>
            <li>device is very simple and easy to use, and I can see for myself that the hairs on my upper lip are removed at the roots.</li>
            <li>skin is easily irritated and this process left me with only a tingling feeling, as if I just exercised my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Overall it is effective and probably less damaging than ripping everything out at once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painful and don&#x27;t see good results ..very easy to use and</li>
            <li>So easy now, 3 days later with no hair on my upper lip, chin, cheeks - anywhere!</li>
            <li>This product honestly cut my facial plucking time in half</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to use and only stings for a second after hairs are removed.  </li>
            <li>So easy I won&#x27;t mind if I do it daily, but it looks like that won&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li>but this works much better than tweezing and grabs a larger amount of hair than just single tweezing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the creams for facial hair and had a reaction from it and broke out with sores on the side of my right lip.</li>
            <li>just right to ensure proper hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Not following up with some type of astringent sets you up for breakouts as bacteria will slip right into those pores that you ripped the hair follicles from.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the hair does not grow back right away.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually how you can tell it&#x27;s working, if it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; a bit you&#x27;re not doing it right.  </li>
            <li>They only appear right after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>It takes many passes for me to extract my thick coarse hairs and the pain doesn&#x27;t really seem worth it.</li>
            <li>Does not feel like a pin prick, feels like a 400 pound German woman named Gert ( pretty sure she used to be a wrestler....and a man) is super glueing duct tape to your cheeks and or upper lip and yanking out the delicate whisps of fuzz with enough force to wax a gorilla then following up with a gentle soothing touch of a blowtorch that will leave you tingling for a good half hour.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I tried to use it on my upper lip stray hairs (I have a few that are blond and not thick)</li>
            <li>I have PCOS and, while I&#x27;m not exactly The Bearded Lady, I want my face to look smooth and youthful and, well, hairless.</li>
            <li>It is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>This is painful at first but gets better as more hairs are lifted.</li>
            <li>I do have to admit it was pretty cool to see my little hairs in the springs of this tool, but It took a lot of twisting and turning to figure out how use this tool correctly.  </li>
            <li>Which for me works with 2 energetic busy little ones.</li>
            <li>I need new one.</li>
            <li>I need to get a new wife, and keep the &amp;#34;Bellabe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li>You do need to purchase a new one every 6 months or so</li>
            <li>but for those of us out here that have had this  problem,tweezing is nothing new and remains TIME CONSUMING.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Figuring they can send people into space with MRE&#x27;s and a suction toilet, they should be able to make a tool to remove unwanted facial hair from the faces of \\&quot;women of a certain age.\\&quot;  Enter Bellabe Facial Hair Remover!  </li>
            <li>but it does get fine hair too with a little more effort and its a little tricky on the curvy parts of your face but all in all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde and have very fine facial hair (except upper lip) and the Bellabee handled it all.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not very painful at all -- especially if you tweeze</li>
            <li>I found a stiff brissell brush like a nail brush works pretty well and then rinsing in hot water soapy water works pretty well.</li>
            <li>After I have removed all that fuzz, I expect it to be quite easy to keep up with it, just use it before going to bed and will be less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use just a few easy motions and start taking those hairs out easier and faster than actual plucking one by one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with light blonde upper lip, chin and cheek hairs and this miracle wand works!</li>
            <li>Actually way more than i expected.</li>
            <li>I will try it a few more times to see if I can tolerate it, but my face is just sensitive.</li>
            <li>You can find far cheaper versions of this product but most are not available on Prime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as waxing, for some reason (the only exception being the middle of the upper lip -- that was pretty intense).</li>
            <li>Possibly safe on the center bridge of the nose between the eyebrows but for God&#x27;s sake woman, keep that thing away from the actual eyebrows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>This hair remover definitely removes a fair amount of facial hair, with just a slight amount of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Shaving only goes so far and can get stubbly real fast.  </li>
            <li>May only be ideal for a few hairs, like less than 10.</li>
            <li>sure the outside doesn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li>I love this little item!</li>
            <li>The most painful area is the upper lip, it kind of startles you at first and can hurt</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin since I am 91 years of age.  </li>
            <li>My face skin is very sensitive and there was no reaction to using this hair remover.  </li>
            <li>, I usually use it while reading an email, (yes usually only one email because it is so quick and easy to use).</li>
            <li>I have no doubt they will come out easily when they are long enough.</li>
            <li>and it does easily take some of the longer hair from the cheek bone area, but the small fine hairs on the lip are harder, even if you stretch your lip out with your tongue.</li>
            <li>It grabs quite a few hairs at once, many of them those tiny ones you can&#x27;t really see when tweezing, I think.</li>
            <li>Not completely painless but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s all of this old hair inside of it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be the first to say I probably didn&#x27;t give it enough of a try...</li>
            <li>No where near the level of pain that you feel after plucking or waxing!  </li>
            <li>and that will last me a whole year!</li>
            <li>It took me about 15 to 20 minutes, off and on, the first time to remove everything because I am such a baby when it comes to discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well arould lips and chin, not ouchless tho, just like plucking only faster.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I got on Amazon, did my research, and decided my first purchase would be something &#x27;simple&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The bumps are barely noticeable unless you look really closely at my face.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised by this product!</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin, no breakouts or irritation!  </li>
            <li>Did you know that the Egyptians used to remove hair with a silk string--works in exactly the same way this thing does!</li>
            <li>My only suggestion to Bellaby would be to give the customer the option of choosing one of the pretty colors you advertise.  </li>
            <li>Epilators--Yes, this has been my go-to product for my adult life!  </li>
            <li>First if you never have done any facial removal, you will feel sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for the peach fuzz and upper lip hair I get and really isn&#x27;t that painful in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so the thought of this metal object ripping my facial hair out wasn&#x27;t exactly a thrilling thought.</li>
            <li>However, getting facial hair off of my face was absolutely a thrilling thought as I for whatever reason</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I can say that it looks exactly like the photo, comes in the proper packaging.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Upon my first use, I did only my lip, at night, before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair thanks you !</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever done but this simple device works</li>
            <li>I rated the Bellabe 4 stars for only one reason, and that is that the solution isn&#x27;t permanent, like perhaps laser treatments claim to be, and because there is a bit of discomfort at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive like waxing, but the hairs stay gone about the same amount of time</li>
            <li>, I was definitely surprised!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have any redness afterwards!</li>
            <li>Definitely removed the hair as it was supposed to; however, prepare yourself for the pain the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>It is very simple to use although at first</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sometimes pretty obvious where the wax has been.  </li>
            <li>I was all freaked out to use it a second time, because the first time hurt so much!&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am 59 years old and have not had an acne break out in decades!</li>
            <li>Just be aware, you only get one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont have to use any shave cream or other products to be able to use the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li>I thought I finally found a solution to unwanted hair without all the chemicals and hot wax.</li>
            <li>Just FYI - since I started taking evening primrose oil, it&#x27;s almost totally eliminated the hair on my face, I only have a little bit left now, and it&#x27;s very light and fine, almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use, a little pinch, but so is threading and tweezing.  </li>
            <li>A little, though hurt is a bit too strong a word.</li>
            <li>As of now I just bend it in the other direction to remove the caught up hair and then clean it with a sanitizer.</li>
            <li>It hurt a lot at first for me but after a few seconds, I got pretty used to the pain, and now I don&#x27;t have a mustache anymore!</li>
            <li>soo easy to use and minimal pain!!!</li>
            <li>This simple little product is so easy to use, and it works!  </li>
            <li>None of those left my skin as smooth for as long.  </li>
            <li>Be careful to be gentle the first time because it can hurt.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but this actually works great!  </li>
            <li>One thing that really helps is covering the area with a wet, hot washcloth before use as it opens up the pores.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has a covering of down facial hairs will love this.  </li>
            <li>It will definitely cut down on the time I spend tweezing every day, and is alot gentler on the skin than most of the options out there.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine on the little peach fuzz that grows on everyone&#x27;s faces that I can&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li>Does it hurt - a little bit more than a little, but you quickly get used to it</li>
            <li>So before I decided to buy this product, I read some of the reviews and they were all positive and seemed that this product actually worked.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use and stings less than threading!</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, safe, fast, hard to beat!</li>
            <li>It hurt a bit more on my upper lip than my chin and neck, but I also tweeze that area less.</li>
            <li>Such a fairly quick and simple solution.</li>
            <li>The product instructions and some of the reviews suggest that using this tool only causes mild discomfort- maybe not in the cheek area, but the upper lip HURTS...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, wax breaks me out, the bleach and lotions really hurt my skin and give me open sores.</li>
            <li>Not only is it really easy and simple to use, but it actually works!</li>
            <li>I order thus thinking it would be easy to use, it is not easy and somewhat time consuming.</li>
            <li>Since reaching a certain age, I have been dealing with the presence of some facial hair on my chin, and lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>After a certain age, facial hair happens.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly doesnt hurt anymore than having wax ripped off your upper lip (along with a layer of skin).  </li>
            <li>I wish that I could post pictures of it, but several large and irritated bumps grew on the sides of my chin.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my skin was left very soft and smooth similar to a post facial.  </li>
            <li>this is okay for fine hairs but hurts like crazy and still have to follow up with tweezers.</li>
            <li>This tool is convenient, and if your hair is not thick black ethic hair and u have mild peach fuzz, this could work on you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to be careful with the application of my makeup, specifically powders, because of the fine blonde hairs that covered my face.</li>
            <li>will say it is not the most pleasant sensation while using it, but I would rather hurt a little while using it, than go around with a hairy face, or a broken out face from waxing and threading!!  </li>
            <li>Luckily I only wound up with a few abrasions and a quick trip to the gyno for some salve will heal that right up, in 2 -3 weeks</li>
            <li>I will spend a little more and only buy Bellabe from now on.</li>
            <li>It works the same as the REM, but for whatever reason I think it works just a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>You do get used to it after a little bit, and, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I love the instant gratification of seeing all the hairs that have been removed with each pass.</li>
            <li>It hurst a little bit at first, but you get used to it because it goes so fast you don&#x27;t even notice it!</li>
            <li>Amazed at the fact that it&#x27;s a little spring, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li>It removed a few fine hairs, but it&#x27;s difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product with very high hopes that it would end my facial hair problems.  </li>
            <li>The upper lip is a little sensitive, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the feeling.  </li>
            <li>This little thing is pretty cool - it actually works!  </li>
            <li>Pinched a little on there, but I never tweeze my upper lip so it was more sensitive.</li>
            <li>This tool is much more effective than tweezing or waxing those pesky, ugly hairs that grow on my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>This is a great inexpensive, not too painful method of getting those hairs that your really can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li>they are almost clear) and depilatory cream (burns my skin)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing; my upper lip hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I use it almost every evening when I&#x27;m reading and my face is clear all the time now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot coming out , so much easier, especially when your busy and have kids.</li>
            <li>Clean the toothbrush with alcohol or whatever, and allow to dry for the next cleaning.</li>
            <li>What I really want is to find a completely fool proof way to not grow facial hair at all.  </li>
            <li>iir appears to do what is stated but it made my face break out as in an acne attack and after 5 days i have not got my face to clear up.</li>
            <li>Not only does it hurt like crazy, it&#x27;s incredibly time consuming.</li>
            <li>Also I thought it would last forever and pull everything out fast..</li>
            <li>Four stars for a working product; I had to skip the fifth star because the pain level completely took me by surprise.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions completely and it caused a severe reaction on my face.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and do not have acne and</li>
            <li>Not only is this product over priced (its just a spring with handles) it does not work very well</li>
            <li>it really hurt and it only owrked on the longer hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought a few of the cheap ones just to compare and they ended up in the garbage, they didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>but I really had to keep on it because it felt like stubble when it would grow back in.  </li>
            <li>As  far as the pain goes, you get used to it after using for a while</li>
            <li>upper lip and chin, this contraption hurts like crazy :) but it sure does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bellabe facial hair remover really does the job.  </li>
            <li>One can twist their fingers whilst moving this wand, but only just so fast.</li>
            <li>Stay away if you are sensitive like me, otherwise this product does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin or are adverse to feeling pain, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>But I had my old one for almost two years</li>
            <li>It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>My problem is that I must have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I had been using wax strips for sensitive skin, but it would still break me out and break me out in rashes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The hair does seem to grow back finer but the product really does have to be used a minimum of once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>also recommend that you don&#x27;t use it near your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t use it near the lips.  </li>
            <li>Bells be Facial Hair Remover really works, inwantbyou know that.</li>
            <li>have found the Bellabe very helpful, do not use on an infected area such as a pimple.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised - doesn&#x27;t get them all</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and waxing and tweezing make me break out.</li>
            <li>I have tried tweezers (which is a real pain, as the hairs come in so white</li>
            <li>but my eyebrows are nearly nonexistent (sigh).</li>
            <li>It was completely bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The maintenance and upkeep is much, much, much simpler than the initial removal.</li>
            <li>I still sneeze every time I get near the nose area.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use n buy when this one becomes old</li>
            <li>It really pulls unwanted hair on upper lips and below.</li>
            <li>I just would not recommend it to people who have sensitive skin and do not do well with the results of plucking.</li>
            <li>Its very inexpensive and low tech...</li>
            <li>so far i haven&#x27;t seen any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>I have professional hair removal services for years including laser and electrolysis.</li>
            <li>So far it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Compared to tweezing individual hairs, this is amaaazingly fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with solutions for hair removal because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s doing whole sections at the same time, unlike tweezing them one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not give me any bumps or marks.</li>
            <li>I have to remove the hair with the root because mine grows back too fast</li>
            <li>So far I have found none of those reviews to be my case.</li>
            <li>but after feeling how soft my face felt it motivated me to keep going.</li>
            <li>, of course, didn&#x27;t notice anything amiss, and told my wife whatever she was concerned about was completely unnoticable.  </li>
            <li>The results last a lot longer than alternative methods and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and I am still dealing with the after effects.</li>
            <li>I also really like that even though its pulling hairs out of my face it doesn&#x27;t actually irritate my skin which I do have sensitive skin so that actually surprised me.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>It looks like I have natural &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; like I had before menopause.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has a problem with facial hair and wants to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>Better late than hairy.</li>
            <li>It really hurts when using it, and does not take off enough hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use depilatory creams because,... refer to the sensitive skin issue...</li>
            <li>with my reading glasses on naturally.  </li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this product to any girl who wants to get rid of their facial hair.</li>
            <li>This is fast and convenient, it does sting some on the upper lip but you&#x27;re ripping out hairs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too busy for that.</li>
            <li>It eveng grabs short hair once you really get the hang of how to use.</li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive to pain I would pass.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, get this.  </li>
            <li>it took two weeks for it to clear completely up.  </li>
            <li>Olay facial hair remover burnt my face despite using the balm etc and it doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Remember to twist the ends near the hairs.</li>
            <li>It totally removes unwanted hair but, it really hurts.  </li>
            <li>I used to do threading but cant find a place that does it near me.</li>
            <li>I just put some ice cubes in a plastic bag and apply to the sensitive areas for 10-15 seconds before I remove the hair.</li>
            <li>long since suffered from blonde peach fuzz pretty much all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Wait at least two days before doing more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem reasonable to have my entire face waxed for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my stepson was about 7 years old, he asked me if &amp;#34;girls can grow beards.&amp;#34; He obviously saw the light blonde fuzz on my jawline where men would have an actual beard.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get the smaller hair that I have..</li>
            <li>This thing grabs tiny hairs that I didn&#x27;t even knew were there, it really made a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>Works really well on peach fuzz and gets it off without  visual irritation!</li>
            <li>Because my skin is so sensitive, I can&#x27;t use wax or chemicals.  </li>
            <li>By using this at home I have completely eliminated breakouts after hair removal.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for removing facial hair both visible and invisible.</li>
            <li>Takes awhile to complete the task, but it does work.</li>
            <li>Works very well on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when ALL the hair was removed,</li>
            <li>and I frequently have my legs waxed.  </li>
            <li>No reaction afterward, even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It takes a short time to master the technique, but it is worth every second.</li>
            <li>Anyway...it has trouble with the more coarse hairs and you&#x27;ll probably have to continue plucking those with tweezers (i do).  </li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve had minor burns from wax that was too hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ended up randomly finding this product because it is totally worth the money &amp; it doesn&#x27;t use chemicals.</li>
            <li>Worth the try since it&#x27;s not much to buy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not into buying expensive waxing tools or trying the  chemical hair removals, this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li>I have too many thick rooted chin hair</li>
            <li>It kinda felt good in a weird way around the chin area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, I still had to get out my trusty tweezers to finish things up, but all in all it did a good job.</li>
            <li>and it is able to remove all the thick hairs.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face, and its not dark, and in most lights not super noticeable, but in certain lighting its obvious and the hairs look long, and there are alot.</li>
            <li>Now when I use Bellabe, the hairs come out easily and there is very little pain.</li>
            <li>It takes up very little room, which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I have tried the other similar spring hair removers and Bellabe is the one that grabs the most hair and actually pulls them out from the roots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a little tingle when I used it to remove the hair on my ears that fell from my head and stuck.</li>
            <li>(I caught both the fine light hairs on my cheeks and upper lip and few course dark hairs that spout on my chin from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair over parts of my face, and I have dark, coarse hair directly over my lips, and I have what you&#x27;d call &#x27;fuzz&#x27; over my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Works well for fine hair, not so much for coarse, small hair.</li>
            <li>I also like it is small and easy to throw in a travel bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive, especially compared to other hair removal methods, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Its not pain free, but the more you use it, the less pain you feel (the longer hairs are more painful, and anything on the upper lip).  </li>
            <li>It hurts a little at first, but it gets rid of hair VERY efficiently and from the roots.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no chemicals involved, no mess, no microwaving, no nicks or cuts.   </li>
            <li>IT hurts like plucking or waxing but no mess like waxing</li>
            <li>There is no mess</li>
            <li>After just a few hair pulls I decided the beauty wasn&#x27;t worth the pain in this case!</li>
            <li>I feel like this product was kind of a fail because it didn&#x27;t really work as easy as people decribed it..or at least it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li>Take my word, it is completely worth the quick tugs and tingles.my eyes water and my skin slightly pink, but there was little evidence of damage.</li>
            <li>I does the job just fine with very little pain.</li>
            <li>It got all those little hairs right off!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, baby white haor on my upper lip and chin (getting older sucks) and waxing and creams tend to make me swell up because my skin is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I know this all sounds like the most time consuming, ridiculous routine ever, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight stinging sensation, and I had to tweeze the smaller hairs (which there weren&#x27;t that many), but it works overall!</li>
            <li>Overall, really decent product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you tied up your hair and slick back hair and sideburn hair that you want to keep!  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the handles on this wonderful device are one of the substances I&#x27;m not able to touch.</li>
            <li>Honestly I need to numb the skin with ice first to make it easier to get thru.</li>
            <li>As ladies grow older, and I assume men, also, pesky facial hair appears in unwanted places.</li>
            <li>Though I was somewhat hesitant at first to believe it would work, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.</li>
            <li>received the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover in return for a realistic review.</li>
            <li>The only complain is that after I used this product I broke out, but that is mainly because of my skin not the product itself.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the clear barely there hairs that come in; they&#x27;re natural.</li>
            <li>so I have a decent amount of darker hair on my face that I wanted to get rid of on the chin, upper lip, cheeks, sideburns, and temples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why some people thought this wouldn&#x27;t hurt any more than regular threading</li>
            <li>Yes, it stings at first, but the pain only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li>I did break out alittle bit after the first time but since then i try to do a facial mask on the same day that i use the Bellabe</li>
            <li>It is a quiet little tool that actually removes the facial hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>It does sting a little bit but not badly.</li>
            <li>And other reviewers are right...</li>
            <li>good news is that it really works, and it isn&#x27;t bad after the first go so long as you keep up with it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any lady having problems with hair on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, I have read mixed reviews</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant when looking for a safer facial hair remover, especially with this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.</li>
            <li>I bought a soft toothbrush for a child, then use alcohol &amp; gently wipe dry.</li>
            <li>One downside was that a two days later I broke out in fine little pimples on my cheek where I plucked out my sideburns.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I have little fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>The main problem with permanent hair removal is new follicles are constantly being stimulated and the hair removal battle is never totally won.</li>
            <li>, so I can use it while catching up on the news on TV--which is much more painful than the Bellabe could ever be!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well and takes a long time.</li>
            <li>have small light hairs and they were removed well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for those who have wanted facial hair; laser treatments can be expensive, and you have to go back for repeated treatments.</li>
            <li>No more looking like the bearded lady when the light hits my face.</li>
            <li>no dark mark</li>
            <li>Im trying to get rid of them, for my skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li>Some areas are really not painful at all, but other areas (like the upper lip) are pretty rough.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I was fully prepared to hate this product because it just looked too simple to be effective.</li>
            <li>It is so bendy that it&#x27;s hard to get the hair on certain locations and while some areas took out quite a bit of hair, the fight isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>It takes a few tries to master the way it works, but the results are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This little tool was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>Anyone reading this may be thinking, &amp;#34;Whoa, calm down there, Haus.</li>
            <li>Yeah right, how can something simple as this spring remove my facial hair, let alone the really tiny baby hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will not use it on as it seems especially painful, most notable right underneath my nose</li>
            <li>(NE and NW), and emerge a little while later with skin as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li>Hard to use...not as easy as it makes it seem.</li>
            <li>There were a few spots on my face that made me wince (like high cheekebone closer to under eye) but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Pulling out hair from the root, especially around sensitive lip area is painful, but the price we pay for good grooming!  </li>
            <li>It does seem to be effective (other than under the jawline), but needs to be used for a few minutes daily.  </li>
            <li>June treated me with such kindness, I felt like I made a new friend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young adult, and I started noticing hair on my upper and lower lip when I was around 12.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect to feel it so much having waxed and tweezed almost daily for around two years prior.</li>
            <li>After constant use of Bellabe I noticed my hair stopped growing back out as much</li>
            <li>The results are well worth the slight tingly-stingy sensation.  </li>
            <li>Now I pay only $8 for eyebrow threading, thanks to Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.</li>
            <li>Just roll in one direction and go slow, it will grab those coarse hairs if you are patient with them, these hurt more to pull out.</li>
            <li>I focus mostly on my upper and lower lips, and use tweezers for the more stubborn ones that are thick and deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very uncomfortable when you use it the first time, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tweeze-it kind of gal, but some angles I just couldn&#x27;t reach, and I was tired of breaking hairs and the resulting facial eruptions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of my makeup sitting on top of my fine, little, blonde baby hairs on my face.</li>
            <li>As the hair grows back in, I&#x27;m sure there will be less to remove in a single instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the same reaction my very sensitive skin has to tweezing and threading.</li>
            <li>Not only was waxing costly, but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I am not tough enough to let hair be pulled from chin on a regular.</li>
            <li>I would like to use it again, but my general instincts won&#x27;t let me because it hurts!</li>
            <li>Removing hair this way it pretty painful, but it does get better over time and it really works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty painful but in the end when you have smooth skin and no traces of hair, it makes the pain worth it.  </li>
            <li>After using it several times, it is still quite painful but does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>This leaves me with essentially no other option but tweezing and plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I used to walk around with my visible mustache apparently, but now it is gone!</li>
            <li>Another major drawback</li>
            <li>Definitely a little tricky to get use to but works better than expected!</li>
            <li>The coil did not  grip facial hair tightly enough to effect consistent removal on the facial areas that needed it.</li>
            <li>I have always have trouble with hair on my chin and lip and wanted something that worked better than Nair or the other facial hair remover because the hair always came back really think.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to other women who have sensitive, delicate skin, and are looking for a simple and effective hair removal device such as this one.</li>
            <li>I do have to get after a few hair the good old fashion tweezers route, although less than usual when I use this facial hair remover first.</li>
            <li>I also love using it on my cheeks, sideburn area and up into the baby hairs around my forehead, you just need to be careful and go slow there, but the hair ends up growing back so much slower.  </li>
            <li>Found my new facial hair remover, way better than using creams or worse</li>
            <li>However it is pretty painful which you get used to the more you use it !</li>
            <li>if u hve fine hair its must, but thick hair forget it.</li>
            <li>I have lots of those little middle age fine, feathery white hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little time but worth the price.</li>
            <li>It will take you a minute or two to get the hang of it but its worth the little bit of effort.  </li>
            <li>This little gem is worth</li>
            <li>I did do some upper lip but that seriously hurt so much more than the chin.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product at first because the hair I have is fine but noticeable</li>
            <li>Using tweezers takes too long and an epilator hurts too much on certain areas and leaves red spots.</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting me as much as waxing has in the past.</li>
            <li>I have tiny tiny blonde hairs on my face that you can see in certain lighting.</li>
            <li>Now although &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; sounds silly considering the fact that yes, it is not painless (in fact, the first time I used it I had to gain a little extra courage by drinking a glass of wine first)</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m a tad bit naive in thinking that it would be pain free</li>
            <li>but overtime it becomes bearable, although I seem to have quite the tolerance when it comes to plucking in general.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;trouble spots&amp;#34; were just mainly my upper lip and over near my side burns.  </li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t left any irritation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets purchasing it</li>
            <li>While it is nowhere near painless, it is simple once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).    </li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional facial threading done before and it brought tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am Italian, and contrary to old wives tales</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and the irritation from pulling multiple hairs at once did cause a lot of redness.</li>
            <li>and I have chin fuzz that I completely got rid of with this Bellabe facial hair remover.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of really coarse ones that the Bellabe pulled with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Bellabe for facial hair removal if you skin is too sensitive for hair removal creams (mine skin burns) or shaving leaves that spikey feeling and shadow.</li>
            <li>but they could also burned the skin if not careful.  </li>
            <li>its back to the salon for me and getting the natural threading done, was hoping to save my self some money by using this tool.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal product.  </li>
            <li>I know you are currently picturing Mrs. Doubtfire, I assure you I am far hotter than she.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tweezed, used facial epiladors, shaved, had professional treatments, use a myriad of delipatory type products--</li>
            <li>always felt self conscious about my facial hair when talking to someone closely.</li>
            <li>but after that it barely stings  </li>
            <li>Tried it out last week and my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>The key is to use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised this actually works, but it does not remove all of the hairs even if I go over an area for 30 min.  </li>
            <li>can truly report that it works,works fine,requires no real effort and without that peach fuzz,my complexion looks much</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think I could tolerate it, however, after several tries, I bit the bullet and went for it.</li>
            <li>It took several tries to figure out exactly how to use it, but one you master the learning curve, it works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that you can become used to it over time, but I kinda don&#x27;t care for unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li>A few things, it is effective in getting small hairs and pulling them out.</li>
            <li>this thing is kind of silly.  </li>
            <li>It took a few goes to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s well worth the patience.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful at all (no more than tweezing anyway).</li>
            <li>I hated using hair removal creams that contained chemicals - the Bellabe was the perfect find!!  </li>
            <li>okay but not great,</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive fair skin, which makes hair removal very difficult.</li>
            <li>My face did get a little red but it quickly faded.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find waxing to be less painful and more effective.</li>
            <li>By far the most painful area was right under the nose.</li>
            <li>Although they say to replace it every year, I have used mine now for a couple of years, and only recently noticed that I am in need of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bleaching creams that weren&#x27;t effective for very long, plus were irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair plucked the first time you use it, but it de-hairs enough that you won&#x27;t feel embarrassed about going out into the sun and worrying your face is starting to resemble a hairy gorilla!</li>
            <li>I have even used it for 3 weeks straight and although it hurts less with frequent use, well...</li>
            <li>(I thought slightly more so than waxing), but after a few uses, my skin got used the process and hurt much less.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t have the proper technique down right</li>
            <li>Although the upper lip hair didn&#x27;t grow back darker, I have very sensitive skin there, and it would get irritated.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot get my upper lip waxed because I leave the salon with a red mustache.  </li>
            <li>At first it hurts, but the hurts get less and it pulls out the hair.</li>
            <li>Such a simple concept, but wow, the results!</li>
            <li>I had assumed that my peach fuzz (which seemed to magically appear as I grew older and had kids) was something that could only be dealt with via prescription or expensive waxing.  </li>
            <li>It pretty much removed everything except some very tiny stubs which are hard to see.  </li>
            <li>and it has pulled out all the fine hairs as well as the occasional thick hairs that sprout up under my chin.</li>
            <li>but it is hard to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It does do the job though, but its hard to clean.</li>
            <li>A little bit of pain involved, but no where near as much as pulling those fellers out one by one.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and is way faster than other methods.</li>
            <li>This hurts but so worth it because it removed every little hair from my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The instructions also say that the device lasts about 6-9 months, which is not bad for something that costs a lot less than a single salon waxing.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest and say that it&#x27;s really more of a horrible ripping sensation!!!</li>
            <li>Seriously, you could probably see if this product will work for you by taking a cheap spring out of one of your home electronics and rolling over your skin...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 4 years now on my upper and lower lip, and i have not had problems so far.</li>
            <li>i am italian and 28 years old and suddenly getting neck and chin hairs</li>
            <li>Also, while my face gets red (it&#x27;s sooooo sensitive) with this it gets red too</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely painless, but if you are used to waxing and tweezing, this is definitely preferable, especially because it won&#x27;t tear and burn your skin.</li>
            <li>I was tired of dealing with trying to get rid of facial hair with less than good results, so I went ahead and bought it based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>.. more of an annoying sting that you will come to enjoy as you revel in the baby smoothness that it uncovers...</li>
            <li>Wasted money over the years with waxing which would turn my skin red and not be much fun.</li>
            <li>I am a little bit red right after I use it</li>
            <li>So over time this little dude will quickly pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li>So over time this little dude will quickly pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li>First I started on areas with little to no hair (my nose and under my eyes...</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little at first</li>
            <li>yes it stings a little at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>first it does hurt a little, like ripping off tape.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend for someone who is willing to put a little time in.</li>
            <li>Hurt a little when I first started using, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened up the package I saw a little spring with plastic</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to the stinging sensation at first</li>
            <li>it does hurt a little bit at first</li>
            <li>It does hurt a little the first time you try it or use it</li>
            <li>It hurts a little bit at first</li>
            <li>The hairs come out easily and there is very little pain, my skin is so soft and smooth, no more embarrassment when I go out in public worrying about if people can see those little chin hairs!</li>
            <li>It gets the thick, coarse hairs and well as the short, fine ones.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, all 970 of them, thereabouts, and heeded the advice given about the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; and the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and the \\&quot;PAIN\\&quot; and I am here to tell you that this is NOTHING compared to the Epilady, this is FAR easier than that moment that you wait for the muslin wax strips to be ripped off your face and little blood spots to appear, and this is INFINATELY easier than natural childbirth.</li>
            <li>But while using Bellabe, it did pull out every single hair whether it was super short or average length.</li>
            <li>I can imagine that it feels the same as waxing but isn&#x27;t that quick rip that waxing provides (haven&#x27;t waxed so not sure).</li>
            <li>I did have a few small red bumps the first two weeks, but my skin quickly adjusted</li>
            <li>This item is fast and gets the job done fast, and gives ultra smooth results, but is incredibly painful.</li>
            <li>There are times where I have gotten pimples in the area where I removed the hair, I don&#x27;t know if that is because I have oily skin in general, or I didn&#x27;t cleanse the area enough before hand.  </li>
            <li>I generally use an electric epi that works on a similar principle</li>
            <li>Since my chemo I have had real problems with facial hair due to the damage to my system.</li>
            <li>On a scale of one to ten with 10 being the excruciating and 1 being barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll go back to ignoring my facial hair, thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li>Now yes it hurt on sensitive spots like my upper lip but after a few times the pain didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but if this can be of help to one woman it will have been worth it.  </li>
            <li>I had a few bumps the first couple of times, but now it doesn&#x27;t even cause redness.</li>
            <li>I noticed a small break out (which is rare for me) where I did use the tool</li>
            <li>not sure if it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I always disliked that with wax you couldn&#x27;t wax twice, if it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair the first time.</li>
            <li>useful since it is small, so I can take it to travel.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>At first it hurts but after a few times you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>I have hit the age where I unfortunately have way too many little hairs popping up, and this tool catches them all and pops them right out.</li>
            <li>initially had a little bit of difficulty working on the right side of my face, but no probs with the left side, But soon figured it out.</li>
            <li>so it was a bit uncomfortable getting the right side of my face since I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li>Not good because the hair grows back the moment you shave it off which feels like a fine stubble.</li>
            <li>Cold wax--didn&#x27;t grab the skin as well as the hot nor did it pull out the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Much faster than plucking, but no less or more painful.</li>
            <li>Do a little bit at a time the first time, just keep going back to it.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I did it, my skin was left red and a developed a couple small zits.</li>
            <li>pretty much it works if you combine it with other hair removal tactics :/</li>
            <li>It small and fits right in your purse so you can take it when you travel.</li>
            <li>If you have a high tolerance for sharp pinching pain, then I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using since the first time is the most painful so now its just upkeep.</li>
            <li>It is slightly cracked and less smooth from that brief</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s working, you&#x27;ll feel and see it gently grab all the hairs it can, slightly pulling your skin up as it goes.</li>
            <li>that vellus hairs are gone, too; it gives me a less furry, much smoother look in my magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li>Leg hair and arm hair get irritating, but I can deal with that; shaving is an easy fix.</li>
            <li>This Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the true definition of no pain no gain and pain is beauty at least for</li>
            <li>There is a learing curve to using it, but I would say go slow, don&#x27;t expect to just quickly roll it over your face and have all your hair gone.     </li>
            <li>But, another day later, my entire chin and sides of my mouth and in between my eyesbrows were covered in whiteheads, a few very large zits, and a ton of smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I had no idea why, so I experimented and found out that the tool works if you hold the 1 in your left hand and the 2 in your right hand, and twist the handles inward (fingers toward each other, toward the center of the inverted U shape.)</li>
            <li>and I was afraid to put it in certain areas on my face because you need long straight strokes to make it halfway useful.  </li>
            <li>This is most painful on the upper lip when you first try it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time using Bellabe, I found it was most painful on my upper lip close to the lip line.  </li>
            <li>For the coarse chin hairs, it removes 99%, for the tiny dark hairs, I just use the tweezers on those, but even so....it still make removal of those hairs so much easier than before.</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you get near your eyebrows or lashes !</li>
            <li>lol.&lt;br /&gt;Had tried a face hair trimmer for peach fuzz previously which was fine except I had to do it every single day &amp; it would work that well in my chin, &amp; I tried The Epilady facial thing, that was difficult to use &amp; spent most of my time burning my face......</li>
            <li>Easily removes all those thin tiny lip hairs.</li>
            <li>I think perhaps removing those tiny hairs gives acne causing bacteria less to cling to, and less of a direct path right into my pores.</li>
            <li>The product only grabs about half the hairs, if you have that one stubborn hair that is hard to pull this item will not be able to pull it out.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about how much it would actually hurt after reading previous reviews but in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some people described.</li>
            <li>It gets the fine, thin hairs on my face that waxing would not remove.  </li>
            <li>There is a little sting, but no worse that waxing.  </li>
            <li>It is so much quicker than tweezing the little hairs off my face (unwanted ones here and there as well as the peach fuzz), and it is not waxing, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>, it does hurt a little bit, but it&#x27;s really no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li>For the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; don&#x27;t curve the spring so much, level it out a little, twirl, then bend.  </li>
            <li>really like this little gadget.</li>
            <li>It really feels like a little tingle as it pulls the hairs out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this device really does work in removing the majority of those little fuzzies,</li>
            <li>It works very well for but not for my daughter who has a little darker hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I bought mine and tried it, I brought it to work for other people to see -- it was a new thing for all of us.</li>
            <li>Only the fine thin baby hairs removed, and with bearable pain while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Be certain to twist each handle at the same time, firmly, as you roll it against the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>Just absolutely brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems like a solid little device.</li>
            <li>Could be coincidence, but whatever the case, this weird little thing has me hooked for good.</li>
            <li>After the first initial use of the product, I did notice less hair and the hair that did come in was by far less coarse.  </li>
            <li>initially bought this because as I get older, I&#x27;ve been getting some dark hairs above my upper lip (gross) and wax makes me red for days</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews, good &amp; bad, about this product, I decided to take a chance &amp; give it a try.</li>

            <li> So avoid the eye region, but it&#x27;s great for the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool to have</li>
            <li> and I am happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I have used it all over my face, with great care avoiding eyebrows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> but it works great.</li>
            <li> Fits great in my purses.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> For a lady like me, this is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> This works great, but if you are a sissy - don&#x27;t even attempt.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford Lasik, so this was a great option.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I made this purchase.</li>

            <li> Lol no kidding.  </li>
            <li> The Bellabe is great, and I for one ,would be er want to be without it.</li>
            <li> but once I figured it out it did a great job.  </li>
            <li> But it removes hair great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great value.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to threading</li>
            <li> I feel like this would do a great job.</li>
            <li> Still in as great a condition as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> (lol)</li>
            <li> Great delivery time.</li>

            <li> This works great</li>
            <li> Gave this a try, and while I can&#x27;t say it feels great</li>
            <li> happy that I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> It worked great for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t seem to grip shorter hairs, although I&#x27;m still learning.  </li>
            <li> Works great price for this beauty aid</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to feel great.  </li>

            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> 100% honest!</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome tool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that the best way to use this is to wash your face before using it and after use, be sure to use an astringent.</li>
            <li> good delivery service, great product</li>
            <li> was impeccable a week ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found something so awesome!</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> This will remove hair as stated, but I do not find the process particularly pleasant.  </li>
            <li> and it is great for removing those fine hairs!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for ripping out those fine downy like hairs.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect tool for me for cleaning up those fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews on this product but when I tried it</li>
            <li> She loved it and that&#x27;s all that</li>
            <li> It took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how to get the hair to come out.</li>
            <li> Just throw it in your makeup case and you&#x27;re good to go when traveling.</li>
            <li> good, but need to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> I washed my face and still my face was tingling, but in a good way.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> This does hurt and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of ripping out the hair once you get the hang of how to twist it.  </li>
            <li> I loved the feeling it gave me after using.</li>
            <li> ... I like to think I have  a good tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> I watched the &amp;#34;demo&amp;#34; on Youtube so I had a good idea about how to use the Bellable.  </li>
            <li> This product works just as good as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Did a good job.  </li>
            <li> which was good,.</li>
            <li> This tool is a good way to remove your hairs without shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> I would have loved this product and kept using it</li>
            <li> always good features.</li>
            <li> Loved this thing.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it works really good.  </li>
            <li> but once you get it it should be good.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> A good tool.</li>
            <li> this product is good and has been helping me a lot.</li>
            <li> Sea Breeze is a good one since it contains alcohol.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good an no visible fuzz or hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived today, and to my surprise, I&#x27;m delighted with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Braun and it has been good.  </li>
            <li> any hair removal that pulls the hair from the root will not feel good, no matter what.  </li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> this is so good for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tricky to use,but I feel that one must work with this item to get good results.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s start with the good.  </li>
            <li> But, for the price, this is good.</li>
            <li> In the meantime....it&#x27;s a good thing someone invented tweezers.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> It is good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to have in your hair removal arsenal.  </li>
            <li> but thats it as I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li> I did a fair bit of research and watched the youtube videos before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> and it came in on good time.</li>
            <li> The material is good though.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Works good, does sting in areas you aren&#x27;t used to plucking, but after a couple&lt;br /&gt;weeks</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> After reading through tons of reviews I decided to purchase, and am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I like the Bellabe so much better than waxing!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> ALWAYS make sure to cleanse and close the pores after use!</li>
            <li> I have had this thing for about 7 weeks and have not been able to pull one hair!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I love My Bellabe!</li>
            <li> and I love that it lasts six months to a year!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it removes hair like it says it does, but the pain of pulling hair from your face takes some getting used to!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get better results with scotch tape!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> Plus I don&#x27;t have to bother with, or buy, any more wax!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I received it and it took me about 3 days (30-45 minutes a day) to get a 90% hair free face!!  </li>
            <li> but saw this and decided to give it a try and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> worked great cleaning was easy</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly and it came with great directions....</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A much more pleasant tool to use now.</li>
            <li> The positive about this purchase is that I understand THREADING and found a woman who does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> This is an easy tool to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> Very effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> She looked amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> After using it I was amazed at how smooth and hair-free my face looked, the results were great for having used it once and for 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> A great investment in a smooth face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, it works.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> but the time saved is amazing.  </li>
            <li> it was amazing.</li>
            <li> works amazingly for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing you can watch people do this on video&#x27;s and not grimace in pain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing because hair you can&#x27;t even see will be plucked.</li>
            <li> is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I do wonder if over time the product will lose tension and no longer be effective...</li>
            <li> If you remove hairs on your face at all you should own this.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s the handiest device I own.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it grabs the finer hairs better than the darker thicker hairs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why so many people would say they loved their Bellabe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great as all the reviewers love it, and it did its job</li>
            <li> The ad states \\&quot;Effective.</li>
            <li> Fill up the tub with warm water and bath salts, and relax for a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is effective and inexpensive; however, it can aggravate the skin, and it hurts like a mother.</li>
            <li> It is portable, cost effective and saves me a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> Interesting product, its like a spring, gave it 3 stars because its good but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is effective and seems to remove the hair longer than tweezers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, an effective product and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was compensated for this review but the opinions are completely my own.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To me, it works a great deal better than wax as you are able to remove all of the hair with just this spring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to not have to stand/sit in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li> liked this so well</li>
            <li> I washed my face thoroughly with cleanser and warm water.</li>
            <li> I have picked up some of my own techniques as well.</li>
            <li> kind of...awkward to the face my hair kept getting caught in it...</li>
            <li> and I can do it in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> nicely packaged too.  </li>
            <li> Okay, they did a good job</li>
            <li> skin looks so nice</li>
            <li> This really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was quite impressed with how well this funky wire/spring thing works.  </li>
            <li> Great, great buy and works very well.  </li>
            <li> If your like me, you like anything you own to be &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; be it a hair remover or shoes...</li>
            <li> However, my thoughts and opinions expressed here are 100% my own and honest.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute case which is good too.</li>
            <li> However, it is effective.</li>
            <li> I turned to Amazon to see what kind of a solution I could find.</li>
            <li> It is nice though saves u from paying 20$ at a salon</li>
            <li> There are some parts that it can&#x27;t get and it does kind of hurt.</li>
            <li> After perseverance and reading the instructions again, I found it remarkably effective.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if it would have worked though.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have the grip for that kind of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly effective with pulling out the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Every woman should own one of these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating because I cannot honestly say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; tearing at my face.  </li>
            <li> It kind of hurt.</li>
            <li> Honestly wish I&#x27;d never tried this product, it ruined my face.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as they said--but it just isnt effective</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to try to be kind.  </li>
            <li> Kind of like the springs you find in toys around the battery terminal - but longer and tighter.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel the product is as spectacular as it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> Does not reliably or effectively remove hair at the root .</li>
            <li> So it will very effectively remove fine fuzz.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly easy to use and so effective!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of great reviews and boy, I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> And surprisingly, it pulled very fine hair from my lip area that I wasn&#x27;t really able to see.</li>
            <li> I watched a video from Youtube first, which helped, because frankly, the package directions weren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wax anymore but kept the wax for nose hairs, because it is excellent for that and not slow torture like plucking them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product thanks &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on more flawless, looks smoother, I really can see a difference.</li>
            <li> With so many good reviews I was expecting more.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> After I ordered one, I ordered 3 more and am going to order more!  </li>
            <li> I thought that the &#x27;invisible&#x27; fine hairs would hurt, but those were the easiest, so that&#x27;s a good place to start.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution to an age old problem.</li>
            <li> LOL HAVE FUN...</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the easiest and most effective I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> and the REM is much more effective.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and excellent product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to find a mirror and a good light, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is the most effective and the easiest tool for threading.</li>
            <li> But this is the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is really effective.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a warm cloth to soften the skin and make the hairs come out.</li>
            <li> Since then I have tried so many things to effectively remove hair, it is almost embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I would have to wear my glasses, turn on a bright light, and use a 10X magnification mirror.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the longer the hair, the more effective the product is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Way cool!!</li>
            <li> Not for very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works well!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and takes out a swath of hairs at the root - hairs you don&#x27;t even know you have until the sting - it brings tears to my eyes (which is where some may draw the line but not me!)</li>
            <li> Once you get used to this, it is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend unless for very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Need to figure out a good way to clean it after use.</li>
            <li> Fast, practicaly pain free and priceless!!  </li>
            <li> i love this product very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I experienced a bit of pain - but it gets easier every</li>
            <li> I was looking for an effective, inexpensive way to better remove facial hair and have been very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy at first.</li>
            <li> Product is great - really works!</li>
            <li> It was great at first</li>
            <li> Too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer advises (wisely) that you wash the area before and after using the device, and that you end with a toner--presumably to make sure the pores and hair follicles are clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin does not break out and in fact, feels very smooth and silky after each Bellabe use.</li>
            <li> Takes the hair off our face to make it very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Your technique is very important.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> So easy and effective</li>
            <li> It is nice, but I just wish I can remove the hair inside the springs easily.</li>
            <li> I can deal with that if it is easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> Effective, easy to use and prefer over waxing.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick and I loved buying and ordering from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly blond mostly fine hair and the Bellabe took most of them out!</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;threader&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threading is definitely becoming a more popular way to eliminate hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m really happy with this, it did a good job (sensitive skin), and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such a wonderful, practical effective product!</li>
            <li> Better for coarser hair</li>
            <li> Okay, this thing works too well.  </li>
            <li> It works ok if you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> 10xs better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more confident about bring close to my husband.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies a lot better now also.</li>
            <li> This is a magic wand, it takes out more hair than I knew I had.</li>
            <li> I have used the Bellabe facial hair remover and found it to be an excellent mechanical hair remover.</li>
            <li> We are both pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I bought Bellabe because of the reviews, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It hurts like a mug, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I love these and wish that I had known about them years ago.</li>
            <li> It gets all the hair, even the most stubborn ones, most of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooooo glad I won&#x27;t need to buy the creams anymore.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could manipulate it better to make it work on my chin.  </li>
            <li> , it gets better.</li>
            <li> There is a stinging sensation, but more gentler than wax removal.  </li>
            <li> I went online to the Bellabe site and read more about it.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> This sounded like the perfect item to painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  </li>
            <li> , what was to love about ripping hair out of your skin?</li>
            <li> Also at the jaw line it takes more time with the Bellabe to get those hairs, I think it is the angle.     </li>
            <li> But it does get better.</li>
            <li> Make sure to disinfect before and after with Witch Hazel</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Also, you might love if you do not mind the idea of tapping hairs out of the spring after use---good luck with that.</li>
            <li> On the up side, my face feels really smooth (and warm from the hair</li>
            <li> I am sure the better</li>
            <li> My makeup applies easier and my face looks much better.</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing for 40 years, and I can&#x27;t even feel that any more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I would spend many hours a week tweezing.</li>
            <li> Love the cylindrical cover it comes with too :)</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it accomplishes so much more in the time it would take to go at it with tweezers or waxing.</li>
            <li> This is even better than tweezing because the spring catches hairs I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> The results are long-lasting and I&#x27;m confident I don&#x27;t have hair anyplace on my face where I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> I love this tool and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It smells of cheap metal, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s some kind of nickel-alloy metal</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than waxing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than waxing, it gets everything.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying that once you get used to it, it will be okay.</li>
            <li> I never thought this product would work, but I saw so many favorable reviews, I could not resist.</li>
            <li> Better than a razor.</li>
            <li> I hope they come up with something that can be used on eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> I used it on my upper lip and it worked great!  </li>
            <li> but it gets easier the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but it is honestly better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and I love that I can do it as often as needed, no calling for appointments, etc.  </li>
            <li> You can do it while you are watching your favorite movie.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than tweezers or wax in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> so laser removal is not an option and waxing caused many bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> Ariane Bashimbe   love this item</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE my Bellabe.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take more than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It only took a couple of minutes to get the hang of using it, and the results were awesome.  </li>
            <li> but...it does cost more.</li>
            <li> yeah sure it works  ,</li>
            <li> Then, you are able to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this product, I was able to do all of the hair within minutes without any issues or even the thought of taking a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was eager to give this a try in hopes of being able to retire my tweezers and magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing does, and it gets the job done a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I wonder if a tighter spring would do the job better.</li>
            <li> But no ingrown hairs :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had much better results with Epicare.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have tweezed plenty of times, but this hurt more then tweezing.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing.</li>
            <li> so much better than tweezing...</li>
            <li> I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> and also it could not make sure will those hair come out again</li>
            <li> Tweezers is a better bet or an eppy.  </li>
            <li> I have used my Bellabe for more than a year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than a year</li>
            <li> It just hurts… more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> It works better than anything I have ever used which includes depilatories, friction, trimming, etc.  </li>
            <li> I wish others better success!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> perhaps if you have thicker hair it would work better?</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just order 2 more for friends.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> and it gets out most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Sure beats going to a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It took me about 3 sessions to get all the hair off my face, and there was much more than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it could be any better than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had one before and glad I found them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product works OK.</li>
            <li> Smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> You will feel the hair being removed, the directions say a tingle, I say more than a tingle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truthfully, watching a YouTube on how to use the Bellabe is the most helpful.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure people want to know about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Not all, but most.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does hurt but any hair remover that you can expect to work is going to :)</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this product and viewing a demonstration on Youtube, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I think this is more a comfort tool.</li>
            <li> okay but no miracle.</li>
            <li> You just twist it and watch it remove many hairs in one swipe.  </li>
            <li> I bet the 100 or more dollar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> is the most tender.</li>
            <li> TYVM Amazon, for having this product for sale! :)</li>
            <li> THE TWEEZERS WORK BETTER</li>
            <li> you basically figure out how to use it around the top of the eyebrows, chin, neck etc.</li>
            <li> Yes it nips when removing hair over top lip....</li>
            <li> the more I used it.</li>
            <li> If you want to remove hair off your face stick with threading its way faster and removes alot more</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you learn how to thread your own hair, its cheaper, plenty of online tutorials are available.</li>
            <li> truly love this hair remover.</li>
            <li> love that I can use this to remove hair while I watch tv, ride in the car, etc.</li>
            <li> It worked well, however, I did find going over the areas three times and I kept finding more hairs to pull.</li>
            <li> I get a more matte finish with my makeup by removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know they would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona</li>
            <li> Love the products.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I think this is 100x better then messing with creams or razors.  </li>
            <li> Way better than wax.  </li>
            <li> Okay so I knew it would hurt....</li>
            <li> but like many people I&#x27;m sure don&#x27;t like any product to make them breakout</li>
            <li> But, as others have stated, thicker more stubborn hairs are reluctant to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tweezers work better.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to bleach before I got this, and I can say for sure that I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will stick to tweezing until i find something better.</li>
            <li> I know that most women have peach fuzz, but I looked like a wookie.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair remover alternative!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> not having to duck my head and hide embarrassing hairs makes me a more confident person.</li>
            <li> But this works better.</li>
            <li> Cheaper and more efficient.</li>
            <li> I love the finished product -- way better than wax.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this through snagshout to test and review.</li>
            <li> I like it better than threading.</li>
            <li> Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing and the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> But it does get rid of most of it so the hair isn&#x27;t visible.</li>
            <li> It does the job ok.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this gadget.</li>
            <li> I used NADS for my lip and my eyebrows for many years.  </li>
            <li> - it really works great.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than waxing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a drinker, I recommend doing a shot and putting on some of your most inspiring tunes while you go at it.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this product</li>
            <li> but so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This mostly trims face fuzzies it doesn&#x27;t remove them.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was able to sit and watch TV while using.</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with my Bellabe Facial Hair remover!</li>
            <li> This thingymajiggy is the best invention for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try it one more time.  </li>
            <li> So glad I got this thing.</li>
            <li> I just received this tool and I&#x27;m pleased at how it works.</li>
            <li> Its been two more days</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for a lil more.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things.</li>
            <li> On a whim I decided to try this, and finally am pleased with a hair removal method.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love that there are a variety of colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> If I lose this one, I&#x27;ll pay more for the REM.</li>
            <li> because I want it to work:)</li>
            <li> Granted, most hair-removal does hurt, so take that with a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> It is so much better than using tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It helps to puff up your face anywhere you can to make it more taut; the spring grabs the hair better that way.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to waxing and it works OK.  </li>
            <li> Love Love my bellabe</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work compared to waxing or plucking.</li>
            <li> and you get more hair each roll than just one by tweezer.</li>
            <li> Much better than tweezing.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and it works!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It takes minutes, literally, and it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than the Bellabe.  </li>
            <li> I am hooked for life.  :-)</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange of my unbiased and honest review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> there is more that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> My wife is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the more course hair, but it could be me still getting accustomed to using it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Ok, it hurts...</li>
            <li> I love this roller, it captures all of the hair in</li>
            <li> I guess my one reason for not giving it 5 stars is more an issue with how I thought it would come.</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to speed that up, and you don&#x27;t even really need to park yourself in front of a magnifying mirror forever.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with this</li>
            <li> I would have time to look semi ok again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every now and then I need to use my tweezers to remove a couple of hairs that I wasn&#x27;t able to getwith the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> but now I love having it.</li>
            <li> Some areas hurt more than others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure laser hair removal or maybe something like</li>
            <li> the no no may do a better job.</li>
            <li> stumbled across this product when I was looking into more permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> Do not get this  unless you love pain.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that more people don&#x27;t use this tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a magic tweezer/epilator.</li>
            <li> Hopefully with more practice I can get the more stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair product remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done waxing/threading for years now and couldn&#x27;t even use this for more than a couple &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; before my eyes started watering</li>
            <li> Mostly seems to grab the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Not too sure yet about the product yet.</li>
            <li> which is where I am most prone to get them).</li>
            <li> But, for the most part, it works much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they were always there</li>
            <li> nothing more</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this instead of NoNo</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and watch the remover leave your face hairless and smooth!</li>
            <li> That way the hairs will grow out and better hair removal will be achieved.</li>
            <li> This also helps the hairs come out even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bellabe for many years now.</li>
            <li> Ok, it is not my favorite tool for hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I have not been able to figure that one out.  </li>
            <li> But I find I still pull out my tweezers most often.  </li>
            <li> The best way to get rid of unwanted facial hair at a fraction...price.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one satisfied customer</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and tried this.</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> And like others say the more you use it the more you do get used to it.  </li>
            <li> It better just to wax.</li>
            <li> I got my product for free by giving an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> I have so much more confidence now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had such an awesome experience when dealing with customer service in my life.</li>
            <li> just can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this company.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much better than getting your face waxed and dealing with breakouts...not to mention the expense.</li>
            <li> it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> I love this spring thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something that removed more than just upper-lip hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I paid what I did</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a smooth and silky face for the rest of your life!</li>
            <li> If you have light-colored facial hair, you can&#x27;t use a laser, so this is a perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Works better than I had hoped .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> muaahahahaahaha :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> In fact, shaving gives me more skin irritation than this</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably have to shave most of it and remove the rest in patches</li>
            <li> It takes longer and more hairs come out at one time.</li>
            <li> What a FABULOUS tool!</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to say how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for chin, upper lip and face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than stringing but just keep in mind, it requires both hands.</li>
            <li> Would be better to get a wider one to get more area</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your face before and after use this thing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> So smooth!  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; was caused by taking a blood pressure medicine which made the hair more prevalent.  </li>
            <li> must have for every women, love this product</li>
            <li> but I am glad I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the best as a control-hair removal product.  </li>
            <li> ; I now wonder how many of those were working for Bellabe.</li>
            <li> I think the epilator hurts more on my legs than this product does on my face.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it and was amazed at how it worked.</li>
            <li> and I have been dealing with it in many ways</li>
            <li> Where hair is longer, jaw or cheeks, it seems to do OK.</li>
            <li> I found the cleaner you keep it, the better it works.</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase 2 more</li>
            <li> the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> I practiced many times, since I know you need to &amp;</li>
            <li> Much better than waxing, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> and i love it already.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Like many others have posted,this thingie works and I WISH I HAD purchased  it a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> whatever reasons,post menopause maybe,my skin texture became coarse looking and a fine growth of hair /peach fuzz appeared seemingly in every enlarged pore--an omg moment !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved this right away.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it is very easy to use and it removes hair quick and easy!  </li>
            <li> For me, this is the best solution I have found to my facial hair, it does a much better job that the electric epilador, gets all the fine hair and that one stray hair.  </li>
            <li> I must say that I am super pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This product was pretty good on my suborn hairs.</li>
            <li> And, it did not feel good at first.</li>
            <li> Now I feel more confident I can enjoy life more than before.</li>
            <li> I am SO EXCITED about this product!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the results!!</li>
            <li> The bellabe is really good at getting those fine tine hairs you can&#x27;t see and plucks them right out, root and all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me more than two attempts to master the technique - it is easy to do.</li>
            <li> Removing the hairs means I can get that clingy waterproof sunscreen off more easily.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use and gets most of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, travels well as it fits into most makeup bags and almost painless.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but it sure isn&#x27;t a comfortable procedure.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a okay product if you are removing fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do have to use this product a once every week or week and a half vs. every three weeks at the salon, but the convenience of doing this when I want is priceless, plus the money I&#x27;m saving makes me feel a lot better. :-)</li>
            <li> but clean well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this super affordable device works!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is easy to use, and easy to take with me on trips.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to store away or carry with me, and my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of twisting the right way on the ends of the device, it removes the hair and leaves your face feeling smooth!!  </li>
            <li> At my age i have a lot of facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; and for that the Bellable does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s important to know that some areas of the face are just much more</li>
            <li> I look cleaner, neater and more smooth.</li>
            <li> I love how it removed all of my peach fuzz and let my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have PCOS, are prone to cysts, or have sensitive skin, I greatly caution you against using this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s kind of fun, but that could be just me.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GOOD AND DOES TAKE ALL HAIR AWAY FROM THE ROOT, BUT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME.</li>
            <li> It works really well, surprisingly.  </li>
            <li> took a chance on this (I&#x27;m willing to spend about $20 to try stuff out) and it worked great, right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Certainly faster than shaving or plucking and more cost effective than waxing.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t hurt, it actually felt good!</li>
            <li> Quick, easy!</li>
            <li> I have tried every other way to remove the hair from my face and this works the best of them all!!!  </li>
            <li> I think I was mostly upset because I was so excited to try the Bellabe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bellabe is sturdy and easily controlled.  </li>

            <li> Really, it does work marvelously, but if you have obnoxiously sensitive skin</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Bellabe for close to two months and most days I feel it leaves my face smooth and hair free,  </li>
            <li> It does a really great job and the effects last quite awhile, it&#x27;s definitely better than plucking with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought this was easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, although there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> This product works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I found this easy to figure out how to use.</li>
            <li> Once you use it, you&#x27;ll see how easy it is to maneuver for faster threading.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, affordable and you can do it in the privacy of your home.</li>
            <li> easy to use and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and compact.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe, according to the reviews, looked like it might be the answer to my problems with an easy, at-home care system, but it was not.</li>
            <li> Bellabe is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure that your skin is clean and moisturized</li>
            <li> Using the Bellabe though really is easy</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> it looked easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just keep looking for a removal cream that works &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave burns on my face (that&#x27;s not too easy to do though).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the front part which is easy anyways</li>
            <li> The end pieces are rubber, which make holding the spring easy.</li>
            <li> It easy to use and it a lot faster than tweezers..</li>
            <li> great product will order more in the future</li>
            <li> I just had to do this one because I was so amazed at how well it works and how easy it is.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WOW, this works GREAT and FAST!!!</li>
            <li> Once I turned the handles the RIGHT way :), it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and this one is by far the most effective yet.</li>
            <li> It does a good job along side of face (like in the picture) or above the lip, but where I need it the most, along curve of chin where hair is more bristly, it won&#x27;t grab.  </li>
            <li> This product is super easy to use and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, and so quick, I can even use it while I&#x27;m doing something else -- saving me even more time.  </li>
            <li> The results are well worth the very quick pain you feel, believe me!</li>
            <li> It works perfect to remove the fine down hairs as well as the ones I can see.</li>
            <li> : It says the Bellabe is good for a year or so, and that after that you should get a new one.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m expecting this item to pull too fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> but once u get used to the pain, u are fine...</li>
            <li> The fine vellous hair on my face had to go.</li>
            <li> Did under my brows which have permanent makeup, but I like that it removed the fine peach fuzz hair that shows up in my pearly eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This product will easily work for people like me (light peach fuzz) to people who are on the darker end of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> Remember to TWIST the remover after bending it and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I just have that baby fine</li>
            <li> so I apply an ice pack afterwards and its fine after a minute or two</li>
            <li> really fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe is that it removed all of the hair including the baby fine ones which my epilator never removed or couldn&#x27;t remove.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine tool.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> That night, I continued with the chin and some fine downey hair on the lower jaw area.  </li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> It does take out the fine hair.</li>
            <li> It appears to grip even fine hairs on the skin and extracts them without pain.</li>
            <li> Some hairs wouldn&#x27;t pull out at all, maybe it has something to do with how fine my hair is.</li>
            <li> It did hurt more the first time I used it, but the pain is getting more tolerable.</li>
            <li> this does not remove fine fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> Useful and pretty good results</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone with fine hairs like mine.</li>
            <li> This did not have the ability to grasp fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly and discreetly too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;so would rather use a shaver which does a better job and is quick</li>
            <li> However, it is a quick &#x27;Ouch&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I love this quick touch up hair removing product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick!</li>
            <li> but it is super!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much you can see the hair but more like a shadow the very fine hair creates.  </li>
            <li> and it was good for the first couple of tweezings, but honestly, I think using a tweezer is more effective and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> Whole face- smooth!!</li>
            <li> It more than paid for itself on the very first use.</li>
            <li> My wife said the product works good and it arrived a day early!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast, effective, saves me time and money not having to get waxed.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best for all the fine little hairs.  </li>
            <li> Now I can see my smooth skin instead of those fine, baby hairs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything was fine and my skin felt smooth.</li>
            <li> It takes some doing to get the hang of it, but it does exactly what it claims and very easily.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This little doo dad is awesome.</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome I can feel and see it pulling my little peach fuzz out not one by one either like twizzers</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of this little device, it does the job wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> I love this product-very easy to use and not very painful.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge money saver.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t accurately get the eyebrow hairs with this tool.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great solution for hair removal and a big time saver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it does work.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling as smooth as silk (almost).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, too.</li>
            <li> Its cheap too...</li>
            <li> It does leave your face baby&#x27;s butt smooth, and  sometimes I still have to pluck one of the coarser hairs.  </li>
            <li> Something monotone like a movie will calm you better than a show with commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks smooth.</li>
            <li> It works great on my upper lip tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product overall.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me I found the Bellabe and tried it.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results and now only spend 20 mins a week removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> The results are a smooth hairless face.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth the money and safe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean</li>
            <li> A great way to get rid of hair above the lip and on the chin.</li>
            <li> It seems sturdy and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is</li>
            <li> They work very well nice item.</li>
            <li> your face is so smooth I broke out in tears</li>
            <li> and i get a lot of light hair on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly happy I went with this rather than a cream, will definitely be recommending this product!</li>
            <li> What a difference and so much cheaper and effective than waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I removed the lip hair (which wasn&#x27;t comfortable, but I hiked up my big-girl pants and just DID IT.</li>
            <li> This bellabe Facial Hair Remover works great.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no way a spring is worth more.</li>
            <li> This cheap product basically rips the hair out of your face.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it does do a really great job of removing any unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li> I got it today, and now my face is almost completely smooth.</li>
            <li> If you want to feel really smooth (I smoothed on face cream after I was finished</li>
            <li> and I now can&#x27;t believe just how smooth my skin feels)</li>
            <li> Bellabe is lighter in weight,  too light for my preference.  </li>
            <li> I primarily got this to take care of my sideburns since they seem to be getting a bit out of control.</li>
            <li> What I wanted to remove was from my jawline and on my cheeks--fine light hair.</li>
            <li> So, for me.. works great all over the face.. the upper lip?</li>
            <li> The videos I&#x27;ve watched on YouTube say your face can be smooth in a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product, actually works and unlike others, it did not hurt.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m still learning how to use properly, but I&#x27;ve experienced some prickly stubble.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m a fan and happy with this decidedly unsexy but necessary purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for upper lip hair removal</li>
            <li> This item is great because it pulls the multiple hairs out at the root like waxing and unlike a razor</li>
            <li> this is so simple and works sooo great.  </li>
            <li> and my face is smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> No redness but don&#x27;t expect it to be pain free</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and it ssems my hair growth has slowed.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and no irritation at all from using.  </li>
            <li> I have used it primarily on my chin.  </li>
            <li> However, sometimes they&#x27;ll come in darker than I&#x27;m comfortable with</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it?  </li>
            <li> It is painless, fast and effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a tube with detailed use and care instructions</li>
            <li> Also, it delivers - the hair is gone, and the skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe is easy to clean and makes no messes.</li>
            <li> works great on upper lip, chin, cheeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and makeup is easier to apply.</li>
            <li> only takes one time to see how great of a product this is.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of removing hair, especially on the sides of the lip.  </li>
            <li> recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> This is so much quicker than having to warm the wax.  </li>
            <li> I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend watching tv while I was using it and was completely comfortable.</li>
            <li> because THAT is precisely what this product is, a cheap coiled spring.</li>
            <li> I would beware of the cheap china knock-offs.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on removing the smallest of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> importantly, it beats the pants off waxing/shaving/bleaching or anything else.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe facial hair threader works great (fast, easy-to-use, effective, inexpensive, virtually painless for me).  </li>
            <li> My skin stays smooth.  </li>
            <li> I will keep trying and update my review as I see fit.</li>
            <li> I am now free to use any makeup I please.</li>
            <li> Liked much by my wife.</li>
            <li> It kept my face smooth and hairless.</li>
            <li> and I refuse to use waxing creams because those burn and damage skin over time, and being as fair and sensitive as I was</li>
            <li> is low but waxing is the best option as it is fast and removes hair in one go.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellable Facial Hair Remover for and awesome product.  </li>
            <li> While the hair removal is effective, the ensuing female circumcision was almost as effective.  </li>
            <li> Which is kind of frustrating because I would except excellent quality when spending $15 on a spring....</li>
            <li> I laughed out loud how I was so duped to buy this thing -</li>
            <li> I have had no problem with irritation (redhead, sensitive skin) and it is so nice to be able to use it whenever I want.....</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellabe for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> For people who don&#x27;t get along with the instruction sheet well and don&#x27;t have a very good right and left hand co-ordination, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and very fast and even better</li>
            <li> Thinner hairs are a bit more tricky, but once you get them at the right angle, it gets those too.</li>
            <li> have fair, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would cause swelling or severe redness, but was excited when neither happened.</li>
            <li> but once you do, this is a simple and very effective device.</li>
            <li> This is not something that is very exciting to me.</li>
            <li> This will be very useful</li>
            <li> A very handy DIY and a reliable solution to facial hair removal!</li>
            <li> -15-12&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few months now and the results are fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a few more to always have!!!</li>
            <li> It works fine, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> While it does not do well on  course hair, it removes all of the finer hairs on my face for a smooth clean look.  </li>
            <li> When you are finished, just spritz the Bellabe with alcohol to keep it clean and oil free and store in the given container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and</li>
            <li> I was looking for something quick and easy I could use at home.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, quick, easy to use, removes hair from root</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Using the Bellabe is super easy once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It is safe, fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to look in the mirror to use it; I keep handy and use it frequently.</li>
            <li> This is a unique hair removing system for the face.  </li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased, the hair was pulled from the roots and has not returned.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying so many different items and products to rid myself of that pesky facial hair, I am finally happy with something!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> I could get both the super fine and the courser hairs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure how to use it or getting the best results, there are videos online you can watch.</li>
            <li> super fine-</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t catch ONE hair, and I am pretty sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> i like parrissa hot wax way better.</li>
            <li> But it does work, but it takes practice and is not all that user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I rated these higher because for the most part you don&#x27;t need to go around mustachioed.</li>
            <li> I even think this thing is fun!</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts but it is sooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Bellabe.  </li>
            <li> In my 10+ years of purchasing on Amazon, I have never found a product I was so excited about that made me want to write a review the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Still worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> But I did it all, and the next day, I was pleased because my skin felt smoother and my makeup went on better and looked better.</li>
            <li> This is a really unique item.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll get use to it over the period.  </li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and of course I was excited to see if it worked but not looking forward to the pain.  </li>
            <li> But I was so excited that something was happening</li>
            <li> But the discomfort is minor and the results great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off I am an African American woman aged 26, I was 25 when I bought this product, I am a healthy and beautiful woman with great skin (no acne or anything!)</li>
            <li> I will warn you, it hurts like hell at first, but the more often you use it,</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best facial hair removals so far!</li>
            <li> Pretty painless and safe.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it more than the first time.</li>
            <li> , I have found that the discomfort is WELL WORTH IT in the end!</li>
            <li> With pretty plastic handles on the end :)</li>
            <li> not as user friendly as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Love it, really works!</li>
            <li> Mostly good for fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> so when I was offered this little device I was more than happy to try it</li>
            <li> I was able to remove a lot of fine facial hair on my face very easily.  </li>
            <li> Having this little gadget is great because it&#x27;s easy to travel with and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The face hair remover is so great for women, even my little sister loves to show her clean lovable face.</li>
            <li> I clean mine before I use it and use a toning acne product on my skin after.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kept clean between uses</li>
            <li> No matter how clean I keep my Bellabe, no matter how clean I keep my face, and</li>
            <li> I have tried all the tricks of the hair removal trade and must say this is by far the best facial hair remover ever.</li>
            <li> And then I was only able to use it effectively 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li> The spring eventually does stop grabbing hair as effectively, but you get enough usage out of it to more than cover the cost.</li>
            <li> Realistically, I am thrilled to have the perfect answer to an ongoing, and highly irritating, problem!</li>
            <li> , also, it speaks the truth when it tells you to clean your face thoroughly before and after you use it, because you WILL break out if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Have had it for a year and clean it with a spray of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Now I can remove facial hair safely in the comfort of my own home without having to pay for threading again .</li>
            <li> I did notice I break out if I don&#x27;t clean my face after.</li>
            <li> skin has to be clean of any oils or the coil won&#x27;t catch the hair.  </li>
            <li> Read the instructions and tips, they tell you the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s and how to clean it.</li>
            <li> My tips are:  Get a clean, unused toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> With the remaining hand, take the clean toothbrush and brush the spring out on all sides.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to know what it was since most of the reviews were good</li>
            <li> It was also suggested that I clean the Bellabe each time with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> fabulous, quick and clean alternative to wax.</li>
            <li> But it does the job for a clean finish.  </li>
            <li> I used to use creams and bleaches, but after a while, my skin got more and more sensitive to using them</li>
            <li> Just be sure your head hair is completely out of the way :)</li>
            <li> It does hurt more so the first time because more hair is being removed at once, but, it is very time saving.  </li>
            <li> the skin around eyes are more sensitive, so it would be better to stick to a nice old pair of tweezers and tackle on hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very smooth and is so much faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these exact products elsewhere, and as much as I dislike the epilator (because it hurts), I love it!  </li>
            <li> It really works well on the chin and on side of your face (without pain) and can very quickly leave you smooth hair free.  </li>
            <li> yank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find that holding it at certain angles pulls the hair better.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it most certainly does.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this little gizmo is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> what once worked wonderfully now it&#x27;s hard to get it to work at all</li>
            <li> and I was super excited it didn&#x27;t hurt,</li>
            <li> Once you get the motion down, it is very handy and relatively easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I actually had tears coming from my eyes, but I persisted because I knew if I could get through it, the results would be good and each time it would get easier.</li>
            <li> , it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out, but this tool is more gentle than I</li>
            <li> It works OK, but sometimes leaves hairs under the chin that I can&#x27;t see very well.</li>
            <li> All of that has been true for me.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I had to buy another one.  </li>
            <li> This quite surprised me honestly.</li>
            <li> not really painful</li>
            <li> Way more than I even realized were there, really.</li>
            <li> But this is not painful.</li>
            <li> Good for removal of peach fuzz not slightly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll have to go over the area many times, doesn&#x27;t really grasp.</li>
            <li> it felt good to have that abhored facial hair pulled up by this spring!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like I was ripping out a full on mustache.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I do not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth it for a hair - free face.  </li>
            <li> It still hurts more than waxing but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> SOOOO much faster than plucking and way better than waxing, IMO.  </li>
            <li> And on top of that all, the pain that went along with it was almost too much to handle.</li>
            <li> so I thought this will be good at work and while in front of the TV, but there just does not seem to be the leverage to actually pull what it might grab.  </li>
            <li> Bellabe sounded like a dream come true, and, feeling optimistic, I ordered the two-pack.</li>
            <li> I love to tell my friends about Bellabe and highly recommend it to them!</li>
            <li> Product works effectively thus far.  </li>
            <li> The best facial hair remover ever, the hair does not grow back as quick as waxing,and does a fine job on that &amp;#34;peach</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not painful to use&lt;</li>
            <li> The whole time I use it, I think &amp;#34;Beauty is pain, beauty is pain!&amp;#34; but I wish it worked better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got thick rogue hairs to contend with, then tweezers will still be your best bet.  </li>
            <li> Age and hormones gifted me (thank you so much) with never-before peach fuzz on both cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on more course chin hair.</li>
            <li> and they work a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this product shortly after me and she has also loved the results.</li>
            <li> If you are good at following instructions, then you can challenge yourself.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that it does a good job on some places, for example the upper lip, &amp;</li>
            <li> a back up pair of tweezers is a good idea for me.</li>
            <li> or if it came with numbing solution (not a bad idea).</li>
            <li> Not bad though</li>
            <li> But after you get use to it it is not bad.  </li>
            <li> But not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did have a lil redness but not bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> This took some time to get used to - first making sure it goes in the right direction and also bending it just so.  </li>
            <li> Bellabe is simple, easy and effective.</li>
            <li> It did everything I hoped it would and more, and there are no negative effects on your face (lightening, scarring, pulling, etc.)!</li>
            <li> I love that I use Bellabe as part of my makeup routine in the morning, and my skin is very soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing makeup, as it seemed to just emphasize the hair, and never seemed to look right.  </li>
            <li> My best recommendation is to do a little bit at a time--don&#x27;t try and do a large area at one time.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;d recommend it, but I think I&#x27;ll try the easy treading tool Amazon sells and see how that works at consistently pulling hairs out by the roots...</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, but isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks - either that or</li>
            <li> not that easy to use at first either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this thing and feel all excited that my face is so smooth and pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> The remover is easy to use with just a bit of practice, and possibly does a much better job on hair that is a bit longer or perhaps not so fine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this very inexpensive little &amp;#34;beauty tool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But once your eyes stop tearing and your breathing returns to a normal pace, you realize this is actually very fast an effective tool.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon, seriously.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, and it does miss a few of the finer ones but it gets a majority of the more visible kind.</li>
            <li> The best part of all -- I was done in less than 15 minutes and my face and neck feels totally smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and it does the job quickly and practically painlessly.  </li>
            <li> Tweezing, but, quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the quick ripping of the hair out that causes some trauma to the skin?</li>
            <li> If you are looking for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> Just be patient.for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> but I quickly realized that it is not something that I plan on buying again.  </li>
            <li> You can actually see the hairs being pulled and leaving the skin smooth and there was no irritation on my skin and no breakouts which I really liked.</li>
            <li> you know, like you rip off a band-aid quick just to have it over with).</li>
            <li> When using this tool I wash with warm water before and after, then use a light non pore clogging oil such as the ones mentioned.</li>
            <li> will make a quick comment on the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ok, so I will admit to having a low pain threshold to start, but after reading so many reviews I decided to give it a try as I am now discovering unwanted hairs since I&#x27;ve hit 40.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very simple device, but sometimes simple is best.</li>
            <li> A quick way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> Just do it quick.</li>
            <li> Waxing hurts but it is over quickly.</li>
            <li> but I watched a quick YouTube tutorial and had no problem.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I find tweezers to be a lot more of a tear jerker than this particular system.  </li>
            <li> favorite thing about this particular device is the options you have.  </li>
            <li> but it gets 90% of them and quickly.  </li>
            <li> They quickly replied and suggested I use witch hazel before and after using Bellabe.</li>
            <li> So the quick rundown is:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I can really quickly touch up at home whenever I want.</li>
            <li> It remove chin hair quickly.</li>
            <li> I just got the Bellabe in the mail today and was so excited I ran to use it right away.  </li>
            <li> I just used it today for the first time, and after a quick use I can feel how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> As another woman with facial hair issues, I have searched for many years for something that is effective, painless, fast, and produces long-lasting results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very much like having threading done by a pro!</li>
            <li> Overall though, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, I got results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and only wish I knew about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure but I had a rash for a long time until I stopped using this for good.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing in the long run.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t clean it with alcohol, I did that with my old one at one point</li>
            <li> I think if you have PCOS, this product would be great combined with Vaniqua (a Rx cream that slows down hair growth) and balancing out your hormones with weight loss and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, i can live with the pain.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it really removs the hair</li>
            <li> worked fast takes a min to get the hang of it then its easy as pie.</li>
            <li> First of all, cleanse your fair, whenever you pull the facial hair out by its roots, you are prone to infection if your skin has makeup or any impurities on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take my word, it is completely worth the quick tugs and tingles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I loved it the first or second time</li>
            <li> The coil is very flexible and bends easily to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use - it really &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; and removes even the finest hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was fast and easy, and the included instructions were no problem to follow.</li>
            <li> The skin is very sensitive here and pulling many hairs can sting.  </li>
            <li> This works great except on coarse black hairs - did not remove but otherwise love it!</li>
            <li> So I decided to search here on Amazon for any other hair removal options and I found this amazing product!</li>
            <li> It really works!!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s stellar!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like tweezing only getting many more hairs in one rolling pull.</li>
            <li> You kind of get used to it after a minute though - kind of like you get used to the pain of tweezing after the first few plucks</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> On first try it worked so WELL!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> try it - its better than paying $$ for frequent threading!</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit at first, but it&#x27;s a lot faster then tweezing!</li>
            <li> Oh yes, I had my share of a scabstache, you know when the hot wax is ripped off and takes some of the skin!  </li>
            <li> Its amazing how something so small can be so effective and useful.  </li>
            <li> I should have known that pulling the hair by the roots from the skin on my upper lip was not going to feel nice, to put it mildly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive, highly effective, and quick way to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> By removing my facial hair I can get the sunscreen off much more easily now.</li>
            <li> It removes unwanted facial hair quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li> I was able to remove all my unwanted hair in less than 10 minutes in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> This tiny little spring does the job wonderfully and was super cheap.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t really pull the hair from the root but cut it off.  </li>
            <li> Would be great if it was a little sturdier.</li>
            <li> Works great if u can tolerate a little pain.</li>
            <li> so this little tool is a godsend compared to anything else I used, works great on the chin, basically everywhere....</li>
            <li> Great little tool.</li>
            <li> However, for me it only grabs the fine hairs and not the more course hairs.</li>
            <li> I believe it does a fine job on most facial hair on the chin,where I used it.</li>
            <li> I think perhaps most of my facial hair is too fine for the spring to grab it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine and blonde that it&#x27;s virtually invisible, but I can feel it when I touch my face, and if I can feel it, anyone else touching my face can, too.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and very effective in removing the facial hairs on the upper lip and chin area.  </li>
            <li> The product is super easy to use and it removed all the fine fuzzy hair on my upper lip and chin area quickly and thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I managed to get most the hair off my chin - takes all the little light ones and most of the thicker ones too.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I&#x27;m tweezing and it&#x27;s faster &amp; more effective than waxing because if it misses a few hairs I roll it over the area again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being in a calm state of mind before you start will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this product prior to buying it and found it to be amazing.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing how different my makeup goes on without all of that fuzz.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool to remove facial hair!  </li>
            <li> Removing all that hair really helps my makeup go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I used Witch Hazel to calm the skin redness when I was finished.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal.</li>
            <li> It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal.</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> Love it, has a tingle, but it made my skin so soft after one use.</li>
            <li> buy this bellebe product, it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, a washcloth or tissue wrapped around the handles provide enough protection that I&#x27;m able to use this as I wish.</li>
            <li> Still, the product is easy to use and does a decent job.</li>
            <li> but I used to just tweeze as that was the only free, and hassle free technique I knew until I came across this tool!  </li>
            <li> The best advice I have is to really play around with the Bellabe, using different techniques on different parts of the face.</li>
            <li> I will need to get used to it a bit better, couldn&#x27;t do my whole face in one sitting but expect it to go better in the next sitting.</li>
            <li> it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It is a simple and effective way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s something I think is quite useful.</li>
            <li> This has just been so handy to have for removal of the stray facial  and neck hairs and peach fuzz ...</li>
            <li> soo worth it.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled that I found Bellabe and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise it for sideburns or more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday, and so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is something that I cannot utilize on a frequent basis, its better for every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and effective.</li>
            <li> thought it&#x27;d be worth the pain</li>
            <li> My nieces and I tried this product I found it painless while they were more sensitive to it and had to force themselves to endure.</li>
            <li> looks far more smoother than when the hair was there.</li>
            <li> It hurts, it works, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was given enough this product to test and return an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> You just twist it as you move it back and forth over your face, and it&#x27;s extremely effective at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> The hairs hurt while they are being pulled out but the pain is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> my husband, who rarely notices any cosmetic improvement I&#x27;ve made, asked that evening &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, it is so worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I am usually a total klutz with tools of any kind.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, it was actually fun ...</li>
            <li> I know, how fun can it be to rip your unwanted hair out by the roots?</li>
            <li> Simple product and does the job quite effectively.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the $14</li>
            <li> So worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> I still have not had a lot of success with it.</li>
            <li> but i guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> Truly worth $15.</li>
            <li> and it sure did make my eyes water using it in a sensitive area</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things, professional waxing, over the counter waxing, bleaching.</li>
            <li> Worth buying</li>
            <li> Back to the drawing board in search of something that really works for those of us that aren&#x27;t fair haired.  </li>
            <li> it makes the momentary torture worth while.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews</li>
            <li> Worth it if you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the area around my mouth is more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful but not quite as useful as I wish it were.</li>
            <li> My evaluation is that if you have waxed your lip/chin area before and survived, then this product is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s worth it to save money.</li>
            <li> That area is more sensitive for me.</li>
            <li> This tool is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> At $15.00 it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> but I decided the end result would be worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the price and not worrying about running out of a cream or wax remover.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Felt the price was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on removing all the hair (started using it yesterday), but I think it will be worth the pain and</li>
            <li> Simple to use and effective -</li>
            <li> For me, the fact that I can use this as needed and without doing damage to my skin, makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> I just received mine and went right to work with it on my little mustache, lol.</li>
            <li> I sort of panicked because I thought I had an allergic reaction but the 2 pimples appeared right under my nose area which is the most sensitive.</li>
            <li> It may be a different experience for someone who is more familiar using this method for hair removal.</li>
            <li> It is quick, and I control exactly where I want the hair to come off.  </li>
            <li> but your face will de-sensitize pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Its not big, which makes it easy to carry with you and its also easy to use.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for much regrowth to use it, and it is just as effective as waxing or threading but insanely less costly and more convenient than going for a professional service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it 1 day, but it certainly is quite easy to get the hang of, and works much better for me than waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> right now I look as if I am a teenager with severe acne.</li>
            <li> just right in order to remove the hair from the roots.  </li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> I saw a infomercial on TV while visiting my mom and immediately wished I had it right then and</li>
            <li> I broke out right after using it and that never happens with tweezing.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR EYEBROWS, says so right on the package</li>
            <li> Oh this strips off the hair all right.</li>
            <li> no one in their right mind would put themselves through it.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you will go to your mother/sister/friend and say: OMG you have to try this thing!&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve, but once you get the twist just right</li>
            <li> And I can go right out</li>
            <li> no gain right?</li>
            <li> Worked right out of package.  </li>
            <li> You just have to do it right or will break the hair without pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and used it right away</li>
            <li> After one use I was used to it right away.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> And the price is definitely right.  </li>
            <li> It works but need to practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> so you know how to get the technique right.  </li>
            <li> right or else</li>
            <li> price was right</li>
            <li> I just received my Bellabe in the mail today and used in right away.  </li>
            <li> On any given day, I&#x27;m pretty much hair free.</li>
            <li> One just thinks of a pleasant subject and all the discomfort goes away.</li>
            <li> First as a teen, I noticed some hairs appearing when I didn&#x27;t want them to appear, might be nice for the boys but</li>
            <li> and I am more interested in thinning my mustache as opposed to completely removing it.</li>
            <li> Not painful at all (and obviously quite satisfying).</li>
            <li> It was really great with the small, fine hairs though, which is exactly what I was hoping for, since using the Epilady on my face was absolute torture.  </li>
            <li> :) Just a tiny sting, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> but I give full credit to the genius who invented this gadget for pure creativity and marketing.</li>
            <li> The acne has gone down a bit--but I now have marks and feel incredibly self conscious going anywhere considering my face</li>
            <li> Okay, Here is a MAJOR  warning for this product and products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is only good for the fine hairs above your lip.</li>
            <li> The only thing I found accurate in the manual, is that it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to point out that tweezing is probably one of the best solutions when it comes to facial hair because it gets the hairs at the root, meaning this wear and tear on the follicle will begin to damage it, and thus, result in less growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to point out that tweezing is probably one of the best solutions when it comes to facial hair because it gets the hairs at the root, meaning this wear and tear on the follicle will begin to damage it, and thus, result in less growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bellabe for a few months and have found it to be easy and effective for me.  </li>
            <li> It was fast and easy and did what it promised with no messy clean up.  </li>
            <li> I was able to clear most of my facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I still on occasion will get this out to use, but it is pretty rare.  </li>
            <li> and it was very hard to get rid of but now with bellabe hair removing is so much faster easier and best of all cleaner!</li>
            <li> Never worked on me, it exfoliated my skin and in certain spots on the face made it more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have some very fine hair on my jaw and above my lip area.  </li>
            <li> Essential and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> It works well enough on very fine hair</li>
            <li> Who would have thought this little tool would achieve such great results!</li>
            <li> I chose Bellabe even though there were fair cheaper options because honestly, when it comes to my face, I can spare the few extra dollars to get a product thats on the higher end of the spectrum and won&#x27;t take a month to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might love this product if: you&#x27;re good at patting your head with one hand, rubbing your belly in circular motions with the other hand, and jumping rope---all at the same time.</li>
            <li> this is really worth a try but the price is too much but is really worth it and help you remove all your hair from your face but don&#x27;t try your eyebrows&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my chin, cheeks and lip area, but was not precise enough for my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a great product, and I would purchase another one, if something happened to my current Bellabe.</li>
            <li> It not only cleans the spring, it works better when fresh.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have had no problems at all with my skin reacting (which it would surely do with a hot wax or a peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to go over my face several times today to get everything, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with every first time user.  </li>
            <li> It probably works great for younger people, but I will say that it did work well enough for me to have somewhat smoother skin</li>
            <li> Sometime I get my eye brows waxed, but my skin is sensitive and burns easily.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re in our 40&#x27;s, and this item seems desiged to help remove the inevitable peach fuzz and occasional wayward hair that can start to appear around this age, to the great dismay of the woman who experiences it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Bellabe grabbed all the hairs except for the very shortest, finest ones, which gives a much more natural appearance.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, hair removal is not comfortable, but the Bellabe is a wonderful, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I am sure this isn&#x27;t for everyone, but if you can muscle through the initial pain, the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if someone has long &amp; fine hair that might work I don&#x27;t know, but otherwise a tweezer is a whole lot better in every way.</li>
            <li> This device works very well for me and now that I&#x27;m used to it, the pain is not nearly as bad as the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, and quickly.</li>
            <li> Tweezee is good but my upper lip area was way too sensitive for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied but after a few days, I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The hairs are not small and light like they</li>
            <li> All the directions for use are on the label of the container (which was super clean and nicely packaged), and there&#x27;s also a small information sheet on cleaning the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> Using tweezers simply doesn&#x27;t do it for me anymore, too many stray hairs that I don&#x27;t always see right away.</li>
            <li> It takes no time at all, removes hair pretty much without exception, and it does not require a mirror or special glasses and light to see hair that my old eyes cannot focus on.  </li>
            <li> Thankyou so very much</li>
            <li> but I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, which is always a plus!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very  light colored hair above my lip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far more effective than waxing, and without the mess, discomfort, or skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I just wipe with a little astringent after and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Get good at the technique of twirling this little gem</li>
            <li> Seriously, it is now nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of other solutions, including Nair and waxing, to my embarrassing dark-ish upper lip hair and after only a couple of days of owning this I can say with confidence that this is the best method available, in terms of return value for its cost.</li>
            <li> It can cover a large area of longer hairs, pretty much as useful for hair removal as duct tape placed onto and ripped off of hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the chin and cheek areas but no matter how hard I try</li>
            <li> This little tool does a great job of getting all the light hairs around my chin and that upper lip area.</li>
            <li> I have a little more peach fuzz than most women and this thing really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, as it seemed so much more convenient and cheaper than buying those little waxing kits or going to have threading</li>
            <li> I recieved this at a free/discounted price for an honest revie, and i must say, i love it, of course its a little painful but works great :-)</li>
            <li> but it works really well!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this miracle wand!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hurts so at first</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something like the NoNo or waxing for the first time and then using this thing to keep any regrowth under control.</li>
            <li> Bellabe can cause a breakout, but it doesn&#x27;t if I use restraint, use it only where it&#x27;s most needed, 1 or 2 rolls over, and not get overeager and pull out every bit of hair I can find.</li>
            <li> FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ME, BUT</li>
            <li> Above my lip area bothers me the most.  </li>
            <li> The first time will hurt like no one&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t stop using it because it really worked!  </li>
            <li> I love it and am on my 3rd one!</li>
            <li> That was funny.</li>
            <li> I love the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal.</li>
            <li> It stings a lot (no worse than waxing), but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit at first.</li>
            <li> I found Bellabe because I looked up hair threading and decided that for $15 I was willing to give it a go.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it hurt.</li>
            <li> The leaning curve on using this takes just a minute or two and the results are stellar.</li>
            <li> The thing that bugs me the most is that the hair starts growing back in before the pimples have even fully cleared!</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know/aren&#x27;t sure how to use it, google a video for proper use.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m willing to bet</li>
            <li> Pulls hairs out pretty well when used correctly..</li>
            <li> (Remember the first time you did your eyebrows?</li>
            <li> in mind that there is a bit of learning curve when you first use it.</li>
            <li> Go slowly at first.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it came exceptionally fast!</li>
            <li> Just wish it could do more for coarse hair!</li>
            <li> I love my Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  </li>
            <li> Not painless but works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> It was time consuming the first time, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Does it work pretty well?</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it hurt a bit&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> but since I plan to use it more regularly now, it won&#x27;t be pulling out&lt;br</li>
            <li> Throw out that hot wax.</li>
            <li> I am working the courage to finish my upper lip - that hurts the most.  </li>
            <li> Hurts like the devil at first</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellabe!</li>
            <li> (Real or imagined!)</li>
            <li> but I use it after a hot shower, so it&#x27;s not as noticeable.....</li>
            <li> I intend to order several more and keep one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Those are really coarse ones, but I am sure it will be no problem.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have worked the first time I used it but not thereafter.  </li>
            <li> My first tool of this type was the REM Spring which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It does a much better job than the facial attachment of my electric epilator.  </li>
            <li> the fact that this will not harm any layers of skin like hot wax can do.</li>
            <li> The benefit with this, however, is that you can go over an area as many times as you want without pulling or tearing skin, which is a risk with waxing the same area of skin over and over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once every two weeks for myself personally.</li>
            <li> At first, Bellabe was not working because I was not doing it correctly.  </li>
            <li> Mostly, I use this on my upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> Gets those hairs and really works!</li>
            <li> I first went on Youtube to see some videos on how to use it and tried it myself.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all of the tiny hairs but gets 100% of the most noticeable longer ones.</li>
            <li> Funny that the girl on youtube didn&#x27;t flinch one bit when using it.</li>
            <li> After 2 years, I&#x27;m glad to finally find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works pretty darn well</li>
            <li> but it works exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> mine went into the trash can after the first week of trying to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty klutzy</li>
            <li> First hold the handles between your fingers and bend into a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty used the pain of hair plucking after years of doing it -</li>
            <li> The Bellabe really works!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> It works but really hurts!</li>
            <li> the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> have more facial hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the actual pain is from not being used to it.</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to use at all</li>
            <li> The famous 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my upper lip…</li>
            <li> I feel like I really just won the lottery here!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with excess facial hair and hair removal for too many years to count.</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> It really WORKS!  </li>
            <li> It hurts so much!</li>
            <li> but it turned to be a risk that was very well worth it.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> My dog ate my first one.</li>
            <li> $15 for a spring with some plastic bits is a bit pricey, considering the materials, but laser treatment cost me a lot more and it didn&#x27;t deal with the blonde ones.</li>
            <li> well at first yes, but i got used to it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> I used this item mostly for my upper lip and chin...</li>
            <li> and at first I didn&#x27;t feel a thing</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> Yes it smarts at first, but you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does hurt at first too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t catch all of the finer hairs.</li>
            <li> The first time is definitely the toughest because so many hairs are removed at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the sugar waxers for my upper lip - have to be heated, applied to the correct thickness, sticky, time consuming and sometimes has to be repeated because there are too many strays.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, it put bumps on my skin, after the first try, so I discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> It does hurt more on the upper lip-so I do suggest trying the chin area first.</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first, then it stings a bit</li>
            <li> I have found that the darker hairs don&#x27;t always come out on the first pass, but eventually the device does grasp them and pull them out.  </li>
            <li> but it really works!</li>
            <li> It really stings !  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I took the precautions of washing and exfoliating first, as well as washing the instrument, it was a no-go.</li>
            <li> This works really well!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to scream, but it worked really well!</li>
            <li> trimmers just cut the hair leaving stubble, Bellabe removes from the root leaving your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> You just need to get used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of hair being pulled at first.</li>
            <li> I had zero problems with any bumps developing (which I would sometimes get from waxing) and no danger of someone applying wax that is too hot.  </li>
            <li> First I was just rolling it and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pain-free, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> This thing really does pull the hair out by the roots!</li>
            <li> The place to put your fingers is in a vibrant color which mine was purple and super</li>
            <li> For my chin however, I began to grow ingrown hairs after the first use.</li>
            <li> Also, I am noticing now a lot of the hair was simply cropped, and it feels almost stubbly (even though I made sure to use as instructed).</li>
            <li> I saw the first hairs grow off of my chin as a teenager.</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to paying for expensive waxing and salon treatments.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you need it to you in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> yes at first.  </li>
            <li> It really hurts!</li>
            <li> I said using this doesn&#x27;t hurt (at first)</li>
            <li> I will never again endure this thanks to Bellabe!  </li>
            <li> Also it takes a lot of repeated going of the same spot over and over MANY times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I love the product and have used it several times since I received it and the pain has eased some</li>
            <li> product seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do if used correctly.</li>
            <li> This will slide across your skin if it&#x27;s damp, humid or hot.  </li>
            <li> This product works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> Something you must stay on top of and do regularly to achieve the goal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on hair that&#x27;s never been removed before but when it starts to grow back, there&#x27;s no grip until it gets long again.</li>
            <li> The Epilady facial depilitator is a better investment.  </li>
            <li> It does get the hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> it took 2 seconds to learn how to use and it hurt at first</li>
            <li> I prefer a GOOD tweezers that will grasp these firmly and leave no root to grow again.</li>
            <li> And even better: you can get rid of that light coat of feather down on the rest of your grace , the stuff you see</li>
            <li> Effective for removing fine facial hair, the mustache and peach fuzz that we women - especially those of a certain age - experience.</li>
            <li> BUT this is def a good tool for a fast fix because it makes the hair appear less noticable even if its not pulled from the root-</li>
            <li> so I can go out and live my life, but this product is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> No worse than plucking, right?  </li>
            <li> I do not have much upper-lip hair to deal with, but enough that it bothered me when I could see it, so now I can just take care of it with the Bellabe, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> It a good idea but not easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have found the positive reviews to be consistent with what this product delivers.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of tools in the past... tweezing, waxing, threading, bleach, etc, and this so far by far has been the best.  </li>
            <li> Just clean your face then sit down in front of your tv and roll this puppy over your face and before your show ends, your face will be smooth and virtually hairless!</li>
            <li> I know there are other women like myself who don&#x27;t go to spas or spent much time in salons or reading beauty magazines to learn what tools and techniques are available, yet we also desire to look as attractive as we can.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I had used the Bellabe with success, I had clusters of cysts growing, particularly around my mouth (</li>
            <li> i use it for upper lip hair removal and it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> and it is so nice not to have those wild hairs and baby fuzz on my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Then I started going over the super fine blonde hairs on my jawline, which I&#x27;m pretty sure just about everyone has, and those never really bothered me before, but when I started to use the Bellabe there I couldn&#x27;t believe how friggin&#x27; hairy</li>
            <li> The Bellabe was slightly less in price but had a decent amount of good reviews, so I wanted to compare.  </li>
            <li> If you are okay with using an epilator, this product might work for you but unlike an epilator this is a slow hair removing device and so can cause more pain.</li>
            <li> It really did take me 3-5 tries for it to be really effective.  </li>
            <li> ITS BETTER TO USE ONLY TO TOUCH UPS AFTER YOU GET A REAL WAXING OR THEADING.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that you can do it any time without all the fuss and mess of other methods.</li>
            <li> Of course it stings a little since you&#x27;re removing hair from the roots, but the discomfort lessens significantly over time the more you use it.</li>
            <li> Is pretty decent!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use and will save me so much money in the long run not going to a salon to get the hair threaded.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bellabe from Amazon.com, prime shipping (yay, I love that) because I am a \\&quot;woman of a certain age\\&quot; with UBER sensitive skin who has never fared well with professional waxing.  </li>
            <li> - if you can stand plucking you&#x27;ll be able to handle this (though some areas of my face are a little more sensitive than others).</li>
            <li> While it definitely saves time and is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t consistently pull the hairs out by the roots-</li>
            <li> It also had a lot of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> all of them were positive.</li>
            <li> I had no faith that this would work but decided to try it anyway because of all the positive reviews I had read.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from fine light hairs on my upper lip and chin and was able to remove all of these with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy with just a tiny sting that I can live with.  </li>
            <li> that pretty much sums up my thoughts about this product.</li>
            <li> However, after doing it 2-3 times after that first experience, it really didn&#x27;t bother me any longer.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this thing it was absolute torture.</li>
            <li> but I thought that this is the first product that really gave me the results it promised</li>
            <li> I looked at this product many times, read reviews, and mulled it over for a long time.</li>
            <li> Having said that,  this device is pretty gentle.  </li>
            <li> but you should get used to it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, and handles exactly what I wanted to handle.</li>
            <li> Now, I was expecting some pain associated with a product that rips the hair out by the root, so I promise I&#x27;m not a complete fool :)</li>
            <li> That said, 4 days is still pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It does really hurt when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li> Pinches a bit at first, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> This thing hurts worse than plucking, but it is fast, a million times more effective, and inexpensive</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but after using my new Bellabe for the first time today, I have to rate it FIVE STARS!</li>
            <li> It is important to clean it after every use and not let the metal part get wet, I think mine may be tarnishing a bit.</li>
            <li> The older that I&#x27;ve gotten, the more facial hair I seem to be getting.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve grown older, my facial hair has become more of an issue.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had more problems with hair above my lip and under my chin, and it gets all that too.</li>
            <li> My upper lip area seems to be a more sensitive area, so I have to do shorter hair-removal sessions, more often, to achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li> It was very good at it&#x27;s job but after a while it started leaving a lot of small spots around my upper lip area.</li>
            <li> This little tool works just like tweezing, but you get to pull many hairs at once!</li>
            <li> Not super well - but amazingly well for what it does.  </li>
            <li> Its an easy way for remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> but once you know, it is so easy to remove the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Worth trying as long as you do realize that it&#x27;s not 100% pain free.</li>
            <li> So beware, if you have super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super duper sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> I make sure my skin is dry</li>
            <li> I have coarse dark hair and have tried just about everything on the market (with the exception of laser) without results that I have ever been happy with.  </li>
            <li> Finally, an easy way to keep up with the hereditary facial hair</li>
            <li> Then I realized I need to twist easy side and all of the sudden I was on a roll, literally!  </li>
            <li> It was so easy to use and removes facial fuzz without a doubt.</li>
            <li> This does work I definitely recommend it for anyone I saw it had a five star and tried it its easy to use</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my Bellabe facial hair threader which arrived only 2 days after ordering it!  </li>
            <li> The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fairly easy especially in areas with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works good, but not on long facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Does not quite hold strong enough for the thicker chin hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is very effective on &amp;#34;scattered&amp;#34; stray hairs and I wish it was because tweezing is not a good answer.  </li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair.</li>
            <li> It was a very fast and effective way to remove facial hair for the larger portions of my face.</li>
            <li> This is basically a large metal spring.</li>
            <li> It certainly beat the cost of the No No.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to learn how to position the wire to get to certain places.  </li>
            <li> but they certainly deserve an award.  </li>
            <li> If you like this product I recommend an emjoi epilator for large areas on your face and body.</li>
            <li> The spring has to be twirled a certain way (counter clockwise) to get it to pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li> It does smart when you apply it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still certain areas on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using it, I can tell you that I love it!</li>
            <li> Rolling the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover across the chin, neck, and cheek area is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> So fast and easy with lasting results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and it really will remove all the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> Great idea and really gets down to the last follicle!</li>
            <li> Sure, it pulls a little, but it&#x27;s done so quickly that it&#x27;s really not bad...definitely better than plucking each hair separately.</li>
            <li> This little gadget comes in handy to get the tiniest hairs off  face that you didn&#x27;t even realize were there, also sometimes I can&#x27;t seem to get certain hairs with tweezers and this pulls those out</li>
            <li> You can feel the pull and sometimes like a pinch as it grips and grabs the fine hair around your facial area.</li>
            <li> and it felt like I was ripping the tiny fine hairs out by the roots.</li>
            <li> , she seems pretty satisfied with the results from this device, although she uses other stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> It definitely pulls all of the fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem getting the hang of it, and unlike a lot of reviewers, it seems to work well on fine and coarse hair for me.  </li>
            <li> I recently started getting hormone replacement therapy and found that it caused me to have fine blond hairs all over my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> hairs seem to be removed root and all so any regrowth has lessened and the regrowing 1s remain a fine tiny hair</li>
            <li> Definitely a decent alternative to waxing and hair plucking!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t realize that I had many very light and thin hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> I am close to 50, blonde/gray, mild to moderate facial hair depending on which strength magnification you use, I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> This little gizmo from Bellabe is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing little tool, wish I had brought one sooner.....</li>
            <li> Instead of getting burned with wax, this is an amazing little thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> These are amazing little gizmos.</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing...</li>
            <li> I do feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance though, so this wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of passes to get the technique down, but after that, the BellaBe was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I seem to have inherited the same fine facial characteristics, and I leave the epilator by modern &amp;#34;lazy boy&amp;#34; chair...with glass of wine readily available.  </li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you can handle a little pain ;)</li>
            <li> To the good, this is a very small tool, could be easily and discreetly carried,  is very simple to use and works!</li>
            <li> It does an amazing job on the larger jobs, but you&#x27;ll still need another product to get those precision jobs such as your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I attended enough sessions of electrolysis that I don&#x27;t have much for hair around my mouth or lips.</li>
            <li> I hate using it lol, but it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I get really really red and huge bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product is made very well.</li>
            <li> The price is absolutely reasonable in my opinion but</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it worked very well.</li>
            <li> so it is going to hurt about as much as tweezing would.</li>
            <li> This brand seems to work very well for me.</li>
            <li> so much I am going to order another one</li>
            <li> The cream also only keeps you feeling smooth for one day.  </li>
            <li> For those wanting additional information on the product, there are several \\&quot;great\\&quot; videos available on youtube.    </li>
            <li> this really does remove the hair.</li>
            <li> so either I&#x27;m really hairier than I thought</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I grew up with an Epilady (torture device), so I was really scared to use it.</li>
            <li> REALLY helps to do something distracting while using this tool.</li>
            <li> Preventing them is MUCH easier than trying to get rid of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bellabe is really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really even need to use this anymore.  </li>
            <li> I would have saved so much time on this process.</li>
            <li> but I can handle it and much faster then one at a time</li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> It does pull a bit but who wants unneeded hair?</li>
            <li> I purchased an item for several hundred dollars which the name fit the product...</li>
            <li> It stung on my upper lip, but no where else My skin has never felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> Hurts so much but gets hairs off after going over it a couple times</li>
            <li> I found that by varying how I was twisting and rolling, how much bend in the spring</li>
            <li> Too much information</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I really do like it</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it in pink, and have been extremely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It removes the hair very well</li>
            <li> once you learn how to use it it really gets rid of a lot of hair...</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the sting you&#x27;ll realize that this product works very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and much easier.</li>
            <li> and it still works very well.</li>
            <li> This tool really does the job.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I  have never broken out from using one.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s ripping hair out), but it works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;as much hairs.</li>
            <li> I did my whole face</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it is very effecient.</li>
            <li> It works very well for that.</li>
            <li> But this hair remover is awesome, It was pretty painful the first time I used it, It made my eyes well up with tears</li>
            <li> too much peach fuzz to deal with</li>
            <li> I simply cannot take using this as my primary hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I know this is not the case for everyone, as I read some reviews saying it really hurt.</li>
            <li> Even before I moved, sometimes it would be a hassle to get to the salon, and doing it at home would have been so much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already told friends and family because it&#x27;s inspired me that much.</li>
            <li> but if used every day it  really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> It is much like plucking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I think is also because you don&#x27;t get much time to prepare yourself for the hair that is going to be removed.</li>
            <li> The coiled device gently pulls the hair from your face.</li>
            <li> It is much easier that tweezing.</li>
            <li> i did my mustache and three days later its still smooth...</li>
            <li> After a week or two, it really does get easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pain and really did pull from the root.</li>
            <li> but it takes much time to get all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see that area, but I suspected I needed this product for it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.</li>
            <li> hurts a lot, &amp;doesn&#x27;t really work,</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I only have light peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t even imagine on how much I&#x27;ve saved on waxing plus</li>
            <li> i did my whole face  </li>
            <li> It lasts much longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> Very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Plus many hair removal methods are impractical since I want to remove hair from a wide surface area (the sides of my face).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li> i just sit there rolling it all over my face and even my friends noticed how much cleaner it looked.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it, it pinched too much as it pulls the hair from her chin.</li>
            <li> But remember - it is pulling the hair out, feels much like waxing.</li>
            <li> I used it everywhere on my face except my eyebrows and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It also REALLY hurts</li>
            <li> This helps me so much.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really uncoordinated.</li>
            <li> Thanks to menopause, I now have a bit of a moustache.  </li>
            <li> Much faster than plucking each hair one by one with a tweezer which was why I got it.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well as described.</li>
            <li> but you have to try and really learn how to use it</li>
            <li> It absolutely works for me.</li>
            <li> No batteries to worry about, this is going to save you so much money from going to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> but this is much faster than Nads and no irritation as with the chemical hair removers.  </li>
            <li> So much faster than tweezing one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the results with this hair remover and after a couple times of using it I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Does not work very well.</li>
            <li> and this does absolutely nothing to remove them.</li>
            <li> Too much labor involved using the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> this is much faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li> It really does</li>
            <li> I feel like I really just won the lottery</li>
            <li> This product did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> More&#x27;s the pity.</li>
            <li> I am DONE with that now, thanks to the Bellabe.  </li>
            <li> and I find the pain too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> Product came fast in mail.  </li>
            <li> You get used to it fast.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of this, I really like it.</li>
            <li> but it is much faster than tweezing and a lot cheaper than laser hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This thing works really well.</li>
            <li> Order came fast.  </li>
            <li> but it might be too much for some people.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely an A+ device.</li>
            <li> , I hope that it will be much easier.  </li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I always think in the back of my head that they can see my light mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> After that, you know what to expect and there isn&#x27;t as much hair to be removed so</li>
            <li> worked better than expected</li>
            <li> As the hair grows back, it is thinner and light.</li>
            <li> and I have been facial hair free for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Really gets rid of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather tweeze my whole face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want everyone to know that this product really works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure after reading the wide range of reviews.  </li>
            <li> But it gets the hair out and works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that customer service was an absolute pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> It made things sooo much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;it really does hurt.  </li>
            <li> I have really course hairs on my chin and throat from PCOS.</li>
            <li> Hurts too much to use again.</li>
            <li> but none seem to work for me very well.</li>
            <li> Using this thing really &amp;#34;smarts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I could feel it grab a hair and yank, but the results were very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> , it is fast and efficient and I no longer have that unsightly mustache.  </li>
            <li> it takes too much time to use it.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Considering how much I use it, and how much I am going to save on not buying anything else, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Granted, it removed some of the finer hair that I wasn&#x27;t really concerned with</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, but I&#x27;m used to the feeling because I use an epilator for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> This product seemed really neat</li>
            <li> yet it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy that I don&#x27;t need a mirror and proper lighting to use.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product and it&#x27;s so inexpensive you can&#x27;t really lose.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bellabe --- would give you 10 stars  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it hurts that much, but I have waxed my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; before</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have tried many different types of hair removal products.</li>
            <li> Before I bought one for myself, I bought one for a friend who was constantly looking for an effective facial hair removal product.</li>
            <li> Well, like many of the reviews posted here, I have to say that it is uncomfortable, but it is effective.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s effective, but takes me multiple passes on the same tender area of skin</li>
            <li> Two children ago, I didn&#x27;t have the kind of luxurious facial growth that would require such a tool, but now I find myself in need.</li>
            <li> Go easy the first pass, particularly if you have long hairs on your jaw line.</li>
            <li> Watched this reviewed for a few years on a popular shopping channel</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a effective and inexpensive facial hair removal product.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe Facial Hair Remover effectively removes facial hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, I have it handy enough where I can start doing it while sitting in traffic, or wait outside the school for my kids.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure it would exfoliate down to the bone.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair you can barely see, but I feel like part of the Duck Dynasty</li>
            <li> The pain is tolerable, the only time it hurts more is when you do your upper lip or right below your eye socket.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stings the first time I used it, but the more I use it, the less it bothers it</li>
            <li> And the hair grows back pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> While not easy to use, I was pleasantly surprised to find it works and the price is good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, takes some getting use to, &amp; have found plucking wit tweezers , nor as good as the small battery operated lady&#x27;s shaver I have, which which neither get smooth as using tweezers..tricky to use also, when rub back &amp; forth with it in a circle, it grabs the hair, the you pull remover out swiftly &amp; it pull hair out, but still leaves a little stub</li>
            <li> I mean, let&#x27;s be fair, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt.  </li>
            <li> Removes facial hair fast and easy, and with only mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in theory but seems to only work if you can hold it flat.  </li>
            <li> I love this and this product is so quick and easy, leaving not one hair behind!</li>
            <li> Then along comes this wonderful little tool and after very little pain, effort or time</li>
            <li> Oh, the other nice thing is you don&#x27;t have to wait until the hair gets a certain length before it will work like many of the items I have tried in the past, including waxing.</li>
            <li> Will come back to it later since it&#x27;s very easy to operate.</li>
            <li> There is a slight pinching while hair is being pulled out, but beauty doesn&#x27;t come easy!  </li>
            <li> No more waxing for me, I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I do actually love this little spring of pain because it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do which is remove all that unsightly hair from my face without taking up a shaving routine.  </li>
            <li> Like it better than other alternatives.</li>
            <li> (I was originally searching for facial hair removing cream, plucking takes foreverrrr</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;s lackluster performance was due to user error and will improve as I learn to wield it better.</li>
            <li> Other than the pimples I was satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i recommended to a couple other ladies and they love it too.</li>
            <li> originally used this product for my upper lip (which I have always had a hair issue for) and my chin (</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> i used it, and it does clean the hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It stings a bit on the real sensitive places like my upper lip and just below where my sideburns are but overall it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I advise using it after the shower since your pores are open and your face is clean.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of Bellabe because it seemed too good to be true, yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing little tool, I bought one for myself and my mother, she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I use some alcohol on a cotton ball to wipe it down after and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.  </li>
            <li> So I found the Bellabe and read many reviews and figured at the low price I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose...except facial hair!</li>
            <li> It really works and deserves the high ratings</li>
            <li> The best part is I can take care of this sitting down, standing up, laying down - with lots of light or no light at all.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky that even with my PCOS, I don&#x27;t get much acne on my face (mostly on my back and around my hairline).</li>
            <li> So take your lip in three stages (right side, left side, middle) and persevere practicing your technique of how fast you want to roll it, and soon you will have smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am excited to get the less expensive one too, because the reviews were also really great!</li>
            <li> I am excited to get the less expensive one too, because the reviews were also really great!</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this tool, much more efficient than tweezing, and no long term side effects like scar tissue or damage to skin from waxing.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was because of breaking hair off, but I can clearly see the roots when I pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves your face soft and smooth and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast.</li>
            <li> WOW, it REALLY works!</li>
            <li> I have to say that, for pulling out light soft hairs on the chin and upper lip, this works really well.</li>
            <li> Going back to my electric full body epilator.</li>
            <li> Your skin may be sensitive at first.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool thing to have.</li>
            <li> So I originally bought the REM and actually wrote a good review about it also, but I misplaced it and thought I&#x27;d try a different brand this time.  </li>
            <li> This is a really cool facial hair remover!</li>
            <li> I got a full 25c piece area cleared on my shin, and I only needed 2 band-aids to staunch the bleeding.  </li>
            <li> this gets the job done pretty good although i do have problems with getting extra small hairs.</li>
            <li> I was more concerned about the stray dark chin hairs that my husband (affectionately?) dubbed  my \\&quot;wiry hag-hairs\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My skin honestly feels softer and smoother and no more peach fuzz or hairs...</li>
            <li> I was paying $30 monthly for full facial threading.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Bellabe a couple of years ago, and I use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the plucking, but not painful except for above the lip.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it it did hurt and knew that it would because i had read the reviews and people had said that it would hurt because it is pulling the hair out and on your face its sensitive anyways.</li>
            <li> , it felt like tiny pricks, not bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use this near/around your eye brows, as it&#x27;s hard to be precise and can end up taking a hunk of eyebrow out quickly!</li>
            <li> This is easy and really doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first use, when you remove all the little hairs at once.  </li>
            <li> My face is very smooth without all the facial hair and I am so thankful that I don&#x27;t have to daily \\&quot;pluck\\</li>
            <li> The trick is to keep rolling gently over little spots to make sure you get it all.</li>
            <li> It is also a great gift for elderly women who have a hard time seeing and plucking those stray hairs on their upper lip or chin.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other product (more expensive) and have not been as happy with there performance.</li>
            <li> I must say my skin has not felt this smooth in a very long time.</li>
            <li> The bellabe is quicker removes more hair with less amount of work.</li>
            <li> With this facial hair remover, I was able to easily remove my facial hair with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even us black girls :)</li>
            <li> easy to twist with rough hold...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use however it does sting which is to be expected</li>
            <li> It is not painless at all, there is more than just a slight tugging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with minimal discomfort which diminishes over time.</li>
            <li> My husband could see the difference before and after, and I was thrilled to see hair trapped in the coils with nearly every pass.</li>
            <li> I adjusted quickly to the initial stinging</li>
            <li> Prices vary, so I wonder if the more expensive ones (like REM) are better. . .     </li>
            <li> Wondering if upgrading to a more expensive model would get better results?     </li>
            <li> I found that hair does not grow back as quickly as plucking it with a tweeezer.   </li>
            <li> Obviously I used it correctly because many hairs were removed (especially the finer hairs just under my lip).</li>
            <li> This Bellabe gets most everything, and then I go back with the tweezers and get the ones that were too short for the spring.</li>
            <li> but you have to have a decent pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> It takes all the hair off my upper lip and leaves it smooth and   soft.</li>
            <li> The way my face is, if I skip a day or two the hair grows back no matter what (albeit lighter and not as quickly).</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of it</li>
            <li> and I figured it was worth the risk of only $16 if I ended up hating its very existence.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Bellabe Facial Hair Remover&#x27; may be &#x27;simple&#x27; but it is mighty!</li>
            <li> I tried a shaver but found that it leaves bumps on my skin and the hair grows back quickly.</li>
            <li> and it grows back really quick.  </li>
            <li> My face was red and sore for about 10 mins after but it quickly subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have acne in middle school, but since then ive got it under control, and my skins been great lately.</li>
            <li> Basically, based on the reviews ive read, if you are older, and have never struggled with acne, you should have no problem, but if you have ever struggled with acne, or have oily skin</li>
            <li> thing I love about the Bellabe Facial Remover, is it allows for multiple hairs to be removed at one time.  </li>
            <li> The photo leads you to believe you are getting more than one facial hair remover, however, for the price, you receive only one.  </li>
            <li> I only use it for my upper lip and chin, and it&#x27;s like magic and strip every hair off.</li>
            <li> It works like many tiny tweezers extracting hair all at the same time.</li>
            <li> Roll it in different directions to get as many hairs as possible.</li>
            <li> I can do this once a week, as a quick clean-up, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to grow back like waxing.</li>
            <li> The creams don&#x27;t get everything, they smell, they burn my skin if left on more than 8 minutes, and I get stubble the next day.  </li>
            <li> so I was afraid the Bellabe wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy, a little stingy at first</li>
            <li> It actually works best when you work with it by feel rather than sight, so I sat down to watch a little TV and used it while I watched.</li>
            <li> This works very well for the fine hair that grows on my face or other areas but anything course will not be removed by this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had not problems at all!</li>
            <li> I have significant light blonde peach fuzz on my upper lip, which has always bothered me, but waxing causes breakouts for me, and all attempts at hair removal on my upper lip have been very unsuccessful.</li>
            <li> Good product, but your hair has to be thick in order for it to work!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend the product highly.</li>

            <li> It has been an embarrassing issue since I was in high school.</li>

            <li> This little thing WORKS for fine hair and peach fuzz that is too much to tweeze!</li>
            <li> hurts a little at first especially sensitive areas but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after a few more uses this slight sting will dissipate.</li>
            <li> It stings the most on the first use, but if used regularly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all because you have less hairs to pull out each time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little large for my upper lip area, but much more effective than this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Cute little hair-removing device.  </li>
            <li> Yes there is a little pain, not any more then tweezing.  </li>
            <li> Love this little thing as a filler in between waxing.</li>
            <li> This cute little device shaved 30 minutes of tweezer time from my life.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little more than waxing</li>
            <li> Much better than those little baby hair clippers since it pulls the hair out by the root</li>
            <li> I held on to it and get a little better at maneuvering it each time.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product to see if it worked before I invested in an expensive epilator - and am very glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> might, with a little more use.</li>
            <li> &quot; I love this little tool and just saying that makes my husband jealous.  </li>
            <li> At most, it stings a little when the hair gets pulled out.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts a little, but better than tweezing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like waxing</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, this innocent looking little &#x27;spring&#x27; get them all.</li>
            <li> This is an ingenious little device.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use a little aloe afterward and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more pulling power when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little bit, but gets better over time.</li>
            <li> Seriously, just buy one already, it&#x27;s totally worth it. :)</li>
            <li> After the first go at my cheeks and chin area, i had red skin which then turned into large pimples.</li>
            <li> The upper lip did smart the first time I tried it there</li>
            <li> It seems to do better removing the fine hairs than the coarse, thick hairs, but that just makes it easier to tweeze the leftovers.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fine facial hair, and it took me multiple passes over an area to completely remove hair (about 20 minutes from start to finish).</li>
            <li> This little spring is effective, fast, and seems to produce long-lasting results, but is definitely not painless.  </li>
            <li> I love my smooth face, and no longer feel ashamed of my slight &#x27;mustache&#x27; or other shadows</li>
            <li> As I get older and lazier, I look for new methods of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Just surprised at how much it hurt.  </li>
            <li> It hurt so much I almost screamed out loud.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day without problems though (no break outs or irritated skin) but was quite surprised to feel how much hair I kept removing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am honestly surprised how much hair I keep pulling out.</li>
            <li> It easily removes facial hairs, even small fine ones and the thicker chin type hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced and surpassed my expectations so far.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much hair you need to remove, depends on how frequently you will need to use it.</li>
            <li> Use on clean, dry</li>
            <li> Looked weird but the reviews said it was great.  </li>
            <li> I prefer professional treatments but don&#x27;t always want to pay so much.</li>
            <li> and I was very self conscious of my mustache area.</li>
            <li> I also wipe mine clean with a dry cloth as I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am not completely hair free, but much better than in the past.</li>
            <li> This hurts too much and my skin is too sensitive to use it.  </li>
            <li> My face felt like a chemical burn a few times from the creams, and I swore I would find a better solution.  </li>
            <li> The ripping of facial hair from the roots by the Bellabe is not a walk in the park, but the result is worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> AFTER A FEW MORE TRYS, IT DID NOT WORK</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about strange hairs when I go out.   </li>
            <li> That this removes multiple hairs at once (rather than tweezing one hair at a time) is well worth the short-term discomfort.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened it I thought this can&#x27;t be good but was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> I had been doing research on the No No for hair removal and most of the reviews were pretty negative, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300+ on a maybe.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my upper lip, it really hurt.  </li>
            <li> I moved to a place where threading was more expensive and they kind of sucked (I had been getting my upper lip threaded for years)..</li>
            <li> that this was a nicer, newer way to remove unwanted hair and could see it useful if I had a bigger problem with hair on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find it more tolerable after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I would say it hurts about as much as waxing, but only the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, the low price convinced me that it was worth</li>
            <li> It is kind of tricky to use properly and have hair above the mouth actually removed.</li>
            <li> I ordered a cheap on first, but then realized that I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered a cheap on first, but then realized that I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few ladies on there who can show you how to use it before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying this a few more times.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was a normal reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So worth it for removing unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> but I still replace them within 9 months, plus, it&#x27;s always fun to get different colors!  </li>
            <li> , I think waxing was the only thing I haven&#x27;t had much success with.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good that I did, so that the fallout wasn&#x27;t worse than it was...</li>
            <li> It took me quite a few tries, watching a u-tube video,and an email to the company, to learn how to use it effectively, and I still cannot use it under my chin/jawline with any measure of success.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to maneuver it to pluck some hairs in certain areas but otherwise is very effective and leaves the skin feeling far smoother than a razor would.</li>
            <li> Other areas were fine.  </li>
            <li> device is very simple and easy to use, and I can see for myself that the hairs on my upper lip are removed at the roots.</li>
            <li> skin is easily irritated and this process left me with only a tingling feeling, as if I just exercised my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Overall it is effective and probably less damaging than ripping everything out at once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and don&#x27;t see good results ..very easy to use and</li>
            <li> So easy now, 3 days later with no hair on my upper lip, chin, cheeks - anywhere!</li>
            <li> This product honestly cut my facial plucking time in half</li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to use and only stings for a second after hairs are removed.  </li>
            <li> So easy I won&#x27;t mind if I do it daily, but it looks like that won&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li> but this works much better than tweezing and grabs a larger amount of hair than just single tweezing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the creams for facial hair and had a reaction from it and broke out with sores on the side of my right lip.</li>
            <li> just right to ensure proper hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Not following up with some type of astringent sets you up for breakouts as bacteria will slip right into those pores that you ripped the hair follicles from.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the hair does not grow back right away.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually how you can tell it&#x27;s working, if it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; a bit you&#x27;re not doing it right.  </li>
            <li> They only appear right after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> It takes many passes for me to extract my thick coarse hairs and the pain doesn&#x27;t really seem worth it.</li>
            <li> Does not feel like a pin prick, feels like a 400 pound German woman named Gert ( pretty sure she used to be a wrestler....and a man) is super glueing duct tape to your cheeks and or upper lip and yanking out the delicate whisps of fuzz with enough force to wax a gorilla then following up with a gentle soothing touch of a blowtorch that will leave you tingling for a good half hour.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I tried to use it on my upper lip stray hairs (I have a few that are blond and not thick)</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and, while I&#x27;m not exactly The Bearded Lady, I want my face to look smooth and youthful and, well, hairless.</li>
            <li> It is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> This is painful at first but gets better as more hairs are lifted.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit it was pretty cool to see my little hairs in the springs of this tool, but It took a lot of twisting and turning to figure out how use this tool correctly.  </li>
            <li> Which for me works with 2 energetic busy little ones.</li>
            <li> I need new one.</li>
            <li> I need to get a new wife, and keep the &amp;#34;Bellabe&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So thought I&#x27;d try something new.  </li>
            <li> You do need to purchase a new one every 6 months or so</li>
            <li> but for those of us out here that have had this  problem,tweezing is nothing new and remains TIME CONSUMING.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Figuring they can send people into space with MRE&#x27;s and a suction toilet, they should be able to make a tool to remove unwanted facial hair from the faces of \\&quot;women of a certain age.\\&quot;  Enter Bellabe Facial Hair Remover!  </li>
            <li> but it does get fine hair too with a little more effort and its a little tricky on the curvy parts of your face but all in all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and have very fine facial hair (except upper lip) and the Bellabee handled it all.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very painful at all -- especially if you tweeze</li>
            <li> I found a stiff brissell brush like a nail brush works pretty well and then rinsing in hot water soapy water works pretty well.</li>
            <li> After I have removed all that fuzz, I expect it to be quite easy to keep up with it, just use it before going to bed and will be less painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use just a few easy motions and start taking those hairs out easier and faster than actual plucking one by one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with light blonde upper lip, chin and cheek hairs and this miracle wand works!</li>
            <li> Actually way more than i expected.</li>
            <li> I will try it a few more times to see if I can tolerate it, but my face is just sensitive.</li>
            <li> You can find far cheaper versions of this product but most are not available on Prime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as waxing, for some reason (the only exception being the middle of the upper lip -- that was pretty intense).</li>
            <li> Possibly safe on the center bridge of the nose between the eyebrows but for God&#x27;s sake woman, keep that thing away from the actual eyebrows and eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This hair remover definitely removes a fair amount of facial hair, with just a slight amount of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Shaving only goes so far and can get stubbly real fast.  </li>
            <li> May only be ideal for a few hairs, like less than 10.</li>
            <li> sure the outside doesn&#x27;t get wet.  </li>
            <li> I love this little item!</li>
            <li> The most painful area is the upper lip, it kind of startles you at first and can hurt</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin since I am 91 years of age.  </li>
            <li> My face skin is very sensitive and there was no reaction to using this hair remover.  </li>
            <li> , I usually use it while reading an email, (yes usually only one email because it is so quick and easy to use).</li>
            <li> I have no doubt they will come out easily when they are long enough.</li>
            <li> and it does easily take some of the longer hair from the cheek bone area, but the small fine hairs on the lip are harder, even if you stretch your lip out with your tongue.</li>
            <li> It grabs quite a few hairs at once, many of them those tiny ones you can&#x27;t really see when tweezing, I think.</li>
            <li> Not completely painless but well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s all of this old hair inside of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say I probably didn&#x27;t give it enough of a try...</li>
            <li> No where near the level of pain that you feel after plucking or waxing!  </li>
            <li> and that will last me a whole year!</li>
            <li> It took me about 15 to 20 minutes, off and on, the first time to remove everything because I am such a baby when it comes to discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well arould lips and chin, not ouchless tho, just like plucking only faster.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I got on Amazon, did my research, and decided my first purchase would be something &#x27;simple&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The bumps are barely noticeable unless you look really closely at my face.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised by this product!</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin, no breakouts or irritation!  </li>
            <li> Did you know that the Egyptians used to remove hair with a silk string--works in exactly the same way this thing does!</li>
            <li> My only suggestion to Bellaby would be to give the customer the option of choosing one of the pretty colors you advertise.  </li>
            <li> Epilators--Yes, this has been my go-to product for my adult life!  </li>
            <li> First if you never have done any facial removal, you will feel sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for the peach fuzz and upper lip hair I get and really isn&#x27;t that painful in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so the thought of this metal object ripping my facial hair out wasn&#x27;t exactly a thrilling thought.</li>
            <li> However, getting facial hair off of my face was absolutely a thrilling thought as I for whatever reason</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I can say that it looks exactly like the photo, comes in the proper packaging.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Upon my first use, I did only my lip, at night, before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair thanks you !</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever done but this simple device works</li>
            <li> I rated the Bellabe 4 stars for only one reason, and that is that the solution isn&#x27;t permanent, like perhaps laser treatments claim to be, and because there is a bit of discomfort at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive like waxing, but the hairs stay gone about the same amount of time</li>
            <li> , I was definitely surprised!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have any redness afterwards!</li>
            <li> Definitely removed the hair as it was supposed to; however, prepare yourself for the pain the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> It is very simple to use although at first</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sometimes pretty obvious where the wax has been.  </li>
            <li> I was all freaked out to use it a second time, because the first time hurt so much!&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am 59 years old and have not had an acne break out in decades!</li>
            <li> Just be aware, you only get one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont have to use any shave cream or other products to be able to use the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li> I thought I finally found a solution to unwanted hair without all the chemicals and hot wax.</li>
            <li> Just FYI - since I started taking evening primrose oil, it&#x27;s almost totally eliminated the hair on my face, I only have a little bit left now, and it&#x27;s very light and fine, almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use, a little pinch, but so is threading and tweezing.  </li>
            <li> A little, though hurt is a bit too strong a word.</li>
            <li> As of now I just bend it in the other direction to remove the caught up hair and then clean it with a sanitizer.</li>
            <li> It hurt a lot at first for me but after a few seconds, I got pretty used to the pain, and now I don&#x27;t have a mustache anymore!</li>
            <li> soo easy to use and minimal pain!!!</li>
            <li> This simple little product is so easy to use, and it works!  </li>
            <li> None of those left my skin as smooth for as long.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to be gentle the first time because it can hurt.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but this actually works great!  </li>
            <li> One thing that really helps is covering the area with a wet, hot washcloth before use as it opens up the pores.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a covering of down facial hairs will love this.  </li>
            <li> It will definitely cut down on the time I spend tweezing every day, and is alot gentler on the skin than most of the options out there.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine on the little peach fuzz that grows on everyone&#x27;s faces that I can&#x27;t even see.</li>
            <li> Does it hurt - a little bit more than a little, but you quickly get used to it</li>
            <li> So before I decided to buy this product, I read some of the reviews and they were all positive and seemed that this product actually worked.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and stings less than threading!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, safe, fast, hard to beat!</li>
            <li> It hurt a bit more on my upper lip than my chin and neck, but I also tweeze that area less.</li>
            <li> Such a fairly quick and simple solution.</li>
            <li> The product instructions and some of the reviews suggest that using this tool only causes mild discomfort- maybe not in the cheek area, but the upper lip HURTS...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, wax breaks me out, the bleach and lotions really hurt my skin and give me open sores.</li>
            <li> Not only is it really easy and simple to use, but it actually works!</li>
            <li> I order thus thinking it would be easy to use, it is not easy and somewhat time consuming.</li>
            <li> Since reaching a certain age, I have been dealing with the presence of some facial hair on my chin, and lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> After a certain age, facial hair happens.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly doesnt hurt anymore than having wax ripped off your upper lip (along with a layer of skin).  </li>
            <li> I wish that I could post pictures of it, but several large and irritated bumps grew on the sides of my chin.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my skin was left very soft and smooth similar to a post facial.  </li>
            <li> this is okay for fine hairs but hurts like crazy and still have to follow up with tweezers.</li>
            <li> This tool is convenient, and if your hair is not thick black ethic hair and u have mild peach fuzz, this could work on you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to be careful with the application of my makeup, specifically powders, because of the fine blonde hairs that covered my face.</li>
            <li> will say it is not the most pleasant sensation while using it, but I would rather hurt a little while using it, than go around with a hairy face, or a broken out face from waxing and threading!!  </li>
            <li> Luckily I only wound up with a few abrasions and a quick trip to the gyno for some salve will heal that right up, in 2 -3 weeks</li>
            <li> I will spend a little more and only buy Bellabe from now on.</li>
            <li> It works the same as the REM, but for whatever reason I think it works just a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> You do get used to it after a little bit, and, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I love the instant gratification of seeing all the hairs that have been removed with each pass.</li>
            <li> It hurst a little bit at first, but you get used to it because it goes so fast you don&#x27;t even notice it!</li>
            <li> Amazed at the fact that it&#x27;s a little spring, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> It removed a few fine hairs, but it&#x27;s difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with very high hopes that it would end my facial hair problems.  </li>
            <li> The upper lip is a little sensitive, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the feeling.  </li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool - it actually works!  </li>
            <li> Pinched a little on there, but I never tweeze my upper lip so it was more sensitive.</li>
            <li> This tool is much more effective than tweezing or waxing those pesky, ugly hairs that grow on my chin and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive, not too painful method of getting those hairs that your really can&#x27;t even see.  </li>
            <li> they are almost clear) and depilatory cream (burns my skin)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing; my upper lip hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every evening when I&#x27;m reading and my face is clear all the time now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot coming out , so much easier, especially when your busy and have kids.</li>
            <li> Clean the toothbrush with alcohol or whatever, and allow to dry for the next cleaning.</li>
            <li> What I really want is to find a completely fool proof way to not grow facial hair at all.  </li>
            <li> iir appears to do what is stated but it made my face break out as in an acne attack and after 5 days i have not got my face to clear up.</li>
            <li> Not only does it hurt like crazy, it&#x27;s incredibly time consuming.</li>
            <li> Also I thought it would last forever and pull everything out fast..</li>
            <li> Four stars for a working product; I had to skip the fifth star because the pain level completely took me by surprise.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions completely and it caused a severe reaction on my face.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and do not have acne and</li>
            <li> Not only is this product over priced (its just a spring with handles) it does not work very well</li>
            <li> it really hurt and it only owrked on the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of the cheap ones just to compare and they ended up in the garbage, they didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> but I really had to keep on it because it felt like stubble when it would grow back in.  </li>
            <li> As  far as the pain goes, you get used to it after using for a while</li>
            <li> upper lip and chin, this contraption hurts like crazy :) but it sure does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bellabe facial hair remover really does the job.  </li>
            <li> One can twist their fingers whilst moving this wand, but only just so fast.</li>
            <li> Stay away if you are sensitive like me, otherwise this product does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or are adverse to feeling pain, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> But I had my old one for almost two years</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> My problem is that I must have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using wax strips for sensitive skin, but it would still break me out and break me out in rashes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The hair does seem to grow back finer but the product really does have to be used a minimum of once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> also recommend that you don&#x27;t use it near your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t use it near the lips.  </li>
            <li> Bells be Facial Hair Remover really works, inwantbyou know that.</li>
            <li> have found the Bellabe very helpful, do not use on an infected area such as a pimple.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised - doesn&#x27;t get them all</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and waxing and tweezing make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have tried tweezers (which is a real pain, as the hairs come in so white</li>
            <li> but my eyebrows are nearly nonexistent (sigh).</li>
            <li> It was completely bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The maintenance and upkeep is much, much, much simpler than the initial removal.</li>
            <li> I still sneeze every time I get near the nose area.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use n buy when this one becomes old</li>
            <li> It really pulls unwanted hair on upper lips and below.</li>
            <li> I just would not recommend it to people who have sensitive skin and do not do well with the results of plucking.</li>
            <li> Its very inexpensive and low tech...</li>
            <li> so far i haven&#x27;t seen any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> I have professional hair removal services for years including laser and electrolysis.</li>
            <li> So far it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Compared to tweezing individual hairs, this is amaaazingly fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with solutions for hair removal because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s doing whole sections at the same time, unlike tweezing them one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not give me any bumps or marks.</li>
            <li> I have to remove the hair with the root because mine grows back too fast</li>
            <li> So far I have found none of those reviews to be my case.</li>
            <li> but after feeling how soft my face felt it motivated me to keep going.</li>
            <li> , of course, didn&#x27;t notice anything amiss, and told my wife whatever she was concerned about was completely unnoticable.  </li>
            <li> The results last a lot longer than alternative methods and it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I am still dealing with the after effects.</li>
            <li> I also really like that even though its pulling hairs out of my face it doesn&#x27;t actually irritate my skin which I do have sensitive skin so that actually surprised me.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> It looks like I have natural &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; like I had before menopause.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has a problem with facial hair and wants to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Better late than hairy.</li>
            <li> It really hurts when using it, and does not take off enough hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use depilatory creams because,... refer to the sensitive skin issue...</li>
            <li> with my reading glasses on naturally.  </li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this product to any girl who wants to get rid of their facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is fast and convenient, it does sting some on the upper lip but you&#x27;re ripping out hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too busy for that.</li>
            <li> It eveng grabs short hair once you really get the hang of how to use.</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive to pain I would pass.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, get this.  </li>
            <li> it took two weeks for it to clear completely up.  </li>
            <li> Olay facial hair remover burnt my face despite using the balm etc and it doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Remember to twist the ends near the hairs.</li>
            <li> It totally removes unwanted hair but, it really hurts.  </li>
            <li> I used to do threading but cant find a place that does it near me.</li>
            <li> I just put some ice cubes in a plastic bag and apply to the sensitive areas for 10-15 seconds before I remove the hair.</li>
            <li> long since suffered from blonde peach fuzz pretty much all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Wait at least two days before doing more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem reasonable to have my entire face waxed for that purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my stepson was about 7 years old, he asked me if &amp;#34;girls can grow beards.&amp;#34; He obviously saw the light blonde fuzz on my jawline where men would have an actual beard.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get the smaller hair that I have..</li>
            <li> This thing grabs tiny hairs that I didn&#x27;t even knew were there, it really made a difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Works really well on peach fuzz and gets it off without  visual irritation!</li>
            <li> Because my skin is so sensitive, I can&#x27;t use wax or chemicals.  </li>
            <li> By using this at home I have completely eliminated breakouts after hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for removing facial hair both visible and invisible.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to complete the task, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Works very well on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when ALL the hair was removed,</li>
            <li> and I frequently have my legs waxed.  </li>
            <li> No reaction afterward, even though I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It takes a short time to master the technique, but it is worth every second.</li>
            <li> Anyway...it has trouble with the more coarse hairs and you&#x27;ll probably have to continue plucking those with tweezers (i do).  </li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve had minor burns from wax that was too hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ended up randomly finding this product because it is totally worth the money &amp; it doesn&#x27;t use chemicals.</li>
            <li> Worth the try since it&#x27;s not much to buy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not into buying expensive waxing tools or trying the  chemical hair removals, this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I have too many thick rooted chin hair</li>
            <li> It kinda felt good in a weird way around the chin area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, I still had to get out my trusty tweezers to finish things up, but all in all it did a good job.</li>
            <li> and it is able to remove all the thick hairs.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face, and its not dark, and in most lights not super noticeable, but in certain lighting its obvious and the hairs look long, and there are alot.</li>
            <li> Now when I use Bellabe, the hairs come out easily and there is very little pain.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little room, which makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other similar spring hair removers and Bellabe is the one that grabs the most hair and actually pulls them out from the roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a little tingle when I used it to remove the hair on my ears that fell from my head and stuck.</li>
            <li> (I caught both the fine light hairs on my cheeks and upper lip and few course dark hairs that spout on my chin from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair over parts of my face, and I have dark, coarse hair directly over my lips, and I have what you&#x27;d call &#x27;fuzz&#x27; over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Works well for fine hair, not so much for coarse, small hair.</li>
            <li> I also like it is small and easy to throw in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very inexpensive, especially compared to other hair removal methods, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Its not pain free, but the more you use it, the less pain you feel (the longer hairs are more painful, and anything on the upper lip).  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little at first, but it gets rid of hair VERY efficiently and from the roots.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no chemicals involved, no mess, no microwaving, no nicks or cuts.   </li>
            <li> IT hurts like plucking or waxing but no mess like waxing</li>
            <li> There is no mess</li>
            <li> After just a few hair pulls I decided the beauty wasn&#x27;t worth the pain in this case!</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was kind of a fail because it didn&#x27;t really work as easy as people decribed it..or at least it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> Take my word, it is completely worth the quick tugs and tingles.my eyes water and my skin slightly pink, but there was little evidence of damage.</li>
            <li> I does the job just fine with very little pain.</li>
            <li> It got all those little hairs right off!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, baby white haor on my upper lip and chin (getting older sucks) and waxing and creams tend to make me swell up because my skin is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I know this all sounds like the most time consuming, ridiculous routine ever, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight stinging sensation, and I had to tweeze the smaller hairs (which there weren&#x27;t that many), but it works overall!</li>
            <li> Overall, really decent product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you tied up your hair and slick back hair and sideburn hair that you want to keep!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the handles on this wonderful device are one of the substances I&#x27;m not able to touch.</li>
            <li> Honestly I need to numb the skin with ice first to make it easier to get thru.</li>
            <li> As ladies grow older, and I assume men, also, pesky facial hair appears in unwanted places.</li>
            <li> Though I was somewhat hesitant at first to believe it would work, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.</li>
            <li> received the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover in return for a realistic review.</li>
            <li> The only complain is that after I used this product I broke out, but that is mainly because of my skin not the product itself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the clear barely there hairs that come in; they&#x27;re natural.</li>
            <li> so I have a decent amount of darker hair on my face that I wanted to get rid of on the chin, upper lip, cheeks, sideburns, and temples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some people thought this wouldn&#x27;t hurt any more than regular threading</li>
            <li> Yes, it stings at first, but the pain only lasts for a second.</li>
            <li> I did break out alittle bit after the first time but since then i try to do a facial mask on the same day that i use the Bellabe</li>
            <li> It is a quiet little tool that actually removes the facial hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> It does sting a little bit but not badly.</li>
            <li> And other reviewers are right...</li>
            <li> good news is that it really works, and it isn&#x27;t bad after the first go so long as you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any lady having problems with hair on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, I have read mixed reviews</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when looking for a safer facial hair remover, especially with this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.</li>
            <li> I bought a soft toothbrush for a child, then use alcohol &amp; gently wipe dry.</li>
            <li> One downside was that a two days later I broke out in fine little pimples on my cheek where I plucked out my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have little fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> The main problem with permanent hair removal is new follicles are constantly being stimulated and the hair removal battle is never totally won.</li>
            <li> , so I can use it while catching up on the news on TV--which is much more painful than the Bellabe could ever be!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well and takes a long time.</li>
            <li> have small light hairs and they were removed well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for those who have wanted facial hair; laser treatments can be expensive, and you have to go back for repeated treatments.</li>
            <li> No more looking like the bearded lady when the light hits my face.</li>
            <li> no dark mark</li>
            <li> Im trying to get rid of them, for my skin to go back to normal.</li>
            <li> Some areas are really not painful at all, but other areas (like the upper lip) are pretty rough.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was fully prepared to hate this product because it just looked too simple to be effective.</li>
            <li> It is so bendy that it&#x27;s hard to get the hair on certain locations and while some areas took out quite a bit of hair, the fight isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to master the way it works, but the results are very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This little tool was quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> Anyone reading this may be thinking, &amp;#34;Whoa, calm down there, Haus.</li>
            <li> Yeah right, how can something simple as this spring remove my facial hair, let alone the really tiny baby hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will not use it on as it seems especially painful, most notable right underneath my nose</li>
            <li> (NE and NW), and emerge a little while later with skin as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use...not as easy as it makes it seem.</li>
            <li> There were a few spots on my face that made me wince (like high cheekebone closer to under eye) but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Pulling out hair from the root, especially around sensitive lip area is painful, but the price we pay for good grooming!  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be effective (other than under the jawline), but needs to be used for a few minutes daily.  </li>
            <li> June treated me with such kindness, I felt like I made a new friend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young adult, and I started noticing hair on my upper and lower lip when I was around 12.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t expect to feel it so much having waxed and tweezed almost daily for around two years prior.</li>
            <li> After constant use of Bellabe I noticed my hair stopped growing back out as much</li>
            <li> The results are well worth the slight tingly-stingy sensation.  </li>
            <li> Now I pay only $8 for eyebrow threading, thanks to Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.</li>
            <li> Just roll in one direction and go slow, it will grab those coarse hairs if you are patient with them, these hurt more to pull out.</li>
            <li> I focus mostly on my upper and lower lips, and use tweezers for the more stubborn ones that are thick and deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable when you use it the first time, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze and extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tweeze-it kind of gal, but some angles I just couldn&#x27;t reach, and I was tired of breaking hairs and the resulting facial eruptions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of my makeup sitting on top of my fine, little, blonde baby hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> As the hair grows back in, I&#x27;m sure there will be less to remove in a single instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the same reaction my very sensitive skin has to tweezing and threading.</li>
            <li> Not only was waxing costly, but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I am not tough enough to let hair be pulled from chin on a regular.</li>
            <li> I would like to use it again, but my general instincts won&#x27;t let me because it hurts!</li>
            <li> Removing hair this way it pretty painful, but it does get better over time and it really works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty painful but in the end when you have smooth skin and no traces of hair, it makes the pain worth it.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times, it is still quite painful but does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This leaves me with essentially no other option but tweezing and plucking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I used to walk around with my visible mustache apparently, but now it is gone!</li>
            <li> Another major drawback</li>
            <li> Definitely a little tricky to get use to but works better than expected!</li>
            <li> The coil did not  grip facial hair tightly enough to effect consistent removal on the facial areas that needed it.</li>
            <li> I have always have trouble with hair on my chin and lip and wanted something that worked better than Nair or the other facial hair remover because the hair always came back really think.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to other women who have sensitive, delicate skin, and are looking for a simple and effective hair removal device such as this one.</li>
            <li> I do have to get after a few hair the good old fashion tweezers route, although less than usual when I use this facial hair remover first.</li>
            <li> I also love using it on my cheeks, sideburn area and up into the baby hairs around my forehead, you just need to be careful and go slow there, but the hair ends up growing back so much slower.  </li>
            <li> Found my new facial hair remover, way better than using creams or worse</li>
            <li> However it is pretty painful which you get used to the more you use it !</li>
            <li> if u hve fine hair its must, but thick hair forget it.</li>
            <li> I have lots of those little middle age fine, feathery white hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little time but worth the price.</li>
            <li> It will take you a minute or two to get the hang of it but its worth the little bit of effort.  </li>
            <li> This little gem is worth</li>
            <li> I did do some upper lip but that seriously hurt so much more than the chin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first because the hair I have is fine but noticeable</li>
            <li> Using tweezers takes too long and an epilator hurts too much on certain areas and leaves red spots.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting me as much as waxing has in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tiny tiny blonde hairs on my face that you can see in certain lighting.</li>
            <li> Now although &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; sounds silly considering the fact that yes, it is not painless (in fact, the first time I used it I had to gain a little extra courage by drinking a glass of wine first)</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a tad bit naive in thinking that it would be pain free</li>
            <li> but overtime it becomes bearable, although I seem to have quite the tolerance when it comes to plucking in general.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;trouble spots&amp;#34; were just mainly my upper lip and over near my side burns.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t left any irritation on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets purchasing it</li>
            <li> While it is nowhere near painless, it is simple once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).    </li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional facial threading done before and it brought tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am Italian, and contrary to old wives tales</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and the irritation from pulling multiple hairs at once did cause a lot of redness.</li>
            <li> and I have chin fuzz that I completely got rid of with this Bellabe facial hair remover.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of really coarse ones that the Bellabe pulled with no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Bellabe for facial hair removal if you skin is too sensitive for hair removal creams (mine skin burns) or shaving leaves that spikey feeling and shadow.</li>
            <li> but they could also burned the skin if not careful.  </li>
            <li> its back to the salon for me and getting the natural threading done, was hoping to save my self some money by using this tool.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal product.  </li>
            <li> I know you are currently picturing Mrs. Doubtfire, I assure you I am far hotter than she.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tweezed, used facial epiladors, shaved, had professional treatments, use a myriad of delipatory type products--</li>
            <li> always felt self conscious about my facial hair when talking to someone closely.</li>
            <li> but after that it barely stings  </li>
            <li> Tried it out last week and my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> The key is to use it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised this actually works, but it does not remove all of the hairs even if I go over an area for 30 min.  </li>
            <li> can truly report that it works,works fine,requires no real effort and without that peach fuzz,my complexion looks much</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think I could tolerate it, however, after several tries, I bit the bullet and went for it.</li>
            <li> It took several tries to figure out exactly how to use it, but one you master the learning curve, it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that you can become used to it over time, but I kinda don&#x27;t care for unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> A few things, it is effective in getting small hairs and pulling them out.</li>
            <li> this thing is kind of silly.  </li>
            <li> It took a few goes to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s well worth the patience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful at all (no more than tweezing anyway).</li>
            <li> I hated using hair removal creams that contained chemicals - the Bellabe was the perfect find!!  </li>
            <li> okay but not great,</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive fair skin, which makes hair removal very difficult.</li>
            <li> My face did get a little red but it quickly faded.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find waxing to be less painful and more effective.</li>
            <li> By far the most painful area was right under the nose.</li>
            <li> Although they say to replace it every year, I have used mine now for a couple of years, and only recently noticed that I am in need of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bleaching creams that weren&#x27;t effective for very long, plus were irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair plucked the first time you use it, but it de-hairs enough that you won&#x27;t feel embarrassed about going out into the sun and worrying your face is starting to resemble a hairy gorilla!</li>
            <li> I have even used it for 3 weeks straight and although it hurts less with frequent use, well...</li>
            <li> (I thought slightly more so than waxing), but after a few uses, my skin got used the process and hurt much less.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t have the proper technique down right</li>
            <li> Although the upper lip hair didn&#x27;t grow back darker, I have very sensitive skin there, and it would get irritated.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot get my upper lip waxed because I leave the salon with a red mustache.  </li>
            <li> At first it hurts, but the hurts get less and it pulls out the hair.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, but wow, the results!</li>
            <li> I had assumed that my peach fuzz (which seemed to magically appear as I grew older and had kids) was something that could only be dealt with via prescription or expensive waxing.  </li>
            <li> It pretty much removed everything except some very tiny stubs which are hard to see.  </li>
            <li> and it has pulled out all the fine hairs as well as the occasional thick hairs that sprout up under my chin.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It does do the job though, but its hard to clean.</li>
            <li> A little bit of pain involved, but no where near as much as pulling those fellers out one by one.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and is way faster than other methods.</li>
            <li> This hurts but so worth it because it removed every little hair from my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The instructions also say that the device lasts about 6-9 months, which is not bad for something that costs a lot less than a single salon waxing.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest and say that it&#x27;s really more of a horrible ripping sensation!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, you could probably see if this product will work for you by taking a cheap spring out of one of your home electronics and rolling over your skin...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 4 years now on my upper and lower lip, and i have not had problems so far.</li>
            <li> i am italian and 28 years old and suddenly getting neck and chin hairs</li>
            <li> Also, while my face gets red (it&#x27;s sooooo sensitive) with this it gets red too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely painless, but if you are used to waxing and tweezing, this is definitely preferable, especially because it won&#x27;t tear and burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dealing with trying to get rid of facial hair with less than good results, so I went ahead and bought it based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> .. more of an annoying sting that you will come to enjoy as you revel in the baby smoothness that it uncovers...</li>
            <li> Wasted money over the years with waxing which would turn my skin red and not be much fun.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit red right after I use it</li>
            <li> So over time this little dude will quickly pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li> So over time this little dude will quickly pay for itself in the long run.</li>
            <li> First I started on areas with little to no hair (my nose and under my eyes...</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little at first</li>
            <li> yes it stings a little at first, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> first it does hurt a little, like ripping off tape.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend for someone who is willing to put a little time in.</li>
            <li> Hurt a little when I first started using, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened up the package I saw a little spring with plastic</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to the stinging sensation at first</li>
            <li> it does hurt a little bit at first</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little the first time you try it or use it</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit at first</li>
            <li> The hairs come out easily and there is very little pain, my skin is so soft and smooth, no more embarrassment when I go out in public worrying about if people can see those little chin hairs!</li>
            <li> It gets the thick, coarse hairs and well as the short, fine ones.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, all 970 of them, thereabouts, and heeded the advice given about the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; and the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and the \\&quot;PAIN\\&quot; and I am here to tell you that this is NOTHING compared to the Epilady, this is FAR easier than that moment that you wait for the muslin wax strips to be ripped off your face and little blood spots to appear, and this is INFINATELY easier than natural childbirth.</li>
            <li> But while using Bellabe, it did pull out every single hair whether it was super short or average length.</li>
            <li> I can imagine that it feels the same as waxing but isn&#x27;t that quick rip that waxing provides (haven&#x27;t waxed so not sure).</li>
            <li> I did have a few small red bumps the first two weeks, but my skin quickly adjusted</li>
            <li> This item is fast and gets the job done fast, and gives ultra smooth results, but is incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> There are times where I have gotten pimples in the area where I removed the hair, I don&#x27;t know if that is because I have oily skin in general, or I didn&#x27;t cleanse the area enough before hand.  </li>
            <li> I generally use an electric epi that works on a similar principle</li>
            <li> Since my chemo I have had real problems with facial hair due to the damage to my system.</li>
            <li> On a scale of one to ten with 10 being the excruciating and 1 being barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll go back to ignoring my facial hair, thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> Now yes it hurt on sensitive spots like my upper lip but after a few times the pain didn&#x27;t bother me so much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but if this can be of help to one woman it will have been worth it.  </li>
            <li> I had a few bumps the first couple of times, but now it doesn&#x27;t even cause redness.</li>
            <li> I noticed a small break out (which is rare for me) where I did use the tool</li>
            <li> not sure if it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I always disliked that with wax you couldn&#x27;t wax twice, if it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair the first time.</li>
            <li> useful since it is small, so I can take it to travel.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> At first it hurts but after a few times you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I have hit the age where I unfortunately have way too many little hairs popping up, and this tool catches them all and pops them right out.</li>
            <li> initially had a little bit of difficulty working on the right side of my face, but no probs with the left side, But soon figured it out.</li>
            <li> so it was a bit uncomfortable getting the right side of my face since I&#x27;m right handed</li>
            <li> Not good because the hair grows back the moment you shave it off which feels like a fine stubble.</li>
            <li> Cold wax--didn&#x27;t grab the skin as well as the hot nor did it pull out the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Much faster than plucking, but no less or more painful.</li>
            <li> Do a little bit at a time the first time, just keep going back to it.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I did it, my skin was left red and a developed a couple small zits.</li>
            <li> pretty much it works if you combine it with other hair removal tactics :/</li>
            <li> It small and fits right in your purse so you can take it when you travel.</li>
            <li> If you have a high tolerance for sharp pinching pain, then I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using since the first time is the most painful so now its just upkeep.</li>
            <li> It is slightly cracked and less smooth from that brief</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s working, you&#x27;ll feel and see it gently grab all the hairs it can, slightly pulling your skin up as it goes.</li>
            <li> that vellus hairs are gone, too; it gives me a less furry, much smoother look in my magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> Leg hair and arm hair get irritating, but I can deal with that; shaving is an easy fix.</li>
            <li> This Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the true definition of no pain no gain and pain is beauty at least for</li>
            <li> There is a learing curve to using it, but I would say go slow, don&#x27;t expect to just quickly roll it over your face and have all your hair gone.     </li>
            <li> But, another day later, my entire chin and sides of my mouth and in between my eyesbrows were covered in whiteheads, a few very large zits, and a ton of smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I had no idea why, so I experimented and found out that the tool works if you hold the 1 in your left hand and the 2 in your right hand, and twist the handles inward (fingers toward each other, toward the center of the inverted U shape.)</li>
            <li> and I was afraid to put it in certain areas on my face because you need long straight strokes to make it halfway useful.  </li>
            <li> This is most painful on the upper lip when you first try it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For the first time using Bellabe, I found it was most painful on my upper lip close to the lip line.  </li>
            <li> For the coarse chin hairs, it removes 99%, for the tiny dark hairs, I just use the tweezers on those, but even so....it still make removal of those hairs so much easier than before.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you get near your eyebrows or lashes !</li>
            <li> lol.&lt;br /&gt;Had tried a face hair trimmer for peach fuzz previously which was fine except I had to do it every single day &amp; it would work that well in my chin, &amp; I tried The Epilady facial thing, that was difficult to use &amp; spent most of my time burning my face......</li>
            <li> Easily removes all those thin tiny lip hairs.</li>
            <li> I think perhaps removing those tiny hairs gives acne causing bacteria less to cling to, and less of a direct path right into my pores.</li>
            <li> The product only grabs about half the hairs, if you have that one stubborn hair that is hard to pull this item will not be able to pull it out.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about how much it would actually hurt after reading previous reviews but in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some people described.</li>
            <li> It gets the fine, thin hairs on my face that waxing would not remove.  </li>
            <li> There is a little sting, but no worse that waxing.  </li>
            <li> It is so much quicker than tweezing the little hairs off my face (unwanted ones here and there as well as the peach fuzz), and it is not waxing, which I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> , it does hurt a little bit, but it&#x27;s really no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> For the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; don&#x27;t curve the spring so much, level it out a little, twirl, then bend.  </li>
            <li> really like this little gadget.</li>
            <li> It really feels like a little tingle as it pulls the hairs out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this device really does work in removing the majority of those little fuzzies,</li>
            <li> It works very well for but not for my daughter who has a little darker hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I bought mine and tried it, I brought it to work for other people to see -- it was a new thing for all of us.</li>
            <li> Only the fine thin baby hairs removed, and with bearable pain while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Be certain to twist each handle at the same time, firmly, as you roll it against the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> Just absolutely brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems like a solid little device.</li>
            <li> Could be coincidence, but whatever the case, this weird little thing has me hooked for good.</li>
            <li> After the first initial use of the product, I did notice less hair and the hair that did come in was by far less coarse.  </li>
            <li> initially bought this because as I get older, I&#x27;ve been getting some dark hairs above my upper lip (gross) and wax makes me red for days</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, good &amp; bad, about this product, I decided to take a chance &amp; give it a try.</li>
            <li> it was making my hair problem worse instead of better the return window was closed.</li>
            <li> For the upper lip this product worked fine, but for the chin where I had baby hairs, there are now dark thick hairs that grow regularly like a mans beard (not long but still</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older and don&#x27;t have the tight skin that younger women have....</li>
            <li> Hard to get all the angles right and takes time to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little the first few times, and it still does now and then, but since I have been looking so darned manly in the last few years, I&#x27;ve learned to muscle through the little pains. :)</li>
            <li> Hurts a reasonable amount, slightly less than threading for some reason but also a bit tougher to take since I&#x27;m doing it to myself!</li>
            <li> The past two days it has been less, but still more than I expected.</li>
            <li> But that is the only negative thing I have to say, and we all pay a price for beauty, right?  </li>
            <li> It really does the job - fast, easy and much less painful than waxing at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> and he was in absolute awe that such a small, simple looking gadget can produce such terrific results.</li>
            <li> it is the same familiar feeling perhaps worse if you are performing on yourself like I have done.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this tool ( Im a middle eastern mexican american chick in her late 20s)</li>
            <li> My skin was a little red where I removed a lot of hair, but it goes away after a few minutes like tweezing, and the more I use it, the less redness I notice.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the motion down, it only takes a few minutes to complete a job that used to take much longer with tweezing.</li>
            <li> and I always break out, due to my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin being quite sensitive eventually left those dark spots on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> The only hairs it hasn&#x27;t take care of are the really short ones that haven&#x27;t grown long enough after tweezing to allow the springs to grab them.</li>
            <li> At first, it made my eyes water and my skin slightly pink, but there was little evidence of damage.</li>
            <li> First time was a little rough until you get used to the sensation.</li>
            <li> No single hair tweeting that takes so long even if you can find them!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, no more pesky little facial hair, I followed the directions and it worked!</li>
            <li> The upper lip is especially sensitive, but I can put up with a few seconds of discomfort for beauty&#x27;s sake!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having trouble on how to use on my chin area since dat it one main concern</li>
            <li> It occasionally misses the thick course hair on the first try or two but with patience and practice it gets easier and easier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get a lot of smaller hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to latch on to hair in certain spots, but overall works really well.</li>
            <li> Hair removal was minimal and it took major time doing it.  </li>
            <li> It took me half and hour to 45 minutes to remove three the first time, and half an hour to remove two the second.  </li>
            <li> It hurt (my upper lip) like heck the first time, but no more mustache!  </li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting used to how much it hurts to use!</li>
            <li> I tweeze pretty often, but it can be time consuming and hard to get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Initially I tried waxing, both professional and at-home, tweezing for 30 minutes a day (shudder), shaving with those little facial hair razors, and even hair removers like Nair.</li>
            <li> Once you get the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of twirling the handles in your little fingers to produce the torqueing action of the spring enough to actually pull hairs, it&#x27;s a breeze.  </li>
            <li> What I wanted was a product that took most of the hair out, leaving only a little bit behind that had to be removed with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Dark hair appeared highlighted and not hidden!  </li>
            <li> : ) I think it&#x27;s less painful when I use it just after a hot shower when my pores are open.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve given me back 15 minutes of my life every single day, and my facial hair is GONE!  </li>
            <li> Growing old is not fun...</li>
            <li> I cried at least the first 3 times</li>
            <li> This product really gets the small hairs that you can never get or see with tweezers.</li>
            <li> The only downside is they get stretched out over time, so you will have to replace them every so often - well, that, and the pain...</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone sitting on the fence like I did for so long.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and will never want to be without them around the house, in the car, etc.</li>
            <li> I had struggled with facial hair for a long time...</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow long enough like you do for waxing.</li>
            <li> and I am not going to wait that long to let my facial hair grow!  </li>
            <li> Grabs those long and short hairs.  </li>
            <li> Redness doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as a wax either.</li>
            <li> wait as long as possible before using this product on my unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> which wasn&#x27;t worth the results of coarse hairs being left behind.</li>
            <li> But it hurts cuz it&#x27;s a pretty slow process..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Laser hair removal is effective but also very expensive and time consuming.</li>
            <li> I bought it because for the low price I thought it was worth a shot instead of waxing - which I find very hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe Facial Hair  Remover is inexpensive, and helps remove fine facial hair, but is not good for chin hairs or the occasional stiff single hair on the chin or upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use it as it turns my skin BRIGHT red, &amp; is very painful, however, I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but after the first time you use it there is less hair and therefor less pain.</li>
            <li> if you have never used this before this little gadget hurts like a mother at the beginning since you are dealing with a very sensitive area however your skin does get used to it, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, a bad guy friend of mine once told me that I should shave or do something to my mustache because he could easily see it and that crushed my confidence so much.</li>
            <li> Bellabe does irritate my sensitive skin, but alot less irritation than waxing or epilating, so I try to use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Does irritate my skin a  bit, but way less than my old hair removal creams.</li>
            <li> I think that it breaks less hairs, so I don&#x27;t have to repeat as frequently.  </li>
            <li> it is not effective in removing smaller hairs and takes way too much time to remove.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m using it wrong or if it really doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> It irritates my skin much less, it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now into my late teens and early adult years.  </li>
            <li> Waxing is faster but not worth the long term pre mature wrinkling effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have actually gone back to just plucking with a wide slant tweezer.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re like me, poor and in need of a quick hair removal fix, get this.</li>
            <li> but i still had to tweez after because you cant get the single tiny hairs with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it pull every single facial hair!  </li>
            <li> considered NoNo but price is too high, this works, a little getting used to but does the job!</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as waxing, and I get to keep my top layer of skin!  </li>
            <li> It is a little painful, similar to tweezing, but better in that it works much faster.  </li>
            <li> The upper lip area was sensitive, but with some practice and taking only small amounts at a time, had painless results.  </li>
            <li> However after a few tweezing strokes in the same area, you really get used to the little sting and it becomes no big deal.</li>
            <li> In total I had grown eight new cysts overnight, as well as a small scattering of whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really fine, pale blonde hair on my jawline all my life, and finally I&#x27;ve found something that removes it without irritating my face.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is painful at first, but you quickly get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> You may have a slight stinging sensation at first but after using it a few times it goes away.</li>
            <li> However, two days later I woke up to see my cheeks completely covered in big, red bumps and whiteheads--at least 10-15 whiteheads on each cheek.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day since different hairs grow on different cycles</li>
            <li> I am a Black, White,Spanish, and Chinese mixed female and I am hairy.</li>
            <li> But due to overall facial hair, I will be trying an epilator.  </li>
            <li> dunno - but after using this, my entire upper lip and corner lip area darkened dramatically due to bruising.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this little gadget worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li> : Definitely use multiple angles and make your skin as tight as possible.  </li>
            <li> You feel these little tugs on your skin as you pull out the hairs (which is a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it), and afterward it feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It hurt a little at first, but after a few beers, I don&#x27;t even feel it.  </li>
            <li> Those little coils sure do grab onto things, I mean hairs, and pull them out by their clingy little roots.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s a little hard to maneuver on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> when I first used it  - it was awkward but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> While effective, these methods can often prove to be painful and time consuming.</li>
            <li> While it is kind of painful, it&#x27;s not like the pain lasts</li>
            <li> After awhile the waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt but it sure is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Painful but effective.</li>
            <li> Laser treatment is even more painful and a heckuva lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was quite painful at first, but now that I have used it consistently for several weeks, the pain has reduced to a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> As an African American with dark hair and skin</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend waxing or plucking before using this product especially if you have dark hair.  </li>
            <li> ..was hoping it would take away the hair on my upper lip and after 2 hours of using it i still had alot of visual hair..really not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll deal with the pain, as long as it does</li>
            <li> Recently I learned about Bellabe on a shopping channel web site and became curious as to whether it would be a viable alternative for me.  </li>
            <li> If you wait close to 3 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t remove it all, but if you wait too long it burns your skin along with removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have the rough fuzzy hairs, (or shadow),  that is left by shaving.  </li>
            <li> Gave it a four because it does take several tries to get some hairs</li>
            <li> I expected this product to feel about the same, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It would take too long, but it does work.</li>
            <li> produce a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too big and not precise enough, it didn&#x27;t even really pick up on the small hair in between my brows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange.</li>
            <li> expect to be using this once a day for a long time.</li>
            <li> After removing it from the packaging, you see the the long spiral coil with two handles on either end.</li>
            <li> But didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to share that I will be a life long customer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use it for long cause my wrists hurt, but it works and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is about the size of a long pencil and comes in a reusable plastic tube with a set of printed instructions.</li>
            <li> I like using it in tandem with regular tweezers for harder to pluck hair.</li>
            <li> What I do care about is how long it takes to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I used to spend a long time sitting at my dressing table tweezing away and it was tiring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a keeper for me, and its a fraction of what I have spent over the years on hair facial removal products.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long to try it.</li>
            <li> There is a minor stinging sensation as the hair is pulled from its roots, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> This product also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Mine have lasted a long time</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to wait until it grows long again to use it.  </li>
            <li> All I can say now is, why did it take me so long to find you?  </li>
            <li> This product resembles a long spring.</li>
            <li> After that, they grow back at different rates, so you only have to remove a few at a time.  </li>
            <li> I want to remove the hair before it gets that long.</li>
            <li> Hair stays away for long periods of time,for  about 6 to 9 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the least expensive kind next time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to remove larger sections of hair, I believe this works, but it did work  in difficult areas like right under my chin to get to the short, stray hairs.</li>
            <li> But I got tired of the hair growing back so dark and so quickly, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so much better than with dry cold skin.</li>
            <li> It is painful when you start pulling out the hair, but the redness disappears quickly and the pain dissipates as fast.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISPLEASED with the product, please be careful if you decide to use and try a small patch first.</li>
            <li> This little tool works really well if you let it grow a little bit</li>
            <li> Does not hurt like waxing and not half as messy.</li>
            <li> Only negative may be that it can be a little tricky to master it at first</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I was in a panic at the sight of major strays between threadings!  </li>
            <li> and when I check the mirror later I find little if any hairs left</li>
            <li> Gets those pesky hairs, although underneath the chin is a little more difficult than the other facial areas.</li>
            <li> in other words - I was stalling!)...and worked up to my upper lip...</li>
            <li> Wayyy better than any of those expensive machines!</li>
            <li> I use it for the little white facial muctache that I can see that i have once every 3 month, but nobody else notice but it drives me nuts.</li>
            <li> Once I had the hair removed I simply use it every other day to do maintenance and upkeep.</li>
            <li> In turn, I&#x27;ve told several other friends about Bellabe -</li>
            <li> I can only do a little bit every/every other day, because I can&#x27;t take the pain, especially the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> The only drawbacks I found with it is that you can ONLY use the coil for lip/chin/cheek areas, and NOT on eyebrows, legs, etc, and that it does take a little bit longer than waxing to get to end result.</li>
            <li> For $15, this tool pays for itself if you get regular waxes or buy depilatory kits, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the cons that some other methods do (stinging, smell, cleanup, skin darkening, etc.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I just started growing some little hairs above my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I have used Nads and other chemical facial hair removers</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews for a product similar to this</li>
            <li> and I get lots of facial hair due to my hormones being unbalanced.</li>
            <li> Also the other reviews say that the hair didn&#x27;t grow back.......</li>
            <li> After I finished, my upper lip was a little irritated and red</li>
            <li> It always made me break out, so as excited as I was to try it, fail.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t know how long its been around!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to using any other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer this to waxing or any other hair removal.</li>
            <li> Using different angles is extremely effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a little silly, but the pictures have always shown more than one hair remover in it.</li>
            <li> Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it grabs all the hairs, fast and gets them out of there.</li>
            <li> Then I used the Bellabe on my dry face.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a peel to remove dry skin, and stumbled upon this by accident.  </li>
            <li> but it only got more painful.</li>
            <li> Mainly because they were not as visible and it is tougher (for me at least) to thighten the skin in this area.    </li>
            <li> BUT I did use it just now and holy cow, you don&#x27;t know how much facial peach fuzz you have until your rip it out.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been the same since I waxed only a few times.  </li>
            <li> After the initial use of removing the hair, I now just do touchups that only takes a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Although the waxing worked on my upper lip (which now doesn&#x27;t grow in as heavy as my chin/neck area), my chin hair kept coming back.</li>
            <li> This twirls the spring, and as it grazes your skin it will snag those little suckers and pluck them right from their hair follicle source.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on my upper lip, though I do have to use tweezers to pluck a few hairs that is left behind.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t try to get every single hair at each sitting, but I probably use it every day.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to spend hours trying to get every single area,</li>
            <li> Also it takes forever to get every single hair -</li>
            <li> It is going to sting in places, and be a little more painful in sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> I love this little spring!I have suffered with facial hair that drove me crazy for years.</li>
            <li> There are still a few hairs I have to pull out with tweezers, under the chin mainly, the skin is a little loser there.</li>
            <li> I have had dark facial hair since age 12</li>
            <li> Do not fool yourself if you have dark or coarse hair that this will work.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would remove dark hair on mu upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I do not normally have the time to write reviews</li>
            <li> dark, deeply rooted hairs resisted the Bellabe, tweezers required.</li>
            <li> and they said it would work on coarse dark hair....</li>
            <li> It barely pulled out a few hairs</li>
            <li> Menopause has not been kind to me and the peach fuzz on my face was making me CRAZY!</li>
            <li> For $15 bucks, you can&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> I have found I have to use it less and less frequently.</li>
            <li> My Husband says that I don&#x27;t need it and that we have facial hair for a reason(such a down to earth man) but being the &amp;#34;silly&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Next, roll THE HANDLES between your fingers and just move the coil up and down the area of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> For hair that I haven&#x27;t waxed as much in the past, I get a little bit of the pulling sensation (like tweezing) but in spots that I always target it is virtually painless.  </li>
            <li> Actual product was a single in black.</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation (of the hairs being ripped out by their roots) is brief, and the slight reddening of the skin (as a result of the hairs being ripped out by thier roots) is temporary.</li>
            <li> I would say it hurts about the same or a bit less than threading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was smelly, messy and results didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> There is only a slight pinching when I use it now, but it still removes all of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin became a lot softer and my wrinkles less deep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this - I was able to trap only a couple of hairs with Bellabe.</li>
            <li> I still like it though, but it takes a while to actually get all of the hair, and is definitely less efficient then waxing.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon and found the Bellabe Facial hair remover for less than 20% the cost of the TV product.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy with a slight uni-brow and hair growing on my upper cheek.</li>
            <li> And the bruising took weeks to even minimally diminish and even now, months after this experience, my upper lip area remains sensitive and faintly discolors following tweezing, which had never been the case prior to using the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> I also think it might have left some small  bumps on my upper lip</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this technique in general is trying to focus in on one lone hair, Perhaps, I&#x27;ve not quite mastered the technique yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;d tried the Nair type creams, only to feel like it was burning off my skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next day on Sunday I had a small pimple appear on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Totally does the job, is inexpensive and small enough to stick in your purse or toiletry bag for travel.</li>
            <li> I would say each time you use it lasts about a week and half before you start noticing hair coming back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping in time it comes back thinner and less often, a hope I will cling to.  </li>
            <li> I would probably buy this type of facial hair remover again if I found one that costs less.</li>
            <li> But I noticed that there is less hair on my upper lips.</li>
            <li> It pulled a lot and even after three weeks of pain, there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in less hair coming back</li>
            <li> Now, in a minute or less, I can remove all my facial hair without a mirror!!  </li>
            <li> This hurts a bit, but leaves me with only slight redness.  </li>
            <li> I usually do threading to get rid of hair on upper lips or occasionally just tweeze.</li>
            <li> but  not for nearly as long as with other methods.</li>
            <li> The only downside is they need to be replaced about every month to keep a tight spring.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t stretch my skin tight enough for the Bellabe to grip the hairs - it just sinks into the cheek hollows.</li>
            <li> This is a little hard to use--sometimes it works, sometimes not so much.  </li>
            <li> little ice afterward and the red disappears.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve since realized that it hurt because Bellabe was picking up ALL of the tiny little hairs that I couldn&#x27;t grab with my tweezers.</li>
            <li> , I can actually see the little root ball attached to the hair.  </li>
            <li> Cheek/chin just a little pain occasionally.</li>
            <li> This little Bellabe removes ALL facial hair without a problem!</li>
            <li> Of course it smarts a little doing the upper lip...</li>
            <li> It left some little irritated bumps on my face...</li>
            <li> I notice that my hair took a little longer to grow back</li>
            <li> My face gets a little red</li>
            <li> Gets all the little hairs around my jaw line, chin, upper lip</li>
            <li> This little guy definitely takes care of the strays.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have a little pull than facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I need to use it at night, because it sometimes makes my face a little irritated, red for 30 minutes max, but I use it once/</li>
            <li> Also, those little frizzy sideburn hairs... clip those back</li>
            <li> It even got the little peach fuzz from my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It hurts EVERY time you use it and it does leave your skin a little red.  </li>
            <li> Hurts a little, but definitely removes hair when used correctly.</li>
            <li> Ladies this is a must have, it removes those little pesky facial hairs like no ones business.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I will feel a little snag but don&#x27;t think it pulled out any hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to shaving as this little jewel just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> It works well and gets the little tiny hairs.  </li>
            <li> Thick, thin, fine hair, it grabs it all.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very thick from over 14 years of shaving, so it does really hurt</li>
            <li> So much money wasted on going to the parlors!!!    </li>
            <li> It does hurt a little, but that&#x27;s only to be expected because all hair removal hurts.</li>
            <li> , it was a little awkward trying to get  both hands to do the twisting motion between my fingers and then making sure that I was continuing to turn the handles when I placed the Bellabe on my face.  </li>
            <li> WOW I hardly ever need to use a tweezers  </li>
            <li> Other devices that are similar, you are subject to NO choice.  </li>
            <li> (Perhaps it isn&#x27;t as bad once it&#x27;s used more often).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, painful at times</li>
            <li> Was it any more painful than a wax - not really.</li>
            <li> more painful than waxing and plucking.</li>
            <li> It is painful, but most hair removal tools are.  </li>
            <li> Works ok but is painful.  </li>
            <li> It is probably the most painful hair removal method I have tried.</li>
            <li> However, it is more painful and takes longer than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was painful because it was removing so many hairs at once.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> It is quite painful, but I like it better than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> This manual device makes for a slower, more painful experience.</li>
            <li> Works great, but very painful to use!</li>
            <li> Can be slightly painful, but I mostly use tweezers.</li>
            <li> Of course this is not \\&quot;painless\\&quot; but it hurts the least on the upper lip and doesn&#x27;t leave red, sore areas.</li>
            <li> difficult to use, even with practiced technique, very time consuming and seems that all the hair is not removed, will be going back to waxing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this simple device really works.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that this particular aspect of life is not pleasant, no matter what one uses.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can keep using it long enough to toughen up my skin.</li>
            <li> It says it needs to be replaced every 6-9 months, at that rate I would consider the ones that are only a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Mastering the technique only took a few minutes and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Have had my facial fuzz waxed a few times, but this will eliminate these trips not to mention the expense of waxing.</li>
            <li> I had to work harder to remove the hairs on the lower chin area.  </li>
            <li> and it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I can use it as often as I like and after a few times of use, it seems some of the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back.  </li>
            <li> It does remove hair, but only a few at a time.</li>
            <li> The pain is minimal and just depends on the sensitivity of the area you are working on.  </li>
            <li> expected it to hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I got one in pink.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because it doesnt remove all the hair (not that i expected it to).</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with facial hair my whole life, and worse after my hysterectomy a few years ago (extending from just the lip to all over...ugh).  </li>
            <li> I was curious about this product.  </li>
            <li> This tool works, it will remove the hairs and it only stings for a few split seconds, part of reach</li>
            <li> I note in the reviews that some people are having trouble with coarse hairs, but I had none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful to not remove your eyelashes or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> and it only takes a few minutes to get the hairs that have grown in that time frame.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, if you have any unwanted hair on your neck, I had a much harder time making the thing work.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to avoid sitting, getting it wet, exercising, douching, tampons, perfumes, and have to keep it elevated.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wash it though because the instructions warn against getting it wet.  </li>
            <li> For a few sessions after that, I sneezed constantly.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to get the hang of it, but once I did all the facial hair was gone in about 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I expected to save some money.</li>
            <li> The longer hairs are gone, but getting it to work on the chin and neck are harder for me</li>
            <li> Only took a few mins for me to get used to it.</li>
            <li> It does not work with course hair and works minimally with anything else.</li>
            <li> So i ordered this and recieved it a few days later, just in time to use the night before school started.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is soft, white and difficult to locate which can be problematic for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the initial twisting I was missing</li>
            <li> I would not want to be without it, and so I have a few extra on hand.  </li>
            <li> With Bellabe, it takes only a few minutes before bed</li>
            <li> Not really as advertised.</li>
            <li> the pain was not a real issue.</li>
            <li> which only took me a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am light/medium skin and was pink after, but when I woke in the morning there was not scarring or pink areas</li>
            <li> I tried it out last month when I had a few days off from work.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m going back to my smelly, messy creams.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie to you, it does hurt, it essentially feels like tweezing, except you can get quite a few hairs in every go.</li>
            <li> The creams were too harsh on my skin, and I had red blotches</li>
            <li> My friends are making fun of me, I&#x27;m so addicted to this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> It misses quite a few really short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I was curious, though, and since it was so affordable I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Bellabe leaves absolutely no redness.  </li>
            <li> Although I used it in a proper manner, I had to go over the hair quite a few times before it would pull some of them out.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Bellabe a few times now</li>
            <li> It is much harder tyo use than they said it was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have so much hair and my hair are thin</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t get the thin one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You can literally use the Bellabe with your eyes closed.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Rachel Ray show a few years back.</li>
            <li> I only have a few stubborn but noticeable hairs.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the hang of operating it (a simple twist of the wrist)</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how to actually move it</li>
            <li> I think the more I use this product, the less painful it will get because I won&#x27;t let the hair get so long.</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week just to check and remove any hairs that are growing back in, and that takes less than a minute!  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe I spend $30/wk for facial hair removal previous to finding this product!</li>
            <li> I certainly never would want to SHAVE for heaven sakes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a good idea because while it did numb it, the cold ice will actually close your pores tighter making the hair more difficult to pull out.     </li>
            <li> This keeps me from breaking out, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve waxed everything on my body and this is far more painful.  </li>
            <li> Just like most of the other reviews,  I too found this painful to use the 1st time.  </li>
            <li> Ive bought 3 of these spring threaders and he other two only cost a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I must warn you though, the first time you use it it is a little painful depending on how much hair you&#x27;re removing.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have small little patches where the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back, so</li>
            <li> I have ridiculous amounts of extra fuzzies for a female.  </li>
            <li> it just depends mainly on how tough the hair is.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little a first, but not any worse than plucking.</li>
            <li> I had course thick dark hair above my upper lip and on chin.  </li>
            <li> Take one end of the Bellabe between your teeth and pull the Bellabe slightly with the other hand to stretch it out only slightly.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I broke out and some areas but after using it every other day-ish and its thin or little hair.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dark hairs under my chin and this works...except for those last few hairs that I have to pluck.</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of tears because the entire first week of my senior year ive had hideous skin and crazy amounts of whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty inconvenient, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> It does however find all the finest hairs I never even noticed, so now I got a fine beard growing back, not just a few annoying facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this simple little tool works!</li>
            <li> But after using this product once, the area I used it on broke out in tiny little pimples!</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts just a little bit, but that lasted for about a minute - if that long, after that it was nothing</li>
            <li> I had regular microdermabrasion, so I feel very little pain when using this hair remover.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t any more or less painful than ripping all the hairs out with wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s infinitely easier and less painful than waxing, and works better too.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing, and I would say also less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I decided to toss one into my \\&quot;cart\\&quot; when purchasing other items at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the other one stays in my purse.</li>
            <li> Some of the instructions  for other spring products say roll the handles in and out.</li>
            <li> Other than that-great   product for the money</li>
            <li> But I was watching a movie and did it little by little, and it all got done - cheeks, chin, under my lower lip, then the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a toner with salicylic acid every other day to prevent bumps &amp; breakouts.</li>
            <li> chose Bellabe after reading some rather concerning reviews on other forms of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> read the other reviews about how to use the roller.</li>
            <li> It is really really not!</li>
            <li> &amp; I had no expectations because of the price &amp; with all of my other disappointments.......</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other brands like Bellabe (Epicare, etc.)</li>
            <li> I did NOT want to go through this production for the other areas of my face too.  </li>
            <li> you use your Bellabe in wrinkly places, be careful!</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day to &amp;#34;keep up&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve gotten faster at it too.  </li>
            <li> This product hurts and it did not work, probably due to the pain</li>
            <li> This little gizmo made short work of getting rid of those little fuzzies.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The instruction guide recommends washing your face before and after you use the tool because it causes acne due to the pore of the hair follicle being exposed.</li>
            <li> but I alternated between putting cold pressed oils on my face like grapeseed and sweet almond.</li>
            <li> Due to this, I started waxing.</li>
            <li> I heeded the other reviews here that said it gets easier, and plowed...or rolled...on.</li>
            <li> Every other day is helpful for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Asked my husband to order two for me; I keep one in my office desk, and the other in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> However, unlike threading which usually happens in the direction of hair growth or some angle of that direction, this tool asks you to pull in the opposite hair growth direction which can lead to ingrown hairs and break outs.</li>
            <li> other downside is you can&#x27;t do your eyebrows with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have to agree with some of the other reviewers that some skin just will not like this product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in 3 weeks I can do the other side and even things out</li>
            <li> Spent $300 on Nono!</li>
            <li> after following the instructions, you find when you bend the spring it opens little gaps, and as you roll the spring up your face, the gaps close on little hairs and pull them out as you continue to roll them upwards.  </li>
            <li> yeah, not sure I&#x27;ll be using it regularly.</li>
            <li> As for the pain, seems like other people are wimpy.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Not sure how to make of any complaints that gives this a low rating because it hurts when the hairs are being pulled....</li>
            <li> the other hand on the other end, bend the spring, put it up to the hairs, and start twisting.</li>
            <li> The handles are printed with a number 1 on one end and a number 2 on the other.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated you can&#x27;t do your eyebrows</li>
            <li> I, like some of the other reviewers, have PCOS.  </li>
            <li> (slick doesn&#x27;t twist properly)</li>
            <li> you only have a small amount of hair to remove, get this.  </li>
            <li> I had to do a small section over the course of several days.  </li>
            <li> I tested a small patch of hair in the evening, and found no skin issues the following day</li>
            <li> 4 Stars for ease of use, but should have listened to other reviewers that said it caused ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The Nono is extremely out of my budget, so I was looking for something within my budget.</li>
            <li> I used it wrongly the first time.</li>
            <li> With waxing and other hair removal stuff that I&#x27;ve tried before, I would usually have hair growing on my upper lip after about a week of removal.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can use on my brows, but otherwise, it gets rid of facial hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I also looked on youtube to see other reviews and how it was used.</li>
            <li> I pay a small fortune to have facial hair removed and this product has let me stop doing that.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days and don&#x27;t know if it is breaking hairs of removing them at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable at first, but once you find a method that works for your hair removal - the process is almost painless.</li>
            <li> The reason I went for Bellabe was because the other brand was quite a bit longer and Bellabe is Made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well, except on some longer, coarser hairs which I had to pluck with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> believe excessive hair remains a VERY PRIVATE ISSUE</li>
            <li> but I am surprised at how easy it is to use and a lot less painful than I imagined!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little painful, similar to waxing, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it for the purpose that it&#x27;s still a little bit painful.</li>
            <li> , I watched videos on how to use it and most of them Said it was a little painful</li>
            <li> I used this a couple of days before a trip to visit my boyfriends family, and on the day that we left, I woke up with a few little pimples in the area.</li>
            <li> Was very curious, so gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a thrill for me to find this effective little tool that doesn&#x27;t leave a rash, smell, stubble or any other bad effect I have suffered in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had minimal redness which disappeared in less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to wax, threading causes my face to swell, and shaving is too harsh and only lasts for a few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitation products make oversees, this is the orginal MADE IN THE USA product!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on the little fuzz around my cheeks and under my chin, but my lip area is completely smooth and hairless for the first time since I had hair there in the past 20 years!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Cleaning this is a little harder due to</li>
            <li> It was about the length that is wasn&#x27;t long enough to wax but enough for me to feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now making plans to get YAG laser hair removal for dark skin due to the side effects from this product.</li>
            <li> It stings in a couple sensitive places (middle upper lip), but really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t as common as any other facial hair removing method.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I used this product, within a few days I would get super deep and painful ingrown hairs (or something) along my face.</li>
            <li> I rated this at 4 stars because the handles are a rubbery, neoprene-type substance; I have tactile sensation issues, meaning I am unable to touch certain surfaces.</li>
            <li> My face looked a little pink after using</li>
            <li> Aim carefully and just do a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Little harder to get under the chin but can be managed with practice.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a slight sting, but nothing of the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; other reviewers talk about.</li>
            <li> It is also hard to figure out if you are removing hair or it is just breaking off in the middle.</li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable at first</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about a little spring removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> as with any other apparatus that pulls hair out of your body, your skin will be a little redish due to the irritation but for me it goes away within an hour.</li>
            <li> I know this product probably works well, however; I have had such a hard time using it.  </li>
            <li> This product is a little difficult to use at first.</li>
            <li> Those with PCOS know what those are: the hard beginnings of cysts starting under the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to make it work at certain angles.</li>
            <li> So much faster and less expensive than any other method.</li>
            <li> Might take a few tries, or just resort to the Medieval tweezer method for the die hard hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used depilatory creams for years to remove unwanted facial hair, but lately have been worrying about the chemicals they contain.  </li>
            <li> hair is dark.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is that the hair can get stuck inside the spring</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cost alot, but I will go back to tweezers.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it wasn&#x27;t too painful, even on the first use.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and ever since I began waxing.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t tighten when twisted like they say it will.</li>
            <li> I could even do it in the dark.  </li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It requires frequent use but the frequency of use has decreased for me.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I do have a lone hair, usually short and thick, that I have to tweeze.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick facial hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shave it cus, lets face it, it will grow back thick</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> Love it for its effectiveness, hate it for the pain.</li>
            <li> Pain factor-tolerable everywhere except the upper lip, feels like a slow wax.</li>
            <li> Not that it won&#x27;t get it off, but you have to struggle with the angle and give it a few tries before it does any thing.</li>
            <li> It stings a little but no more than tweezing, and a lot less than if you could pull each individual hair out with tweezers anyway.  </li>
            <li> your way up to the scary spots...it helps you get used to working with it &amp; getting your technique down while also helping you to psyche yourself up to get to the *real* spots.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the hang of using the Bellabe, but once I had the twisting motion down it works well.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour trying to get the technique down to pick up a few of the longer hairs</li>
            <li> I hate the look of those hairs on other people, so am a bit paranoid! :)</li>
            <li> Really liked it but very painful.</li>
            <li> Other areas on face are hard to grab and take a long time.</li>
            <li> I had tears streaming down my eyes</li>
            <li> When you look down at the coil, you see the hairs between the coils.</li>
            <li> I had tears streaming down my face.</li>
            <li> It works well, but I can&#x27;t really down rate a product because it made me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to endure the pain until I break down and get laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I would suggest wiping it down with an alcohol swab between uses to minimize the chance of getting acne.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe I just could not get the technique down.</li>
            <li> If you can figure out how to get the technique down it may work for you, but this is now a product for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to take some practice to get the technique down.</li>
            <li> To the day she died, my mother would tweeze 20 hairs a day to try to keep the growth down.  </li>
            <li> I had tears streaming down my face because of the hairs being removed there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it was because of the metal rolling up and down my skin.</li>
            <li> A fuzzy upper lip is not cute and neither is one with pimples!</li>
            <li> Does sting a little, but so does other hair removers, and this has no chemicals 😍</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and voila!</li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs out and re-growth time is slower than any other method I have used!</li>
            <li> This device yanks out all the hairs, dark ones and vellus hairs, with less violence than the word \\&quot;yank\\&quot; might suggest.  </li>
            <li> You bend it in half and twirl the ends between your fingers as you move it up and down over the skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> The only place I have trouble is under my jaw - it&#x27;s a hard place to get to.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job, yes its uncomfortable but not as bad as plucking</li>
            <li> Slight discomfort when the hair is pulled out</li>
            <li> I have previously used shaving, chemicals and electrolysis.</li>
            <li> less pain....</li>
            <li> It hurts less than waxing, but it is pulling the hair out by the root</li>
            <li> Usage does involve a slight stinging sensation, which will hopefully lessen with time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less than waxing and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin reddened afterwards.</li>
            <li> It took about an hour to figure out the technique but is so much less hassle than a razor or tweezers.</li>
            <li> the faster it will work and the less pulling I will feel.</li>
            <li> Tip: use it after shower or having your face steamed for less pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to tweeze or use an epilator in way less time.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it hurts me even less than threading.</li>
            <li> I did half of it yesterday.  </li>
            <li> but I find the pain is less every time I do it.</li>
            <li> Now I can cut my threading bill and time in half.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, the hairs start thinning out, too, so I use it much less often now than I used to.</li>
            <li> MUCH less pain than waxing and threading.  </li>
            <li> It is painful and did not remove much at all after ten minutes of suffering.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  </li>
            <li> I also use razors usually if in a rush or simply too lazy to stand in front of the mirror with Bellabe to pluck one or two defiant hairs.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and a lot less laborious for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have any less re-growth, but it is no problem as this gets rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I took a previous reviewer&#x27;s advice and cleansed with witch hazel afterwards -</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of such a product until recently when someone else had one, then I decided to try one for myself.  </li>
            <li> The instructions warn that you may feel a slight &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> nothing less.</li>
            <li> The shorter the hair, the less pain.</li>
            <li> I never have stubble, or irritation with this product, although it does give a slight tingling sensation when using it, it goes away after a minute or so of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the less hurts.</li>
            <li> yourself in the bathroom for a half hour&amp;#34; sort of thing.</li>
            <li> so i have less of a problem with breaking out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also,  each time I have used it, the discomfort is less and less.</li>
            <li> A lot less than this one</li>
            <li> And you get used to the slight pinching.  </li>
            <li> yes it&#x27;s a pulling, slightly stinging sensation but not unbearable by any means.  </li>
            <li> Pain subsides around a half hour or so after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> No pain, just a slight pinch that was almost unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Comes with getting older unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Bellabe is not fun to use and does feel like I&#x27;m pulling the little hairs out of my face.</li>
            <li> It even goes down to the little peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> however I couldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars because it was PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d deal with the sticky mess on my hands and face and then wait another week to do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I still pluck those few dark stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> The coil is all you need to remove hair, and eliminates the mess and time that comes with waxing.</li>
            <li> The actual removal was EXTREMELY painful, especially the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> De fuzzed and amazed that a torture device is so small and pink.</li>
            <li> Along with a few dark and brittle ones that pop up on the chin and moustache.</li>
            <li> Waxing hurts and makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> NOt good on short hairs.</li>
            <li> I have many small tiny thin hair near my ears, and its terrible to use this contraption.</li>
            <li> well worth the price instead of the ridiculously priced NoNO Hair--at a cost of over $250!!!</li>
            <li> I think the price could be a little less.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little sting as the hair is being removed, and there&#x27;s a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make it hurt less: after you&#x27;ve cleaned your face, get an ice cube and put it in a little sandwich baggie.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> Not as well on little black hairs on the chin tho.</li>
            <li> It would probably be less painful if you could use the device quickly.</li>
            <li> I think an epilator would be less painful as the machine tweezers the hair quickly.</li>
            <li> it takes a few minutes to get your technique down.</li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s a tightly coiled spring with handles on the end.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s basically a tightly coiled piece of metal).</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get all the hairs out, but once you do I think it lasts a little longer than (or at least as long as) waxing.</li>
            <li> Was a little awkward to use at first but got the hang of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is painful and really takes a long time to remove hairs.  </li>
            <li> It seems gentler than waxing, definitely less messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> I like that I can do this while watching TV, reading, etc, and there is virtually no clean up involved.</li>
            <li> Certainlly a lot cheaper and less trouble than lazer too.</li>
            <li> When first reading the reviews before purchasing this item I was a little skeptical ager reading the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into self-torture, this little device&#x27;s effects are long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not without a little pain, but you get used to that.  </li>
            <li> It pinches/stings/pricks a little, but as you get used to using the bellabe</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> This does have a little pain</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because the wand is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, it did hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> and I admit it does sting a little.</li>
            <li> So I gave this a shot and it stings a little bit to</li>
            <li> No more money spent on waxes, yea!</li>
            <li> It hurts a little</li>
            <li> even if I follow up with alcohol and antibiotic ointment, I ALWAYS develop those pesky little pimples.</li>
            <li> , it work it hurt a little when you pulling out the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little time to get the hang of this</li>
            <li> I still broke out in one little area.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a neat little tool.. twist and rip.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitate to buy this but took a chance</li>
            <li> , this may hurt a little if you have not had any hair removal.</li>
            <li> found this little guy when browsing through hair removal products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Needs a little training and getting used to</li>
            <li> Completely not worth it!</li>
            <li> But if your use to a little pain, you&#x27;ll like the product.</li>
            <li> It felt like some little pinpricks comparable to how threading would feel.</li>
            <li> takes a little bit of getting use to...</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to it because i was breaking hairs a lot but man...</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this little tool.</li>
            <li> It stings a little</li>
            <li> Yes, it can be a little tricky along the jaw line, but with practice it can be done.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little bit</li>
            <li> I can also tell you, that it hurts, as you get tons of little hair in it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> But, it performs the task of ripping out little microscopic hairs from my wife&#x27;s face, so I guess it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little thing does the job, but it hurts just like pulling out hairs with the tweezers.</li>
            <li> It even took out the little hairs.</li>
            <li> Stings a little bit, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It does take a little bit of getting used to how to roll it.</li>
            <li> After using it, I put a little antibiotic cream (like neosporin) on the area.  </li>
            <li> That was a little trickier to learn which way to hold it and which way to \\&quot;twirl\\&quot; it to grab the hair.  </li>
            <li> With a little trial and error you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to, but once you figure it out it isn&#x27;t so</li>
            <li> This little device works.</li>
            <li> This thing will pluck out every little hair though if you can withstand the pain.</li>
            <li> This little springy thingamajig however....</li>
            <li> definitely not worth it for me!</li>
            <li> It even worked on my thicker coarser hair, although I did have to manipulate the shape of the want a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> There were little hairs in there when I was done.  </li>
            <li> Its just like little pinches as it is ripping your hair from its roots.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a little tricky to get used to how this works</li>
            <li> When I first used it my upper lip broke out a tiny bit, but nothing horrible</li>
            <li> It tingles just a little; nothing I can&#x27;t tolerate.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wax because it causes me to break out with little pimple bumps.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> And I had a little redness at the beginning</li>
            <li> and it is far less uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful just beneath the nose area, but a few quick passes and it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t have noticeable facial hair, I do have dry skin, so I feel like make-up &#x27;sits&#x27; wrong on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little painful and my upper lip is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> instead of going for the cheaper ones; I have a feeling this will last for a few years at least!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only a little worse than plucking my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> parts I did so far were red for a few minutes, but not all that bad.</li>
            <li> but this wasn&#x27;t bad on the really sensitive spots- like the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> I followed the advice of another reviewer and used ice to numb the area before using, and it really helped minimize the discomfort (feels like tweezing 10+ hairs at once).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit painful but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to messy waxing.</li>
            <li> I have used harsh creams before on my peach fuzz and NEVER had a reaction like this.</li>
            <li> So this allows me to remove my facial hair without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t know how to work this, but it was a waste of money - cheaper to go have your face threaded</li>
            <li> I think this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I would have had to spend hours just to get a few hairs.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds harsh, but you want to keep those areas exfoliated to prevent ingrown hairs and pimples.</li>
            <li> I watched quite a few YouTube videos before trying on my face.</li>
            <li> Yet, I was still left with a wake of broken hairs.</li>
            <li> Since the product doesn&#x27;t come with instruction, and just running it over the hair you want to remove doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, I surmised you&#x27;re supposed to bend the springy wire over the hairs so they will get trapped in the coils and pull the hairs out by the root when you jerk the device away.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return it,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for Bellabe, watched a few instructional videos, and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing, plucking and even shaving the few hairs that poke through.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> I will no longer need to use those harsh chemicals and have to deal with the resulting skin irritations.</li>
            <li> so you have to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an epislim for years, but it leaves tiny hairs behind which I do not like.  </li>
            <li> As is so often the case, the first time is the worst, I would suggest doing small sections and starting low and moving up gradually.  </li>
            <li> Then I took a few days off.</li>
            <li> After a few times you get use to the sensation.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> after a few minutes, I was using it while watching the news.</li>
            <li> I just received my Bellabe a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> This product foregoes all that trouble.  </li>
            <li> few of my friends use this product and I even bought one for my sister.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> After watching a few instructional Youtube videos, I got the hang of it, no problem.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product..</li>
            <li> It now causes some discomfort, but not to the point that I have to talk myself into going another round.</li>
            <li> I tried practicing the technique on a few leg hairs.</li>
            <li> I have tried bleaching, depilatories, waxing, threading, tweezing... am I missing anything?</li>
            <li> Here are a few things you need to do BEFORE you use</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a few months now</li>
            <li> I will no longer use messy creams.  </li>
            <li> I can even skip a few threading sessions.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times now</li>
            <li> Received the Ballable Hair Removal in the mail a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and I was using in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I still have to use tweezers to get a few stubborn hairs</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t understand those who have trouble using it.  </li>
            <li> It also has trouble grasping hairs on the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; or edges of your face like the rounded areas of the chin.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few tips that they don&#x27;t mention in the directions: 1.</li>
            <li> There is also a learning curve involved, so don&#x27;t expect to pick it up and be hairless in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I my trouble spots.</li>
            <li> i hear her crying while taking her mustache off</li>
            <li> This ended up breaking a lot of hair rather than pulling from the roots, and it had trouble getting hold of the hair, too.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from the trouble of having to pluck out tiny but quite visible hair on their faces every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then it was like a 2 step process spread over a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago after seeing it on Rachel Ray.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> a *few*</li>
            <li> I have been using it every few days</li>
            <li> Waxing and creams really destroy my skin.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> although it breaks off quite a few hairs as well.</li>
            <li> Takes off a lot of baby fuzz and thin hairs, but you still need tweezers for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have had a few bumps, but they&#x27;re gone in an hour&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried laser before and it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Seems too much trouble to try to do my legs.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> you MIGHT HAVE TO tweeze a few here and there</li>
            <li> Man did this sucker work, slowly ripping out tiny peach fuzz......</li>
            <li> The older I get, the harder it is to see those little bad boys and who has the time anyway?  </li>
            <li> It hurt quite a lot when I first used it, but it&#x27;s getting less painful.</li>
            <li> This item works with no more pain than lessors with a lot less cost..</li>
            <li> It took less than five minutes for me to figure it out and get the feel for it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;She, on the other hand, is convinced that any faint facial hair that manifests makes her blood kin to the grizzly bear that bit Jim Bridger&#x27;s arse, and must not be tolerated.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to use and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i was a bit skeptical, because i thought that it was going to be so painful, but once i started i got used to the little sting!</li>
            <li> It is initially a bit painful and irritated my sensitive skin by leaving small bumps</li>
            <li> As an Amazon Prime member, I was a little disappointed that this took 4 dyes to get to me, even though the other items I ordered at the same time got to me in the regular 2 day time period.</li>
            <li> At first it was a little painful</li>
            <li> No more being embarrassed and worried if anyone could see the hairs left behind from those wasteful creams.</li>
            <li> very slight pain when the hair comes out is not a problem</li>
            <li> also noticed when I applied waterproof sunscreen I could not easily remove it.</li>
            <li> It does smart a little when you start but after a minute it&#x27;s not as bad.</li>
            <li> Yes it is painful in certain spots but after using it for a little bit the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> pussyfooting around, the Bellabe stung so badly the first couple of times that I used it</li>
            <li> ... stings a bit at first but its not that bad</li>
            <li> It can be a bit painful at first if you&#x27;ve never used one before</li>
            <li> Painful but works pretty well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was shocked at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I thought it was painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Creams which burn the hell out of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried waxing which bruised and left my face with thick scale like spots, I&#x27;ve tried shaving which was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> When using it to first remove the hair it can be painful.</li>
            <li> The coil is painful to use at first</li>
            <li> Its a bit painful the first time or two you use this, but that seems to diminish over time ad bottom line - it does the job.</li>
            <li> The first go was painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed before and that alone is pretty darn painful</li>
            <li> It was pretty painful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing, but usually end up pulling skin off as well, not to mention it&#x27;s horribly messy.</li>
            <li> dark thick ones too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast but still a little painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this bad of acne in my entire life, and i had it pretty bad in middle school.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would say this considering I had a bad experience with a facial spring before - bottomline - shell out some extra money for those products that touch your face.</li>
            <li> I use it only on my upper lip, and yes it&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> Yes the first time you use it, it can be somewhat painful but no more than if you have waxed or had treading done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d compare it to having a rubber band snapped against your face - Certainly far less painful than waxing or the previously mentioned epilady.  </li>
            <li> I spared my skin from wax and burning, I spared my wallet from insane charges, and my UBER sensitive skin thanks me for it.  </li>
            <li> I worked at it for at least a half hour</li>
            <li> Do not attempt because it&#x27;s not easy to control small areas.</li>
            <li> For $15, that&#x27;s less than one waxing plus gratuity (at least where I live…)  </li>
            <li> It really works to remove those nasty old chin hairs.</li>
            <li> Have no idea how this is better than waxing , very painful and hard to use.</li>
            <li> This little thing works like a charm!</li>
            <li> What a neat little tool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, tightly wound coil with hard plastic ends for holding that will catch every single microscopic hair including the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> It is very painful to use and easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li> This is a little hard to use until you get the feel of how to roll it.  </li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and lots of it!</li>
            <li> I had very little luck grasping the hairs within the coils,</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without these silly things!  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how I&#x27;ve lived this long without this little beauty secret!</li>
            <li> Also it really didn&#x27;t hurt that bad</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care about the momentary &#x27;pain&#x27;, it is not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad, works really well at hair removal but did cause a break out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really hurt that bad</li>
            <li> I am a post-menopausal woman who has plenty of long, blonde, silky hair -- too bad it&#x27;s all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Works very well and its not that painful.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I purchased it, but it definitely worked as advertised .  </li>
            <li> I usually have to replace mine after about a year</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Doing my upper lip is still difficult but I have found a way to use it that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to use tweezers in the past</li>
            <li> No more wasting money on waxes.</li>
            <li> It was still blonde, but got longer and would stick out in weird directions so you could see it.  </li>
            <li> and we just don&#x27;t usually notice it.</li>
            <li> The key is to keep the skin taut, which can be difficult with some parts of the face.</li>
            <li> .. broke out on my cheeks but not sure if it is from the bellable or just a heat rash since I was out in the sun</li>
            <li> small try this</li>
            <li> And, also, it&#x27;s not good at removing those stubborn dark chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product instead of REM spring that I usually buy</li>
            <li> is discrete, no more warming up wax in the microwave or walking around the house with bleach cream on my lip and chin.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this item is returnable, but I cannot use it and cannot recommend it, either.  </li>
            <li> Once there is no more tugging</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve forgotten to do this a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed any negative effects.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a penny on this!</li>
            <li> Was not able to figure this out at all.</li>
            <li> it would grab a few of the longer hairs and let me just say ouch!</li>
            <li> The pain is no more than if you used tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s a tiny bit difficult to use</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me.</li>
            <li> The discomfort is no more than that caused by removing a bandaid</li>
            <li> No, wont remove really small hairs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be anxiously staring into the bathroom mirror anymore.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable,  how manageable my unwanted hair has become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved at least $100 in threading since I got it a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> It does sting a bit - but no more than tweezing.  </li>
            <li> I found it tedious and there&#x27;s no way I can see myself doing this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> after all, unless your skin is numb to hairs being pulled out, expect discomfort in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have also used small razors…</li>
            <li> Then I put a small dab of antibiotic ointment on the area... and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> used it on my upper lip, chin and random hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> No more max burns or anything.</li>
            <li> No more mustache problems.  </li>
            <li> Was not able to return this product, was not informed of no returns.</li>
            <li> When you first try it and it grabs a bunch of your hairs, you feel shocked, but it&#x27;s too late LOL&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d manage to get a little patch here, a small patch there, but even after 30 minutes I had not even finished one section of my face!</li>
            <li> No more going to the salon to get this done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products that I buy</li>
            <li> I have been insecure since I was 18 because of my facial hair, I have had years of</li>
            <li> Then roll the Bellabe as usual in that spot.  </li>
            <li> I usually get irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> but it takes forever to remove hair from a small area.</li>
            <li> And it is noiseless and small</li>
            <li> No more waxing.</li>
            <li> I just made my second try after purchasing, and I am not happy!  </li>
            <li> I have waxed in the past</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sorry but this product was just not for me, personally.</li>
            <li> No more plucking and shaving for me.</li>
            <li> I use it on those annoying hairs that started growing after I reached a certain age - the ones by the corners of my mouth, and those odd hairs along my jaw line.</li>
            <li> It is less irritating (despite the pain) to my skin than waxing, as I didn&#x27;t get the little pimples that I get with waxing.</li>
            <li> You have to move super slow, it&#x27;s friggin ANNOYING and basically just acts as a rolling tweezer.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how painful it was after reading other reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t that bad or that plucking hurt more.  </li>
            <li> I found this product not easy to use and not effective.</li>
            <li> I tried those facial cream hair remover but it also was very irritating.</li>
            <li> The last time i waxed at a salon it was expensive and so hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> Most tedious and annoying way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I can handle the intense stinging sensation around my eyebrows once I got used to it and forced myself to hang in there, but it is WAY too painful to use anywhere else on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to wax my face for over 2 years and threading is very time consuming (and expensive).</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully and only got some painful pinching in return.  </li>
            <li> I have resigned myself to threading for several years now, but although it works well, I hate the in between, waiting for the next session, having to tweeze.  </li>
            <li> Tired of waxing, tired of the daily tweezer runs.      </li>
            <li> but it was always annoying having to go an extra mile trying to find the proper makeup that wouldn&#x27;t expose all the hairs.</li>
            <li> It is quite painful and I have a high tolerance for pain, so</li>
            <li> Very painful, removed little to no hair, and left skin red and flaky.</li>
            <li> tbh the pain was wayyyy worse than threading, at least in threading, you have the tech holding the skin taught with the other hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost picky - it won&#x27;t get the hairs that are too thick or too small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t base your decision on the first time.  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to the sensation of removing facial hair, this little wonder will be an unpleasant experience.</li>
            <li> The first time is the worse but not as bad after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to direct, so the result is hit or miss.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was not quick enough with the twisting because I found the pulling of the hairs to be painful.</li>
            <li> I actually found it less painful than waxing because it is an even rolling motion instead of a nervous</li>
            <li> It definitely gets less painful as you get used to the sensation it causes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that it is painless, but it is less painful than traditional threading.  </li>
            <li> Its less painful than threading which is almost the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is a thin, tightly coiled springy wire.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to use, and not working so well, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time giving a product that hurts a 5,haha.</li>
            <li> I did watch youtube videos but found the bellabe hard to use</li>
            <li> This thing hurts to use, is hard to guide and to add insult to injury it causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it hard to figure out at all.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s just the angle of the mouth that makes it hard to catch.</li>
            <li> You will need to use tweezer though for the hard to pull hair.</li>
            <li> IT hurts like hell and hard to use it on face.</li>
            <li> It is hard to remove those with the Bellable</li>
            <li> Hard to believe how this works.  </li>
            <li> Initially, using it was a little painful, but that means that it is pulling the hair out.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I like, the pulling out by the root like a tweezers, but for larger areas with out any of the messiness of waxing or crazy hard contraptions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things to defuzz my face, waxing being the most painful and my skin reacting badly to hair removing creams.   </li>
            <li> It was mildly painful, but nowhere near unbearable.</li>
            <li> I tried and it&#x27;s just not effective there</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent all that money on useless hair removal methods.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint.</li>
            <li> youtube has at least one).</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My mom is in a home and plucking hair on her lip is just not effective.</li>
            <li> At least with me</li>
            <li> several times i used it on my cheeks and it made me break out like crazy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shave it because I was afraid that it would grow back thicker</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing, tweezing, shaving it all sucks.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t awful, but it wasn&#x27;t comfortable either.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not effective.</li>
            <li> Only 2 problems: uses up batteries like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This will numb the area just enough for the hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel the need to numb the area with ice (which I did prior to laser for underarms and legs)</li>
            <li> I tend to have to shave a couple patches on my chin at least once a week</li>
            <li> I was skeptical purchasing this product but at 50+ years of age I was tired of tweezing upper lip hairs.  </li>
            <li> also to note, I don&#x27;t think this keeps the hair away any longer than the strips would- at least in my experience with it.  </li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> Kids are dangerous because they only see the truth!  </li>
            <li> but at least it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like depilatory creams.</li>
            <li> but since they r thick even wax wont work well</li>
            <li> worse than tweeters, as it grabs a few, or a lot, of them suckers at one time....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing myself and after two attempts I vowed I would never try that again (messy and poor result).</li>
            <li> I did it this way to slowly, slowly proceed because it hurts.</li>
            <li> Tweezing hurts and is slow, waxing didn&#x27;t work unless I went to a salon, and creams burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews, and I have found that it gets all the hairs out, even the thick ones, but there is a learning curve to using it.</li>
            <li> It looked as if I had a rash or something, which is WAY worse than a few hairs.</li>
            <li> once where, they are thick and noticeable and I also have discoloration from where the ingrown hairs where.</li>
            <li> It is slow going too.</li>
            <li> (it covers a very small area) which is a little frustrating.</li>
            <li> I mean it hurt like a motha...  </li>
            <li> Not sure how that works, but hey, am taking it!</li>
            <li> No more wax strips for me!</li>
            <li> If you ever tweezed then you would know what I mean.</li>
            <li> IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> No more waxing!</li>
            <li> but no more!  </li>
            <li> I mean ya&#x27;ll...</li>
            <li> Thank god for no more waxing!</li>
            <li> No more chin hairs!  </li>
            <li> Have had the bellabe for a few days and no stubble, no hair at all!!</li>
            <li> Bearded lady no more!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought it would, it was just a quick little pinch and even then it didn&#x27;t hurt that bad.</li>
            <li> I took all precautions to avoid a breakout, but unfortunately, I suffered a pretty bad breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair grows back fairly quickly, it&#x27;s painful, and small hairs don&#x27;t get picked up.</li>
            <li> Waxing all of that area is very painful and leaves me red for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pretty painful in the beginning, but just like plucking your eyebrows it gets less painful with time.</li>
            <li> (that would have looked ridiculous with my skin color).</li>
            <li> Impossible to move quickly enough to help alleviate torturous pain.</li>
            <li> I was literally scared of this hair remover and didn&#x27;t have any idea why people would seriously want to use this.</li>
            <li> I like these spring things, but after losing my REM version, I tried this less expensive one.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint iwith the Bellabe is that it is a bit painful, and leaves skin redness.  </li>
            <li> Seriously genius product.</li>
            <li> Seriously will take you a while to figure out how to work this thing.  </li>
            <li> I was seriously thinking about dropping the $300 for a</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to use it from other reviews that talk about how painful it is to use.  </li>
            <li> This is a spring with little tabs on the end - it works don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I have my eyebrows threaded every few weeks, and although there is no other way to get them shaped as nicely, it is very painful.  </li>
            <li> but it breaks you out bad and by the time the breakouts are gone the hairs back.</li>
            <li> I could tweeze each hair individually and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad as this thing does.</li>
            <li> This remover hurts so bad; however, it does get rid of all of my facial hair....</li>
            <li> This is painful but it works amazingly on facial hair.</li>
            <li> Not fair.</li>
            <li> Not fair at all.</li>
            <li> just too painful, even though i have prescription topical lidocaine ointment.</li>
            <li> Waxing was painful and had to be done before bed so that the redness and irritation would be gone by morning, and I could go out in public again.  </li>
            <li> I still have to pluck a few difficult hairs though.</li>
            <li> It was only as painful as you&#x27;d expect, removed all the unwanted hair even the short ones that I plucked... and didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated or painful.</li>
            <li> it was a bit painful on my upper lip</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> Where the hair was longer, like the upper lip, it was painful.</li>
            <li> Initially, I found it to be painful</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been warned - it&#x27;s possible, just painful.</li>
            <li> Useless, money wasted</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how painful this thing is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fair if I say it&#x27;s a no good item.  </li>
            <li> It got easier and less painful over the few minutes</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed as it breaks the hair and does not have a firm and sharp hold.</li>
            <li> Hardly hurts if ur used to plucking!</li>
            <li> Because it is limited in speed, in this manner, it&#x27;s impossible to swiftly remove hairs.</li>
            <li> Not completely painless, come on it is pulling hair out, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> It seems that this spring is too weak to pull out hair.  </li>
            <li> This worked but no better than tweezers, sadly.</li>
            <li> not for the weak</li>
            <li> Not sure if I am doing something wrong</li>
            <li> So I was a bit disappointed when I opened my package today and only had one.</li>
            <li> Especially I found it difficult, really impossible, around the corners of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin or hair are just too tough, but this hair remover did not work for me.</li>
            <li> And the chin/neck area is tough to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the job, but very slowly.  </li>
            <li> No more peach fuzz!!</li>
            <li> You know when you&#x27;re twisting it correctly when you fill like little pins and needles are stabbing you.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned my skin, used ice cubes to numb a little</li>
            <li> 10 seconds, or until the area is a little numb.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of all the creams on the market that kept changing formulas over the years, and I&#x27;m not one for waxing...and bleaching was out of the question</li>
            <li> so I find I go over the area I worked on and deal with broken or missed hairs with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for the express purpose of removing those annoying hairs that are starting to grow on my chin.</li>
            <li> Then whip out your Bellabe and visit your secret places.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would just shave in between the waxing because I was so tired of it.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and hated what waxing was doing to my skin...not to mention embarrassed.  </li>
            <li> i was so skeptical on buying this based on the reviews it did not get the thick hair...</li>
            <li> No great in comfort, but</li>
            <li> but i was not happy with the product</li>
            <li> My eyesight is getting poor</li>
            <li> its the worse product ever.</li>
            <li> Worse than plucking and waxing</li>
            <li> This may work, but I&#x27;ll never know because the pain was worse than waxing and worse than an epilator.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worse that waxing by 10x.</li>
            <li> Worse than waxing because it&#x27;s slower and pulls one by one.</li>
            <li> &amp; I hate using that at-home facial wax</li>
            <li> and I was tired of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s probably not be because of this product (.time, and decreased dosage acne meds).</li>
            <li> I was so tired of getting waxed and threaded</li>
            <li> And I was getting tired of all that.</li>
            <li> If you have poor eyesight, this thing removes hair.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe does thin it..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I can use it because it hurts worse, to me, than waxing.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me; perhaps my hair was too thin; but there is a lot of it</li>
            <li> but im someone who has spent minutes each day with tweezers and i was getting so sick of it..</li>
            <li> Painful as any other hair removal tool is.</li>
            <li> We women are used to going to painful lengths to be anything other than the hairy mammals we are, however, so as time goes on, you get used to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The upper lip smarted the worst but the rest of the face had very little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Seriously it hurt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious!</li>
            <li> hairs from your face is never fun and my hope for this was that it wouldn&#x27;t be painful.</li>
            <li> Extremely painful to use and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for professional full-face waxing which is inconvenient, expensive and painful --</li>
            <li> I am &#x27;hairy&#x27; and have been using tweezers for the past decade and a half... needless to say, it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> It feels like a slight snap on the skin but not that bad and immediately I saw the hairs coming out.</li>
            <li> Its less painful than waxing, but there is still pain.</li>
            <li> Is it less painful than tweezers?</li>
            <li> After using it continually it gets easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> My facial hair isn&#x27;t as bad as what it was before hand!</li>
            <li> but above the lip is brutal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful,  </li>
            <li> It is a little painful</li>
            <li> It is a little painful, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> It is a little painful.  </li>
            <li> Its painful and you have to attempt quite a few times before you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s painful, and because it hurts me, I want to hurt it, so I&#x27;m childishly keeping the star from</li>
            <li> Body hair just gets annoying but with all of the fancy hair removers being roughly between $300-$450, I just couldn&#x27;t afford any of them at this time.</li>
            <li> all the ladies out there with sensitive skin and annoying peach fuzz, you&#x27;ve got to give this a try!</li>
            <li> This product is very painful once you actually get it to work!</li>
            <li> The upper lip was awfully painful, but the chin was barely painful.  </li>
            <li> This product is much less painful and you have control over it instead of someone else, maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad, I&#x27;m not sure!</li>
            <li> Also, very difficult to get some hairs on chin and its hard not to just break the hair off.</li>
            <li> I switched to depilatory cream every two weeks for the past couple of years, until three weeks ago, when the stuff burned my face so badly I looked like a meth addict.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with those small stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> but I had a bad experience in the past and got burned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> threw these out- painful and hard for me to</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Remover]]Was skeptical</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the money or the time to go to a threading Kiosk.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use correctly although I have figured it out with some practice.  </li>
            <li> But i just hated the hairs growing back crazy.</li>
            <li> everything was so expensive n creams made me break out</li>
            <li> I had never used a device like this before, but now I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it will have somewhat of a &amp;#34;tingling feeling.&amp;#34; This is wrong.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be useless.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m weird and like that</li>
            <li> And I swear it&#x27;s helped get rid of a months-long battle with some weird acne around my mouth...</li>
            <li> What is so awful is the pain of individual hairs being pulled out over and over again.</li>
            <li> The upper lip area is horrific, start at the outer corner and work your way in and up.  </li>
            <li> The TV product was way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> so maybe thats why it was uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m (perhaps unfairly) withholding 1 star because it hurts like a mother</li>
            <li> Plus you don&#x27;t get those weird breakouts you get sometimes after a wax.</li>
            <li> Still useless.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the moment I tried to do my upper lips my eyes teared up because it hurt so effing bad!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m not a wuss either.</li>
            <li> As someone with &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; vision, plucking had become difficult without a magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Start with the least painful which is shaving.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Not at all difficult to use (</li>
            <li> I am really angry with this product and so embarrassed of my skin now.</li>
            <li> Looked to complicated to even try and it does looks like it would hurt.</li>
            <li> It does take some time to get used to how this works because it seems weird</li>
            <li> just sorry I didn&#x27;t know about it before now.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Totally useless hair removal product.  </li>
            <li> This is difficult to get used to but it does work as promised.</li>
            <li> or you will be sorry.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> The upper lip has got to be the worst area</li>
            <li> Works well to get rid of those random hairs.</li>
            <li> In case anything went wrong</li>
            <li> Rinsing, washing cloth strips, on and on; it&#x27;s tedious and a pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical that hair will grow in finer, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Tired of paying for waxing and threading!  </li>
            <li> but it hurt, tore off my skin in places and was expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought about threading but again expensive</li>
            <li> I have twisted and twirlled this way and that..opposite directions...same directions..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but docking stars for the pain factor is silly.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It works but really uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Hurts horribly and have to go over area multiple times.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to grab the chin hair.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> And the ones it does pull out is slow and painful.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> But just because it&#x27;s not your cup of tea doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.  </li>
            <li> But seriously ... it hurts like he**!!</li>
            <li> Waxing is less painful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a little painful, but not as bad as before.</li>
            <li> Rather than spending all that time plucking hairs one by one (and always missing a lot), this device will find and pull out all those ugly hairs once and for all!</li>
            <li> This sproduct was painful to use but even worse...</li>
            <li> Probably my worst or at least second to worst amazon purchase to date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a chicken and have put it up for a bit.  </li>
            <li> so I could numb the area.</li>
            <li> Any one who says it doesn&#x27;t hurt might have numb skin or who knows.</li>
            <li> so I had to used ice (in a baggy) to numb it.  </li>
            <li> OMG it hurt like CRAZY.  </li>
            <li> I almost cried and wished i could numb the pain...</li>
            <li> Waxing always makes me break out like crazy because the wax or the products that go along with waxing always clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because I was afraid of the pain involved.</li>
            <li> you can go crazy with this thing.</li>
            <li> Use on a clan face and rinse with cold water after to close the pores and reduce redness.</li>
            <li> When i used it, i took all the precautions like washing and exfoliating before and after the use, cleaning it, and rinsing my face in cold water to close the pores after.</li>
            <li> This is sort of awkward, it pulls hair downward to remove, rather than upward.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stings like crazy</li>
            <li> This crazy thing HURTS like he</li>
            <li> This spring like tool is barbaric and useless!</li>
            <li> I,guess ill continue to go to the salon....  Drat !</li>
            <li> I keep using it because I&#x27;m tired of paying for waxing and using chemicals but be prepared for your eyes to water!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product as of late</li>
            <li> Very simplistic, but does the trick.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> very difficult to use</li>
            <li> Also, went bad after a while, where it just started to appear really dirty, like the metal had gone bad.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought after reading some reviews.  </li>
            <li> Hurts a tad bit, but it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It hurt me so F-ing bad that I started to bleed from the pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li> sometimes, it would get your arm hair stuck in it and sting really badly?</li>
            <li> It just hurts REALLY bad.</li>
            <li> then again I never waxed (heard it was bad for the face)</li>
            <li> But it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> If you had a bad reaction to waxing I could see using this.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER shaved my face (isn&#x27;t that bad, yet)</li>
            <li> like , really bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> The pain was not that bad to me.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> This hair remover isn&#x27;t AS bad as my mind made me believe that it would be.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad on the sides face</li>
            <li> and then it really isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> I thought, how bad can it be?  </li>
            <li> It is painful, but it does get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> it I foind it too painful.</li>
            <li> When using the Bellabe, the is a pulling sensation of the hair which is slightly painful but no redness.</li>
            <li> It did take some time to get used to using the product, and, I will not lie, it was painful.  </li>
            <li> It is really painful</li>
            <li> Yes, it is painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;First week was quite painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it painful any longer (you do get used to it)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it painful any longer (you do get used to it)</li>
            <li> If you think it may be painful take a pain reliever about 30 minutes before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit painful.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it was painful.  </li>
            <li> it pulls the hair out and is painful.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it but too painful.</li>
            <li> I would give the nifty tool 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so painful</li>
            <li> This hair remover device is somewhat painful when using it.  </li>
            <li> but it was just too painful ...</li>

            <li> I would be lying to you if I said it wasn&#x27;t slightly painful...</li>
            <li> but it is really painful to use...</li>
            <li> This works well but is painful.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to waxing or plucking this can be painful.</li>
            <li> as some claim this to be) and I didn&#x27;t find it nearly as painful as some claim it to be.</li>
            <li> I just got frustrated every time and ended up shaving the chin.  </li>
            <li> Painful, but it works.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to be painful at all.  </li>
            <li> So, I was worried about how painful the Bellabe would be (although it cannot be used on eyebrows).  </li>
            <li> Forget the painful hair removal products or even shaving.  </li>
            <li> This product was painful to use, and produced acne even though I took all the hygiene advice the product info gave.  </li>
            <li> Sooo painful...</li>
            <li> It yanks the hairs from the roots (and yes, that is every bit as painful as it sounds) but it WORKS.  </li>
            <li> Painful as a mother?  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it anymore painful than either of those options.</li>
            <li> So painful can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> It was just way to painful for me.</li>
            <li> Yikes - this was so painful</li>
            <li> It is extremely painful but waxing hurts to.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s quite painful.  </li>
            <li> Just too painful for me.</li>
            <li> Painful, painful, painful and doesn&#x27;t work that well and painful.</li>

            <li> I tried  cheaper versions and was so disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> No hairs removed :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with it and wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> Well, this purchase is now part of my permanent budget.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> And sometimes, it plucks the skin out too :(</li>
            <li> no luck here.  :(</li>
            <li> This product broke me out like crazy!</li>
            <li> Bummer :(</li>
            <li> If you are stubborn like me, and still want to try something so stupid, get one of the ones for like $1 or $</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just stupid, but this product does not work for me.</li>
            <li> It was annoying.</li>
            <li> i hate it and it not working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is just as annoying as waxing with how it pulls the hair from its roots but didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all or leave a mark.  </li>
            <li> I hate messing with wax</li>
            <li> and she ask me if it was suppose to hurt like crap</li>
            <li> It was also annoying having to wait for the hair to grow out a bit between uses.</li>
            <li> Bad product!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this was painful!  </li>
            <li> This is so painful!</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> and I hated how it often missed the coarser hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the fact that you are basically plucking a lot of the hair out at one time, I found this to not be very painful.</li>
            <li> This product is also very painful to use.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> very painful to use.</li>
            <li> It does remove the hair, very painfully......</li>
            <li> Seldom works well and when it does it&#x27;s very painful.</li>
            <li> Very painful, and does not get all the hairs off.  </li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t use it very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Waxing also gave me nasty acne, which isn&#x27;t a problem at all with my Bellabe.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>
            <li> I think it is a  terrible product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an insane amount of pain</li>

            <li> sorry purchase !!!!</li>
            <li> and it did not remove alot of the hair off my chin- very expensive!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get the hang of it but it works really well! Better for coarser hair but it does get fine hair too with a little more effort and its a little tricky on the curvy parts of your face but all in all I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> Some hair does get removed, but not enough to make a noticeable difference. Personally, I find waxing to be less painful and more effective. Not to mention this thing tends to brake the hair rather than remove it. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Been using on and off a couple months - seemed to work well initially but now doesn&#x27;t seem to be &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; the hairs.</li>
            <li> used this on my forehead and chin. Love it, has a tingle, but it made my skin so soft after one use. No more peach fuzz!! Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Okay, this thing works too well.  You know when you&#x27;re twisting it correctly when you fill like little pins and needles are stabbing you.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get used to the pain, but I do like how well it takes hair out from the roots.  If you&#x27;re into self-torture, this little device&#x27;s effects are long-lasting.  I&#x27;m just a chicken and have put it up for a bit.  Will come back to it later since it&#x27;s very easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe Facial Hair  Remover is inexpensive, and helps remove fine facial hair, but is not good for chin hairs or the occasional stiff single hair on the chin or upper lip.  I prefer a GOOD tweezers that will grasp these firmly and leave no root to grow again.</li>
            <li> Does the job but hurt like hell</li>
            <li> This works but KILLS! ! The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s a little hard to maneuver on the right side of my face.</li>
            <li> its not working at all</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and effective. I have a hard time giving a product that hurts a 5,haha. Also I thought it would last forever and pull everything out fast.. It says it needs to be replaced every 6-9 months, at that rate I would consider the ones that are only a few dollars. We will see.</li>
            <li> These work great! I have used them for years. The only downside is they get stretched out over time, so you will have to replace them every so often - well, that, and the pain...but I haven&#x27;t found anything else that does the job so well as these!</li>
            <li> It works ok if you continue to use it. It is painful, but it does get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> Eh.  Doesn&#x27;t work very well and takes a long time. I&#x27;ll stick to messy waxing.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, absolutely love it.....just got to get thru the 1st couple times, eyes will tear!  bettr than nair or personal groomers</li>
            <li> Anyone who has a covering of down facial hairs will love this.  Slight discomfort when the hair is pulled out but it doesn&#x27;t pull the surrounding skin like waxing does.  The Bellabe is sturdy and easily controlled.  Mastering the technique only took a few minutes and it works well.  You can keep up with hair removal without a need for waxing.  Portable.  Can be done anywhere.  No fuss.  So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Great hair remover! Hurts a lot in the beginning, but saves you a lot of money and trips to the eyebrow parlor. I have been using this product for the last 4 years now on my upper and lower lip, and i have not had problems so far.</li>
            <li> the best hair remover ever. this product works great buy it</li>
            <li> I was so tired of all the creams on the market that kept changing formulas over the years, and I&#x27;m not one for waxing...and bleaching was out of the question (that would have looked ridiculous with my skin color). So I found the Bellabe and read many reviews and figured at the low price I really didn&#x27;t have much to lose...except facial hair! Four stars for a working product; I had to skip the fifth star because the pain level completely took me by surprise. I should have known that pulling the hair by the roots from the skin on my upper lip was not going to feel nice, to put it mildly. However, I did test the Bellabe on my cheek and jawline to just see what that felt like and it wasn&#x27;t bad at all. All the directions for use are on the label of the container (which was super clean and nicely packaged), and there&#x27;s also a small information sheet on cleaning the Bellabe. Overall, really decent product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on the peach fuzz I have on my cheeks. I followed the directions completely and it caused a severe reaction on my face. I am 30 years old and do not have acne and right now I look as if I am a teenager with severe acne. Not only is this product over priced (its just a spring with handles) it does not work very well and I would never have used it if I had known this was a risk. I have used harsh creams before on my peach fuzz and NEVER had a reaction like this. I used it 4 days ago and the rash/acne has not cleared up and now I have to spend money to go to the doctors. BEWARE! I can send you a pic of the rash so you know I am not over exaggerating.</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. Not for very fine hair.</li>
            <li> 10xs better than any cream I&#x27;ve tried. I must warn you though, the first time you use it it is a little painful depending on how much hair you&#x27;re removing. I follow up with it every few days so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much. Easy to use! I&#x27;ve had problems with light blonde upper lip, chin and cheek hairs and this miracle wand works! No more being embarrassed and worried if anyone could see the hairs left behind from those wasteful creams. I&#x27;m more confident about bring close to my husband. My makeup applies a lot better now also. Highly recommend this miracle wand!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of it.  Just make sure you tied up your hair and slick back hair and sideburn hair that you want to keep!  I think it is easier using two hands to twist the bellabe than the way the instructions tells you too!</li>
            <li> This is a magic wand, it takes out more hair than I knew I had. Not completely painless, come on it is pulling hair out, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> The product is made very well. The price is absolutely reasonable in my opinion but it I foind it too painful.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t do it on your cheeks if you don&#x27;t want horrible acnes!</li>
            <li> What a simple product and works so well!  I was skeptical when I purchased it, but it definitely worked as advertised .  I use it on my upper lip and chin and it does the job quickly and practically painlessly.  I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews on this product but when I tried it I didn&#x27;t find it worked very well. I had to keep going over and over the same spot and it stil didn&#x27;t grab the hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading several reviews.  I have previously used shaving, chemicals and electrolysis. As an African American with dark hair and skin I did not feel laser was an option for me. The main problem with permanent hair removal is new follicles are constantly being stimulated and the hair removal battle is never totally won. I have used the Bellabe facial hair remover and found it to be an excellent mechanical hair remover. When using the Bellabe, the is a pulling sensation of the hair which is slightly painful but no redness. It requires frequent use but the frequency of use has decreased for me.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> when I first used it  - it was awkward but it really does work.  Hurts in the lip area but does the job.</li>
            <li> bought one for me and my daughter. We are both pleased with the product. There is a slight pinching while hair is being pulled out, but beauty doesn&#x27;t come easy!  :)  I think the price could be a little less.</li>
            <li> No longer will the wife have to go to the place where the lady and the string cleans off her facial hair.  She loved it and that&#x27;s all that counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my chin for grins and let&#x27;s just say I will be sticking with my razor. less pain.... I am not tough enough to let hair be pulled from chin on a regular.</li>
            <li> This works like magic! I have always waxed or tweezed because it lasts longer than shaving my chin or upper lip, but waxing hurts and leaves my skin red for hours and tweezing takes forever! This little tool works just like tweezing, but you get to pull many hairs at once! It hurts less than waxing, but it is pulling the hair out by the root so it is going to hurt about as much as tweezing would. I think this is a great solution for hair removal and a big time saver.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old and have tried many different types of hair removal products. This is by far the best I have found. It takes a short time to master the technique, but it is worth every second. Before I bought one for myself, I bought one for a friend who was constantly looking for an effective facial hair removal product. I saw this on line and decided to take a chance for her. She loved it! The rest is history!!! Excellent product. [[ASIN:B001RPL902 Bellabe Facial Hair Remover]]</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use medication for acne so waxing is not an option because it pulls off a layer of skin. So this allows me to remove my facial hair without irritating my skin.  It&#x27;s hurts so at first but after the first time you use it there is less hair and therefor less pain. I love it. So much faster and less expensive than any other method. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I just got this item in the mail today, and immediately put it to use. I love the product. It was mildly painful, but nowhere near unbearable. My husband could see the difference before and after, and I was thrilled to see hair trapped in the coils with nearly every pass. I do wonder if over time the product will lose tension and no longer be effective...makes me want to order a lifetime supply just in case! I totally recommend this tool, much more efficient than tweezing, and no long term side effects like scar tissue or damage to skin from waxing. If I can find some way to convert this for use with the bikini line, I will be all set! buy this bellebe product, it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> it really hurt and it only owrked on the longer hairs. I sent it back....the people on youtube siad it did not hurt. not the truth!</li>
            <li> maybe i didn&#x27;t know how to work this, but it was a waste of money - cheaper to go have your face threaded</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and works well! The company is honorable and delightful to deal with. I did not receive my order and I informed them and was immediately sent another bellabe. I recommend the product highly.</li>
            <li> I bought Bellabe because of the reviews, and I am glad I did. It took me a good 10 minutes to figure out how to get the hair to come out. Once I turned the handles the RIGHT way :), it worked like magic. It hurts like a mug, but that&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;ll deal with the pain, as long as it does it&#x27;s job, and my skin is unharmed. Awesome option for those of you using Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of keeping one at home, at work and in the car. Seriously!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It works great once you get the hang of it. I would recommend using something like the NoNo or waxing for the first time and then using this thing to keep any regrowth under control. And other reviewers are right...it&#x27;s kinda addictive!</li>
            <li> This brand seems to work very well for me. It can be a bit painful at first if you&#x27;ve never used one before but it does get easier. Such a fairly quick and simple solution. You can use it while watching TV. Just be careful if you get near your eyebrows or lashes ! Then you need to be using a mirror. I love these and wish that I had known about them years ago. Just throw it in your makeup case and you&#x27;re good to go when traveling. I usually have to replace mine after about a year so it&#x27;s a great value. I bought a few of the cheap ones just to compare and they ended up in the garbage, they didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> helpful item !! if you are  an make up stylist/artist, or even for the day by day, it will be a great item for your makeup bag or necessaire!</li>
            <li> This is a unique hair removing system for the face.  It can be a bit tricky to get it just right in order to remove the hair from the roots.  Once removed, however, it leaves no stubble.</li>
            <li> Just received my Bellabe Hair Remover today. At first, I didn&#x27;t think I could tolerate it, however, after several tries, I bit the bullet and went for it. It got easier and less painful over the few minutes I used it.  Have had my facial fuzz waxed a few times, but this will eliminate these trips not to mention the expense of waxing.</li>
            <li> this is okay for fine hairs but hurts like crazy and still have to follow up with tweezers.</li>
            <li> If not for the reviews I read about this product I highly doubt I would have purchased it. I have been struggling with facial hair for years, trying various products and often ended up shaving the upper lip and chin because I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the growth. This little gizmo from Bellabe is amazing. It gets all the hair, even the most stubborn ones, most of the time. Once in a while I do have a lone hair, usually short and thick, that I have to tweeze. It is very quick, I usually use it while reading an email, (yes usually only one email because it is so quick and easy to use). I never use a mirror while using it and when I check the mirror later I find little if any hairs left I need to deal with. I like it so much I am going to order another one so I have one for my purse and one for home.</li>
            <li> Its less painful than waxing, but there is still pain. Its an easy way for remove facial hair. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used depilatory creams for years to remove unwanted facial hair, but lately have been worrying about the chemicals they contain.  Recently I learned about Bellabe on a shopping channel web site and became curious as to whether it would be a viable alternative for me.  I decided to toss one into my \\&quot;cart\\&quot; when purchasing other items at Amazon.  After receiving and trying out the product, I find that it does work.  Usage does involve a slight stinging sensation, which will hopefully lessen with time.</li>
            <li> It works!  It works!  It really works!!  Prior to receiving this, I&#x27;ve been using Avon facial hair remover cream for the last year or so.  My &amp;#34;trouble spots&amp;#34; were just mainly my upper lip and over near my side burns.  Thankfully I have blonde hairs so they aren&#x27;t that noticeable but I really had to keep on it because it felt like stubble when it would grow back in.  I don&#x27;t like that feeling!  The trick with that cream is that you have to time it just right.  If you wait close to 3 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t remove it all, but if you wait too long it burns your skin along with removing the hair.  It was horrible for my skin. The cream also only keeps you feeling smooth for one day.  I didn&#x27;t want stubble, I didn&#x27;t want to have to wax.  I certainly never would want to SHAVE for heaven sakes.  This WORKS!  I&#x27;m sooooo happy.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought after reading some reviews.  The upper lip is a little sensitive, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the feeling.  It&#x27;s easy to just roll and use while watching TV.  TV provides a distraction from an uncomfort you might experience.  You know when you&#x27;ve gotten it all when you no longer feel hairs being grabbed.  I&#x27;m sooooo glad I won&#x27;t need to buy the creams anymore.  My face felt like a chemical burn a few times from the creams, and I swore I would find a better solution.  THIS IS IT!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  It really is great.  I wish I could manipulate it better to make it work on my chin.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s stellar!</li>
            <li> I have not just one but TWO of this product. One sits by my computer. It is safe, fast and easy to use. the other one stays in my purse. I have bought all my friends  this and I even sell it on my website. Big fan!</li>
            <li> good, but need to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;it not so easy to use...and also , it helps to take care of your facial issue immediately, tempotarity</li>
            <li> Believe it or not it works.  It&#x27;s not without a little pain, but you get used to that.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This actually works. It takes awhile to get all the hairs out, but once you do I think it lasts a little longer than (or at least as long as) waxing. It pinches/stings/pricks a little, but as you get used to using the bellabe, it gets better. If you remove hairs on your face at all you should own this. It&#x27;s cheap and it does work. However, it&#x27;s not for eyebrows. Not even in the middle region. I tried and it&#x27;s just not effective there and you can&#x27;t get it too close to your actual brows or it will rip them out. So avoid the eye region, but it&#x27;s great for the rest of your face.</li>
            <li> I received the Bellabe 3 weeks ago.  It was easy to use and very effective in removing the facial hairs on the upper lip and chin area.  I had to work harder to remove the hairs on the lower chin area.  Mainly because they were not as visible and it is tougher (for me at least) to thighten the skin in this area.    So far I am very pleased, the hair was pulled from the roots and has not returned.  There is a stinging sensation, but more gentler than wax removal.  And I don&#x27;t have the rough fuzzy hairs, (or shadow),  that is left by shaving.  I only wish I had known of the product years ago.  I have what I fear is permanant skin discoloration on my upper lip and chin area from years of using hair removal creams.     For those wanting additional information on the product, there are several \\&quot;great\\&quot; videos available on youtube.    I viewed several before deciding to purchase the item.</li>
            <li> this really does remove the hair. i use it for upper lip hair removal and it does such a good job. you dont even need to use a mirror! it does hurt! its like tweezing.</li>
            <li> I no longer need to use creams or pay for waxing! This product leaves my face feeling as smooth as silk (almost). The ripping of facial hair from the roots by the Bellabe is not a walk in the park, but the result is worth the discomfort. It&#x27;s cheap, too. I will get one for my daughter, she has a hairy face too.</li>
            <li> Bellabe does irritate my sensitive skin, but alot less irritation than waxing or epilating, so I try to use it sparingly. I use it when I&#x27;m tweezing and it&#x27;s faster &amp; more effective than waxing because if it misses a few hairs I roll it over the area again. I don&#x27;t wax anymore but kept the wax for nose hairs, because it is excellent for that and not slow torture like plucking them. Bellabe is not fun to use and does feel like I&#x27;m pulling the little hairs out of my face. It seems gentler than waxing, definitely less messy and time consuming. It&#x27;s exactly like tweezing only getting many more hairs in one rolling pull. Bellabe can cause a breakout, but it doesn&#x27;t if I use restraint, use it only where it&#x27;s most needed, 1 or 2 rolls over, and not get overeager and pull out every bit of hair I can find. There is cleaning instructions for the Bellabe. I clean mine before I use it and use a toning acne product on my skin after. It&#x27;s a great tool to have and I would recommend getting one, especially for when you need to pull hairs out in hurry.</li>
            <li> save yourself the ingrown hairs and go get it threaded or learn how to thread. This thing screwed up my skin</li>
            <li> Cute little hair-removing device.  It works good, but not on long facial hair.  Takes a bit to get the hang of using it, but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to but now it&#x27;s the handiest device I own. Worth every penny. I bought a no-no and it was a total waste of money. By the time I figured out it was making my hair problem worse instead of better the return window was closed. This does have a little pain but it&#x27;s less than waxing and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin reddened afterwards. I have found I have to use it less and less frequently.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve used! Using tweezers takes too long and an epilator hurts too much on certain areas and leaves red spots. Of course this is not \\&quot;painless\\&quot; but it hurts the least on the upper lip and doesn&#x27;t leave red, sore areas. It takes a few tries to figure out how to use it. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to make it work at certain angles.</li>
            <li> Good product, but your hair has to be thick in order for it to work!</li>
            <li> hurts a bit but cheaper than paying someone to do it</li>
            <li> I think this product was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I would have had to spend hours just to get a few hairs.</li>
            <li> I saw a infomercial on TV while visiting my mom and immediately wished I had it right then and there to try.  As soon as I got home I went online to the Bellabe site and read more about it.  Then I went to Amazon and they had it and I ordered it and received it within 2 days.  The upper lip smarted the worst but the rest of the face had very little discomfort.  I use it now while I am watching TV and it is so nice not to have those wild hairs and baby fuzz on my chin and upper lip.  I gave my sister one and she loves it.</li>
            <li> its so easy to use n I dont have to go to salon for facial hair removal often. Its cheap too...i love it.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NONE OF THE THINGS IT PROMISED. FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS ME, BUT AFTER A FEW MORE TRYS, IT DID NOT WORK</li>
            <li> Yes, I like it and use.  I still have to use tweezers.  Would I purchase again? Not sure.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this before purchasing and want to add my 2 cents:  It took some time for me to figure out how to work it.  Some of the instructions  for other spring products say roll the handles in and out. That did not work for me.  I have to continually turn it one way as I roll it across the face.  That works. As  far as the pain goes, you get used to it after using for a while and it&#x27;s no big  deal (to me).  I do have to use it every day, though and it feels like it is pulling   hair out every time I use it, so either I&#x27;m really hairier than I thought or I&#x27;m not  going over the same area enough.  It does leave your face baby&#x27;s butt smooth, and  sometimes I still have to pluck one of the coarser hairs.  Other than that-great   product for the money and I am happy I found it.</li>
            <li> upper lip and chin, this contraption hurts like crazy :) but it sure does work.&lt;br /&gt;(tough spots may need going over twice)&lt;br /&gt;really simple to use - just do it.&lt;br /&gt;*a little ice afterward and the red disappears.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the hang of using the Bellabe, but once I had the twisting motion down it works well. Surprisingly, it grabs the finer hairs better than the darker thicker hairs. Does irritate my skin a  bit, but way less than my old hair removal creams. Use before bed and any irritation will be gone by morning.</li>
            <li> After years of trying so many different items and products to rid myself of that pesky facial hair, I am finally happy with something!  The Bellabe facial hair remover really does the job.  After the first initial use of the product, I did notice less hair and the hair that did come in was by far less coarse.  It did take some time to get used to using the product, and, I will not lie, it was painful.  But so is waxing and threading!  This product is similar to threading and you can do it yourself at home or anywhere!</li>
            <li> This sounded like the perfect item to painlessly remove unwanted facial hair.  Not!  It is painful and does not do a good job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why so many people would say they loved their Bellabe, what was to love about ripping hair out of your skin? But after using it for a couple months, I totally understand now.   I was tired of dealing with trying to get rid of facial hair with less than good results, so I went ahead and bought it based on the reviews. There is a learing curve to using it, but I would say go slow, don&#x27;t expect to just quickly roll it over your face and have all your hair gone.     I started with the blonde peach fuzz on my cheeks and could go faster with that, it felt like tiny pricks, not bad. Than onto chin hair which had some hairs that were darker and coarser, therefore I went slower and used a magnifying mirror for. Just roll in one direction and go slow, it will grab those coarse hairs if you are patient with them, these hurt more to pull out. Got to the upper lip and yes, this area hurt like heck! I actually had tears coming from my eyes, but I persisted because I knew if I could get through it, the results would be good and each time it would get easier. I actually asked my hubby to get me some ice so I could numb the area. Not sure if this was a good idea because while it did numb it, the cold ice will actually close your pores tighter making the hair more difficult to pull out.     There are still a few hairs I have to pull out with tweezers, under the chin mainly, the skin is a little loser there. Also at the jaw line it takes more time with the Bellabe to get those hairs, I think it is the angle.     Now when I use Bellabe, the hairs come out easily and there is very little pain. Hair takes longer to come in and is thinner. My skin is so soft and smooth, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about strange hairs when I go out.   I use this every other day since different hairs grow on different cycles but I too am one that can now say I love my Bellabe!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Fast shipping and I received it on a Saturday. Gets those pesky hairs, although underneath the chin is a little more difficult than the other facial areas. Hurts a tad bit, but it&#x27;s not as bad as I thought it would be. I gave this four stars because the wand is a little flimsy. Would be great if it was a little sturdier. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> As another woman with facial hair issues, I have searched for many years for something that is effective, painless, fast, and produces long-lasting results. This little spring is effective, fast, and seems to produce long-lasting results, but is definitely not painless.  Rolling the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover across the chin, neck, and cheek area is easy and fast. It seems to do better removing the fine hairs than the coarse, thick hairs, but that just makes it easier to tweeze the leftovers.  My upper lip area seems to be a more sensitive area, so I have to do shorter hair-removal sessions, more often, to achieve the same results.  The stinging sensation (of the hairs being ripped out by their roots) is brief, and the slight reddening of the skin (as a result of the hairs being ripped out by thier roots) is temporary. That this removes multiple hairs at once (rather than tweezing one hair at a time) is well worth the short-term discomfort.  There&#x27;s no chemicals involved, no mess, no microwaving, no nicks or cuts.   I rated this at 4 stars because the handles are a rubbery, neoprene-type substance; I have tactile sensation issues, meaning I am unable to touch certain surfaces. Unfortunately, the handles on this wonderful device are one of the substances I&#x27;m not able to touch. Fortunately, a washcloth or tissue wrapped around the handles provide enough protection that I&#x27;m able to use this as I wish.</li>
            <li> Not the best product for me.  I have some very fine hair on my jaw and above my lip area.  Above my lip area bothers me the most.  It&#x27;s not so much you can see the hair but more like a shadow the very fine hair creates.  I did watch youtube videos but found the bellabe hard to use, it&#x27;s definitely all in the technique you use.  You will definitely know when it does pull out hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if I don&#x27;t have the proper technique down right or if I&#x27;m expecting this item to pull too fine hairs.  It&#x27;s sitting in a drawer and I don&#x27;t expect to be pulling it out any time soon.</li>
            <li> This thing is AMAZING! I grew up with an Epilady (torture device), so I was really scared to use it. First I started on areas with little to no hair (my nose and under my eyes...in other words - I was stalling!)...and worked up to my upper lip...so scared! But I was watching a movie and did it little by little, and it all got done - cheeks, chin, under my lower lip, then the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, it feels like you&#x27;re pulling your hair out, but this tool is more gentle than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY helps to do something distracting while using this tool. Watch TV! Something monotone like a movie will calm you better than a show with commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work your way up to the scary spots...it helps you get used to working with it &amp; getting your technique down while also helping you to psyche yourself up to get to the *real* spots. I thought that the &#x27;invisible&#x27; fine hairs would hurt, but those were the easiest, so that&#x27;s a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in a calm state of mind before you start will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a toner with salicylic acid every other day to prevent bumps &amp; breakouts. I know that sounds harsh, but you want to keep those areas exfoliated to prevent ingrown hairs and pimples. Preventing them is MUCH easier than trying to get rid of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I saw a review of the bellababe on youtube and wanted to try it out myself.   So I have a peach fuzzy face, and it drives me nuts. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things to defuzz my face, waxing being the most painful and my skin reacting badly to hair removing creams.   As soon as this arrived in the mail, I was already trying it out. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it did hurt a little bit. My face looked a little pink after using but hey you are ripping hair out. It worked fantastically! My face feels and looks smooth. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.   If you have a fuzzy face, buy this! You wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bellabe for a few months and have found it to be easy and effective for me.  I have used it all over my face, with great care avoiding eyebrows and eyelashes.  I adjusted quickly to the initial stinging and it hasn&#x27;t left any irritation on my sensitive skin.  I like that I can use it as often as I like and after a few times of use, it seems some of the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back.  I focus mostly on my upper and lower lips, and use tweezers for the more stubborn ones that are thick and deep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark.  I&#x27;ve used bleaching creams that weren&#x27;t effective for very long, plus were irritating to my skin.  I also tried waxing which caused redness, dryness, irritation and pimples.  I resolved to tweezing but (at age 57), I have too much facial hair to tweeze every one.  It had become my latest retirement project!  Bellabe has been a blessing to my rather simple primping routine.  That routine is especially simple now with Bellabe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Bellabe after reading some rather concerning reviews on other forms of hair removal.  I was skeptical of Bellabe because it seemed too good to be true, yet figured I had nothing to lose considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but if this can be of help to one woman it will have been worth it.  I know there are other women like myself who don&#x27;t go to spas or spent much time in salons or reading beauty magazines to learn what tools and techniques are available, yet we also desire to look as attractive as we can.</li>
            <li> This tiny little spring does the job wonderfully and was super cheap. It&#x27;s one of my must-have beauty products! But seriously ... it hurts like he**!! LOL! You kind of get used to it after a minute though - kind of like you get used to the pain of tweezing after the first few plucks : ) I think it&#x27;s less painful when I use it just after a hot shower when my pores are open. I was worried that using this would give me a rash or leave some sort of redness or swelling, but nope - it hasn&#x27;t left a mark! I def recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product and it was good for the first couple of tweezings, but honestly, I think using a tweezer is more effective and less time consuming. With tweezers, you see the hair, you pluck the hair, and then you are hairless. The Bellabe is really a hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Can anyone compare the Bellabe, Epicare, and REM Spring Sprong, or others I may not know about? Prices vary, so I wonder if the more expensive ones (like REM) are better. . .     [...]    I am now using the Bellabe. It works OK, but sometimes leaves hairs under the chin that I can&#x27;t see very well. Also, the spring has gotten discolored and has a metallic smell. Wondering if upgrading to a more expensive model would get better results?     Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this was painful!  I&#x27;ll probably go back to waxing.  My results were spotty even after going over the instructions.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dark hairs under my chin and this works...except for those last few hairs that I have to pluck. It&#x27;s almost picky - it won&#x27;t get the hairs that are too thick or too small. It works great on my upper lip tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE read the other reviews about how to use the roller. IT RIPS YOUR HAIR OUT. The first time will hurt like no one&#x27;s business. But it does get better. Doing my upper lip is still difficult but I have found a way to use it that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product overall. If you&#x27;re not into buying expensive waxing tools or trying the  chemical hair removals, this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I tried this product prior to buying it and found it to be amazing. It removes hair from my chin area which at my age is a big deal. I use it at least twice a week. I found that hair does not grow back as quickly as plucking it with a tweeezer.   I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This works great. Be careful to be gentle the first time because it can hurt. After a while, it is easy to use and the pain subsides. Make sure to disinfect before and after with Witch Hazel or else you&#x27;ll get pimples or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this product. So easy and effective</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price. Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Impossible to move quickly enough to help alleviate torturous pain. I watched quite a few YouTube videos before trying on my face. I began on my chin area. The instructions state that if not used with the &amp;#34;correct&amp;#34; method, this may cause hairs to break rather than be removed. Hogwash. Obviously I used it correctly because many hairs were removed (especially the finer hairs just under my lip). Yet, I was still left with a wake of broken hairs. One can twist their fingers whilst moving this wand, but only just so fast. Because it is limited in speed, in this manner, it&#x27;s impossible to swiftly remove hairs. When I use tweezers, I pull out hairs very quickly. This helps reduce the pain. As suggested, I also held a warm-hot washcloth to my chin prior to using. You might love this product if: you&#x27;re good at patting your head with one hand, rubbing your belly in circular motions with the other hand, and jumping rope---all at the same time. Also, you might love if you do not mind the idea of tapping hairs out of the spring after use---good luck with that. Returning for refund unless I can convince my dentist to allow me to use while I use the laughing gas.</li>
            <li> I use it for my upper lip and I am not going to lie... if you have never used this before this little gadget hurts like a mother at the beginning since you are dealing with a very sensitive area however your skin does get used to it, and it works like a charm. No more waxing for me, I love this thing!</li>
            <li> This little doo dad is awesome. I use this in conjunction with my tweezers. This Bellabe gets most everything, and then I go back with the tweezers and get the ones that were too short for the spring. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> and this was definitely painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover today and just finished using it.  It really works and deserves the high ratings however I couldn&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars because it was PAINFUL.  I mean it hurt like a motha...  lol!  My eyes were tearing up, I&#x27;m breaking out in a sweat, my face is getting red and my stomach was in knots.  But I couldn&#x27;t stop using it because it really worked!  For a moment I thought it might also be pulling my skin so I went over an area that didn&#x27;t have hair.  Nope, nothing.  So I went on to finish what I started.  After I was done I washed my face and still my face was tingling, but in a good way.  On the up side, my face feels really smooth (and warm from the hair pulling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s a good product if you don&#x27;t mind the hair pulling.  I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product.  Just surprised at how much it hurt.  I have no regrets purchasing it and I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001RPL902 Bellabe Facial Hair Remover]]Was skeptical but it works great. It took about an hour to figure out the technique but is so much less hassle than a razor or tweezers. It feels very similar to getting threading done. I am sure the better I get with the technique the faster it will work and the less pulling I will feel.</li>
            <li> It works once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool - it actually works!  Not super well - but amazingly well for what it does.  Just FYI - since I started taking evening primrose oil, it&#x27;s almost totally eliminated the hair on my face, I only have a little bit left now, and it&#x27;s very light and fine, almost non-existent.  So I don&#x27;t really even need to use this anymore.  But it does work.</li>
            <li> Painful but works pretty well. It is a coil that pulls out your hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, painful at times</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for removing unwanted peach fuzz.  I love it and am on my 3rd one! The only downside is they need to be replaced about every month to keep a tight spring. Which is sooner than what they say in the description I think.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I had a friend that got her face threaded . . She looked amazing afterwards. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have the money or the time to go to a threading Kiosk. Fortunately for me I found the Bellabe and tried it. The results are amazing. My makeup applies easier and my face looks much better. No stinging, burning, or redness. Ladies, if you are paying money to get your face threaded you need to try this product. You will be amazed!!!  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> Does a good job, yes its uncomfortable but not as bad as plucking and you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This nifty item does well at removing facial fuzz, but not without a bit of sting!  One just thinks of a pleasant subject and all the discomfort goes away.</li>
            <li> Works just as they claim!  Wish I discovered this years ago!!</li>
            <li> Best thing I have used. Gave it a four because it does take several tries to get some hairs</li>
            <li> This item is fast and gets the job done fast, and gives ultra smooth results, but is incredibly painful. I have been tweezing for 40 years, and I can&#x27;t even feel that any more. I guess the nerves quit caring after several decades! I expected this product to feel about the same, but it didn&#x27;t. It hurt so much I almost screamed out loud. It grabs quite a few hairs at once, many of them those tiny ones you can&#x27;t really see when tweezing, I think. To the good, this is a very small tool, could be easily and discreetly carried,  is very simple to use and works! But it will knock you to your knees.</li>
            <li> Works well. A little tricky to get used to using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to remove hair on entire face. It would take too long, but it does work. It&#x27;s a little painful,  but I knew it would be. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is painful but it works amazingly on facial hair. I use this on my lip and chin and it definitely gets all of the hair out but you have to have a decent pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I would spend many hours a week tweezing. I am really happy with the results and now only spend 20 mins a week removing unwanted hair. My face is smooth and hairless!!! I wish I had found this 10 years ago. I would have saved so much time on this process. It hurts, but I am used to waxing and threading so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I would say it hurts about the same or a bit less than threading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-15-12&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few months now and the results are fantastic!!!! I can&#x27;t believe I spent all that money on useless hair removal methods. This is a huge money saver. The results are a smooth hairless face. I had a few bumps the first couple of times, but now it doesn&#x27;t even cause redness.</li>
            <li> Great Item very handy. Fits great in my purses. Use it all the time. Recommended it to friends and family. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great as all the reviewers love it, and it did its job so I can&#x27;t fault the product.  It hurt me so F-ing bad that I started to bleed from the pulled hairs.  I had tears streaming down my eyes immediately so I couldn&#x27;t even use it.  Stay away if you are sensitive like me, otherwise this product does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> I will never wax my lip again. This is so easy. Not completely painless but well worth the effort. It takes all the hair off my upper lip and leaves it smooth and   soft. Love this!</li>
            <li> I do like this a lot .and I have tried the creams for facial hair and had a reaction from it and broke out with sores on the side of my right lip. And saw the and said why not. I use to use tweezers in the past and I admit it does sting a little. So I gave this a shot and it stings a little bit to but I can handle it and much faster then one at a time lol. I even asked my husband if I could try it on his face and his reply was NO. That was funny. But it&#x27;s worth the money and safe.</li>
            <li> It hurts, don&#x27;t believe the fact that this painless.  It is really really not!</li>
            <li> Tweezing, but, quickly. I like it for quick touch ups, but, I still think waxing works best. Still, the product is easy to use and does a decent job.</li>
            <li> I have too many thick rooted chin hair i tried wax but since they r thick even wax wont work well, so i use to&lt;br /&gt;Pluck them but still some could be seen but this produ t is the bestttttttt plucks every hair i love love love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was kind of a fail because it didn&#x27;t really work as easy as people decribed it..or at least it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Bellabe babe! Never thought I would say this considering I had a bad experience with a facial spring before - bottomline - shell out some extra money for those products that touch your face. Period! This one removes hairs from the root and my hair grows in thinner and the best part for me is that it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts - which the cheaper version did! So, I&#x27;m a convert - this one is here to stay. Love the cylindrical cover it comes with too :)</li>
            <li> OUCH - that pretty much sums up my thoughts about this product. It is really painful and I just can&#x27;t use it very disappointed.</li>
            <li> excellent product! I use it everywhere it takes all the hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow! For a lady like me, this is great. I have a little more peach fuzz than most women and this thing really does the trick. It is easy to do while watching tv or waiting for the coffee to brew. While it is nowhere near painless, it is simple once you get the hang of it. Not to mention that it accomplishes so much more in the time it would take to go at it with tweezers or waxing. I am sold on this thing!</li>
            <li> The ad states \\&quot;Effective. Affordable. Easy.  Fast. Convenient. All of that has been true for me. Once you get the motion down, it only takes a few minutes to complete a job that used to take much longer with tweezing. This is even better than tweezing because the spring catches hairs I can&#x27;t see. Of course it stings a little since you&#x27;re removing hair from the roots, but the discomfort lessens significantly over time the more you use it. The results are long-lasting and I&#x27;m confident I don&#x27;t have hair anyplace on my face where I don&#x27;t want it. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and I don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use it anymore, so I can use it while catching up on the news on TV--which is much more painful than the Bellabe could ever be! It comes in a plastic tube so it&#x27;s kept clean between uses and it&#x27;s  easy to carry if you need to travel. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an inexpensive, highly effective, and quick way to remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or are adverse to feeling pain, this isn&#x27;t the product for you. It takes a bit of getting used to but works as described!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have tried tweezers, hair removal creme etc. and this is the best thing ever! It leaves your face soft and smooth and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast.</li>
            <li> This is most painful on the upper lip when you first try it.  But once your eyes stop tearing and your breathing returns to a normal pace, you realize this is actually very fast an effective tool.  It really works well on the chin and on side of your face (without pain) and can very quickly leave you smooth hair free.  I love this tool and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Think I&#x27;ll go back to waxing and tweezing.  This thing hurts to use, is hard to guide and to add insult to injury it causes breakouts. It smells of cheap metal, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s some kind of nickel-alloy metal - smells like a slinky I had when I was a kid.  Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal. It does pull a bit but who wants unneeded hair? You can use it any time.</li>
            <li> I actually like to keep one in my travel case, one and home, and one in the car.  I love this thing.  It really works to remove those nasty old chin hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than waxing and I like that there are no chemicals involved. It&#x27;s great, and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> It works, yes. It will grab anything, even coarse hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it hurts like a....well, you know! It&#x27;s very painful. If you think back to when you were a kid and you had a slinky and sometimes, it would get your arm hair stuck in it and sting really badly? Well, that&#x27;s what happens on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use it- it&#x27;s better than waxing, it gets everything. But if you&#x27;re looking for pain-free, it&#x27;s not the way to go!</li>
            <li> It works great! It just hurts REALLY bad. I read the reviews saying that once you get used to it, it will be okay. I don&#x27;t plan on getting used to it. I guess I have a low pain tolerance?</li>
            <li> This is a thin, tightly coiled springy wire.  Since the product doesn&#x27;t come with instruction, and just running it over the hair you want to remove doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, I surmised you&#x27;re supposed to bend the springy wire over the hairs so they will get trapped in the coils and pull the hairs out by the root when you jerk the device away. Too much trouble to return it, but I give full credit to the genius who invented this gadget for pure creativity and marketing.</li>
            <li> I never thought this product would work, but I saw so many favorable reviews, I could not resist. I had been using a depilatory for years. It was smelly, messy and results didn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;ve been using the Bellabe for about a month, and it&#x27;s the best thing. It stings a lot (no worse than waxing), but the results are well worth it. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Wonderful at removing unwanted hair once you get the hand of it, look on YouTube how to use if you are having difficulties.</li>
            <li> The perfect solution to an age old problem. It hurts a bit at first. I got used to it, just like anything else. Better than a razor. The hairs that are too course, or stubborn you can tweeze out. I a, very happy that I chose to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;trying&amp;#34; to remove facial hair for a couple of years. I have tried EVERY cream hair remover on the market, SOME of them removed the peach fuzz, NONE of them removed the hair above the lip or stray hairs on my chin. I purchased an item for several hundred dollars which the name fit the product...IT WAS A BIG NO NO!! That left scratches on my face that took several days to heal and MAYBE removed 3 or 4 hairs and NO peach fuzz. I finally decided to try the BELLABE I figured the price was inexpensive &amp; I had no expectations because of the price &amp; with all of my other disappointments....... I tried it the night I received it &amp; it works AMAZINGLY!!!! It stung on my upper lip, but no where else My skin has never felt so smooth. I have told several people about this product &amp; I am ordering some for gifts!!! I HIGHLY recommend this product.  I hope they come up with something that can be used on eyebrows :)</li>
            <li> Tip: use it after shower or having your face steamed for less pain.</li>
            <li> Hair grows back fairly quickly, it&#x27;s painful, and small hairs don&#x27;t get picked up. I have to go back and use tweezers. Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Very effective device once you get the hang of it.  Pulling out hair from the root, especially around sensitive lip area is painful, but the price we pay for good grooming!  Gives you something to do while watching tv in the evening😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with facial hair since I was a teenager and have had to face many embarrassing moments where people stare at my faint beard...  I&#x27;ve have tried waxing, threading the epilator etc...but I used to just tweeze as that was the only free, and hassle free technique I knew until I came across this tool!  In 20 min, I had a hair-free face!  It is a little painful but once u get used to the pain, u are fine... I cant believe I didnt know about this all my life! So much money wasted on going to the parlors!!!    I would wholeheartedly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of great reviews and boy, I was not disappointed.  When I first opened it I thought this can&#x27;t be good but was I wrong.  I used it on my upper lip and it worked great!  I wish I knew about this produce a long time ago.  It does hurt a little at first but it gets easier the more you use it.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am going to get another one. At first it hurts, but the hurts get less and it pulls out the hair. The chin is a challenge, but gets easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young adult, and I started noticing hair on my upper and lower lip when I was around 12. Initially I tried waxing, both professional and at-home, tweezing for 30 minutes a day (shudder), shaving with those little facial hair razors, and even hair removers like Nair. But no matter what I did, I always had the hair grow back enough so that within a week (or with shaving, a day) I had to repeat whatever process I used all over again. I found Bellabe because I looked up hair threading and decided that for $15 I was willing to give it a go.  The first time I used it, it hurt. It wasn&#x27;t terrible at all but I didn&#x27;t expect to feel it so much having waxed and tweezed almost daily for around two years prior. But I&#x27;ve since realized that it hurt because Bellabe was picking up ALL of the tiny little hairs that I couldn&#x27;t grab with my tweezers. After using it I was amazed at how smooth and hair-free my face looked, the results were great for having used it once and for 10 minutes.  Since then, I&#x27;ve started using it every day for maintenance. The way my face is, if I skip a day or two the hair grows back no matter what (albeit lighter and not as quickly). I LOVE THIS THING! There is only a slight pinching when I use it now, but it still removes all of the hair.  Some things about the product: It says the Bellabe is good for a year or so, and that after that you should get a new one. But I had my old one for almost two years and it worked perfectly. Just make sure you don&#x27;t clean it with alcohol, I did that with my old one at one point and it caused the thing to rust - it still worked perfectly but it was just rusted. I wasn&#x27;t quite vigilant with cleaning mine, maybe doing it once a week if that, but I never broke out because of it. In fact, I could use Bellabe when I had a cold sore or pimple and it wouldn&#x27;t affect it at all! Definitely don&#x27;t try using this on your brows, though. It&#x27;s just too big and not precise enough, it didn&#x27;t even really pick up on the small hair in between my brows.  Overall, I am totally sold on this product. I haven&#x27;t used other brands like Bellabe (Epicare, etc.) but I don&#x27;t need to. It is such a simple concept but it is honestly better than I thought it would be. It did everything I hoped it would and more, and there are no negative effects on your face (lightening, scarring, pulling, etc.)! I have been using Bellabe for going on three years and I&#x27;ve never had a complaint. I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Hurts so much but gets hairs off after going over it a couple times</li>
            <li> I had bought one of these earlier and lost it.  I love it so much I had to buy another one.  A great way to get rid of hair above the lip and on the chin.</li>
            <li> Probably just me, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make this work.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife.  And she was ecstatic with this item.  It is awesome!</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to try this. All I can say is..........WOW, it REALLY works! In minutes, I removed hair from my upper lip, chin and cheeks. Was it painless? No. Was it any more painful than a wax - not really. It really wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Hint: Watch TV and get distracted when you use the tool, and you&#x27;ll not concentrate on the tingling. I am very happy with my purchase, and the performance of this product. I&#x27;m blonde and have very fine facial hair (except upper lip) and the Bellabee handled it all. No more money spent on waxes, yea! The leaning curve on using this takes just a minute or two and the results are stellar. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of tools in the past... tweezing, waxing, threading, bleach, etc, and this so far by far has been the best.  So easy to use, a little pinch, but so is threading and tweezing.  I did have a few small red bumps the first two weeks, but my skin quickly adjusted and I love that I can do it as often as needed, no calling for appointments, etc.  Works great.  I highly recommend.  Came quickly and discreetly too!</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Bellabe hair remover.  Yes there is a little pain, not any more then tweezing.  The bellabe is quicker removes more hair with less amount of work. You can do it while you are watching your favorite movie.  My friend told me about this product and I&#x27;m so thankful she did.  No more wasting money on waxes.</li>
            <li> I like how this product is packaged and how it looks. It seems sturdy and is comfortable to hold.  While it definitely saves time and is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t consistently pull the hairs out by the roots- it can just break them off- especially the thinnest hairs so I find I go over the area I worked on and deal with broken or missed hairs with tweezers.  The product instructions and some of the reviews suggest that using this tool only causes mild discomfort- maybe not in the cheek area, but the upper lip HURTS... then again I never waxed (heard it was bad for the face) so I&#x27;m not used to grabbing 15 hairs at a time and yanking them out! OUCH.  Still, I&#x27;d recommend it, but I think I&#x27;ll try the easy treading tool Amazon sells and see how that works at consistently pulling hairs out by the roots...</li>
            <li> This works great, but if you are a sissy - don&#x27;t even attempt.  It is going to sting in places, and be a little more painful in sensitive areas.  I winced, but I got through it and was amazed how something so simple worked so well.  Ir hurt the worst around lips.  I have very fine blonde hair you can barely see, but I feel like part of the Duck Dynasty bunch sometime,  so I needed alittle something.  It does the trick and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than tweezers or wax in my opinion.  I can&#x27;t afford Lasik, so this was a great option.  Very simplistic, but does the trick. Happy!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this little spring!I have suffered with facial hair that drove me crazy for years. My hair is blonde so laser removal is not an option and waxing caused many bumps and irritation. I have to say I was not expecting this gadget to truly get all the hair but it did. I can&#x27;t believe how smooth my face is and it is amazing how different my makeup goes on without all of that fuzz. The best advice I have is to really play around with the Bellabe, using different techniques on different parts of the face. I found that by varying how I was twisting and rolling, how much bend in the spring etc I could get both the super fine and the courser hairs.I am so happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair out pretty easily. Yes, it is painful but I got used to it. The only thing that sucks is that the hair can get stuck inside the spring and I don&#x27;t know how to get it out without messing the spring up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 4/22/14: The springs have rusted! And there&#x27;s all of this old hair inside of it! Not worth the money... It is nice, but I just wish I can remove the hair inside the springs easily.</li>
            <li> This looks like it would not work, but it does. It reminds me of threading but with a spring. It hurts a little but you get used to the way it feels.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I experienced a bit of pain - but it gets easier every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is very simple and easy to use, and I can see for myself that the hairs on my upper lip are removed at the roots. I&#x27;ve tried a number of other solutions, including Nair and waxing, to my embarrassing dark-ish upper lip hair and after only a couple of days of owning this I can say with confidence that this is the best method available, in terms of return value for its cost. I can&#x27;t believe that fo this price I got a device that removed all of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is life changing for me. This is something that I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about for well over a decade. I would highly recommend this to any lady having problems with hair on the upper lip.</li>
            <li> It works! OUCH! LOL Seriously, it grabs all the hairs, fast and gets them out of there.</li>
            <li> This thing works great. My problem is that I must have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll use this thing and feel all excited that my face is so smooth and pretty and then the next day I develop pimples In place of each hair that was plucked. No matter how clean I keep my Bellabe, no matter how clean I keep my face, and even if I follow up with alcohol and antibiotic ointment, I ALWAYS develop those pesky little pimples. And that doesn&#x27;t happen if I pluck each hair individually. It&#x27;s strange. Maybe it&#x27;s the quick ripping of the hair out that causes some trauma to the skin? No idea. The thing that bugs me the most is that the hair starts growing back in before the pimples have even fully cleared! Talk about insult to injury! lol. I&#x27;ve tried this several times. Really, it does work marvelously, but if you have obnoxiously sensitive skin like I do, probably best to avoid this device. Not fair. Not fair at all.</li>
            <li> This thing HURTS!!! It is also hard to figure out if you are removing hair or it is just breaking off in the middle.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use correctly although I have figured it out with some practice.  Too much information but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on longer, coarser hair.  I still end up plucking.  Growing old is not fun...</li>
            <li> Ariane Bashimbe   love this item, it work it hurt a little when you pulling out the hair. Besides that i perfect nice and smooth as it says.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE my Bellabe. I&#x27;ve been a fan for years now. Thick, thin, fine hair, it grabs it all. For those who don&#x27;t know/aren&#x27;t sure how to use it, google a video for proper use. (I&#x27;m willing to bet youtube has at least one). This thing works like a charm. I simply will not be without one now.</li>
            <li> it works, but OUCH!!! more painful than waxing and plucking. i can&#x27;t use it. just too painful, even though i have prescription topical lidocaine ointment.</li>
            <li> Ouch! Pulls hairs out pretty well when used correctly.. But it hurts cuz it&#x27;s a pretty slow process.. And the hair grows back pretty quickly. I broke out right after using it and that never happens with tweezing. Coincidence? Possibly.. But I only broke out in the spots I used it.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it really removs the hair</li>
            <li> I have one now. Had it for a while. I need new one. They work very well nice item. I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does remove hair, but only a few at a time.</li>
            <li> This thing is freakin amazeballs. Perfect for ripping out those fine downy like hairs.</li>
            <li> This does the same thing as waxing except you don&#x27;t have to go to a salon to get it waxed. NOT FOR EYEBROWS, says so right on the package and I would never try it either. You can&#x27;t accurately get the eyebrow hairs with this tool. This does hurt and doesn&#x27;t feel good. Any one who says it doesn&#x27;t hurt might have numb skin or who knows. Waxing hurts, this is just a slower process of waxing but the results are the same. Honestly I need to numb the skin with ice first to make it easier to get thru. It doesn&#x27;t take more than a couple minutes. BUT IT WORKS GREAT! Beauty is pain!</li>
            <li> I had blonde hair on my jaw, chin, and upper lip.  I had been waxing my lip when the hair became noticeable, but when I turned 30, the hair on my jaw and chin started to get out of control.  It was still blonde, but got longer and would stick out in weird directions so you could see it.  Waxing was painful and had to be done before bed so that the redness and irritation would be gone by morning, and I could go out in public again.  I did NOT want to go through this production for the other areas of my face too.  I read the reviews for Bellabe, watched a few instructional videos, and decided to try it.  It only took a couple of minutes to get the hang of using it, and the results were awesome.  It gets hair I couldn&#x27;t even see!  The pain is minimal and just depends on the sensitivity of the area you are working on.  But it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful as waxing, and I get to keep my top layer of skin!  My skin was a little red where I removed a lot of hair, but it goes away after a few minutes like tweezing, and the more I use it, the less redness I notice.  I love that I use Bellabe as part of my makeup routine in the morning, and my skin is very soft and smooth now.  Very, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Reading through all the reviews, very mixed, I decided to go ahead and try this. Using tweezers simply doesn&#x27;t do it for me anymore, too many stray hairs that I don&#x27;t always see right away. Guess that happens with age. I hate the look of those hairs on other people, so am a bit paranoid! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to hurt. That&#x27;s what happens when you pluck hair off your face. (Remember the first time you did your eyebrows? Yeah, me neither, but my mom told me that I said it hurt like hell and I had tears in my eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little time to get the hang of this but once you do, this is a simple and very effective device. I will need to get used to it a bit better, couldn&#x27;t do my whole face in one sitting but expect it to go better in the next sitting. After I have removed all that fuzz, I expect it to be quite easy to keep up with it, just use it before going to bed and will be less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parts I did so far were red for a few minutes, but not all that bad. Next time I will buy the double pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update January 29th, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now into the third week of using this.&lt;br /&gt;First week was quite painful. I used it twice a day without problems though (no break outs or irritated skin) but was quite surprised to feel how much hair I kept removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second week I went to once a day using. I noticed that my skin became a lot softer and my wrinkles less deep. Not sure how that works, but hey, am taking it! Not saying it has anything to do with using this product, maybe just being lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third week: Am still using it once a day before bedtime. I am honestly surprised how much hair I keep pulling out. The past two days it has been less, but still more than I expected. At first I thought it was because of breaking hair off, but I can clearly see the roots when I pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;I expect to be using this once a day for a long time. It&#x27;s only for 10 minutes or so, so not that big of a deal to me and I hope the hair will grow back slower in the future. If you are looking for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you. I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, am not regretting buying this product. It does what it says it does. I don&#x27;t find it painful any longer (you do get used to it) and I don&#x27;t like using wax, so for me, this is perfect. Just be patient.for quick immediate result, this might not be the product for you. I will be ordering an extra one, and use the old one on my legs (see how that goes).

            <li> I bought this for the express purpose of removing those annoying hairs that are starting to grow on my chin. This does nothing. It seems to be fine on the little peach fuzz that grows on everyone&#x27;s faces that I can&#x27;t even see. but it will not touch the stronger stuff. $15 is a lot to pay for a spring.</li>
            <li> It did remove some hair above my lip. Maybe I was not quick enough with the twisting because I found the pulling of the hairs to be painful. I would rather use tweezers.</li>
            <li> I had been doing research on the No No for hair removal and most of the reviews were pretty negative, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend $300+ on a maybe.  I stumbled on this item while searching Amazon and figured for the price it was worth a try. It also had a lot of positive reviews.  It is the best.  It easily removes facial hairs, even small fine ones and the thicker chin type hairs.  There is a little sting, but no worse that waxing.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It hurts, and actually it didnt remove all the hair I wanted to get rid of. I think it deserves a lower price.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars for how it works, but I am withholding a star for the pain factor.  DEAR LORD! This thing makes me wimper and my eyes water.  It does a good job of ripping out the hair once you get the hang of how to twist it.  It is less irritating (despite the pain) to my skin than waxing, as I didn&#x27;t get the little pimples that I get with waxing. Like I said, it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be the first to say I probably didn&#x27;t give it enough of a try... It is so bendy that it&#x27;s hard to get the hair on certain locations and while some areas took out quite a bit of hair, the fight isn&#x27;t worth it to me. I&#x27;ll continue to tweeze or use an epilator in way less time.</li>
            <li> It was very good at it&#x27;s job but after a while it started leaving a lot of small spots around my upper lip area. These might have been from skin getting caught? I&#x27;m unsure but I had a rash for a long time until I stopped using this for good. Also, went bad after a while, where it just started to appear really dirty, like the metal had gone bad.</li>
            <li> Recieved my bellabe hair remover, yesterday and I&#x27;m very impressed with it! Am buying one for my friend now. very slight pain when the hair comes out is not a problem</li>
            <li> This spring like tool is barbaric and useless! Would not recommend to anyone! Waxing is less painful! Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is a simple and effective way to remove unwanted hair. It was reasonably priced and surpassed my expectations so far. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d already rated this one.  I&#x27;m hooked on it.  Can&#x27;t believe how this tool works &amp; how easy to use....my face has never felt smoother and I love  love  love no peach fuzz!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is really worth a try but the price is too much but is really worth it and help you remove all your hair from your face but don&#x27;t try your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way only one come for $15</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these coil hair removers from various sources. I totally wanted to compare. This one is truly the best quality one of them all...but...it does cost more.</li>
            <li> Oh this strips off the hair all right. It does a decent job of it but the method is so tortuous, no one in their right mind would put themselves through it.</li>
            <li> difficult to use, even with practiced technique, very time consuming and seems that all the hair is not removed, will be going back to waxing</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back and yeah sure it works  , but it breaks you out bad and by the time the breakouts are gone the hairs back. I&#x27;m gonna stick with tweezing.</li>
            <li> The older that I&#x27;ve gotten, the more facial hair I seem to be getting. This is not something that is very exciting to me. I&#x27;ve tried waxing, plucking and even shaving the few hairs that poke through. While effective, these methods can often prove to be painful and time consuming. With this facial hair remover, I was able to easily remove my facial hair with minimal pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering, this product arrived two days later. After removing it from the packaging, you see the the long spiral coil with two handles on either end. To use this facial hair remover, you hold the coil against your skin, stretch it apart, let the coil fold back into themselves and pull the coil away from your face. When you look down at the coil, you see the hairs between the coils. Simply stretching the coils back apart empties the hair from the coils. Then, you are able to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that you are basically plucking a lot of the hair out at one time, I found this to not be very painful. This quite surprised me honestly. Even plucking my eyebrows will make my eyes water. This felt almost like my skin was being pinched. No where near the level of pain that you feel after plucking or waxing!  When I pluck with tweezers, I often times have to take breaks. With this product, I was able to do all of the hair within minutes without any issues or even the thought of taking a break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that I would say would be that this item is not meant for precision jobs. It was perfect for my chin, cheeks and lip area, but was not precise enough for my eyebrow. It does an amazing job on the larger jobs, but you&#x27;ll still need another product to get those precision jobs such as your eyebrow. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. I would recommend it to anyone. It was a very fast and effective way to remove facial hair for the larger portions of my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I&#x27;ve seen these in the store for quite some time but never thought to buy one. Bellabe sent me one to review. The first time I used it I was shocked at how well it worked. The downside was that I was not prepared for the prickly feeling from the hair removal. My daughter watched me do it and noticed my eyes were watering. Beauty is not always painless. That being said, it&#x27;s important to know that some areas of the face are just much more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize that I had many very light and thin hairs on my face. My esthetician said we all do and we just don&#x27;t usually notice it. That makes sense. However, when your husband buys a magnifying mirror you start to take notice to everything. Having this little gadget is great because it&#x27;s easy to travel with and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that there is a bit of learning curve when you first use it. And keep it away from your eyelashes and eyebrows. If you have longer hair, pull it back so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally get grabbed. Go slowly at first. You may have a slight stinging sensation at first but after using it a few times it goes away. If you&#x27;re not sure how to use it or getting the best results, there are videos online you can watch. The key is to keep the skin taut, which can be difficult with some parts of the face. But don&#x27;t give in. If you think it may be painful take a pain reliever about 30 minutes before using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it&#x27;s something I think is quite useful.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I got a discount to review this product and I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  Works great.  When I first used it, I thought it was painful and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore, but I kept using it and then got used to it.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.</li>
            <li> This has just been so handy to have for removal of the stray facial  and neck hairs and peach fuzz ...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it came exceptionally fast! I have only used it once so far but I am surprised at how easy it is to use and a lot less painful than I imagined! I&#x27;ve had professional facial threading done before and it brought tears to my eyes. This product is much less painful and you have control over it instead of someone else, maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad, I&#x27;m not sure! I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was eager to give this a try in hopes of being able to retire my tweezers and magnifying mirror. I have to say that, for pulling out light soft hairs on the chin and upper lip, this works really well. It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing does, and it gets the job done a lot faster. I didn&#x27;t find it hard to figure out at all.  The downside: it doesn&#x27;t pull out the thicker hairs. I wonder if a tighter spring would do the job better.</li>
            <li> I really do like it but it hurts!  Have to get uaed to it.. broke out on my cheeks but not sure if it is from the bellable or just a heat rash since I was out in the sun a day after I used bellable.. but still getting used to</li>
            <li> It works really well. My face felt like I had shaved. I still have to pluck a few difficult hairs though. Good product!</li>
            <li> When reading all these reviews on here i thought why not!2 for 25$ and that will last me a whole year! This little thing works like a charm! Hardly hurts if ur used to plucking! But no ingrown hairs :)</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of passes to get the technique down, but after that, the BellaBe was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spa day at your house! Fill up the tub with warm water and bath salts, and relax for a bit. Then whip out your Bellabe and visit your secret places. It really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works underwater! It works without chemicals! It works in places where you don&#x27;t want strangers applying wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use your Bellabe in wrinkly places, be careful! Don&#x27;t accidentally pinch any tender skin! Aim carefully and just do a little bit at a time. The Amazon wasn&#x27;t deforested in a day!</li>
            <li> This is basically a large metal spring. Did nothing like I wanted, and I&#x27;m still tweezing. It can cover a large area of longer hairs, pretty much as useful for hair removal as duct tape placed onto and ripped off of hair. I gave it to my sister.</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use, fast, effective, saves me time and money not having to get waxed. It does smart a little when you start but after a minute it&#x27;s not as bad.</li>
            <li> This product was great. Actually way more than i expected. But i gave this product up for the NoNo because i felt like with Bellabe my facial hairs were growing longer and some were growing thicker, finer, or the same as before using this product. But while using Bellabe, it did pull out every single hair whether it was super short or average length. I loved the feeling it gave me after using. But i just hated the hairs growing back crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a hair removal option that did not irritate my skin. I had been using wax strips for sensitive skin, but it would still break me out and break me out in rashes. This bellabe works and does not irritate my skin! I love it. I use it about once a week when i start to see any facial hair come in. it even gets the baby hair/fuzz that you don&#x27;t even notice. Leaves my face nice and smooth. No more wax strips for me!</li>
            <li> The fine vellous hair on my face had to go. Menopause wasn&#x27;t going to win that one. This product is effective and inexpensive; however, it can aggravate the skin, and it hurts like a mother.</li>
            <li> I have had dark facial hair since age 12 everything was so expensive n creams made me break out I used this yes it stung a bit but no irritation no dark mark and it&#x27;s 99% gone in one hour it was on my neck my chin and the side of my face I now pull my hair up in cofindence and after I was done I cried thinking finially I don&#x27;t have to hide my son said mom your face is so smooth I broke out in tears I am so very happy please if your a women hiding yourself because of facial hair and your budget is small try this it truly works&lt;br /&gt;  Thankyou so very much</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $. This doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this - I was able to trap only a couple of hairs with Bellabe. It seems that this spring is too weak to pull out hair.  I had much better results with Epicare.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have struggled with unwanted facial hair, and it is a relief to have a found an at home remedy that works!!</li>
            <li> Yes this product works! BUT YOU CAN BUY IT FOR $1 !!! This price is a rip off!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Just wish it could do more for coarse hair!</li>
            <li> Works great for most facial hair.  Does not quite hold strong enough for the thicker chin hairs.</li>
            <li> I Have Mixed emotions about this product. I have tried using it on a number of occasions. However, for me it only grabs the fine hairs and not the more course hairs. It&#x27;s a okay product if you are removing fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is only good for the fine hairs above your lip. Do not fool yourself if you have dark or coarse hair that this will work. This product is also very painful to use.</li>
            <li> I love my Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  I bought it in pink, and have been extremely pleased with it.  The first time I used it on my upper lip, it really hurt.  I never had waxing done before or threading, so I was unprepared for the \\&quot;ouch factor\\&quot; of removing facial hair from that area.  I have tweezed plenty of times, but this hurt more then tweezing.  However, after doing it 2-3 times after that first experience, it really didn&#x27;t bother me any longer.  It removes the hair very well, I can actually see the little root ball attached to the hair.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage, and if there is any, I would just go over it again with the Bellabe. There are times where I have gotten pimples in the area where I removed the hair, I don&#x27;t know if that is because I have oily skin in general, or I didn&#x27;t cleanse the area enough before hand.  I am Italian, and contrary to old wives tales, I haven&#x27;t noticed any increase in facial hair, thickening, or whatever.  Actually, I have small little patches where the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back, so I guess that&#x27;s a good thing in the long run. Overall, it is a great product, and I would purchase another one, if something happened to my current Bellabe.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use and stings less than threading! I love love love it! No peach fuzz!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main areas of usage: Face and neck. Haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather go to the salon any day than use this torture device! I could tweeze each hair individually and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad as this thing does.</li>
            <li> I had never used a device like this before, but now I&#x27;m addicted! It is very easy to use. While it is kind of painful, it&#x27;s not like the pain lasts and it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing. The redness on my face went away overnight, so I would recommend using it before bed.</li>
            <li> so much better than tweezing... once you learn how to use it it really gets rid of a lot of hair... hurts a little at first especially sensitive areas but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I&#x27;ve lived this long without this little beauty secret! it&#x27;s super easy to use. yes it stings a little at first, but you get used to it. soo worth it.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s easy. Hurts alittle though</li>
            <li> I was eager to do this once it arrived, but I took time to read the directions and follow them.  I have sensitive skin and I took the directions precautions so I would limit any breakouts. I still broke out in one little area. I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> I have really thick facial hair and it works miracles!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product... but it actually works. It was only as painful as you&#x27;d expect, removed all the unwanted hair even the short ones that I plucked... and didn&#x27;t leave my skin irritated or painful. I&#x27;d definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> i used it, and it does clean the hair on my upper lip. but it is hard to clean thoroughly. and also it could not make sure will those hair come out again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, tightly wound coil with hard plastic ends for holding that will catch every single microscopic hair including the peach fuzz. Not painless but works exactly as it should. If you aren&#x27;t used to the sensation of removing facial hair, this little wonder will be an unpleasant experience. If you use it weekly tho, it&#x27;s awesome. Little harder to get under the chin but can be managed with practice.</li>
            <li> It works as im a man and i get a lot of light hair on my cheek. I didn&#x27;t want to shave it cus, lets face it, it will grow back thick and soon I would have to shave up to my eye balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It take time to get use to the pain. worse than tweeters, as it grabs a few, or a lot, of them suckers at one time....LOL HAVE FUN... I STILL RECOMMEND IT.</li>
            <li> Bellabe is the best! I tried  cheaper versions and was so disappointed in them. I will spend a little more and only buy Bellabe from now on.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool to remove facial hair!  It was easy to use and very fast and even better it works! I will no longer need to use those harsh chemicals and have to deal with the resulting skin irritations. Thank you Bellabe!</li>
            <li> After using it several times, it is still quite painful but does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions. DOES NOT WORK. Most tedious and annoying way to remove hair. Also you can get a knockoff for $5 on ebay.</li>
            <li> It does work, it just doesn&#x27;t grab all the hairs at once so you have to go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the sting you&#x27;ll realize that this product works very well.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t take the pain from waxing I suggest you don&#x27;t try this... I like to think I have  a good tolerance for pain and this pushed my limit but after getting the hang of it.... I did get used to it. It also does work like threading.... it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and much easier.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that it will have somewhat of a &amp;#34;tingling feeling.&amp;#34; This is wrong. It hurts just like tweezing, but gets multiple hairs at once. I still like it though, but it takes a while to actually get all of the hair, and is definitely less efficient then waxing.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all well.  Tweezers is a better bet or an eppy.  Wish it did work but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product does as stated but it hurts like hell.  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but I quickly realized that it is not something that I plan on buying again.  I&#x27;m sure that you can become used to it over time, but I kinda don&#x27;t care for unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> I have used my Bellabe for more than a year and I am very happy with it. I use it every 3 - 4 days to get rid of the hair on my upper lip and on my chin. It&#x27;s been more than a year and it still works very well. I have tried the other similar spring hair removers and Bellabe is the one that grabs the most hair and actually pulls them out from the roots. It does not break off the hairs like the others do. My skin does not break out and in fact, feels very smooth and silky after each Bellabe use. I am so thrilled that I found Bellabe and would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> It just hurts… more than I&#x27;d like.  I will try it a few more times to see if I can tolerate it, but my face is just sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product I have ever used.  It is very uncomfortable when you use it the first time, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze and extremely effective.  I will never be without one again.  It works better than anything I have ever used which includes depilatories, friction, trimming, etc.  None of those left my skin as smooth for as long.  Do a little bit at a time the first time, just keep going back to it.  It took me about 15 to 20 minutes, off and on, the first time to remove everything because I am such a baby when it comes to discomfort.  Now, I use it two minutes a day and it is far less uncomfortable.  Awesome, awesome product.</li>
            <li> This little thing WORKS for fine hair and peach fuzz that is too much to tweeze!</li>
            <li> This tool really does the job. I just used it today for the first time, and after a quick use I can feel how smooth my skin is. Yes, it is a bit painful. Especially if you aren&#x27;t used to pulling the hairs from the roots. I have sensitive skin, and the irritation from pulling multiple hairs at once did cause a lot of redness. I am incredibly happy I went with this rather than a cream, will definitely be recommending this product!</li>
            <li> This actually works rather well.  Be prepared to have some irritation for a bit (you can put on a beauty balm to cover for the day).  Otherwise this is a neat little tool.. twist and rip.  not really painful.. more of an annoying sting that you will come to enjoy as you revel in the baby smoothness that it uncovers...</li>
            <li> It hurts but works perfect.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product! Honestly, i was a bit skeptical, because i thought that it was going to be so painful, but once i started i got used to the little sting! I recommend this to everyone wanting to rid of facial hair! Wayyy better than any of those expensive machines! 100% honest!</li>
            <li> Broke after 1 minute. No hairs removed :(</li>
            <li> Its painful and you have to attempt quite a few times before you get the hang of it. They are at times stubborn areas which need to retouch.</li>
            <li> It works....but it hurts, a LOT.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well arould lips and chin, not ouchless tho, just like plucking only faster. I wouldn&#x27;t advise it for sideburns or more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and very effective. It does sting a little bit but not badly. My face did get a little red but it quickly faded. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Turned out to be useless. Cannot grab short/fine upper lip hairs. Definitely grabs arm hair but not why I purchased it. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my upper lip, lower lip and chin for years. After awhile the waxing doesn&#x27;t hurt but it sure is inconvenient. I&#x27;d deal with the sticky mess on my hands and face and then wait another week to do it all over again.&lt;br /&gt;No pussyfooting around, the Bellabe stung so badly the first couple of times that I used it I had tears streaming down my face. I kept up with it though and am so happy with the results. I use it at least twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;The product no longer causes me pain. It&#x27;s so convenient that I can use it as I watch TV or surf FB. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a number of friends.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars out of five is that it doesn&#x27;t eliminate the hair. The hair does seem to grow back finer but the product really does have to be used a minimum of once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also recommend that you don&#x27;t use it near your eyebrows. There&#x27;s simply no way to get the precision you want in that area with Bellabe.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still tweezing my eyebrows and waxing the outer edges once a month. That&#x27;s OK with me since I no longer have a mustache!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this little gadget worked as well as it did. At my age i have a lot of facial &amp;#34;fuzz&amp;#34; and for that the Bellable does a very good job.  Leaves my skin very smooth and is so much faster than tweezing. I watched the &amp;#34;demo&amp;#34; on Youtube so I had a good idea about how to use the Bellable.  It was time consuming the first time, but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  Now I use it every other day to &amp;#34;keep up&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve gotten faster at it too.  The only place I have trouble is under my jaw - it&#x27;s a hard place to get to.  And, also, it&#x27;s not good at removing those stubborn dark chin hairs.  You&#x27;ll probably still need tweezers for that.  All in all I am very happy with this very inexpensive little &amp;#34;beauty tool&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Still hurts, but such is the price of beauty?</li>
            <li> Not the best hair remover. Going back to my electric full body epilator. It&#x27;s a little large for my upper lip area, but much more effective than this little gadget.</li>
            <li> threw these out- painful and hard for me to use- I wish others better success!&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde facial hair that is super fine- perhaps if you have thicker hair it would work better?</li>
            <li> This thing works.. it rips your hair out, just like it should... But it hurts so bad. I will stick to waxing and nair.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this simple little tool works! I bought it because for the low price I thought it was worth a shot instead of waxing - which I find very hard on my skin. On first try it worked so WELL! I have hit the age where I unfortunately have way too many little hairs popping up, and this tool catches them all and pops them right out. Way more than I even realized were there, really. :) Just a tiny sting, not bad at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitate to buy this but took a chance and so glad I did.  One of the best beauty product I&#x27;ve bought in years.  It really does the job - fast, easy and much less painful than waxing at a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;ve just order 2 more for friends.  A great investment in a smooth face.</li>
            <li> It hurts and comes back ina week&lt;br /&gt;so would rather use a shaver which does a better job and is quick</li>
            <li> Absolutely doesn&#x27;t work. This thing didn&#x27;t catch ONE hair, and I am pretty sure I was using it correctly. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it I had no problems. Works great for me and so will it work for you.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.  I going back to wax.</li>
            <li> worked fast takes a min to get the hang of it then its easy as pie. feel like tweezing. i only used it on my baby hairs on my upper lip. worked great cleaning was easy and so it storage</li>
            <li> This actually work just don&#x27;t like the pain when I do it on my upper lip but, beauty is pain. You can actually see the hairs being pulled and leaving the skin smooth and there was no irritation on my skin and no breakouts which I really liked. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I recieved this at a free/discounted price for an honest revie, and i must say, i love it, of course its a little painful but works great :-)</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! The reviews said so but I was eager to see how it did for me, and it performed wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Works excellent, easy to use, didn&#x27;t hurt at all!!! Easy instructions to follow or watch you tube-it&#x27;s on there. That&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> Wonderful product thanks &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This works great except on coarse black hairs - did not remove but otherwise love it!</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times, boy does it hurt, threw it in the drawer.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t do anything when I attempted to use it. I was disappointed with it and wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this did remove some hair and I don&#x27;t think it was painful.  I don&#x27;t think it is very effective on &amp;#34;scattered&amp;#34; stray hairs and I wish it was because tweezing is not a good answer.  If you are looking to remove larger sections of hair, I believe this works, but it did work  in difficult areas like right under my chin to get to the short, stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it is very easy to use and it removes hair quick and easy!  Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  If I had to travel with just one beauty item this would be it.  I have already told all my sisters about this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to dat I got chance to purchase my bellabe. I got one in pink. I started using as soon as I got home. It hurt a lot dat brought tears to my eyes. Lol no kidding.  I&#x27;m having trouble on how to use on my chin area since dat it one main concern cuz I have darker hair. Please I have read some of da reviews but I haven&#x27;t no luck anyone having da same issue. Please anyone out there who has da same issue as me post on how u resolve it?</li>
            <li> A bunch of girls at work had one so I had to grt one too. Cheek/chin just a little pain occasionally. Upper lip brings tears to my eyes but prefer over waxing.</li>
            <li> Does it work pretty well? Yes, indeed. Does it hurt so you&#x27;ll never actually use it? Yes to that too.</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to REM. I bought this product instead of REM spring that I usually buy but I am disappointed as it breaks the hair and does not have a firm and sharp hold.</li>
            <li> This product hurts and it did not work, probably due to the pain and I gave up. I,guess ill continue to go to the salon....  Drat !</li>
            <li> Received this today and it is wonerful!Easy to use and gets the job done!will reorder and keep a spare close by.8/11/2015...this time when I received my order I was very disappointed. what once worked wonderfully now it&#x27;s hard to get it to work at all I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product as of late</li>
            <li> Ouch!!  Yes, it does hurt until you actually get used to it.  It&#x27;s great for the chin and cheek areas but no matter how hard I try I still can&#x27;t use it near the lips.  It does the job and keeps hair away allot longer than a trimmer or even shaving.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product. All it does is catch the hair in the twist and rip it out</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful low-tech product.  I&#x27;ve been using an epislim for years, but it leaves tiny hairs behind which I do not like.  This little gizmo made short work of getting rid of those little fuzzies.  It is wonderful!  Definitely 4 stars and I will absolutely buy it again.  I&#x27;m thinking of gifting it to my menopausal buddies!</li>
            <li> didnt do all i expect</li>
            <li> This was the 2nd time I have purchased a Bellabe. I buy 2 at a time.  I have had my face waxed and threaded to remove facial hair and I always break out, due to my sensitive skin.  The Bellabe is an wonderful device and pulls the hair out by the roots. I  have never broken out from using one.  I use it above and below my lips and my chin area.&lt;br /&gt;I will say it is not the most pleasant sensation while using it, but I would rather hurt a little while using it, than go around with a hairy face, or a broken out face from waxing and threading!!  The Bellabe is great, and I for one ,would be er want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This product works just as good as I hoped it would. What I wanted was a product that took most of the hair out, leaving only a little bit behind that had to be removed with tweezers.  This product does just that. I use it only on my upper lip, and yes it&#x27;s painful (it&#x27;s ripping hair out), but it works very well. I roll it over each side and the middle probably five times each and it gets out most of the hair.  Way quicker and easier than having to tweeze every individual hair.  I took off a star because it doesnt remove all the hair (not that i expected it to). I have been using it for about a month and a half. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: I&#x27;m weird and like that you can see the result of each use by the amount of hairs caught in the springs. Helps you know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I tried this facial hair remover. It works! This will be very useful and I plan to use it&lt;br /&gt;on regular basis. Sure beats going to a salon. The first time I used it, it hurt a bit&lt;br /&gt;because it did it&#x27;s job but since I plan to use it more regularly now, it won&#x27;t be pulling out&lt;br /&gt;as much hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does a better job than waxing.  It gets the fine, thin hairs on my face that waxing would not remove.  Yes, it is a little painful, similar to waxing, but so worth it!  It took me about 3 sessions to get all the hair off my face, and there was much more than I thought.  I would work on an area, take a break, and then work on another area.  I use it about once a week just to check and remove any hairs that are growing back in, and that takes less than a minute!  What a difference and so much cheaper and effective than waxing.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I love this product! I am a Black, White,Spanish, and Chinese mixed female and I am hairy. This works for all types of hair even us black girls :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have a mustache and I have chin fuzz that I completely got rid of with this Bellabe facial hair remover. I&#x27;m not going to lie.. it was a bit painful on my upper lip so I had to used ice (in a baggy) to numb it.  Other than that I&#x27;ve thrown away my face bleach and wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;This is discrete, no more warming up wax in the microwave or walking around the house with bleach cream on my lip and chin. I may even opt out of laser hair removal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN THE MAKEUP BAG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU BELLABE USA!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you will go to your mother/sister/friend and say: OMG you have to try this thing!&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve, but once you get the twist just right and you determine which way to push it according to the direction the hairs grow (different directions on different parts of the face), you&#x27;ll want to mow your entire face with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought this because as I get older, I&#x27;ve been getting some dark hairs above my upper lip (gross) and wax makes me red for days (so it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;ve been attempting to remove lip hair) and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to shave it off, so I thought this would be a viable alternative. Yeah- WHOA!&lt;br /&gt;First I removed the lip hair (which wasn&#x27;t comfortable, but I hiked up my big-girl pants and just DID IT. you know, like you rip off a band-aid quick just to have it over with). It wasn&#x27;t any more or less painful than ripping all the hairs out with wax. It actually felt comparable to waxing, with no redness or irritation after. Then I started going over the super fine blonde hairs on my jawline, which I&#x27;m pretty sure just about everyone has, and those never really bothered me before, but when I started to use the Bellabe there I couldn&#x27;t believe how friggin&#x27; hairy I&#x27;ve been all these years and I didn&#x27;t even know it! The Bellabe gets it ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I do it about 5 minutes every 2 days or so.  Removing all that hair really helps my makeup go on so smoothly. And I swear it&#x27;s helped get rid of a months-long battle with some weird acne around my mouth... I think perhaps removing those tiny hairs gives acne causing bacteria less to cling to, and less of a direct path right into my pores. All I know is that I had some really horrible eruptions for about six months until I started removing all the hair in those areas. Could be coincidence, but whatever the case, this weird little thing has me hooked for good.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome tool! Never mind going for electrolysis. This little Bellabe removes ALL facial hair without a problem! Takes a minute!</li>
            <li> Took this out of the package and used it today! Wow! Those first few pulls made me weep! Very painful. But didn&#x27;t take long to get used to it. I did my whole face and I must say, this got a lot of hair, by the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a facial hair remover and was about to give up and buy No-No. I can&#x27;t believe that it could be any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is easily irritated and this process left me with only a tingling feeling, as if I just exercised my skin!&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you buy one of these every 6-9 months. Well, this purchase is now part of my permanent budget.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed. Does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it is very effecient. I use it for the little white facial muctache that I can see that i have once every 3 month, but nobody else notice but it drives me nuts. Comes with getting older unfortunately. It works very well for that. Have not tried it for darker thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This just pulls your hair. I can just tell you I didn&#x27;t like it from the beginning. It may be a different experience for someone who is more familiar using this method for hair removal.</li>
            <li> This little tool is awesome! I have tried all the tricks of the hair removal trade and must say this is by far the best facial hair remover ever. My Husband says that I don&#x27;t need it and that we have facial hair for a reason(such a down to earth man) but being the &amp;#34;silly&amp;#34; woman I am I have been looking for something to remove my facial hair since I could remember it being there. I&#x27;ve tried Creams which burn the hell out of my sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve tried waxing which bruised and left my face with thick scale like spots, I&#x27;ve tried shaving which was a bad idea. But this hair remover is awesome, It was pretty painful the first time I used it, It made my eyes well up with tears but I&#x27;ve been using it about 2-3 times a week and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad. The instruction guide recommends washing your face before and after you use the tool because it causes acne due to the pore of the hair follicle being exposed. I noticed a small break out (which is rare for me) where I did use the tool but I alternated between putting cold pressed oils on my face like grapeseed and sweet almond. When using this tool I wash with warm water before and after, then use a light non pore clogging oil such as the ones mentioned. I highly recommend this product to other women who have sensitive, delicate skin, and are looking for a simple and effective hair removal device such as this one.</li>
            <li> This bellabe Facial Hair Remover works great.  Takes the hair off our face to make it very smooth.  I have had one before and glad I found them again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am 52 and I going through menopause and have a ton of peach fuzz all over my face and chin.  I had been plucking for years but too much peach fuzz to deal with so I decided to give this product a try.  It worked great!  It does take a bit of getting use to but once I figured it out it did a great job.  I still pluck those few dark stubborn hairs.  I would definitely recommend waxing or plucking before using this product especially if you have dark hair.  That way the hair will grow out softer and easier to use this tool.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it pulls the hair out and is painful. I tried to use it but too painful. I would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> OUCH! This product works OK. It is hard to get the hang of it. What is so awful is the pain of individual hairs being pulled out over and over again. I prefer waxing. If you had a bad reaction to waxing I could see using this. I simply cannot take using this as my primary hair removal product.</li>
            <li> This tool is much more effective than tweezing or waxing those pesky, ugly hairs that grow on my chin and upper lip.  It does hurt more so the first time because more hair is being removed at once, but, it is very time saving.  Rather than spending all that time plucking hairs one by one (and always missing a lot), this device will find and pull out all those ugly hairs once and for all! It is portable, cost effective and saves me a lot of time.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I moved to a place where threading was more expensive and they kind of sucked (I had been getting my upper lip threaded for years).. Due to this, I started waxing. For some reason, my chin hair started to grow back darker and thicker, where as before it used to be finer. Although the upper lip hair didn&#x27;t grow back darker, I have very sensitive skin there, and it would get irritated. Nair also irritated it. Sometimes I would just shave in between the waxing because I was so tired of it. Anyway, I just discovered this, and couldn&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t known about it. It&#x27;s amazing. I received it yesterday, and so far I absolutely love it. I already told a bunch of people about it. For some reason, it hurts me even less than threading. I know this is not the case for everyone, as I read some reviews saying it really hurt. I do feel like I have a pretty high pain tolerance though, so this wasn&#x27;t an issue for me at all. I no longer have to be embarrassed about  facial hair, and don&#x27;t have to worry about irritation. I wish I had found out about this years ago. Even before I moved, sometimes it would be a hassle to get to the salon, and doing it at home would have been so much easier. Definitely going to keep this in my purse for when I go on trips for touch ups.</li>
            <li> i have trued and tried to use as directed...but to n avail</li>
            <li> My wife has been using it for a couple of months. It works fine, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> So, this product is great for all that fuzzy baby hair and your make-up applies so much better when it&#x27;s gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH MY GOD IT HURTS!!!!!  Seriously, I&#x27;ve waxed everything on my body and this is far more painful.  As is so often the case, the first time is the worst, I would suggest doing small sections and starting low and moving up gradually.  The upper lip area is horrific, start at the outer corner and work your way in and up.  And know it will still be awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it really works, and it isn&#x27;t bad after the first go so long as you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> Yikes!  This hurt like heck!  Tried it twice and then gave up.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I felt I needed to for this.  I have been cursed with facial hair my whole life, and worse after my hysterectomy a few years ago (extending from just the lip to all over...ugh).  I am in my early 30&#x27;s and hated what waxing was doing to my skin...not to mention embarrassed.  I just got the Bellabe in the mail today and was so excited I ran to use it right away.  OMG, it totally works!!!  I read the directions and had no problem getting it to work.  It does sting...but since I am used to waxing no biggie.  It got all those little hairs right off!  I am so impressed!!  And I can go right out, I&#x27;m not red at all!  Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Too good to be true. This device is both tricky to operate and ineffective. Hair&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Miracle thing everyone should have one</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Tried to use it but it is rather tricky....not sure if it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Loved this right away. Did under my brows which have permanent makeup, but I like that it removed the fine peach fuzz hair that shows up in my pearly eyeshadow. Also worked for the fuzz on my upper lip. Pinched a little on there, but I never tweeze my upper lip so it was more sensitive. Quick, easy and it effortlessly removes it all. No single hair tweeting that takes so long even if you can find them!  Very much like having threading done by a pro! Smooth afterwards! No worries, this ones a keeper.</li>
            <li> Bells be Facial Hair Remover really works, inwantbyou know that. Please do not fool around with tweezers and ruin your skin with pin point pricks. First of all, cleanse your fair, whenever you pull the facial hair out by its roots, you are prone to infection if your skin has makeup or any impurities on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this may hurt a little if you have not had any hair removal. As ladies grow older, and I assume men, also, pesky facial hair appears in unwanted places. Under your nose and over your lips, on the side of your face u set your ear line, chin area, and around your lips. Read the instructions thoroughly. Remove the Bellabe from it&#x27;s circular case. These directions are from the website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold the handles using thumbs, index and middle fingers. Bend the spring downwards, place against face where hair is to be removed. Turn the handles inward and outward between your fingers so in a continuous motion. You will feel the hair being removed, the directions say a tingle, I say more than a tingle. But this is not painful. Imagine when you pluck your eyebrows, the same sort of feeling. I use the Bellabe over and over in the same area, if I have not used the Bellabe in this area before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, watching a YouTube on how to use the Bellabe is the most helpful. Google Bellabe, and how to use. Your skin may be sensitive at first. Depending on how much hair you need to remove, depends on how frequently you will need to use it. Keep the Bellabe in it&#x27;s case when not in use. It should last from 6-9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the Bellabe very helpful, do not use on an infected area such as a pimple. Use on clean, dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-27-15</li>
            <li> Throw out that hot wax. This is the only facial hair remover you will ever need.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been doing some research into some handheld hair removers. Body hair just gets annoying but with all of the fancy hair removers being roughly between $300-$450, I just couldn&#x27;t afford any of them at this time. Leg hair and arm hair get irritating, but I can deal with that; shaving is an easy fix. But facial hair. That is an immediate blow to a woman&#x27;s personal appearance insecurities. I have NEVER shaved my face (isn&#x27;t that bad, yet) and I refuse to use waxing creams because those burn and damage skin over time, and being as fair and sensitive as I was I knew my skin would definitely show the chemical burns. This leaves me with essentially no other option but tweezing and plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this little guy when browsing through hair removal products on Amazon. It was cheap and I figured it was worth the risk of only $16 if I ended up hating its very existence. So I bought it! I received it yesterday in the mail and was immediately compelled to use it. I love this thing. I&#x27;ve never been so hairless! I can finally feel my smooth skin without all of that irritating peach fuzz I get. This product will easily work for people like me (light peach fuzz) to people who are on the darker end of the spectrum. So if you&#x27;re like me, poor and in need of a quick hair removal fix, get this. I&#x27;ve already told friends and family because it&#x27;s inspired me that much. Anyone reading this may be thinking, &amp;#34;Whoa, calm down there, Haus. It&#x27;s just a facial hair remover.&amp;#34; But chances are, you all understand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make a quick comment on the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; factor though. I&#x27;m sure people want to know about it&#x27;s handling and performance. Basically, it&#x27;s a tightly coiled spring with handles on the end. You turn the spring into a U shape (as seen) and twist the handles between your thumb and finger tips. This twirls the spring, and as it grazes your skin it will snag those little suckers and pluck them right from their hair follicle source. At first, it made my eyes water and my skin slightly pink, but there was little evidence of damage. Once my skin got used to the sensation, it toughened up and now it&#x27;s a breeze. So this was achieved after one night of usage. I&#x27;d like to point out that tweezing is probably one of the best solutions when it comes to facial hair because it gets the hairs at the root, meaning this wear and tear on the follicle will begin to damage it, and thus, result in less growth. So over time this little dude will quickly pay for itself in the long run. Take my word, it is completely worth the quick tugs and tingles.my eyes water and my skin slightly pink, but there was little evidence of damage.

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised - doesn&#x27;t get them all but if used every day it  really makes a difference.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good for removal of peach fuzz not slightly coarse hair. Convenient to use. Did not pain or cause rash afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product.  Looked weird but the reviews said it was great.  It arrived and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try.  OMG OMG OMG it hurt like CRAZY.  My eyes teared up.  BUT I had to keep trying.  I managed to get most the hair off my chin - takes all the little light ones and most of the thicker ones too.  Not all, but most.  Still need to tweeze.  Then I took a few days off. I am working the courage to finish my upper lip - that hurts the most.  I did half of it yesterday.  I would give the nifty tool 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so painful or if it came with numbing solution (not a bad idea).</li>
            <li> It really does work. On upper lip and chin! Worth the money! Yes it does hurt but any hair remover that you can expect to work is going to :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Takes getting used to but I like it very much.  Very simple to use.  Have always wanted to try one.</li>
            <li> Love this little thing as a filler in between waxing. Works great!</li>
            <li> Works great if u can tolerate a little pain. Takes the hair out by the root with no coarse regrowth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would remove dark hair on mu upper lip.  The TV product was way too expensive.  I searched Amazon and found the Bellabe Facial hair remover for less than 20% the cost of the TV product.  IT WORKS!!!  It is much like plucking eyebrows.  I think it&#x27;s terrific.  .</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of facial hair removers.  This is not one of my favorites.  I do have to admit it was pretty cool to see my little hairs in the springs of this tool, but It took a lot of twisting and turning to figure out how use this tool correctly.  And then I was only able to use it effectively 50% of the time.  It also does not do well on the curves of your face and you have to hold it just right to ensure proper hair removal.  It is painful, but most hair removal tools are.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Hurts like the devil at first but my skin got used to it and it is great for removing those fine hairs!! So glad I gave it a try!!</li>
            <li> Interesting product, its like a spring, gave it 3 stars because its good but just not for me. This is something that I cannot utilize on a frequent basis, its better for every once in awhile. Prefer to stick to the tweezing/plucking of a hair at a time that is noticeable than removing hair that is not as noticeable. This tool works, it will remove the hairs and it only stings for a few split seconds, part of reach I think is also because you don&#x27;t get much time to prepare yourself for the hair that is going to be removed. If you ever tweezed then you would know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Probably my worst or at least second to worst amazon purchase to date how could I fall for such a thing?  I must have been having a manic episode- purchasing all kinds of beauty products. I read lots of reviews that said &amp;#34;once you get it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34; you need to practice &amp;#34;. Trust- I tried it a million different ways. Keep your tweezers. It&#x27;s a metal spring. No more. If you are stubborn like me, and still want to try something so stupid, get one of the ones for like $1 or $2- there&#x27;s no way a spring is worth more. Ever.</li>
            <li> So simple a concept.  So easy to use.  It was a little uncomfortable at first but then I got used to it.  Did a good job.  Buying one for daughter now.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this product and viewing a demonstration on Youtube, I decided to try it.  I love it! So fast and easy with lasting results.  I use once a week.  While it does not do well on  course hair, it removes all of the finer hairs on my face for a smooth clean look.  The upper lip area was sensitive, but with some practice and taking only small amounts at a time, had painless results.  I would definitely recommend this product for anytime use as well as on the go needs too!</li>
            <li> Since reaching a certain age, I have been dealing with the presence of some facial hair on my chin, and lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks. It was through searching for information on another product that I found the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover. You simply bend the product and roll it over your face while rotating the ends between your fingers. The coiled device gently pulls the hair from your face. It is much easier that tweezing. I wish I had found this product years ago. I would recommend it to anyone who is seeking an efficient and affordable way to manage facial hair.</li>
            <li> ... either on men or on me. I&#x27;ve plucked, shaved, waxed, depilatoried, tried the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; look (no no no). This is the easiest and most effective I&#x27;ve found. Don&#x27;t throw away the tweezers because you&#x27;ll need to catch a stray now and then. Otherwise, this little gizmo is pretty impressive. It hurt a little the first few times, and it still does now and then, but since I have been looking so darned manly in the last few years, I&#x27;ve learned to muscle through the little pains. :)</li>
            <li> It works, but hurts. Also, very difficult to get some hairs on chin and its hard not to just break the hair off. I&#x27;ll continue using since the first time is the most painful so now its just upkeep.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife... This cute little device shaved 30 minutes of tweezer time from my life. I think this is more a comfort tool. She says honey fo you see this hair... I say no and she just says men.. I guess I  dont have the hair x-ray vision. But she says it works and I get brownie points.</li>
            <li> i am italian and 28 years old and suddenly getting neck and chin hairs dark thick ones too i used to wax myself but i always got red bumps and patches that made it look like i have a skin disease. Plucking takes forever and i can still see the hairs the next day... i was so skeptical on buying this based on the reviews it did not get the thick hair...i did my mustache and three days later its still smooth...i noticed with my neck if i just keep it on the hair i want to get it does grab it...this is amazing and does what it says i will always use this!!</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot! And sometimes, it plucks the skin out too :( It does do the job though, but its hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It does what it should but it hurts (as one would suspect when pulling hair out).  Works okay but no miracle.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I like this a lot.  It is so much quicker than tweezing the little hairs off my face (unwanted ones here and there as well as the peach fuzz), and it is not waxing, which I don&#x27;t like.  You just twist it and watch it remove many hairs in one swipe.  Of course it smarts a little doing the upper lip...ha ha!</li>
            <li> I bet the 100 or more dollar no-no they advertise on tv, is the electric version of this. My mom is in a home and plucking hair on her lip is just not effective. This thing hurts worse than plucking, but it is fast, a million times more effective, and inexpensive</li>
            <li> Impractical and not worth-it</li>
            <li> I feel that it is effective and seems to remove the hair longer than tweezers.  No great in comfort, but I can deal with that if it is easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this thing it was absolute torture. I&#x27;m not a wimpy girl by any stretch, but I was borderline in tears. I heeded the other reviews here that said it gets easier, and plowed...or rolled...on. After a week or two, it really does get easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any set regimen for using this, I just pick it up and roll it around when I&#x27;m watching TV or something. I don&#x27;t try to get every single hair at each sitting, but I probably use it every day. This seems to keep the hairs thinned and thus minimizes my pain and suffering from yanking out clumps at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an effective product and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. Knocking off one star because it made me cry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something quick and easy I could use at home.  I found this product and read the review and for the price I thought I would give it a try.  Yes the first time you use it, it can be somewhat painful but no more than if you have waxed or had treading done.  After a few times you get use to the sensation.  It was fast and easy and did what it promised with no messy clean up.  I do not normally have the time to write reviews but I thought that this is the first product that really gave me the results it promised and I wanted to share that I will be a life long customer. Thanks Bellabe!</li>
            <li> This is my 4th bellabe.  Its the best, so addicting, and keeps my peach fuzz at bay.  Its not pain free, but the more you use it, the less pain you feel (the longer hairs are more painful, and anything on the upper lip).  try it - its better than paying $$ for frequent threading!</li>
            <li> Mabey it&#x27;s the strenght ofthe hair on my face, but it seemed to just snap off the hair at the skins surface. The hair that came out by the root on the upper lip also resulted in alot of ingrown hair. At least it didn&#x27;t cost alot, but I will go back to tweezers.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I will admit to having a low pain threshold to start, but after reading so many reviews I decided to give it a try as I am now discovering unwanted hairs since I&#x27;ve hit 40.  I can handle the intense stinging sensation around my eyebrows once I got used to it and forced myself to hang in there, but it is WAY too painful to use anywhere else on my face.  3 or 4 attempts and I&amp;#34;m done...no luck here.  :(</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Must buy. It hurts a bit at first, but it&#x27;s a lot faster then tweezing! Honestly, it&#x27;s kind of fun, but that could be just me.</li>
            <li> This is such a cool thing to have. I do not have excess hair, but instead of using the wax strips, this is easier and can be used anytime.Needs a little training and getting used to but once you know, it is so easy to remove the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in response to my frustration at the cost and inconvenience of regular lip and chin waxing. I&#x27;ve tried waxing myself and after two attempts I vowed I would never try that again (messy and poor result). I figured, what could it hurt to try this? (no pun intended). It didn&#x27;t take me more than two attempts to master the technique - it is easy to do. It does hurt a little more than waxing but I find the pain is less every time I do it. I do have to use this product a once every week or week and a half vs. every three weeks at the salon, but the convenience of doing this when I want is priceless, plus the money I&#x27;m saving makes me feel a lot better. :-)</li>
            <li> This little gadget comes in handy to get the tiniest hairs off  face that you didn&#x27;t even realize were there, also sometimes I can&#x27;t seem to get certain hairs with tweezers and this pulls those out</li>
            <li> WOW! As I&#x27;ve grown older, my facial hair has become more of an issue. I got on Amazon, did my research, and decided my first purchase would be something &#x27;simple&#x27;. The &#x27;Bellabe Facial Hair Remover&#x27; may be &#x27;simple&#x27; but it is mighty! It works wonders! I have fine hair over parts of my face, and I have dark, coarse hair directly over my lips, and I have what you&#x27;d call &#x27;fuzz&#x27; over my cheeks. This hair remover works on all three types of hair! Of course, the pain level is different for each type of hair and for where you are removing the hair from your face. I&#x27;ve found over my lips is the most tender. Ouch! However, it is a quick &#x27;Ouch&#x27;! Which is gone in a millisecond! The results are well worth the very quick pain you feel, believe me! I love my smooth face, and no longer feel ashamed of my slight &#x27;mustache&#x27; or other shadows (Real or imagined!) along the sides of my face! TYVM Amazon, for having this product for sale! :)</li>
            <li> It works well, but I can&#x27;t really down rate a product because it made me break out. I have sensitive skin and waxing and tweezing make me break out. I santized it and cleansed my skin before and after. Even applied Tea Tree oil. But it removes hair great.</li>
            <li> VERY PAINFUL!!! Product does NOT at all work like it says. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Completely not worth it!</li>
            <li> I like this but prepare yourself because it hurts. It is easy to use and takes out a swath of hairs at the root - hairs you don&#x27;t even know you have until the sting - it brings tears to my eyes (which is where some may draw the line but not me!) I prefer professional treatments but don&#x27;t always want to pay so much.</li>
            <li> So I originally bought the REM and actually wrote a good review about it also, but I misplaced it and thought I&#x27;d try a different brand this time.  It works the same as the REM, but for whatever reason I think it works just a little bit better.  At least with me I think that it breaks less hairs, so I don&#x27;t have to repeat as frequently.  Removing hair this way it pretty painful, but it does get better over time and it really works.  Guess I&#x27;ll continue to endure the pain until I break down and get laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> It took me a sec to get used to the twisting action. This little tool was quick and efficient. No pain and really did pull from the root. Read the helpful instructions and care guidelines included in the package.</li>
            <li> The pain is horrible....like , really bad. I almost cried and wished i could numb the pain...BUT the results are beautiful, and id rather control the pain at home than pay for someone else to hurt me.</li>
            <li> This thing works as described but it hurts like HELL. I would like to use it again, but my general instincts won&#x27;t let me because it hurts! It left some little irritated bumps on my face...so I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Only the fine thin baby hairs removed, and with bearable pain while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;The dark, deeply rooted hairs resisted the Bellabe, tweezers required.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  This essentially rips the hair out of your skin.  If you can endure the pain then it accomplishes the purpose of hair removal.</li>
            <li> This is a great inexpensive, not too painful method of getting those hairs that your really can&#x27;t even see.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I was that hairy until I started doing the roll under my lip and along the sides of my face, (just don&#x27;t get it caught in any of the hair on your head). You can feel the pull and sometimes like a pinch as it grips and grabs the fine hair around your facial area.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I don&#x27;t love it for the purpose that it&#x27;s still a little bit painful. Plucking, tweezing, pulling, etc. hairs from your face is never fun and my hope for this was that it wouldn&#x27;t be painful. Is it less painful than tweezers? You bet. Maybe I&#x27;m a tad bit naive in thinking that it would be pain free but it does what it needs to and I&#x27;m grateful for that! Toodaloo unwanted hairs! Worth trying as long as you do realize that it&#x27;s not 100% pain free.</li>
            <li> Really liked it but very painful. Hope it would come with something that would sooth the pain. I would buy something else to remove hair.</li>
            <li> This hair remover device is somewhat painful when using it.  It does work but it takes much time to get all the hairs out.  There are a couple of stubborn hairs that don&#x27;t come out but i think it&#x27;s just the angle of the mouth that makes it hard to catch.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD AT ALL DOESN&#x27;T GET THE SHORT HAIRS THE TWEEZERS WORK BETTER i WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> Honestly, I tried to use it on my upper lip stray hairs (I have a few that are blond and not thick) but it was just too painful ... it grabs the hair and hurts like hell.  I am not a scaredy cat because I use an epilator on my legs all the time and I don&#x27;t even feel any pain when doing that, but this is a torture device.  I&#x27;m not sure if this item is returnable, but I cannot use it and cannot recommend it, either.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair to remove. I had two longish hairs that I wanted gone pronto! This worked but no better than tweezers, sadly. I did like that this was a nicer, newer way to remove unwanted hair and could see it useful if I had a bigger problem with hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was compensated for this review but the opinions are completely my own.</li>
            <li> Product works well. It will definitely take out your facial hair just be prepared for the pain. No pain no gain right?</li>
            <li> Amazing little tool, wish I had brought one sooner.....initially had a little bit of difficulty working on the right side of my face, but no probs with the left side, But soon figured it out. Becomes soooo addictive lol.&lt;br /&gt;Had tried a face hair trimmer for peach fuzz previously which was fine except I had to do it every single day &amp; it would work that well in my chin, &amp; I tried The Epilady facial thing, that was difficult to use &amp; spent most of my time burning my face......so this little tool is a godsend compared to anything else I used, works great on the chin, basically everywhere....you basically figure out how to use it around the top of the eyebrows, chin, neck etc. Would definitely recommend to anyone sitting on the fence like I did for so long. Does it hurt??? Yes it nips when removing hair over top lip....but what wouldn&#x27;t....but I use it after a hot shower, so it&#x27;s not as noticeable.....but it&#x27;s a feeling you get used to &amp; doesn&#x27;t bother you as much next time. For the coarse chin hairs, it removes 99%, for the tiny dark hairs, I just use the tweezers on those, but even so....it still make removal of those hairs so much easier than before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to use, and not working so well, don&#x27;t waste your money.  I should of trust the reviews, now I paid my price.</li>
            <li> This product works, but it also hurt. Ouch! I got used to it the more I used it. Where the hair was short it was sort of a tingly feeling. Where the hair was longer, like the upper lip, it was painful. I can&#x27;t really see that area, but I suspected I needed this product for it. I think the more I use this product, the less painful it will get because I won&#x27;t let the hair get so long. It certainly beat the cost of the No No.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful, but it does work.  The first time is the worse but not as bad after that.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical, but decided to give this a try. It works! The learning curve was perhaps 10 minutes, after which I was using the &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; with ease. You don&#x27;t have to use a mirror...after a few minutes, I was using it while watching the news. It&#x27;s far more effective than waxing, and without the mess, discomfort, or skin irritation.  I intend to order several more and keep one in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it! A very handy DIY and a reliable solution to facial hair removal! Go for it, girls!</li>
            <li> i like parrissa hot wax way better. this is like water torture, ripping one hair out at a time, not even getting them all. what was Ithinking???</li>
            <li> I believe it does a fine job on most facial hair on the chin,where I used it. Misses occasional hairs tho.</li>
            <li> What a neat little tool! I&#x27;m very impressed with the innovation of this product. Simple to use and effective. I have found the positive reviews to be consistent with what this product delivers. Glad I purchased this one!</li>
            <li> If you considering buying this thing please dont it barley even removes anything even after you go over the area several times i used it on my cheeks and it made me break out like crazy and now i have acne scars all my face. If you want to remove hair off your face stick with threading its way faster and removes alot more and you can do it yourself. DONT BUY THIS IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!!</li>
            <li> This product was pretty good on my suborn hairs. I notice that my hair took a little longer to grow back which was good,. Only problem for me...it&#x27;s a little painful and my upper lip is very sensitive. But if your use to a little pain, you&#x27;ll like the product.</li>
            <li> I used this just twice it is not effective in removing smaller hairs and takes way too much time to remove. I would recommend that you learn how to thread your own hair, its cheaper, plenty of online tutorials are available. Rubbish product.</li>
            <li> This cheap product basically rips the hair out of your face.  Save yourself the pain and get your lip waxed.</li>
            <li> item was delivered on time but i was not happy with the product..was hoping it would take away the hair on my upper lip and after 2 hours of using it i still had alot of visual hair..really not worth it</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! It removes hair very effectively. I had regular microdermabrasion, so I feel very little pain when using this hair remover. Your technique is very important. If you use the hair remover at the right angle, it will work the best! Takes some trial and error to figure out the best angles. But so glad to see these unwanted hair removed!</li>
            <li> *NOTE* I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION .&lt;br /&gt;I truly love this hair remover. I use it for my upper lip. It&#x27;s very easy to use! Yes, it is painful at first, but you quickly get used to the pain. I use this on my upper lip. When I would wax my upper lip, I would always get a pimple somewhere along my upper lip area.  With this product,  I have yet to experience any pimples after using it. I would recommend this product! !</li>
            <li> I really like this tool. To me, it works a great deal better than wax as you are able to remove all of the hair with just this spring. I always disliked that with wax you couldn&#x27;t wax twice, if it didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair the first time. So, you&#x27;d rip it off and then you&#x27;d have to individually pull hair, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I can use this to remove hair while I watch tv, ride in the car, etc. It&#x27;s so nice to not have to stand/sit in front of a mirror. Additionally, it does do a really great job of removing any unwanted facial hair (I don&#x27;t use it on eyebrows...don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re supposed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this so well, I am on my 2nd one. The spring eventually does stop grabbing hair as effectively, but you get enough usage out of it to more than cover the cost. It&#x27;s really a great value. In fact, my mother saw me using it one day, decided she needed one herself, so I bought one for her, too! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product no one or nothing should use this.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work.  I think I have gotten about five hairs in all- only 2 million to go.</li>
            <li> I love this little item! Since my chemo I have had real problems with facial hair due to the damage to my system. Hormone issues are the pits. I have tried tweezers (which is a real pain, as the hairs come in so white they are almost clear) and depilatory cream (burns my skin) so when I was offered this little device I was more than happy to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way cool!! Though I was somewhat hesitant at first to believe it would work, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. I got it today, and now my face is almost completely smooth. Well, except for my eyebrows - though the weirdness I inherited after my chemo means that the hair grows on my face... but my eyebrows are nearly nonexistent (sigh). Anyway! The only hairs it hasn&#x27;t take care of are the really short ones that haven&#x27;t grown long enough after tweezing to allow the springs to grab them. I have no doubt they will come out easily when they are long enough. Those are really coarse ones, but I am sure it will be no problem. I had a couple of really coarse ones that the Bellabe pulled with no trouble at all. I note in the reviews that some people are having trouble with coarse hairs, but I had none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall? If you want to feel really smooth (I smoothed on face cream after I was finished and I now can&#x27;t believe just how smooth my skin feels) I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover in return for a realistic review. Realistically, I am thrilled to have the perfect answer to an ongoing, and highly irritating, problem!</li>
            <li> I found this product not easy to use and not effective.</li>
            <li> ouch! hurts a lot, &amp;doesn&#x27;t really work, thought it&#x27;d be worth the pain but no.  You&#x27;d have to spend hours trying to get every single area, doesn&#x27;t work well, you&#x27;ll have to go over the area many times, doesn&#x27;t really grasp.</li>
            <li> My nieces and I tried this product I found it painless while they were more sensitive to it and had to force themselves to endure. I love this quick touch up hair removing product. Recommend if you can take it!! not for the weak</li>
            <li> I just received my Bellabe a few days ago. I washed my face thoroughly with cleanser and warm water. Then I used the Bellabe on my dry face. The pain was not that bad to me. It felt like some little pinpricks comparable to how threading would feel. On a scale of one to ten with 10 being the excruciating and 1 being barely noticeable. I would rate the pain I felt from the Bellabe as 4. It was completely bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Bellabe to remove my upper lip hair and sideburns. It worked well, however, I did find going over the areas three times and I kept finding more hairs to pull. I also didn&#x27;t have a shadow left on my upper lip as I did with shaving. That was the best part. One downside was that a two days later I broke out in fine little pimples on my cheek where I plucked out my sideburns. The bumps are barely noticeable unless you look really closely at my face. This is the same reaction my very sensitive skin has to tweezing and threading. So beware, if you have super sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Bellabe for facial hair removal if you skin is too sensitive for hair removal creams (mine skin burns) or shaving leaves that spikey feeling and shadow.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my facial hair. When using it to first remove the hair it can be painful. I won&#x27;t lie. I used it for about 10 minutes then stopped for 30 minutes. I did it this way to slowly, slowly proceed because it hurts. Once I had the hair removed I simply use it every other day to do maintenance and upkeep. The maintenance and upkeep is much, much, much simpler than the initial removal. I cleaned up my sideburns, hairline, cheeks and my skin looks far more smoother than when the hair was there. I look cleaner, neater and more smooth. Now I can see my smooth skin instead of those fine, baby hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of my makeup sitting on top of my fine, little, blonde baby hairs on my face. It was annoying. All I and anyone else could see was the hair and not my skin. I get a more matte finish with my makeup by removing the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed when I applied waterproof sunscreen I could not easily remove it. By removing my facial hair I can get the sunscreen off much more easily now. The sunscreen clings to the hairs. Removing the hairs means I can get that clingy waterproof sunscreen off more easily. Yay! Problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried another brand of this hair remover. I didn&#x27;t care for it. I like this one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to not remove your eyelashes or eyebrows. Use care. It does take sometime to get used to using it. You bend it in half and twirl the ends between your fingers as you move it up and down over the skin. It feels like a tugging. Once there is no more tugging you know the hair is gone. Every other day is helpful for maintenance.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have worked the first time I used it but not thereafter.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using an epilator.</li>
            <li> This is a little hard to use--sometimes it works, sometimes not so much.  It hurts and I think it often snaps hairs instead of pulling them out.</li>
            <li> Forever I&#x27;ll be grateful to the friend who told me about this product.  It is simply amazing!  I love the fact that it is easy to use, and easy to take with me on trips.  No more waxing! Why in the world I didn&#x27;t know about Bellabe earlier? Asked my husband to order two for me; I keep one in my office desk, and the other in my bathroom.  In turn, I&#x27;ve told several other friends about Bellabe - I know they would love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mona</li>
            <li> It does hurt when it pulls our your hairs but what do you expect, you&#x27;re pulling out your hairs. It hurt a lot at first for me but after a few seconds, I got pretty used to the pain, and now I don&#x27;t have a mustache anymore! I am a girl and I was very self conscious of my mustache area. When I was younger, a bad guy friend of mine once told me that I should shave or do something to my mustache because he could easily see it and that crushed my confidence so much. I didn&#x27;t want to shave it because I was afraid that it would grow back thicker and I don&#x27;t like waxing because I feel like it also removes a lot of skin cells. So I used to walk around with my visible mustache apparently, but now it is gone! This tool is a good way to remove your hairs without shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> It pulls the hair like the thread. lil painfull but doesnt cause redness of the skin like the wax . recommended</li>
            <li> This is a really cool facial hair remover! Does a GREAT job! I used to use wax but this works so much better, and there is NO waxy residue! Really, really love this! (Just wish I could use it on my eyebrows!)</li>
            <li> The product is very good nice product and it works great , purchased at great price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised by this product! I have tiny tiny blonde hairs on my face that you can see in certain lighting. I have tried waxing, tweezing, shaving it all sucks. Follow the instructions and it is very easy to use. I have picked up some of my own techniques as well. The bellabe is really good at getting those fine tine hairs you can&#x27;t see and plucks them right out, root and all. It can be addicting to use, I can easily spend 30 minutes in front of the mirror removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it does hurt a little, like ripping off tape. However after a few tweezing strokes in the same area, you really get used to the little sting and it becomes no big deal. I used the bellabe on my upper and lower lip and side burn area and the hair took about a solid month to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for someone who is willing to put a little time in. Waxing is faster but not worth the long term pre mature wrinkling effects on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the products.  takes a little bit of getting use to... but the outcome is wonderful and you save a ton of money on waxing...</li>
            <li> I need to learn to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Definitely a decent alternative to waxing and hair plucking!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this simple device really works.  Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The product works, deserves 4 stars. A few things, it is effective in getting small hairs and pulling them out. However, unlike threading which usually happens in the direction of hair growth or some angle of that direction, this tool asks you to pull in the opposite hair growth direction which can lead to ingrown hairs and break outs. The first time i used this tool ( Im a middle eastern mexican american chick in her late 20s) tbh the pain was wayyyy worse than threading, at least in threading, you have the tech holding the skin taught with the other hand. Ok, i can live with the pain. Ripping your hair out in the opposite way of growth will break you out. After the first go at my cheeks and chin area, i had red skin which then turned into large pimples. This tool is convenient, and if your hair is not thick black ethic hair and u have mild peach fuzz, this could work on you. But on me.....yikes. no me gusta</li>
            <li> My first tool of this type was the REM Spring which I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 years.  It came time to replace it so i decided to try this Bellabe, made in USA, hair remover. The Bellabe was slightly less in price but had a decent amount of good reviews, so I wanted to compare.  I wish ordered the spring again.  Bellabe is lighter in weight,  too light for my preference.  It does not grip hairs as well as the spring and I feel like it&#x27;s breaking the hair instead of pulling it out.  If I had bought this at a local store I would be exchanging this Bellabe for the REM Spring.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have little fine facial hair. I used it and it hurts. Im not used to threading so maybe thats why it was uncomfortable to me.</li>
            <li> Works best for mustache area. It does take several (8-12) times of use to get use to the prickly pain. No breakouts afterward. I still sneeze every time I get near the nose area. But due to overall facial hair, I will be trying an epilator.  Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> This product does work, however H.O.L.Y. the pain is excruciating!  I can only do a little bit every/every other day, because I can&#x27;t take the pain, especially the upper lip area.  Thankfully, I only have light peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts, but it works!  I use it once a week and it only takes a few minutes to get the hairs that have grown in that time frame.&lt;br /&gt;I had the peach fuzz...but no more!  I think this is 100x better then messing with creams or razors.  I will never be without one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also followed the tip someone gave of using the icecube to reduce pain. I only found using this unbearable around the lip area but the cube took care of that problem!!</li>
            <li> Is pretty decent! Not as painful as some claim,  but def not painless!!!!!!! Way better than wax.  Sensitive skin, no breakouts or irritation!  I will continue to use n buy when this one becomes old</li>
            <li> This is one of my best purchases!! Works great and easy to use!! I will definitely share this with my friends.</li>
            <li> This hurt like the dickens! It worked ...kind of...awkward to the face my hair kept getting caught in it...I&#x27;ll keep threading...</li>
            <li> It hurts but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Although it efficiently removes hair, its a torture to oneself. If you are okay with using an epilator, this product might work for you but unlike an epilator this is a slow hair removing device and so can cause more pain. I had bumps on my face after I used it. May be my pain threshold is low but waxing is the best option as it is fast and removes hair in one go.</li>
            <li> Okay so I knew it would hurt....that sucked haha but that wasn&#x27;t really a problem. This product broke me out like crazy! I did my left cheek and two days later my cheek had like 9/10 pimples all in that area. If it didn&#x27;t break my out I would have loved this product and kept using it but like many people I&#x27;m sure don&#x27;t like any product to make them breakout so I did not like it.</li>
            <li> It works.  It does hurt a bit, but pulling hairs out by the roots is going to hurt.  It does a much better job than the facial attachment of my electric epilator.  It&#x27;s very simple device, but sometimes simple is best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Bellabe for close to two months and most days I feel it leaves my face smooth and hair free,  but there are some places that just are stubborn.  I admit I haven&#x27;t watched any YouTubes and that might give me a handle on how to always get the best results.  I&#x27;ve also learned to wipe it with rubbing alcohol about once a week.  It not only cleans the spring, it works better when fresh.</li>
            <li> I do actually love this little spring of pain because it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do which is remove all that unsightly hair from my face without taking up a shaving routine.  Waxing always makes me break out like crazy because the wax or the products that go along with waxing always clog my pores.  This product foregoes all that trouble.  But I&#x27;m (perhaps unfairly) withholding 1 star because it hurts like a mother***.  I mean, let&#x27;s be fair, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt.  You&#x27;re ripping a mass of hair out of your face.  It&#x27;s like tweezing, on steroids.  But it&#x27;s painful, and because it hurts me, I want to hurt it, so I&#x27;m childishly keeping the star from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other downside is you can&#x27;t do your eyebrows with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, it speaks the truth when it tells you to clean your face thoroughly before and after you use it, because you WILL break out if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this everynow and then. It really pulls unwanted hair on upper lips and below. You will need to use tweezer though for the hard to pull hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to threading and I can do it in the comfort of my own home. It works perfect to remove the fine down hairs as well as the ones I can see. It is initially a bit painful and irritated my sensitive skin by leaving small bumps but after my third use it no longer bothers me. It doesn&#x27;t remove skin like waxing so I don&#x27;t need to worry about the sun after using it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have to use tweezers for some hair that it doesn&#x27;t remove in places that it doesn&#x27;t reach well but it&#x27;s minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of my friends use this product and I even bought one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Worked right out of package.  Have always got the upper lip &amp; eyebrows threaded.  Now I can cut my threading bill and time in half.  Thanks Bellable Facial Hair Remover for and awesome product.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> For the product function, it does work. It feels like you are plucking multiple hairs at once. It isn&#x27;t awful, but it wasn&#x27;t comfortable either.  I was taking my time to try to learn how to use the Bellabe but after about 25 minutes, I had to stop. I was able to clear most of my facial hair.  However, if you have any unwanted hair on your neck, I had a much harder time making the thing work. If you have finer hairs I feel like this would do a great job. But, as others have stated, thicker more stubborn hairs are reluctant to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that some skin just will not like this product. I prepped my skin, followed the instructions to the letter, and I still reacted to the process. My skin broke out the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I rated the product a 4 because it does what it states. I just would not recommend it to people who have sensitive skin and do not do well with the results of plucking.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it works SO WELL. I&#x27;ve had it for years and I can&#x27;t even imagine on how much I&#x27;ve saved on waxing plus the fact that this will not harm any layers of skin like hot wax can do. Eventually, the hairs start thinning out, too, so I use it much less often now than I used to.</li>
            <li> There is a definite learning curve on how to use this gadget. But it does work, but it takes practice and is not all that user friendly.  I kinda like it. Its very inexpensive and low tech...always good features.</li>
            <li> It works and takes off all unwanted hair, very good price.</li>
            <li> doesnt serve the purpose in any way..waste of money</li>
            <li> Loved this thing. Can&#x27;t use it for long cause my wrists hurt, but it works and gets the job done. Have had it for a year and clean it with a spray of rubbing alcohol. Still in as great a condition as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> Essential and easy to use!  What did we ever do without this product?</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  It&#x27;s impossible to direct, so the result is hit or miss.  Tweezers work better.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. It barely pulled out a few hairs and I used it correctly. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> I love this hair remover.  I use it once or twice a week.  Hurt a little when I first started using, but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  A quick way to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try out as a replacement for waxing at home with an electric warming pot and muslin strips. The coil is all you need to remove hair, and eliminates the mess and time that comes with waxing. I like that I can do this while watching TV, reading, etc, and there is virtually no clean up involved. The only drawbacks I found with it is that you can ONLY use the coil for lip/chin/cheek areas, and NOT on eyebrows, legs, etc, and that it does take a little bit longer than waxing to get to end result. I have pretty fine facial hair, and it took me multiple passes over an area to completely remove hair (about 20 minutes from start to finish). The benefit with this, however, is that you can go over an area as many times as you want without pulling or tearing skin, which is a risk with waxing the same area of skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin, and was worried that this would cause swelling or severe redness, but was excited when neither happened. The coil is painful to use at first (I thought slightly more so than waxing), but after a few uses, my skin got used the process and hurt much less. I have not had any ingrown hairs or breakouts from using this product, which was an added bonus. The directions to say to clean/disinfect the skin to be treated before and after, but I&#x27;ve forgotten to do this a few times and haven&#x27;t noticed any negative effects. For $15, this tool pays for itself if you get regular waxes or buy depilatory kits, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the cons that some other methods do (stinging, smell, cleanup, skin darkening, etc.)</li>
            <li> i just got it today and i was scared that it would hurt from all the reviews i&#x27;ve been reading but it didn&#x27;t hurt, it actually felt good! it felt good to have that abhored facial hair pulled up by this spring! it would take me forever with a tweezer if i tried to do this. i did my whole face  (lol) so far i haven&#x27;t seen any irritation or redness. i will wait until tomorrow evening and update you all. toodles!~  UPDATE: it&#x27;s been a week now and no irritation or redness. i will do it again in another week. i don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once every two weeks for myself personally.</li>
            <li> I have professional hair removal services for years including laser and electrolysis. My eyesight is getting poor but I can feel the hair on my chin and lip.  At first, Bellabe was not working because I was not doing it correctly.  Once I got the hang of it, it works really good.  If you are doing it correctly, you should feel pain just as if you were waxing that area.  It is tolerable but it does hurt.  It lasts much longer than shaving.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is painful and really takes a long time to remove hairs.  I think it is advertised poorly...Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with a slight uni-brow and hair growing on my upper cheek. This remover did the trick for me. It hurts a little at first, but it gets rid of hair VERY efficiently and from the roots. Even though it says not to use it on your eyebrows, I still did and it seemed to work quite well (I don&#x27;t recommend using it on the rest of your eyebrows however). Only negative may be that it can be a little tricky to master it at first but once you get it it should be good. Remember to TWIST the remover after bending it and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Maybe it is just me, but I can&#x27;t see any results from this.</li>
            <li> Very time consuming. It works on some area of the face like upper lips but may take your eyebrows if used close to it. Not practical.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT AND I&#x27;M GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE</li>
            <li> It is a little painful, similar to tweezing, but better in that it works much faster.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great delivery time. Arrived as promised. Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have ridiculous amounts of extra fuzzies for a female.  Mostly, I use this on my upper lip area.  It works great.  It removes about 90-95% of existing fuzz.  Anything that is remaining, I just use my tweezers on. I used to bleach before I got this, and I can say for sure that I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Definitely use multiple angles and make your skin as tight as possible.  I also wipe mine clean with a dry cloth as I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it does hurt a little bit, but it&#x27;s really no worse than waxing. And it might make your skin red for some time.  I like to use it when I know that I won&#x27;t be going anywhere for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> If you are deciding between the Bellabe and the REM spring, go with the REM.  I have had both and the REM is much more effective.</li>
            <li> Very painful! and it irritated my skin. However i am not used to threading my facial hair or anything like that so thats why it may have irritated my skin. I will stick to tweezing until i find something better.</li>
            <li> The face hair remover is so great for women, even my little sister loves to show her clean lovable face.</li>
            <li> Received the day it said it should. Just like described. A good tool. Painful as any other hair removal tool is. Gets those hairs and really works!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has 1 and she told me about it, I actually tried hers before I bought mine. It does a really great job and the effects last quite awhile, it&#x27;s definitely better than plucking with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon, seriously. It is super easy to use, and you can feel it working. You feel these little tugs on your skin as you pull out the hairs (which is a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it), and afterward it feels silky smooth. Sometimes I just use it while I&#x27;m sitting and watching tv. I use this on my upper lip and chin area, so I don&#x27;t have to wax them. Plus you don&#x27;t get those weird breakouts you get sometimes after a wax. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll. painful in the beginning but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> If you too are a weirdo with a beardo, you NEED this.  I know that most women have peach fuzz, but I looked like a wookie.  After watching a few instructional Youtube videos, I got the hang of it, no problem.  It hurt a little at first, but after a few beers, I don&#x27;t even feel it.  It&#x27;s infinitely easier and less painful than waxing, and works better too.  Waxing also gave me nasty acne, which isn&#x27;t a problem at all with my Bellabe.</li>
            <li> This remover hurts so bad; however, it does get rid of all of my facial hair.... So it&#x27;s a win!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews I was a bit hesitant to purchase this product because I was afraid of the pain involved. I must say that I am super pleased with this product! Not only is it really easy and simple to use, but it actually works! I first went on Youtube to see some videos on how to use it and tried it myself. It feels like a slight snap on the skin but not that bad and immediately I saw the hairs coming out. You have to work it against the hair growth so it was a bit uncomfortable getting the right side of my face since I&#x27;m right handed but I got the hang of it after a few tries. I primarily got this to take care of my sideburns since they seem to be getting a bit out of control. I was trying to decided between this and an epilator and after reading all of the reviews for both decided to go with this.  I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this super affordable device works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say like it because I haven&#x27;t seen what happens to my face tomorrow morning. BUT I did use it just now and holy cow, you don&#x27;t know how much facial peach fuzz you have until your rip it out. I knew I had some peach fuzz but once I started rolling, it was great! It stings a bit on the real sensitive places like my upper lip and just below where my sideburns are but overall it was quick and easy. That&#x27;s what I like, the pulling out by the root like a tweezers, but for larger areas with out any of the messiness of waxing or crazy hard contraptions.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic hair remover alternative! :) Tweezing takes forever, and waxing/creams break me out no matter what brand I use. Plus many hair removal methods are impractical since I want to remove hair from a wide surface area (the sides of my face). Using the bellabe takes about 15 min. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used ice to numb the area before using, and it really helped minimize the discomfort (feels like tweezing 10+ hairs at once). Doesn&#x27;t get all of the tiny hairs but gets 100% of the most noticeable longer ones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on heavy hairs just peach fuzz on sides of face.</li>
            <li> Now I can remove facial hair safely in the comfort of my own home without having to pay for threading again . I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li> It hurts, it works, it&#x27;s worth it. I used it on my chin like two weeks ago and only had to pluck a couple strays that showed up since. I did do some upper lip but that seriously hurt so much more than the chin. Just do it quick. I can imagine that it feels the same as waxing but isn&#x27;t that quick rip that waxing provides (haven&#x27;t waxed so not sure). I have PCOS and, while I&#x27;m not exactly The Bearded Lady, I want my face to look smooth and youthful and, well, hairless. It&#x27;s been bothering me for awhile. I feel like not having to duck my head and hide embarrassing hairs makes me a more confident person.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to it because i was breaking hairs a lot but man...you can go crazy with this thing. i just sit there rolling it all over my face and even my friends noticed how much cleaner it looked.</li>
            <li> this product is good and has been helping me a lot. You just have to do it right or will break the hair without pulling from the root.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product.. IT hurts like hell and hard to use it on face. Your fingers will hurt and face get scars.. And Amazon, please avoid selling such carpy products that will affect your reputation.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another seller for 1 dollar. Still useless.</li>
            <li> Works ok but is painful.  It&#x27;s like a hundred tweezers pulling all at once.  I guess you have to get use to it.  I used once but have not tried again because of the pain.</li>
            <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it, it pinched too much as it pulls the hair from her chin. I need to get a new wife, and keep the &amp;#34;Bellabe&amp;#34;. HA!HA!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an at home hair removal for the fine/baby hairs that seem to be increasing on my face. I didn&#x27;t want chemicals (I break out from waxing, so I can only imagine what chemicals would do.) This is perfect! Does it hurt? Yes. Is it unbearable? No. If you tweeze or wax you can handle this. I did notice I break out if I don&#x27;t clean my face after. I just wipe with a little astringent after and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> easy to use works well</li>
            <li> As I get older and lazier, I look for new methods of hair removal. I figure, if this can get rid of pre-menopausal woman &#x27;stache, then why not try it all over?  Those little coils sure do grab onto things, I mean hairs, and pull them out by their clingy little roots. I got a full 25c piece area cleared on my shin, and I only needed 2 band-aids to staunch the bleeding.  I figured, while that heals, I&#x27;d work on some deforestation of the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, Yeah, NO.  While the hair removal is effective, the ensuing female circumcision was almost as effective.  Luckily I only wound up with a few abrasions and a quick trip to the gyno for some salve will heal that right up, in 2 -3 weeks (so she said).  I&#x27;m supposed to avoid sitting, getting it wet, exercising, douching, tampons, perfumes, and have to keep it elevated.  Hopefully in 3 weeks I can do the other side and even things out but only if I have enough medicated salve to get through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely get this product but do not use it on your nether regions.  Stick to the &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li> It removed a few fine hairs, but it&#x27;s difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Spent $300 on Nono! But this works better. Cheaper and more efficient. no irritation. Recommend it to men and women.</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this little tool. Love it for its effectiveness, hate it for the pain. I watched a youtube video on how to use it and after seeing how well it worked, decided I would try it. Funny that the girl on youtube didn&#x27;t flinch one bit when using it. Well, like many of the reviews posted here, I have to say that it is uncomfortable, but it is effective. I have had electrolysis and waxing done on my face. Fortunately, I attended enough sessions of electrolysis that I don&#x27;t have much for hair around my mouth or lips. What I wanted to remove was from my jawline and on my cheeks--fine light hair. Waxing all of that area is very painful and leaves me red for a long time. I tried a shaver but found that it leaves bumps on my skin and the hair grows back quickly. This tool gets the job done, but it hurts. My best recommendation is to do a little bit at a time--don&#x27;t try and do a large area at one time. And surprisingly, it pulled very fine hair from my lip area that I wasn&#x27;t really able to see. It will pull out whatever is lurking! But remember - it is pulling the hair out, feels much like waxing. I&#x27;ve also found that the best way to use this is to wash your face before using it and after use, be sure to use an astringent. Sea Breeze is a good one since it contains alcohol. Not following up with some type of astringent sets you up for breakouts as bacteria will slip right into those pores that you ripped the hair follicles from. Following this routine has worked well for me. My skin looks good an no visible fuzz or hair. It&#x27;s a great tool, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> dont work as it advertised.....its the worse product ever. i hate it and it not working. will never recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! Doesn&#x27;t work, is just a joke. Don&#x27;t waste a penny on this! I think it is a  terrible product.</li>
            <li> So far it works as advertised. I&#x27;ve only had it 1 day, but it certainly is quite easy to get the hang of, and works much better for me than waxing or tweezing. There are definitely some spots that make my eyes water though.</li>
            <li> This was awesome.  I opened the package and used it right away and it did what it said it would do.  I have never used anything like this before and it only took seconds to get the hang of it.  Also it really didn&#x27;t hurt that bad, it was just like when you tweeze.  I love this and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> When I first opened up the package I saw a little spring with plastic and I was like \\&quot;What the heck is this? How is it supposed to work?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after following the instructions, you find when you bend the spring it opens little gaps, and as you roll the spring up your face, the gaps close on little hairs and pull them out as you continue to roll them upwards.  It&#x27;s ingenious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have small light hairs and they were removed well.  It pretty much removed everything except some very tiny stubs which are hard to see.  Compared to tweezing individual hairs, this is amaaazingly fast.  I recommend this over waxing because from personal experience, I found that waxing caused damage to my skin.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been the same since I waxed only a few times.  It is slightly cracked and less smooth from that brief usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time using Bellabe, I found it was most painful on my upper lip close to the lip line.  The skin is very sensitive here and pulling many hairs can sting.  I found that tightening my lip before using it helped.  Overall though, it wasn&#x27;t too painful, even on the first use.  I actually found it less painful than waxing because it is an even rolling motion instead of a nervous yank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find that holding it at certain angles pulls the hair better.  I&#x27;ve found that rolling against the grain of the hairs helps, tilting the device to match the angle of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A suggestion for those prone to acne:  Since this product is being rubbed over your skin, it&#x27;s likely to pick up oils and bacteria.  I would suggest wiping it down with an alcohol swab between uses to minimize the chance of getting acne.  Don&#x27;t wash it though because the instructions warn against getting it wet.  I assume it could be prone to rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with this product.  I would have never guessed a spring could remove hair so well, and I am impressed with whoever came up with this design.  They deserve some sort of award.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with solutions for hair removal because of my sensitive skin. I have been unable to wax my face for over 2 years and threading is very time consuming (and expensive). I looked at this product many times, read reviews, and mulled it over for a long time. Finally, I decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t satisfied but after a few days, I was completely satisfied. I have very dark hair and lots of it! After 2 years, I&#x27;m glad to finally find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using it, I can tell you that I love it! It takes a bit of practice but once you get it, it&#x27;s a breeze. I often use it when I&#x27;m watching TV. I have a lot of hair on the side of my face and lip. On any given day, I&#x27;m pretty much hair free. It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Was not able to figure this out at all. Threw it in a drawer and will probably never bother with it again.</li>
            <li> This thing... Well, I was expecting it to make me cry. It didn&#x27;t. There were a few spots on my face that made me wince (like high cheekebone closer to under eye) but it worked pretty well. It kinda felt good in a weird way around the chin area. HOWEVER, the moment I tried to do my upper lips my eyes teared up because it hurt so effing bad!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m not a wuss either. So, for me.. works great all over the face.. the upper lip? I&#x27;m too scared to try that area again! I just have that baby fine peach fuzz blonde hair too, so it&#x27;s not like I was ripping out a full on mustache. Also, it doesn&#x27;t rip all hair out from the root... so you kinda have to keep going over places. I like this, but yeah, not sure I&#x27;ll be using it regularly.</li>
            <li> This thing was probably used as a torture tool in the Spanish Inquisition. Yikes, it hurts. And yet, it is totally AWESOME! I cried at least the first 3 times I used this. For a few sessions after that, I sneezed constantly. It now causes some discomfort, but not to the point that I have to talk myself into going another round. I love the finished product -- way better than wax.</li>
            <li> Having a hard time getting used to how much it hurts to use! Sometimes I go over the same spot 5 times and it still doesn&#x27;t get the hairs.</li>
            <li> WOW.  I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t as common as any other facial hair removing method.  It&#x27;s great.  I LOVE it!  It stings a little but you get use to the pain... MUCH less pain than waxing and threading.  Also, while my face gets red (it&#x27;s sooooo sensitive) with this it gets red too but  not for nearly as long as with other methods.</li>
            <li> This took some time to get used to - first making sure it goes in the right direction and also bending it just so.  I can&#x27;t say I loved it the first or second time but now it is a great tool.  As someone with &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; vision, plucking had become difficult without a magnifying mirror.  I still need the mirror for the brow but in between the brows and along the chin and upper lip is a breeze.  It occasionally misses the thick course hair on the first try or two but with patience and practice it gets easier and easier.  The best part is I can take care of this sitting down, standing up, laying down - with lots of light or no light at all.  The hair for the most part has gotten finer and finer and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Did you know that the Egyptians used to remove hair with a silk string--works in exactly the same way this thing does!</li>
            <li> It does work but i still had to tweez after because you cant get the single tiny hairs with this product. I was able to get this through snagshout to test and review.</li>
            <li> This product is very painful once you actually get it to work! It is not very user friendly. Or maybe I just could not get the technique down. I bent it in the u-shape it would grab a few of the longer hairs and let me just say ouch! But then I couldn&#x27;t get it to grab hairs the majority of the time. I tried practicing the technique on a few leg hairs. I spent an hour trying to get the technique down to pick up a few of the longer hairs and I could never get it to work. If you can figure out how to get the technique down it may work for you, but this is now a product for me. I will stick to either just tweezing or using my face razors. I really wanted to love this product, but I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PROCE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> works pretty darn well</li>
            <li> This thing works!!  It took a few minutes to get the hang of it, but once I did all the facial hair was gone in about 10 minutes!  It stings a little but no more than tweezing, and a lot less than if you could pull each individual hair out with tweezers anyway.  So glad I purchased this!!!</li>
            <li> This product works great!  It is simple to get the hang of.  I may even get my mother one since it works so well!  Yes, it hurts a bit.  However, any tool that removes hair by the root is going to hurt. Period.  It is worth it for a hair - free face.  I used it everywhere on my face except my eyebrows and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Convenient, and works relatively well...but I think it&#x27;s a tad overpriced for what it does. It takes awhile to get used to and it&#x27;s not as painless as the lady in the picture makes it! Regardless I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> All I can say is OUCH!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother who has difficulty seeing to pluck stray hairs....and this is great!  Easy, a little stingy at first but it seems to do the job.  Going to get one for myself.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to the stinging sensation at first but I find it more tolerable after a few uses. I use at night since skin tends to get red from hair being pulled from roots. I like the idea of not using chemicals or waxing. Overall a neat and portable product!</li>
            <li> I like it better than threading.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the fault may have been partly mine - maybe my technique was improper, I dunno - but after using this, my entire upper lip and corner lip area darkened dramatically due to bruising. And the bruising took weeks to even minimally diminish and even now, months after this experience, my upper lip area remains sensitive and faintly discolors following tweezing, which had never been the case prior to using the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> Yes, as soon as it arrived I had to try it and it felt like I was ripping the tiny fine hairs out by the roots. Then I decided to do a  cleanse and steaming towel and try again. It was so much better than with dry cold skin. It still hurts more than waxing but much cheaper. I used Witch Hazel to calm the skin redness when I was finished. My skin looks and feels great. I was given enough this product to test and return an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing; my upper lip hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for a few weeks. I have been using this product for a year, and it still works well! I have sensitive skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all. It&#x27;s a great deal for those who have wanted facial hair; laser treatments can be expensive, and you have to go back for repeated treatments.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  I received it very quickly and it came with great directions....nicely packaged too.  I have already placed an order for another one to keep in my purse or in work.  My only suggestion to Bellaby would be to give the customer the option of choosing one of the pretty colors you advertise.  Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> You still need to tweeze afterwards, so don&#x27;t throw your tweezers away.  I rated these higher because for the most part you don&#x27;t need to go around mustachioed.</li>
            <li> I mean ya&#x27;ll... this thing is the best!!! I have tried bleaching, depilatories, waxing, threading, tweezing... am I missing anything? Waxing and threading always broke me out even if I exfoliated afterward, but this thing does not break me out at all! I would say it hurts about as much as waxing, but only the first time you use it. It definitely gets less painful as you get used to the sensation it causes. I even think this thing is fun! My favorite thing about it is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for much regrowth to use it, and it is just as effective as waxing or threading but insanely less costly and more convenient than going for a professional service. I love this thing and the tube it comes in. You can find far cheaper versions of this product but most are not available on Prime. I will keep buying these forever!</li>
            <li> This tool works great.  it takes a few minutes to get your technique down. Pretty painful in the beginning, but just like plucking your eyebrows it gets less painful with time. Much better than those little baby hair clippers since it pulls the hair out by the root and you can get a larger area done at once vs. plucking with tweezers. Use on a clan face and rinse with cold water after to close the pores and reduce redness.</li>
            <li> This item works perfect once I figured out how to use it correctly.  I should have looked it up sooner.</li>
            <li> Very effective product. Its a bit painful the first time or two you use this, but that seems to diminish over time ad bottom line - it does the job. Yes, it can be a little tricky along the jaw line, but with practice it can be done. My face gets a little red so I apply an ice pack afterwards and its fine after a minute or two</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m using it wrong or if it really doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I fell like it just pulls the hair and it grows back really quick.  It also REALLY hurts</li>
            <li> This product is okay. For some reason, I take forever to get it to work on  my upper lip area. But it does get rid of most of it so the hair isn&#x27;t visible. It does the job ok.</li>
            <li> I like using the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover all in all.  It works pretty well on my upper lip, though I do have to use tweezers to pluck a few hairs that is left behind.  I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product; great seller, great price</li>
            <li> considered NoNo but price is too high, this works, a little getting used to but does the job!</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the Tweezerman implement. Hurts more too!</li>
            <li> This works great but OMG does it hurt!! I keep using it because I&#x27;m tired of paying for waxing and using chemicals but be prepared for your eyes to water!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a little tingle when I used it to remove the hair on my ears that fell from my head and stuck. Ouch but it worked well to remove almost all of them.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and having facial hair is embarrassing!! This helps me so much. The first time I used it I broke out and some areas but after using it every other day-ish and its thin or little hair. I no longer have to deal with creams or waxing.</li>
            <li> Really painful way to remove hair, I&#x27;ll go back to ignoring my facial hair, thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> Age: 38&lt;br /&gt;Ethnicity: White/Northern European&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: Dry/Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t searching Amazon for a facial hair removal system... I was searching for a peel to remove dry skin, and stumbled upon this by accident.  I had assumed that my peach fuzz (which seemed to magically appear as I grew older and had kids) was something that could only be dealt with via prescription or expensive waxing.  When I saw this, the low price convinced me that it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today, and to my surprise, I&#x27;m delighted with it.  It&#x27;s a deceptively simple coil, which reminded me powerfully of the epilady system my mom purchased in the late 80&#x27;s.  You just twist it as you move it back and forth over your face, and it&#x27;s extremely effective at removing the hair. I would be lying to you if I said it wasn&#x27;t slightly painful... it IS pulling dozens of tiny hairs out from the root.  That being said, it&#x27;s doing whole sections at the same time, unlike tweezing them one at a time.  I&#x27;d compare it to having a rubber band snapped against your face - Certainly far less painful than waxing or the previously mentioned epilady.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have had no problems at all with my skin reacting (which it would surely do with a hot wax or a peel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to go over my face several times today to get everything, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the case with every first time user.  As the hair grows back in, I&#x27;m sure there will be less to remove in a single instance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never felt comfortable wearing makeup, as it seemed to just emphasize the hair, and never seemed to look right.  I&#x27;ve tried my makeup again after my Bellabe, and it actually looks right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very enthusiastic about this product, and grateful that I stumbled across it.</li>
            <li> it does work for hair above the lips but it is really painful to use...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  Based on the reviews I expected to save some money. and reduce my visits to the salon for waxing.  I followed the instructions carefully and only got some painful pinching in return.  I would have tolerated the pinching if the hair was removed but everything remained intact. I  tried applying pressure as I used it but it only got more painful. After about four uses, I gave up.  I also think it might have left some small  bumps on my upper lip but they did disappear overnight. The only thing I found accurate in the manual, is that it is easy to use.  It&#x27;s just not effective.</li>
            <li> This really works. It does hurt a little bit but I could bear it. I would recommend this item to others.</li>
            <li> This works well but is painful. It is probably the most painful hair removal method I have tried. Waxing hurts but it is over quickly. You have to uses this repeatedly to remove all of the hairs in one area and it is somewhat torturous. Area is also red for about 30 minutes after you use it and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it immediately before you have to go somewhere.  Overall it is effective and probably less damaging than ripping everything out at once.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, but isn&#x27;t as easy as it looks - either that or I&#x27;m just really uncoordinated. The videos I&#x27;ve watched on YouTube say your face can be smooth in a couple of minutes. I worked at it for at least a half hour and it does easily take some of the longer hair from the cheek bone area, but the small fine hairs on the lip are harder, even if you stretch your lip out with your tongue. I&#x27;m a 53 y-o woman, so part of it is that my skin isn&#x27;t as taut as a younger person and the fact that you need 2 hands to hold the Bellabe, I can&#x27;t stretch my skin tight enough for the Bellabe to grip the hairs - it just sinks into the cheek hollows. It probably works great for younger people, but I will say that it did work well enough for me to have somewhat smoother skin and I will continue to use it. The longer hairs are gone, but getting it to work on the chin and neck are harder for me - maybe I just need to work with it and figure out the best positioning. As for the pain, seems like other people are wimpy. Yes, it&#x27;s a slight sting, but nothing of the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; other reviewers talk about. Overall a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d take a chance. I have used this for about a week. And boy does this thing find and remove hairs you can&#x27;t see. If you are not used to waxing or plucking this can be painful.</li>
            <li> Love love love this gadget. Was skeptical at first but it works exactly as stated. Planning to order another one soon</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts but it is sooo worth it! I have sensitive skin and this does not give me any bumps or marks. I am a little bit red right after I use it but the redness goes aways in minutes. I have tried so many products and this one is by far the most effective yet. I can use it anytime and don&#x27;t even need a mirror to do so. Love it and highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of facial hair. P.S. This is not made for the rest of your body...only your face.</li>
            <li> Thanks to menopause, I now have a bit of a moustache.  I used NADS for my lip and my eyebrows for many years.  Sometime I get my eye brows waxed, but my skin is sensitive and burns easily.  So thought I&#x27;d try something new.  Gave this a try, and while I can&#x27;t say it feels great - it really works great.</li>
            <li> this thing is kind of silly.  I don&#x27;t care for it at all and mine went into the trash can after the first week of trying to use it. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting burned with wax, this is an amazing little thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very useful since it is small, so I can take it to travel.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy that I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Wife</li>
            <li> Works great.  It does hurt a bit, but if you want rid of the hair you&#x27;ve got to do it.</li>
            <li> Useless. It simply does not work for the function it is designed for.</li>
            <li> I like this much better than waxing. It irritates my skin much less, it&#x27;s not messy. It does hurt a little, but that&#x27;s only to be expected because all hair removal hurts. I do not have much upper-lip hair to deal with, but enough that it bothered me when I could see it, so now I can just take care of it with the Bellabe, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Great product, actually works and unlike others, it did not hurt. The only complain is that after I used this product I broke out, but that is mainly because of my skin not the product itself.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy! Maybe I&#x27;m still learning how to use properly, but I&#x27;ve experienced some prickly stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhere in that middle crowd where my facial hair is not enough to warrant a full-on salon wax but I&#x27;m just vain/neurotic enough to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is about the size of a long pencil and comes in a reusable plastic tube with a set of printed instructions. The coil is very flexible and bends easily to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it by bending it into a U shape and twisting the handles in and out. I&#x27;m pretty klutzy so I had my doubts but I watched a quick YouTube tutorial and had no problem. My pro tip: Puff up your lips and use your tongue to push out your cheeks to get closer access to the hair, similar to how men do when they&#x27;re shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So. The pain. Yes, it hurts. Worse than plucking and waxing and it takes longer so there&#x27;s that, too. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an insane amount of pain but it&#x27;s no picnic, either. If you&#x27;re a drinker, I recommend doing a shot and putting on some of your most inspiring tunes while you go at it. My face was red and sore for about 10 mins after but it quickly subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m a fan and happy with this decidedly unsexy but necessary purchase.</li>
            <li> It is painful and did not remove much at all after ten minutes of suffering.</li>
            <li> Hard to get all the angles right and takes time to get the hang of it. Still need pincers for tougher hairs. It does however find all the finest hairs I never even noticed, so now I got a fine beard growing back, not just a few annoying facial hairs.</li>
            <li> i love this product very easy to use. i used to wax my upper lip and would have all the sticky wax on my fingers and it was very hard to get rid of but now with bellabe hair removing is so much faster easier and best of all cleaner! i do recommend.</li>
            <li> It does what I bought it to do.  The hairs hurt while they are being pulled out but the pain is well worth it.  The pain is no more than if you used tweezers.  The only thing I found was I am prone to blemishes and did get 3 when hair was removed on my chin.</li>
            <li> Effective, easy to use and prefer over waxing. Shipped quickly. A+ Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have lots of those little middle age fine, feathery white hairs on my face.  I can also tell you, that it hurts, as you get tons of little hair in it.  It takes a while to get a sense of using it.  Why we just don&#x27;t shave like men I don&#x27;t know.  I think I could put numbing cream on and maybe it would help.  Nonetheless, I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> Yeah right, how can something simple as this spring remove my facial hair, let alone the really tiny baby hairs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go into my review, let me tell you about my journey with my facial hair.  First as a teen, I noticed some hairs appearing when I didn&#x27;t want them to appear, might be nice for the boys but for a teenage girl going through puberty, a mustache just isn&#x27;t right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to do?  Start with the least painful which is shaving. Not good because the hair grows back the moment you shave it off which feels like a fine stubble. Next, the bleaching.  Yes, I used that and that should just be called a facial hair highlighter because that is what it did to mine. Dark hair appeared highlighted and not hidden!  The depilatory creams.  Okay, they did a good job but they could also burned the skin if not careful.  Waxing--Hot wax.  Oh yes, I had my share of a scabstache, you know when the hot wax is ripped off and takes some of the skin!  Cold wax--didn&#x27;t grab the skin as well as the hot nor did it pull out the fine hairs. These were all through my teen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now into my late teens and early adult years.  I tried one of those sand paper like hair removal stuff.  Never worked on me, it exfoliated my skin and in certain spots on the face made it more sensitive.  Hair removal was minimal and it took major time doing it.  Threading--not coordinated enough and still not today!  Epilators--Yes, this has been my go-to product for my adult life!  I have been using the Braun and it has been good.  Only 2 problems: uses up batteries like crazy.  4 AAA batteries lose their steam after a couple of uses which cost a lot!  Another major drawback, it doesn&#x27;t catch the really fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now for the BELLABE.  No way!  Can&#x27;t work! Too simple of a gadget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my skepticism turned to belief!  First if you never have done any facial removal, you will feel sensitivity.  Here are a few things you need to do BEFORE you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your skin has to be clean of any oils or the coil won&#x27;t catch the hair.  You should swipe the area of hair removal with rubbing alcohol and also spritz some on the coils.  If you feel pain or sensitivity when using the product, I suggest getting some Anbesol  and applying onto the area used.  This will numb the area just enough for the hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have prepped the skin, you have to learn how to use it.  First hold the handles between your fingers and bend into a &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; shape.  Next, roll THE HANDLES between your fingers and just move the coil up and down the area of hair removal.  THAT&#x27;S IT!  When you are finished, just spritz the Bellabe with alcohol to keep it clean and oil free and store in the given container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I couldn&#x27;t believe is that it removed all of the hair including the baby fine ones which my epilator never removed or couldn&#x27;t remove.  Another thing is, I don&#x27;t need batteries which makes it perfect for traveling.  It is a quiet little tool that actually removes the facial hair effectively.  I won&#x27;t go back to my Braun, Bellabe is it for me from now on!</li>
            <li> Just received this product today.  It took a bit of trial and error to figure it out.  It worked great for the &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t seem to grip shorter hairs, although I&#x27;m still learning.  As for the pain....any hair removal that pulls the hair from the root will not feel good, no matter what.  Having said that,  this device is pretty gentle.  I&#x27;m pretty used the pain of hair plucking after years of doing it - but this wasn&#x27;t bad on the really sensitive spots- like the upper lip.  Glad I got this product and hopefully it will save me prep time.</li>
            <li> It works as said. Much faster than plucking each hair one by one with a tweezer which was why I got it. I have to remove the hair with the root because mine grows back too fast so I can&#x27;t use Nair or like products, then when I try using wax strips I always somehow wax my skin off too even though I hold it taut. It was easy to use, and it does miss a few of the finer ones but it gets a majority of the more visible kind.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try but so glad I did. Stings a bit but you can get use to it. Easily removes all those thin tiny lip hairs.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use and gets most of the hairs. Hurts a reasonable amount, slightly less than threading for some reason but also a bit tougher to take since I&#x27;m doing it to myself! Haven&#x27;t been able to get threaded since my son was born 10 months ago and this saved me!! I have mostly blond mostly fine hair and the Bellabe took most of them out! I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it&#x27;s a tiny bit difficult to use but I also think that&#x27;s just the nature of the beast.</li>
            <li> This mostly trims face fuzzies it doesn&#x27;t remove them.</li>
            <li> This little tool works really well if you let it grow a little bit so it can grab the hair. Great for upper lip hair removal and it does pull from the root.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe really works! I&#x27;ve had really fine, pale blonde hair on my jawline all my life, and finally I&#x27;ve found something that removes it without irritating my face. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve had more problems with hair above my lip and under my chin, and it gets all that too. Sure, it pulls a little, but it&#x27;s done so quickly that it&#x27;s really not bad...definitely better than plucking each hair separately. I&#x27;ll never be without one of these!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as it claims!  I don&#x27;t recommend it to anybody because you will just be wasting your time. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt like threading. Takes a little time but worth the price. 100 dollars saved for the year from my pocket</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a few months now and I love it! When first reading the reviews before purchasing this item I was a little skeptical ager reading the negative reviews. So far I have found none of those reviews to be my case. This item is great because it pulls the multiple hairs out at the root like waxing and unlike a razor but if you miss a spot you can go back like tweezers. I have no problems with red spots and the pain is defiantly manageable. If you are hesitating on this item stop worrying and just buy it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but it hasn&#x27;t worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Works great price for this beauty aid</li>
            <li> this is so simple and works sooo great.  I use it around my mouth and chin.  It hurts a tiny bit but it lasts a while after.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and excellent product. I was able to sit and watch TV while using.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about a little spring removing unwanted hair. However after reading some reviews I decided to give it a try. The first go was painful and I stopped halfway but after feeling how soft my face felt it motivated me to keep going. Now the tingly feeling it induces is not bothersome at all and my face is smooth and hairless. Definitely glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> These are amazing little gizmos. Easy to use. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would wax or bleach when they could use this.</li>
            <li> It took a few goes to get the hang of it, but it&#x27;s well worth the patience. I love the convenience and results!</li>
            <li> This thing works! It does exactly what it is advertised to do. It hurts a bit but it isn&#x27;t too bad. Imagine tweezing several hairs at once, that&#x27;s what it feels like.</li>
            <li> It really works.  At first it hurts but after a few times you get used to it.  No more waxing for me.</li>
            <li> The product only grabs about half the hairs, if you have that one stubborn hair that is hard to pull this item will not be able to pull it out.</li>
            <li> Effective for removing fine facial hair, the mustache and peach fuzz that we women - especially those of a certain age - experience. I used it on my upper lip, chin, and cheeks the morning it arrived and my husband, who rarely notices any cosmetic improvement I&#x27;ve made, asked that evening &amp;#34;your skin looks so nice - did you have a facial?&amp;#34; My 20-year-old daughter used mine once on her mustache and immediately asked for one. Not at all difficult to use (as some claim this to be) and I didn&#x27;t find it nearly as painful as some claim it to be. The discomfort is no more than that caused by removing a bandaid and I don&#x27;t feel the need to numb the area with ice (which I did prior to laser for underarms and legs) but if you do, ignore the reviewer who cautions that &amp;#34;ice closes the pores&amp;#34; because hair follicles aren&#x27;t pores. This is not a precision tool - you won&#x27;t shape your eyebrows with it. But it is easy to keep your face and chin hair-free (I caught both the fine light hairs on my cheeks and upper lip and few course dark hairs that spout on my chin from time to time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an effective, inexpensive way to better remove facial hair and have been very happy with the results.  The only problem that I have is removing hair from neck area and then have two problem areas on my chin where the hairs are gray and very coarse.  It is hard to remove those with the Bellable so I still have to use tweezers  on those areas.  Overall though, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> All it did was break off the hairs and give me a rash on my cheeks</li>
            <li> works perfectly once you get the hang of it. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It does sting at first but no more than plucking.  Once you get the hang of twisting the right way on the ends of the device, it removes the hair and leaves your face feeling smooth!!  I have tried every other way to remove the hair from my face and this works the best of them all!!!  I would highly recommend this hair remover.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my wife wanted it.  We&#x27;re in our 40&#x27;s, and this item seems desiged to help remove the inevitable peach fuzz and occasional wayward hair that can start to appear around this age, to the great dismay of the woman who experiences it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, of course, didn&#x27;t notice anything amiss, and told my wife whatever she was concerned about was completely unnoticable.  She&#x27;s gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She, on the other hand, is convinced that any faint facial hair that manifests makes her blood kin to the grizzly bear that bit Jim Bridger&#x27;s arse, and must not be tolerated.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, she seems pretty satisfied with the results from this device, although she uses other stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it appears like something from the Spanish Inquisition (which nobody expects).  But, it performs the task of ripping out little microscopic hairs from my wife&#x27;s face, so I guess it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Girls.  Waddya gonna do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We guys would just use a circular saw.  That&#x27;s how &#x27;cause we be so purty and smert.</li>
            <li> No, wont remove really small hairs.</li>
            <li> I will no longer use messy creams.  This works like a charm.  Took a week or so to get the hang of it...helps to read the directions.  There are several instructive online videos that help.  There is some discomfort especially above the upper lip but this disminishes with use.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Bellabe.  And, it did not feel good at first. Seriously it hurt! But, I am now hooked and use it all the time.  My face is so smooth.  It&#x27;s never felt like that before.  I love it.  Don&#x27;t base your decision on the first time.  Keep trying. you will love it too.</li>
            <li> This works very well for the fine hair that grows on my face or other areas but anything course will not be removed by this product.  I have to tweeze stubborn  hairs.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fine tool.</li>
            <li> This product works very well as described. The results last a lot longer than alternative methods and it shipped fast. You can check out a youtube video for instructions.</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe Facial Hair Remover was recommended by a close friend and I&#x27;m eager to recommended it to others. It works easily with a minimum of discomfort and can be used anywhere. I don&#x27;t have to be anxiously staring into the bathroom mirror anymore. I use it almost every evening when I&#x27;m reading and my face is clear all the time now. What a relief!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice in theory but seems to only work if you can hold it flat.  It does a good job along side of face (like in the picture) or above the lip, but where I need it the most, along curve of chin where hair is more bristly, it won&#x27;t grab.  I tried and tried, holding it differently, coming from different angles, etc.  I just got frustrated every time and ended up shaving the chin.  I guess it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older and don&#x27;t have the tight skin that younger women have....</li>
            <li> Holy cow!  This really works!&lt;br /&gt;I was quite impressed with how well this funky wire/spring thing works.  It will take you a minute or two to get the hang of it but its worth the little bit of effort.  No redness but don&#x27;t expect it to be pain free - if you can stand plucking you&#x27;ll be able to handle this (though some areas of my face are a little more sensitive than others).</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what is said it would at all.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this, no more pesky little facial hair, I followed the directions and it worked! The hairs come out easily and there is very little pain, my skin is so soft and smooth, no more embarrassment when I go out in public worrying about if people can see those little chin hairs! I highly recommend this, I have read mixed reviews but you have to try and really learn how to use it and it will work! Im very happy with my Bellabe Facial Hair remover!</li>
            <li> In my 10+ years of purchasing on Amazon, I have never found a product I was so excited about that made me want to write a review the day I received it. This is perfect for the peach fuzz and upper lip hair I get and really isn&#x27;t that painful in my opinion. It is super easy to use and will save me so much money in the long run not going to a salon to get the hair threaded. If only it could work on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This thingymajiggy is the best invention for facial hair removal. It absolutely works for me. After one use I was used to it right away. The most painful area is the upper lip, it kind of startles you at first and can hurt but you should get used to it pretty fast. If you can handle waxing, you can get through this. Gets all the little hairs around my jaw line, chin, upper lip and my skin is looking clearer and feels smoother because of this. Makeup goes on more flawless, looks smoother, I really can see a difference. No batteries to worry about, this is going to save you so much money from going to the salon to get waxed. You&#x27;ll still need to get your brows waxed though but that&#x27;s just fine. Do not attempt because it&#x27;s not easy to control small areas. Use your tweezers for your brows!  Read the instructions and tips, they tell you the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s and how to clean it. It&#x27;s very simple to use. Just set against your skin and twist with both hands. Don&#x27;t immerse it in water. You will need to replace every 6-9 months it says as the spring wears put. Still worth every penny! You have to try it to believe.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I just started growing some little hairs above my upper lip. It hurt quite a lot when I first used it, but it&#x27;s getting less painful. The only problem is for some reason it leaves some hairs and won&#x27;t pick them up.. Which is kind of frustrating because I would except excellent quality when spending $15 on a spring....</li>
            <li> Unbelievable,  how manageable my unwanted hair has become. Does not irritate and leave  my skin at all. My skin feels smooth and it ssems my hair growth has slowed. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I find Bellabe to be quite helpful. It can be difficult to maneuver it to pluck some hairs in certain areas but otherwise is very effective and leaves the skin feeling far smoother than a razor would. I like using it in tandem with regular tweezers for harder to pluck hair. I also use razors usually if in a rush or simply too lazy to stand in front of the mirror with Bellabe to pluck one or two defiant hairs. Initially, I found it to be painful but overtime it becomes bearable, although I seem to have quite the tolerance when it comes to plucking in general.</li>
            <li> It really does work.  I am an Italian-American woman with coarse hairs on the lip and chin.  This little guy definitely takes care of the strays.  I can even skip a few threading sessions.  A few months ago, I was in a panic at the sight of major strays between threadings!  A caveat: I was just about the throw this thing out.  I laughed out loud how I was so duped to buy this thing - I tried twice and it wasn&#x27;t working at all.  Then I decided to try it one more time.  Eureka!  Results.  I held on to it and get a little better at maneuvering it each time.  It really did take me 3-5 tries for it to be really effective.  If you have one, keep trying!  If you don&#x27;t, it is so worth the investment.  It&#x27;s $10!  I&#x27;ve saved at least $100 in threading since I got it a few months ago.  So glad I got this thing.</li>
            <li> Great little tool. Much faster than plucking, but no less or more painful.</li>
            <li> I just received this tool and I&#x27;m pleased at how it works. Only took a few mins for me to get used to it. I do have to giggle at the instructions when it states that I would feel a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; sensation when the hair gets pulled out. Let&#x27;s be honest and say that it&#x27;s really more of a horrible ripping sensation!!! More effective than tweezing and less damaging than wax, so still happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Painful, but it works.</li>
            <li> SOOOO much faster than plucking and way better than waxing, IMO.  Obviously it&#x27;s going to feel like you&#x27;re plucking because it&#x27;s pulling hair out of your face so it&#x27;s not going to feel great.  I have super duper sensitive skin  as with any other apparatus that pulls hair out of your body, your skin will be a little redish due to the irritation but for me it goes away within an hour.</li>
            <li> Purchased this with high hopes.  It does not work with course hair and works minimally with anything else. I have attempted to use it numerous times incase I was doing it incorrectly but still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  It does what it is supposed to!  I&#x27;m happy&lt;br /&gt;with my Bellabe purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times now but i cannot seem to get the hair from the root no matter what i try..... Also it takes forever to get every single hair - so i just go threading instead BUT this is def a good tool for a fast fix because it makes the hair appear less noticable even if its not pulled from the root- I give it a 6 out of 10</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product. I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face, and its not dark, and in most lights not super noticeable, but in certain lighting its obvious and the hairs look long, and there are alot. So i ordered this and recieved it a few days later, just in time to use the night before school started. ( i am a senior in high school) I used to have acne in middle school, but since then ive got it under control, and my skins been great lately. I wasnt even worried about this breaking me out after reading the reviews all of them were positive. When i used it, i took all the precautions like washing and exfoliating before and after the use, cleaning it, and rinsing my face in cold water to close the pores after. The actual removal was EXTREMELY painful, especially the upper lip area. But I did it all, and the next day, I was pleased because my skin felt smoother and my makeup went on better and looked better. So i used it again the next night. But, another day later, my entire chin and sides of my mouth and in between my eyesbrows were covered in whiteheads, a few very large zits, and a ton of smaller ones. Its disgusting. Its been two more days and im struggling to get rid of them. I&#x27;ve never had this bad of acne in my entire life, and i had it pretty bad in middle school. I was on the verge of tears because the entire first week of my senior year ive had hideous skin and crazy amounts of whiteheads. Basically, based on the reviews ive read, if you are older, and have never struggled with acne, you should have no problem, but if you have ever struggled with acne, or have oily skin DO NOT USE THIS. I still have a ton of zits all over, and Im trying to get rid of them, for my skin to go back to normal. I am really angry with this product and so embarrassed of my skin now. And on top of that all, the pain that went along with it was almost too much to handle.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, baby white haor on my upper lip and chin (getting older sucks) and waxing and creams tend to make me swell up because my skin is so sensitive.  I ordered this product to see if it worked before I invested in an expensive epilator - and am very glad that I did!  It does sting a bit - but no more than tweezing.  Great, great buy and works very well.  After a bit of practice, you can control where the springs pull from - not just pulling willy-nilly.  Very happy with the product.  Great stocking stuffer idea for my girlfriends&#x27;, too!</li>
            <li> Looked to complicated to even try and it does looks like it would hurt. Only thing I can say is that you got to have a lot of facial hair to use this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and don&#x27;t see good results ..very easy to use and good price but I was hoping for a lil more.</li>
            <li> This sproduct was painful to use but even worse...it didn&#x27;t work very well. I had to go over the same area several times, endure the pain, but there were still hairs left. I found it tedious and there&#x27;s no way I can see myself doing this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things. Tweezing hurts and is slow, waxing didn&#x27;t work unless I went to a salon, and creams burn my skin. On a whim I decided to try this, and finally am pleased with a hair removal method. It is easy to use, easy to store away or carry with me, and my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and can&#x27;t stop using it.  It works perfectly.  I was a little apprehensive to use it from other reviews that talk about how painful it is to use.  I did not find this to be painful at all.  Some people just have lower pain tolerance.  I suffer from fine light hairs on my upper lip and chin and was able to remove all of these with little effort.  My face feels smooth and no irritation at all from using.  I will definitely continue to use this.  I have used Nads and other chemical facial hair removers but this is much faster than Nads and no irritation as with the chemical hair removers.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have my eyebrows threaded every few weeks, and although there is no other way to get them shaped as nicely, it is very painful.  So, I was worried about how painful the Bellabe would be (although it cannot be used on eyebrows).  I&#x27;m not going to say that it is painless, but it is less painful than traditional threading.  I have used it primarily on my chin.  It takes a few tries to master the way it works, but the results are very smooth.  I have very sensitive skin and had not problems at all!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of bending &amp; then twisting the ends, it does the job. You can definitely feel the hairs being pulled. So much faster than tweezing one hair at a time. Not sure how to make of any complaints that gives this a low rating because it hurts when the hairs are being pulled....after all, unless your skin is numb to hairs being pulled out, expect discomfort in sensitive areas. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My facial hair is soft, white and difficult to locate which can be problematic for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  Love this product.  Easy to use, travels well as it fits into most makeup bags and almost painless.</li>
            <li> I love it! Serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This may work, but I&#x27;ll never know because the pain was worse than waxing and worse than an epilator.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;threader&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threading is definitely becoming a more popular way to eliminate hair.  Hair removal is never a &amp;#34;Fun&amp;#34; thing, especially when you are having to pluck hairs one by one, causing your eyes to water and your face to sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love about the Bellabe Facial Remover, is it allows for multiple hairs to be removed at one time.  It&#x27;s easy and pracitcally painless.  I find tweezers to be a lot more of a tear jerker than this particular system.  My only complaint with this technique in general is trying to focus in on one lone hair, Perhaps, I&#x27;ve not quite mastered the technique yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to try this or anything like it, I would recommend, just note that in order to get it to actually work &amp;#34;Arch it, then twist the handles&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;arch and twist&amp;#34;.  It was the initial twisting I was missing I was wondering WHY can&#x27;t I get any dang hairs, UH because of user error....  However, I managed to figure it out and once I did I fell in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this particular device is the options you have.  Other devices that are similar, you are subject to NO choice.  I love that there are a variety of colors to choose from.  If your like me, you like anything you own to be &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; be it a hair remover or shoes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a review sample.  However, my thoughts and opinions expressed here are 100% my own and honest.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!! Definitely a little tricky to get use to but works better than expected!</li>
            <li> It works but really hurts!</li>
            <li> It pinches and left me with bumps (that may just be my skin)</li>
            <li> This product is awesome I can feel and see it pulling my little peach fuzz out not one by one either like twizzers do it&#x27;s a lot coming out , so much easier, especially when your busy and have kids.</li>
            <li> Forget the painful hair removal products or even shaving.  Use this product to gently remove facial hair and those few stray eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out the correct motion..... Man did this sucker work, slowly ripping out tiny peach fuzz...... Does not feel like a pin prick, feels like a 400 pound German woman named Gert ( pretty sure she used to be a wrestler....and a man) is super glueing duct tape to your cheeks and or upper lip and yanking out the delicate whisps of fuzz with enough force to wax a gorilla then following up with a gentle soothing touch of a blowtorch that will leave you tingling for a good half hour. De fuzzed and amazed that a torture device is so small and pink.</li>
            <li> Received the Ballable Hair Removal in the mail a few weeks ago.  Tried it twice.  Definitely removed hair but.......MY FACE BROKE OUT....DELETE. END OF STORY.</li>
            <li> This really works. I&#x27;ve given them to all my friends. After they quit laughing they come to the same conclusion. Great product</li>
            <li> Extremely painful to use and not worth the money. It is not easy to use and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> This product was painful to use, and produced acne even though I took all the hygiene advice the product info gave.  I have sensitive skin, and I am still dealing with the after effects.</li>
            <li> It took several tries to figure out exactly how to use it, but one you master the learning curve, it works well.</li>
            <li> This Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the true definition of no pain no gain and pain is beauty at least for the first couple uses. I was literally scared of this hair remover and didn&#x27;t have any idea why people would seriously want to use this. I&#x27;ve waxed before and that alone is pretty darn painful so the thought of this metal object ripping my facial hair out wasn&#x27;t exactly a thrilling thought. However, getting facial hair off of my face was absolutely a thrilling thought as I for whatever reason have more facial hair then I or any woman would like to admit so no pain no gain here we come!  This hair remover isn&#x27;t AS bad as my mind made me believe that it would be. Yes it is painful in certain spots but after using it for a little bit the pain goes away. I&#x27;m pretty sure the actual pain is from not being used to it. It does take some time to get used to how this works because it seems weird but all you have to do is grab the hair remover with one hand on one end and the other hand on the other end, bend the spring, put it up to the hairs, and start twisting. You can go faster on some spots and slower on others it just depends mainly on how tough the hair is. The hair remover starts pulling the hairs out by the roots which means it&#x27;ll take a lot longer for those hairs to grow back and some of them actually wont grow back.  I really like the results with this hair remover and after a couple times of using it I&#x27;ve gotten used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34;. I also really like that even though its pulling hairs out of my face it doesn&#x27;t actually irritate my skin which I do have sensitive skin so that actually surprised me. My facial hair isn&#x27;t as bad as what it was before hand! I would definitely recommend this Bellabe Facial Hair Remover!  **I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> Great tool! Works well, came very nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> very difficult to use</li>
            <li> Hard to use...not as easy as it makes it seem.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work like I hoped it would</li>
            <li> Sooo painful...Not sure if I am doing something wrong but this is just horrible, it&#x27;s worse that waxing by 10x.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Always need to exfoliate after using this to avoid ingrown follicles.</li>
            <li> easy to use. if u hve fine hair its must, but thick hair forget it. its back to the salon for me and getting the natural threading done, was hoping to save my self some money by using this tool.</li>
            <li> I like these spring things, but after losing my REM version, I tried this less expensive one.  It works, but the metal is getting all discolored and nasty looking.  If I lose this one, I&#x27;ll pay more for the REM.</li>
            <li> This is a really unique item. Easy to use. You can feel it working. I don&#x27;t have to find a mirror and a good light, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This handles facial hair effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I chose this item because it works. I can&#x27;t see the hair any longer that is on my face This item works with no more pain than lessors with a lot less cost..</li>
            <li> With so many good reviews I was expecting more.  I generally use an electric epi that works on a similar principle so I thought this will be good at work and while in front of the TV, but there just does not seem to be the leverage to actually pull what it might grab.  Maybe my skin or hair are just too tough, but this hair remover did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I can say that it looks exactly like the photo, comes in the proper packaging. I have read other reviews for a product similar to this and it looks NOTHING like the photos. So if you want what you pay for, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I know this product probably works well, however; I have had such a hard time using it.  I haven&#x27;t given up yet because I want it to work:)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Bellabe from Amazon.com after a friend told me about it.  It was in stock and shipped promptly and I was using in a few days.  I found the product to be very easy to use.  The very first time I used it, I got results.  My face is very smooth without all the facial hair and I am so thankful that I don&#x27;t have to daily \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; hairs.  After the initial use of removing the hair, I now just do touchups that only takes a few seconds.  I personally would recommend this product.  I am 67 yrs. old and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it or sell it for anything, just sorry I didn&#x27;t know about it before now.</li>
            <li> once you get the hang of how to use it, it&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll get the job done.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of this little device, it does the job wonderfully.  But be prepared... it HURTS!  Granted, most hair-removal does hurt, so take that with a grain of salt.  Don&#x27;t try to use this near/around your eye brows, as it&#x27;s hard to be precise and can end up taking a hunk of eyebrow out quickly!</li>
            <li> it works!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!  !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! ...</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this earlier. It is so much better than using tweezers. Works great on your face! Wondering if there was 1 for your body like your legs and arms?</li>
            <li> It HURTS and it leaves a rash on my upper lip for several hours.  I still use it about 2-3 times a week because it gets the job done, however, I always do it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical but it really does work.  I still have to use tweezers to get a few stubborn hairs but it gets 90% of them and quickly.  I would definitely recommend this product,</li>
            <li> It definitely pulls all of the fine hairs.  It is not difficult to use at all and I don&#x27;t understand those who have trouble using it.  Anyway...it has trouble with the more coarse hairs and you&#x27;ll probably have to continue plucking those with tweezers (i do).  It also has trouble grasping hairs on the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; or edges of your face like the rounded areas of the chin.  Yes it hurts...as you would expect from anything that rips your hair out from the root.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Thank god for no more waxing! All women should have one of these. It&#x27;s an amazing little tool, I bought one for myself and my mother, she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I use mine weekly. Love it</li>
            <li> fast&lt;br /&gt;easy to order&lt;br /&gt;hurts to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use - it really &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; and removes even the finest hairs.  Certainly faster than shaving or plucking and more cost effective than waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get used to it, but it does work. I use it for my face and I didn&#x27;t find that it hurts, but then I&#x27;m used to plucking.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!!!! I highly recommend it! Virtually painless.</li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you can handle a little pain ;)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. First time was a little rough until you get used to the sensation. But after that it&#x27;s a piece of cake. The cost pays for itself with one use if compared to a salon lip waxing. And even better: you can get rid of that light coat of feather down on the rest of your grace , the stuff you see hut nobody else might, with a little more use.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews, but after using my new Bellabe for the first time today, I have to rate it FIVE STARS! I am a post-menopausal woman who has plenty of long, blonde, silky hair -- too bad it&#x27;s all over my face and neck. Along with a few dark and brittle ones that pop up on the chin and moustache. Yuuuuuuck. I&#x27;ve paid for professional full-face waxing which is inconvenient, expensive and painful -- my skin is sensitive and I&#x27;ve had minor burns from wax that was too hot. I switched to depilatory cream every two weeks for the past couple of years, until three weeks ago, when the stuff burned my face so badly I looked like a meth addict. I was in despair when I went online and started researching. Bellabe sounded like a dream come true, and, feeling optimistic, I ordered the two-pack. Ladies, you won&#x27;t believe this thing!!! I was worried because if it didn&#x27;t work, I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do about the facial hair. Plus, I am usually a total klutz with tools of any kind. It took less than five minutes for me to figure it out and get the feel for it! I watched a video from Youtube first, which helped, because frankly, the package directions weren&#x27;t very good. Once I got the hang of it, it was actually fun ... I know, I know, how fun can it be to rip your unwanted hair out by the roots? But it was strangely addictive, like popping those plastic bubbles on shipping wrap. The best part of all -- I was done in less than 15 minutes and my face and neck feels totally smooth and soft. I had minimal redness which disappeared in less than 20 minutes. The Bellabe grabbed all the hairs except for the very shortest, finest ones, which gives a much more natural appearance. It looks like I have natural &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; like I had before menopause. I will never be without this tool again. Here are a few tips that they don&#x27;t mention in the directions: 1. The handles are printed with a number 1 on one end and a number 2 on the other. I had no idea why, so I experimented and found out that the tool works if you hold the 1 in your left hand and the 2 in your right hand, and twist the handles inward (fingers toward each other, toward the center of the inverted U shape.) 2. Be certain to twist each handle at the same time, firmly, as you roll it against the direction of hair growth. When it&#x27;s working, you&#x27;ll feel and see it gently grab all the hairs it can, slightly pulling your skin up as it goes. 3. It helps to puff up your face anywhere you can to make it more taut; the spring grabs the hair better that way. It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as waxing, for some reason (the only exception being the middle of the upper lip -- that was pretty intense). But that is the only negative thing I have to say, and we all pay a price for beauty, right?  I promise you will love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to waxing and it works OK.  Doesn&#x27;t remove all the hairs that waxing does but is easier on the skin.</li>
            <li> Simple product and does the job quite effectively. Like it better than other alternatives. Need to figure out a good way to clean it after use. As of now I just bend it in the other direction to remove the caught up hair and then clean it with a sanitizer. It comes in a cute case which is good too.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, hair removal is not comfortable, but the Bellabe is a wonderful, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Product works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say... There is a bit of an ouch factor here. If you don&#x27;t like plucking, this baby isn&#x27;t for you. There is also a learning curve involved, so don&#x27;t expect to pick it up and be hairless in a few minutes. It seems to take some practice to get the technique down.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well. It is kind of tricky to use properly and have hair above the mouth actually removed. Just easier to use tweezer !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without these silly things!  After I ordered one, I ordered 3 more and am going to order more!  They last a long time and will never want to be without them around the house, in the car, etc.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and ever since I began waxing. My skin being quite sensitive eventually left those dark spots on my upper lip. I tried those facial cream hair remover but it also was very irritating. I have also used small razors….Well, You know what you get. The famous 5 o&#x27;clock shadow on my upper lip…No thanks&lt;br /&gt;This tool has been a life saver, works wonders. It sting but it&#x27;s so worth it. My marks are gone and my upper lip looks even.&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love my bellabe…Works for me</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just stupid, but this product does not work for me. I have peach fuzz on my cheeks and this does absolutely nothing to remove them. It&#x27;s nothing more than an expensive spring. Useless.</li>
            <li> This little thing does the job, but it hurts just like pulling out hairs with the tweezers. I use it on those annoying hairs that started growing after I reached a certain age - the ones by the corners of my mouth, and those odd hairs along my jaw line. It&#x27;s easy to use, and you don&#x27;t have to look in the mirror to use it; I keep handy and use it frequently.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on the Bellabe Facial Hair Removal product.  Totally useless hair removal product.  sorry purchase !!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work compared to waxing or plucking. Once I got the hang of it, yes there is a learning curve on this item, I now actually prefer using this to plucking or waxing. As other reviewers have stated you can&#x27;t do your eyebrows but anywhere else on your face you can use this. IT hurts like plucking or waxing but no mess like waxing and you get more hair each roll than just one by tweezer. Cleaning this is a little harder due to you don&#x27;t want to damage the spring, but a I found a stiff brissell brush like a nail brush works pretty well and then rinsing in hot water soapy water works pretty well. This is great for travelling just toss in your make up bag!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It removes unwanted facial hair quickly and effectively.  I would not want to be without it, and so I have a few extra on hand.  I love to tell my friends about Bellabe and highly recommend it to them!</li>
            <li> Was very curious, so gave it a try.  It does the job, but very slowly.  I really don&#x27;t care about the momentary &#x27;pain&#x27;, it is not too bad.  What I do care about is how long it takes to get the job done.  The positive about this purchase is that I understand THREADING and found a woman who does a wonderful job.  It is inexpensive and a lot less laborious for me.  Too much labor involved using the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> this gets the job done pretty good although i do have problems with getting extra small hairs. this is much faster than tweezing.</li>
            <li> Since I bought it I use it everyday.  It makes my life easier and save me money. Don&amp;#34;t have to go to the Salon.</li>
            <li> Totally impressed.  Gets those darn man hairs before they become obvious.  A little bit of pain involved, but no where near as much as pulling those fellers out one by one.  Nifty tool.</li>
            <li> Wow! Love this product! 💖 I was looking for a product that worked just as well as a waxing, and This pulled out hair I didn&#x27;t know I had.  Just like most of the other reviews,  I too found this painful to use the 1st time.  But with weekly maintenance, I only get the occasional &amp;#34;pinch&amp;#34; of a pulled hair. Plus it saves me $10/month because I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> if you have a lot of hair on your face it will not work- i got it for my chin and it did not remove alot of the hair off my chin- very expensive!!!!</li>
            <li> Painful but effective. This is difficult to get used to but it does work as promised. Just wish it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I had no faith that this would work but decided to try it anyway because of all the positive reviews I had read.  Amazingly, it works.  It really does and I LOVE IT!  Yes, it pulls a bit, but no big deal.  I&#x27;d rather have a little pull than facial hair.  Waxing hurts and makes a mess.  There is no mess and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I recommend it to anyone who has a problem with facial hair and wants to get rid of it.  Oh, the other nice thing is you don&#x27;t have to wait until the hair gets a certain length before it will work like many of the items I have tried in the past, including waxing.</li>
            <li> I was a my wits end! Plucking just wasn&#x27;t doing it and waxing hurt! I got the Bellabe and started removing hair... you have to get use to the turning motion while rolling (but women are multi-taskers). So easy now, 3 days later with no hair on my upper lip, chin, cheeks - anywhere! Love it! too bad I waited so long. Better late than hairy.</li>
            <li> This took all of three seconds to figure out....and I LOVE it! It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal. Not to mention that it is so convenient just to travel with or to just leave in your makeup bag. I ordered a cheap on first, but then realized that I wouldn&#x27;t get it for a few weeks and I wanted it now. So, I ordered this one because it would arrive in two days. I am excited to get the less expensive one too, because the reviews were also really great! I feel like I really just won the lottery here!his took all of three seconds to figure out....and I LOVE it! It works really well, and it is sooo cheap compared to waxing or hair removal.

            <li> I was very skeptical, but this actually works great!  I need to use it at night, because it sometimes makes my face a little irritated, red for 30 minutes max, but I use it once/twice a week before going to bed and have eliminated all of my peach fuzz that only I noticed, but it was bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> I felt this did not work as I wanted. It really hurts when using it, and does not take off enough hair. Bummer :(</li>
            <li> My wife and I like it. Nothing bad to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with those small stubborn hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Came very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> The photo leads you to believe you are getting more than one facial hair remover, however, for the price, you receive only one.  You do not get to pick your color.  Product works effectively thus far.  Much better than tweezing.</li>
            <li> This product did not work very well for me. The coil did not  grip facial hair tightly enough to effect consistent removal on the facial areas that needed it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have fine hair and it didn&#x27;t really pull the hair from the root but cut it off.  You have to go over it several times to get it removed.</li>
            <li> It might work for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  More&#x27;s the pity.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Love it</li>
            <li> I, like some of the other reviewers, have PCOS.  I have suffered with excess facial hair and hair removal for too many years to count. I have resigned myself to threading for several years now, but although it works well, I hate the in between, waiting for the next session, having to tweeze.  I am DONE with that now, thanks to the Bellabe.  I absolutely love it.  I have had no problem with irritation (redhead, sensitive skin) and it is so nice to be able to use it whenever I want.....plus it works GREAT.  I had no problem getting the hang of it, and unlike a lot of reviewers, it seems to work well on fine and coarse hair for me.  Do not hesitate to try this product, it&#x27;s cheap and it works!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Works great!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I don&#x27;t mind the clear barely there hairs that come in; they&#x27;re natural. However, sometimes they&#x27;ll come in darker than I&#x27;m comfortable with and I&#x27;m self conscious about it. What woman wouldn&#x27;t be?! I used to spend a long time sitting at my dressing table tweezing away and it was tiring. With Bellabe, it takes only a few minutes before bed and I&#x27;m done. Any redness goes away while I sleep and the rest of the world would never even know I had unwanted facial hair at all. It hurts a bit at first, but you&#x27;ll get used to it. It&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Bellabe from Amazon.com, prime shipping (yay, I love that) because I am a \\&quot;woman of a certain age\\&quot; with UBER sensitive skin who has never fared well with professional waxing.  I lose actual skin with waxing and though they charge me for that, I feel that my pound of flesh should have been enough payment.  I don&#x27;t use depilatory creams because,... refer to the sensitive skin issue... pretty sure it would exfoliate down to the bone. Spent money on Epilady for my legs years ago and actually preferred natural childbirth... at home... to this device. Figuring they can send people into space with MRE&#x27;s and a suction toilet, they should be able to make a tool to remove unwanted facial hair from the faces of \\&quot;women of a certain age.\\&quot;  Enter Bellabe Facial Hair Remover!  I read the reviews, all 970 of them, thereabouts, and heeded the advice given about the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; and the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; and the \\&quot;PAIN\\&quot; and I am here to tell you that this is NOTHING compared to the Epilady, this is FAR easier than that moment that you wait for the muslin wax strips to be ripped off your face and little blood spots to appear, and this is INFINATELY easier than natural childbirth. Put it in perspective folks.  Once you get the \\&quot;hang\\&quot; of twirling the handles in your little fingers to produce the torqueing action of the spring enough to actually pull hairs, it&#x27;s a breeze.  For the \\&quot;tougher hairs\\&quot; don&#x27;t curve the spring so much, level it out a little, twirl, then bend.  Might take a few tries, or just resort to the Medieval tweezer method for the die hard hairs.  My only words of caution would be... do NOT use this on eyebrows.  Possibly safe on the center bridge of the nose between the eyebrows but for God&#x27;s sake woman, keep that thing away from the actual eyebrows and eyelashes.  Also, those little frizzy sideburn hairs... clip those back or you will be sorry.  You do NOT want to be the woman in urgent care who is referred to as \\&quot;Need spring removal from eyelashes STAT!\\&quot; I love this little tool and just saying that makes my husband jealous.  Now for my face care facts.  I thoroughly cleanse my sensitive skin with either the Simple facial cleansing wipes or Dove Unscented soap and water, being careful not to scrub too vigorously.  I make sure my skin is dry, paper towels work well.  I pull out the Bellabe and go to work in the mirror... with my reading glasses on naturally.  I know you are currently picturing Mrs. Doubtfire, I assure you I am far hotter than she.  Upon my first use, I did only my lip, at night, before going to bed.  I needed the \\&quot;beauty sleep\\&quot; to recover as I had no idea what the result would be as I could, in fact, wake up looking like Mrs. Doubtfire.  After using the tool, I soaked a cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide, probably the cheapest anti-infective on the market, and cleansed my upper lip with that thoroughly.  Then I put a small dab of antibiotic ointment on the area... and went to bed.  In the morning I couldn&#x27;t tell anything had been done to my upper lip.  That night, I continued with the chin and some fine downey hair on the lower jaw area.  Same cleansing routine before and after, and same result. The tool comes with cleaning instructions.  My tips are:  Get a clean, unused toothbrush.  Take one end of the Bellabe between your teeth and pull the Bellabe slightly with the other hand to stretch it out only slightly.  With the remaining hand, take the clean toothbrush and brush the spring out on all sides.  Clean the toothbrush with alcohol or whatever, and allow to dry for the next cleaning. I know this all sounds like the most time consuming, ridiculous routine ever, but it&#x27;s not.  It takes minutes, literally, and it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than the Bellabe.  I spared my skin from wax and burning, I spared my wallet from insane charges, and my UBER sensitive skin thanks me for it.  I am close to 50, blonde/gray, mild to moderate facial hair depending on which strength magnification you use, I have incredibly sensitive skin, and I am thrilled with this product.  Worth the $14 and then some, even if I have to replace it in 6-9 months.</li>
            <li> I am SO EXCITED about this product!  It really WORKS!  It hurt (my upper lip) like heck the first time, but no more mustache!  No more chin hairs!  No chemicals and it&#x27;s cheaper than electrolysis.  So easy to use.  So worth the $$$.  I am hooked for life.  :-)</li>
            <li> the directions are self explanatory, but i didnt find it worked for me. it only pulled my skin but not the hair</li>
            <li> Repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This is so painful! Worse than waxing because it&#x27;s slower and pulls one by one. It&#x27;s not so bad on the sides face but above the lip is brutal. Can&#x27;t bring myself to use it I my trouble spots.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is difficult to use.  I had read reviews and they said once you get the hang of it, it was easy.  I still have not had a lot of success with it.</li>
            <li> Received it today. Works GREAT! Easy to use. I was a little worried about how much it would actually hurt after reading previous reviews but in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some people described. At most, it stings a little when the hair gets pulled out. I guess it does depend on each person though. If you&#x27;re used to getting threaded, plucking or waxed, this product shouldn&#x27;t faze you.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip, chin and random hairs on my face. I was amazed on how well it worked! It even took out the little hairs. This thing is definitely going to save me money since I&#x27;ll only have to get my eyebrows threaded. I&#x27;m glad I ended up randomly finding this product because it is totally worth the money &amp; it doesn&#x27;t use chemicals. (I was originally searching for facial hair removing cream, plucking takes foreverrrr &amp; I hate using that at-home facial wax crap).&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought it, I went on YouTube to see how it works. There&#x27;s a few ladies on there who can show you how to use it before you buy it :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, takes some getting use to, &amp; have found plucking wit tweezers , nor as good as the small battery operated lady&#x27;s shaver I have, which which neither get smooth as using tweezers..tricky to use also, when rub back &amp; forth with it in a circle, it grabs the hair, the you pull remover out swiftly &amp; it pull hair out, but still leaves a little stub</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GOOD AND DOES TAKE ALL HAIR AWAY FROM THE ROOT, BUT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME. ITS BETTER TO USE ONLY TO TOUCH UPS AFTER YOU GET A REAL WAXING OR THEADING.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange of my unbiased and honest review.  I didn&#x27;t realize it pull every single facial hair!  Even the smallest and tiniest hair!  It hurts as it pinches the hair out but I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll get use to it over the period.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Well this one is the easiest and fastest way to removed facial hair plus it&#x27;s cheaper and reusable I don&#x27;t need to invest buying wax time to time when I run out and it save me money!</li>
            <li> i hear her crying while taking her mustache off but i guess its worth it.</li>
            <li> It hurts so much! I bought this as an alternative to shaving. I tend to have to shave a couple patches on my chin at least once a week and I was tired of ingrown hairs so I gave this a shot. It takes many passes for me to extract my thick coarse hairs and the pain doesn&#x27;t really seem worth it. I rather wax and pluck the couple stragglers. If you have a high tolerance for sharp pinching pain, then I would recommend this. If not, do yourself a favor and find an alternative. Again, it&#x27;s effective, but takes me multiple passes on the same tender area of skin and I find the pain too much to deal with.</li>
            <li> easy to twist with rough hold...(slick doesn&#x27;t twist properly)</li>
            <li> Who would have thought this little tool would achieve such great results! I am very pleased. Yes it hurts just a little bit, but that lasted for about a minute - if that long, after that it was nothing and I have lots of peach fuzz, tiny fuzz and it worked just fine. It is so easy to use. I will never wax my upper lip or cheeks, chin again. The last time i waxed at a salon it was expensive and so hard on my skin. Truly worth $15.</li>
            <li> Disinfected my skin, and used this, then washed and exfoliated skin after to ensure no breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I still got a lot of breakouts, BUT it&#x27;s probably not be because of this product (.time, and decreased dosage acne meds). This is sort of awkward, it pulls hair downward to remove, rather than upward. If you&#x27;ve waxed, or threaded, you&#x27;ll recall that hair is removed opposite to the hair growth. Its easier to grab the hair and remove it opposite to the growth versus toward. This ended up breaking a lot of hair rather than pulling from the roots, and it had trouble getting hold of the hair, too. So I had to keep doing the same area over and over and over (it covers a very small area) which is a little frustrating. I had to wait till the hair grew back and tweeze it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying this a few more times. Hopefully it&#x27;s lackluster performance was due to user error and will improve as I learn to wield it better.</li>
            <li> I love it! So, I took a risk with purchasing this item but it turned to be a risk that was very well worth it. I had never heard of something like this, I was looking for something to help me thread my facial hair and I came across this. I was curious to know what it was since most of the reviews were good, I watched videos on how to use it and most of them Said it was a little painful so I was skeptical about it. I went ahead and purchased it and it&#x27;s amazing. Its not big, which makes it easy to carry with you and its also easy to use. It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as I thought it would, it was just a quick little pinch and even then it didn&#x27;t hurt that bad. I would definately recommend this product to any girl who wants to get rid of their facial hair. It&#x27;s inexpensive, quick, easy to use, removes hair from root and it&#x27;s small. Thank you bellabe!!! Finally something that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have always had a lot of chin, upper lip hair, genetics.  To the day she died, my mother would tweeze 20 hairs a day to try to keep the growth down.  I&#x27;ve tweezed, used facial epiladors, shaved, had professional treatments, use a myriad of delipatory type products--I&#x27;m sure there is more that I&#x27;ve tried.  This is basically a manual epilador.  If you don&#x27;t like electric/battery operated epiladors, you won&#x27;t like this.  It has an ouch to it, especially on the upper lip, when starting out.  When I first got it I did a section at time, always applying witch hazel afterward.  I think it took 3 days to get all areas done.  Now every morning I do a section in rotation so that it takes maybe 30 seconds a day and I don&#x27;t have a hair problem.  For me, this is the best solution I have found to my facial hair, it does a much better job that the electric epilador, gets all the fine hair and that one stray hair.  It takes some practice to learn how to position the wire to get to certain places.  I&#x27;ve never had ingrown hair, rash or problem.  It&#x27;s a keeper for me, and its a fraction of what I have spent over the years on hair facial removal products.</li>
            <li> Picture seems to indicate multiple objects in a variety of colours. Actual product was a single in black. Not really as advertised. However, it is effective.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! I don&#x27;t know how anyone came up with it but they certainly deserve an award.  I will never be without one and have already given it as a gift.  Thank you to some brilliant person.</li>
            <li> Could not get this to work at all!</li>
            <li> I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and I get lots of facial hair due to my hormones being unbalanced. I was so tired of getting waxed and threaded this is so good for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> My dog ate my first one. Love this thing! Product came fast in mail.  My facial hair thanks you !</li>
            <li> Used it on upper lip, lower lip, and chin. I am &#x27;hairy&#x27; and have been using tweezers for the past decade and a half... needless to say, it&#x27;s annoying. This thing took care of even the hair I could never quite get with tweezers. It&#x27;s not painful at all (no more than tweezing anyway). Gets rid of all the unwanted hair way faster. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from the trouble of having to pluck out tiny but quite visible hair on their faces every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wouldn&#x27;t use this for eyebrows. the skin around eyes are more sensitive, so it would be better to stick to a nice old pair of tweezers and tackle on hair at a time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Wish I would have had one years ago. Works great and easy to use. Hurts a little a first, but not any worse than plucking. You get used to it fast. I would recommend the Bellabe to anyone.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This method of hair removal is like threading, &amp; HURTS. I no longer use it as it turns my skin BRIGHT red, &amp; is very painful, however, I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Yes, this hurts, especially if you&#x27;re not used to plucking but the time saved is amazing.  It yanks the hairs from the roots (and yes, that is every bit as painful as it sounds) but it WORKS.  The older I get, the harder it is to see those little bad boys and who has the time anyway?  It&#x27;s a bit of a trick learning how to use and angles DO matter.  We women are used to going to painful lengths to be anything other than the hairy mammals we are, however, so as time goes on, you get used to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I enjoy using it?  Oh hell to the no.  Does it get the hairs I can&#x27;t see?  Yes, it most certainly does.  Painful as a mother?  Crikey YES but I&#x27;m still glad I bought it.  The upper lip has got to be the worst area so steel your nerves and just do it.  Laser treatment is even more painful and a heckuva lot more expensive.  $15 for a spring with some plastic bits is a bit pricey, considering the materials, but laser treatment cost me a lot more and it didn&#x27;t deal with the blonde ones.</li>
            <li> i followed the directions but the bellable does not work.</li>
            <li> It hurts, a lot. well at first yes, but i got used to it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;its not that easy to use at first either. this does work but not all the time because it doesnt remove all the hairs that i want removed.</li>
            <li> Works well. Stings a little bit, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> My wife is completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I order thus thinking it would be easy to use, it is not easy and somewhat time consuming. I will not use this again.</li>
            <li> After reading through tons of reviews I decided to purchase, and am glad I did! This little tool does a great job of getting all the light hairs around my chin and that upper lip area. Previously I&#x27;d tried the Nair type creams, only to feel like it was burning off my skin! Also tried the rub and peel type of wax strips, those actually worked well but to remove any sticky residue I had to use a \\&quot;conditioning oil\\&quot; with the product and it always broke me out. A fuzzy upper lip is not cute and neither is one with pimples! This is fast and convenient, it does sting some on the upper lip but you&#x27;re ripping out hairs so it&#x27;s not painless. Not bad though and my skin is never bothered by this. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I used this item mostly for my upper lip and chin...it was amazing. It was a bit tricky to use,but I feel that one must work with this item to get good results. Its less painful than threading which is almost the same thing. I read a lot of reviews that say that they had to go over an area multiple times and i don&#x27;t find that to be a problem. The lady that threads my upper lip DOES THE SAME thing! the pain was not a real issue. I hope to continue using this item for the rest of my hair growing life!</li>
            <li> I thought this was easy to use and I was happy at first. But the next day was a different story: It made my face brake out in bumps and left my face red for two days after. I will not use it a second time. Threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Works great once you get the hang of it which only took me a few minutes. I love how it removed all of my peach fuzz and let my skin feeling smooth. This product honestly cut my facial plucking time in half I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to try this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of price and I got what I paid for.  It works but it would forever to do brow, lip and chin area.  It will go in my yard sale tote.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of this, I really like it. It does take out the fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to grab the more course hair, but it could be me still getting accustomed to using it. It does take a little bit of getting used to how to roll it. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I didn&#x27;t have high hopes when I ordered this. I have done the bleach, wax, nair. And I was getting tired of all that. I&#x27;m not gonna go to a salon to wax my upper lip and then walk out with a red lip. It has been an embarrassing issue since I was in high school. I felt that when I bleached it helped for the nair but then it was like a 2 step process spread over a few days. I&#x27;m too busy for that. And I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on laser removal and it not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read the reviews, some say it works, some say it doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle. I got this in the mail today and of course I was excited to see if it worked but not looking forward to the pain.  I cleaned my skin, used ice cubes to numb a little and at first I didn&#x27;t feel a thing and I was super excited it didn&#x27;t hurt, well that was till I started actually doing it right and it sure did make my eyes water using it in a sensitive area but it ACTUALLY WORKS. It was about the length that is wasn&#x27;t long enough to wax but enough for me to feel uncomfortable. A lot of people said not to do it all at once cause your skin will be red and irritated. But I was so excited that something was happening I iced and powered thru. I have to say I will never wax or bleach or use that stinky nair again. I am beyond happy with the results. And it really only took me 5 mins if even that. Which for me works with 2 energetic busy little ones. For $15 bucks, you can&#x27;t loose. Think of all the money you spend on nair, bleach, and waxing. No more max burns or anything.</li>
            <li> But this thing works awesome!  It even got the little peach fuzz from my upper lip.  No more mustache problems.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been reading reviews to see what others have to say.  I bought this a few years ago after seeing it on Rachel Ray.  It does work.  I use it mostly for the upper lip area.  Yes it smarts at first, but you get used to it.  After using it, I put a little antibiotic cream (like neosporin) on the area.  This keeps me from breaking out, plain and simple.  I recently started using it on the \\&quot;sideburn\\&quot; area.  That was a little trickier to learn which way to hold it and which way to \\&quot;twirl\\&quot; it to grab the hair.  With a little trial and error you get the hang of it.  Now I use it about once or twice a month.  I don&#x27;t think I have any less re-growth, but it is no problem as this gets rid of it.  And the price is definitely right.  I use some alcohol on a cotton ball to wipe it down after and it&#x27;s good to go for the next time.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this Bellabe Facial Hair remover a year ago and am still using it.  It hurts EVERY time you use it and it does leave your skin a little red.  Also the other reviews say that the hair didn&#x27;t grow back.......that&#x27;s a bunch of bull because in a week, I have to remove the hair again. I still have to use tweezers also.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I no longer have to pay for expensive lip and chin waxing. It is easy to use, although there is a learning curve. Yes, it does pull the hairs out but so does waxing or tweezing and I don&#x27;t find it anymore painful than either of those options. It has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical purchasing this product but at 50+ years of age I was tired of tweezing upper lip hairs.  Yes, you will feel a pinch but it is much faster than tweezing and a lot cheaper than laser hair removal.  Works really well.</li>
            <li> This product didnt work for me. Very painful, removed little to no hair, and left skin red and flaky. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Ok, it hurts...but what do you expect, you are pulling those hairs out.  After a certain age, facial hair happens.  This is the best I have found yet.  Bought a second one for my sister (she asked, it was not a hint).</li>
            <li> Did not work well at all to remove facial hair.</li>
            <li> This thing works really well. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Order came fast.  This product works and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> NOt good on short hairs.</li>
            <li> Works well on upper lip and chin area. Removes even the shortest hair that wax can not grab. Other areas on face are hard to grab and take a long time. However, it is more painful and takes longer than waxing.  I use it for my upper lip and never went back to waxing because I like the convenience of not using wax.  If you like this product I recommend an emjoi epilator for large areas on your face and body.</li>
            <li> I love this roller, it captures all of the hair in it&#x27;s way and snatches it out from the root. It eveng grabs short hair once you really get the hang of how to use.</li>
            <li> I guess my one reason for not giving it 5 stars is more an issue with how I thought it would come. I thought for some reason it was a set of two.&lt;br /&gt;It does work however for the intended use.&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt at first too.&lt;br /&gt;It is something that you have to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;A bit easier than plucking but sometimes it does not catch all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I tweeze pretty often, but it can be time consuming and hard to get all of the hair. This product is a great way to speed that up, and you don&#x27;t even really need to park yourself in front of a magnifying mirror forever. I found this easy to figure out how to use. It hurt a bit more on my upper lip than my chin and neck, but I also tweeze that area less. And it&#x27;s not very painful at all -- especially if you tweeze regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this while watching tv. It&#x27;s a great way to multi-task, I guess. I&#x27;d recommend it. There seem to be lower-cost options on Amazon, but I have no qualms with this product or the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It has tamed any facial hair that might have been plaguing me.  My fear is that they will leave the market and I&#x27;ll be back to the one-at-a-time pluck event.  This is an easy tool to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> This product works great but if you are sensitive to pain I would pass.  It does sting especially on the upper lip.  I tend to be someone that isn&#x27;t bothered by the stinging but it might be too much for some people.  It works great but there is a learning curve to it.  The spring has to be twirled a certain way (counter clockwise) to get it to pull the hair out.  I recommend watching a YouTube video of people who use it.</li>
            <li> very painful to use. Was not able to return this product, was not informed of no returns. Bad product!</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product review I&#x27;ve ever done but this simple device works so well I had to do a review.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and it really will remove all the unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> This is junk.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but doesn&#x27;t catch all of the finer hairs.</li>
            <li> virtually no discomfort on facial hairs. did not cause any rash or irritation. Absolutely an A+ device. Everyone should try it.</li>
            <li> The best facial hair remover ever, the hair does not grow back as quick as waxing,and does a fine job on that &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; as well as coarser hair.  What a great product! Certainlly a lot cheaper and less trouble than lazer too.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective and the easiest tool for threading. Once you use it, you&#x27;ll see how easy it is to maneuver for faster threading. I will definitely repurchase because I can never be without it.</li>
            <li> I will not lie.  When I did this above and below the lip, it brought tears to my eyes.  Other areas were fine.  It did seem to work well, so once the forest is cleared and I am only doing maintenance, I hope that it will be much easier.  I will also add that this it not Taylor, it is his mother.</li>
            <li> Works well to get rid of those random hairs. It does hurt!</li>
            <li> I bought this for unwanted facial hair....it works but hurts like bee stings! If you have ever had threading performed it is the same familiar feeling perhaps worse if you are performing on yourself like I have done. I am light/medium skin and was pink after, but when I woke in the morning there was not scarring or pink areas so it does go away. I did have some hair grow back in a week but not all so it is a matter of keeping up...also depends on your hair growth pattern.</li>
            <li> I had struggled with facial hair for a long time...mainly my upper lip. I began to tweeze the hairs I thought were the darkest but I still wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied with this method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always felt self conscious about my facial hair when talking to someone closely. I turned to Amazon to see what kind of a solution I could find. I was close to buying hair removal cream but I had a bad experience in the past and got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the great reviews about Bellabe and decided to give it a try. I tried it out last month when I had a few days off from work. In case anything went wrong I would have time to look semi ok again. I tried it out on a Saturday. Yes, it was painful because it was removing so many hairs at once. Learning how to twist it takes practice but its doable. By far the most painful area was right under the nose. I won&#x27;t lie...I had tears streaming down my face because of the hairs being removed there. After I finished, my upper lip was a little irritated and red and I thought it was a normal reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day on Sunday I had a small pimple appear on my upper lip. Then on Monday I had another pimple show up. I sort of panicked because I thought I had an allergic reaction but the 2 pimples appeared right under my nose area which is the most sensitive. By Wednesday my pimples had cleared up.  I emailed Bellabe customer service about my the pimples. They quickly replied and suggested I use witch hazel before and after using Bellabe. It was also suggested that I clean the Bellabe each time with rubbing alcohol. Other than the pimples I was satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it again with the advice I was given and haven&#x27;t had any pimples or issues again. After using it continually it gets easier and less painful. The first time is definitely the toughest because so many hairs are removed at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and then I need to use my tweezers to remove a couple of hairs that I wasn&#x27;t able to getwith the Bellabe. I&#x27;m still working on improving the twisting method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this little gadget. It works great. It&#x27;s easy to use, affordable and you can do it in the privacy of your home. I only use it once a week and I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs that grow out seem lighter and they all don&#x27;t grow out at the same time. I worried about the hair regrowth because I didn&#x27;t want it to be so obvious but it really isn&#x27;t. I am satisfied with the product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a thrill for me to find this effective little tool that doesn&#x27;t leave a rash, smell, stubble or any other bad effect I have suffered in the past.  It took a few tries to get the hang of operating it (a simple twist of the wrist) but now I love having it. It does yank hair out, but that no longer bothers me because it works so well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with very high hopes that it would end my facial hair problems.  I have a lot of facial hair on my upper lip, chin, neck, and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the good.  The product does work.  It does indeed take the hair off.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you only have a small amount of hair to remove, get this.  It will work.  But if you have a lot like me, it will take FOREVER.  I had to do a small section over the course of several days.  You have to go over each section several times to get it all off.  And the chin/neck area is tough to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can tolerate pain well, get this.  It does hurt.  It isn&#x27;t excruciating pain, but it hurts.  Some areas hurt more than others.  The upper lip was awfully painful, but the chin was barely painful.  I could deal with the pain and I&#x27;m a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, get this.  If you do, avoid it.  I took all precautions to avoid a breakout, but unfortunately, I suffered a pretty bad breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in conclusion, it works well for some, but not for others.  Guess I&#x27;m going back to my smelly, messy creams.  Maybe someday a product will be made for someone like me!</li>
            <li> Everytime I used this product, within a few days I would get super deep and painful ingrown hairs (or something) along my face. I exfoliated, washed, toned, did nothing, sanitized the tool, never mattered. It always made me break out, so as excited as I was to try it, fail. I&#x27;d rather have the fuzzy hairs, instead of having pizza chin/neck/face. Bleh.</li>
            <li> I was paying $40 per week for a 15 minute electrolysis treatment. This may not be completely perfect, but it does a great job for the price. I have tried many things, professional waxing, over the counter waxing, bleaching. But this is the best I have used so far. It is important to clean it after every use and not let the metal part get wet, I think mine may be tarnishing a bit. I use it almost everyday. I am not completely hair free, but much better than in the past. I&#x27;m sure laser hair removal or maybe something like the no no may do a better job. But, for the price, this is good.</li>
            <li> I rated the Bellabe 4 stars for only one reason, and that is that the solution isn&#x27;t permanent, like perhaps laser treatments claim to be, and because there is a bit of discomfort at first. But the discomfort is minor and the results great. I read all the reviews, and I have found that it gets all the hairs out, even the thick ones, but there is a learning curve to using it. So the quick rundown is:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not expensive like waxing, but the hairs stay gone about the same amount of time&lt;br /&gt;2. Depilatory creams don&#x27;t work at all, and they stink and sometimes burn your skin&lt;br /&gt;3. I burnt myself trying to do wax myself, hence the wax had to be done at $15. a pop by my beautician&lt;br /&gt;4. I couldn&#x27;t get a grip or make myself pull hairs (especially under my nose) with tweezers&lt;br /&gt;5. After constant use of Bellabe I noticed my hair stopped growing back out as much and it&#x27;s not painful to use&lt;br /&gt;6. When you first try it and it grabs a bunch of your hairs, you feel shocked, but it&#x27;s too late LOL&lt;br /&gt;7. So take your lip in three stages (right side, left side, middle) and persevere practicing your technique of how fast you want to roll it, and soon you will have smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;8. all the reviews about the no-no laser thing says it doesn&#x27;t work and it burns. I use Epilady on my legs, and this is the same only not electric. Whoever thought of this simple device , Thank YOU</li>
            <li> I used to bleach facial hair, but didn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;blond&amp;#34; look. Don&#x27;t care for the cream hair removers, so I just stuck with the bleach anyway. This product works really well, and handles exactly what I wanted to handle. It&#x27;s easy to use, not messy, quick and easy. Stings a bit, but that&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as promised. Waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it. I have had high hope for this because I didn&#x27;t want to use chemicals on my face but it was a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive fair skin, which makes hair removal very difficult. I have significant light blonde peach fuzz on my upper lip, which has always bothered me, but waxing causes breakouts for me, and all attempts at hair removal on my upper lip have been very unsuccessful. While this isn&#x27;t the worst problem, but when people get up close to me I always think in the back of my head that they can see my light mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this product when I was looking into more permanent hair removal. IT REALLY WORKS! I tested a small patch of hair in the evening, and found no skin issues the following day so I went ahead and finished the job. I won&#x27;t lie to you, it does hurt, it essentially feels like tweezing, except you can get quite a few hairs in every go. It takes a little time to get used to, but once you figure it out it isn&#x27;t so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the ladies out there with sensitive skin and annoying peach fuzz, you&#x27;ve got to give this a try!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when looking for a safer facial hair remover, especially with this one because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work. It works very well, I was definitely surprised! I love it!</li>
            <li> works amazingly for me. I cannot believe I spend $30/wk for facial hair removal previous to finding this product! i recommended to a couple other ladies and they love it too. soo easy to use and minimal pain!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that this particular aspect of life is not pleasant, no matter what one uses. I&#x27;ve been using the sugar waxers for my upper lip - have to be heated, applied to the correct thickness, sticky, time consuming and sometimes has to be repeated because there are too many strays. Rinsing, washing cloth strips, on and on; it&#x27;s tedious and a pain. This little device works. Does it hurt - a little bit more than a little, but you quickly get used to it and then it really isn&#x27;t bad. The best thing is that you can do it any time without all the fuss and mess of other methods. Also, you don&#x27;t have to wait for the hair to grow long enough like you do for waxing. I sit at the computer or watch TV for distraction.</li>
            <li> WOW I hardly ever need to use a tweezers  just use this a couple of times a week and your facial hair is gone. 1st couple of time it will hurt but after that it barely stings  Worth buying</li>
            <li> Two children ago, I didn&#x27;t have the kind of luxurious facial growth that would require such a tool, but now I find myself in need. I&#x27;m a tweeze-it kind of gal, but some angles I just couldn&#x27;t reach, and I was tired of breaking hairs and the resulting facial eruptions.&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on this (I&#x27;m willing to spend about $20 to try stuff out) and it worked great, right out of the box. I read the directions, watched the video and went to town. Perfect, perfect in every way. I took a previous reviewer&#x27;s advice and cleansed with witch hazel afterwards - so today, no lumps, bumps or rashes. I&#x27;m skeptical that hair will grow in finer, but we&#x27;ll see. The trick is to keep rolling gently over little spots to make sure you get it all. There may be one or two that don&#x27;t get picked up - either use the tweezers or just keep rolling it, you&#x27;ll get them eventually.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m really happy with this, it did a good job (sensitive skin), and it was easy to use. Go easy the first pass, particularly if you have long hairs on your jaw line. Also, doing my upper lip hurt like a motha@#$ -- you&#x27;ve been warned - it&#x27;s possible, just painful. My self-confidence went up a bunch after using it, and so should yours.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me, it put bumps on my skin, after the first try, so I discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> This is a spring with little tabs on the end - it works don&#x27;t get me wrong but I can get a spring from a hardware store for 99 cents and do the same thing!</li>
            <li> Hurts a little, but definitely removes hair when used correctly.</li>
            <li> It works!  I was skeptical of such a product until recently when someone else had one, then I decided to try one for myself.  It is working for me!</li>
            <li> Ladies this is a must have, it removes those little pesky facial hairs like no ones business. I just received mine and went right to work with it on my little mustache, lol. Seriously, it is now nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> This really works! Hair stays gone for weeks... stings a bit at first but its not that bad and it&#x27;s well worth the results!!</li>
            <li> Useless, money wasted</li>
            <li> So painful can&#x27;t use.  Do not get this  unless you love pain.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars for ease of use, but should have listened to other reviewers that said it caused ingrown hairs.  I have coarse dark hair and have tried just about everything on the market (with the exception of laser) without results that I have ever been happy with.  Watched this reviewed for a few years on a popular shopping channel and they said it would work on coarse dark hair....well it was my experience that the hairs would have to be longer if it was coarse....and I am not going to wait that long to let my facial hair grow!  lol.  It did pull out hair that wasn&#x27;t as coarse, but it was in those areas that ingrown hairs occured....it took two weeks for it to clear completely up.  Grrrr.  Back to the drawing board in search of something that really works for those of us that aren&#x27;t fair haired.  In the meantime....it&#x27;s a good thing someone invented tweezers.  Unfortunately, this was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> This is a little hard to use until you get the feel of how to roll it.  The product does work and needs to be repeated every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with the unwanted facial hair for years. The creams were too harsh on my skin, and I had red blotches (so I stayed away from them). Waxing worked-but also left some red. Although the waxing worked on my upper lip (which now doesn&#x27;t grow in as heavy as my chin/neck area), my chin hair kept coming back. Tweezing temporarily worked. The Nono is extremely out of my budget, so I was looking for something within my budget. I read the reviews on this product-so I decided to take a chance. To my surprise, it does work! There is a slight stinging sensation, and I had to tweeze the smaller hairs (which there weren&#x27;t that many), but it works overall! It does hurt more on the upper lip-so I do suggest trying the chin area first. (Perhaps it isn&#x27;t as bad once it&#x27;s used more often). I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t have any redness afterwards! It&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> It is very painful to use and easy to miss spots.</li>
            <li> Definitely removed the hair as it was supposed to; however, prepare yourself for the pain the first time you use it. After that, you know what to expect and there isn&#x27;t as much hair to be removed so don&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> Holy crap! This thing hurts!!! Maybe I have a low pain threshold. This thing will pluck out every little hair though if you can withstand the pain. It even goes down to the little peach fuzz. It was just way to painful for me.</li>
            <li> fabulous, quick and clean alternative to wax.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that more people don&#x27;t use this tool. It&#x27;s like a magic tweezer/epilator. Olay facial hair remover burnt my face despite using the balm etc and it doesn&#x27;t really do the job. This little springy thingamajig however....rocks! It is painless, fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!  easy to use and gets the job done.  Yes, it hurts a little, but better than tweezing and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like waxing does.  Try it!</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how to actually move it but once you get the hang of it it works. Hopefully with more practice I can get the more stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my upper lip broke out.. BAD. I used this a couple of days before a trip to visit my boyfriends family, and on the day that we left, I woke up with a few little pimples in the area. I thought it was pretty inconvenient, but not a big deal. Then within the next 3 days, a *few* pimples turned into around 10. I felt (and looked) disgusting. It looked as if I had a rash or something, which is WAY worse than a few hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> worked better than expected</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and bought it based on it&#x27;s high reviews.  It is fairly easy to use and only stings for a second after hairs are removed.  Great price and convenient.</li>
            <li> Best facial hair product remover. It&#x27;s easy and compact. As the hair grows back, it is thinner and light. I use to go for waxing and or threading. This product does the job, saves me money and time.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and have had to deal with &#x27;hair issues&#x27; of all sorts for over 20 years.  I&#x27;ve waxed. Lasered.  Plucked.  Shaved. But there are always hairs that refuse to just go away.  Well let me tell you, this innocent looking little &#x27;spring&#x27; get them all. Now, I am not going to lie or soften this - it HURTS.  A lot.  You do get used to it after a little bit, and, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I love the instant gratification of seeing all the hairs that have been removed with each pass. it makes the momentary torture worth while.  I am sure this isn&#x27;t for everyone, but if you can muscle through the initial pain, the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a great surprise.  I have been using it every few days and I have been facial hair free for a couple of weeks.  I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> While not easy to use, I was pleasantly surprised to find it works and the price is good.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to this, it is easy to use! Took me only two trys to figure it out correctly. It does hurt at first, then it stings a bit and that&#x27;s about it. Really gets rid of the hairs. It&#x27;s a lot quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve used so far. Great product! I&#x27;m glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Not painless...but works!</li>
            <li> It works but need to practice to get it right. It is nice though saves u from paying 20$ at a salon</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, as it seemed so much more convenient and cheaper than buying those little waxing kits or going to have threading done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this thing HURTS!!! I&#x27;ve done waxing/threading for years now and couldn&#x27;t even use this for more than a couple &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; before my eyes started watering and I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to waxing kits for me!</li>
            <li> Count me another happy user.  This is an ingenious little device.  I was more concerned about the stray dark chin hairs that my husband (affectionately?) dubbed  my \\&quot;wiry hag-hairs\\&quot; than I was about the finer, light vellus hairs; I was also getting mightily tired of the never-ending search-and-destroy mission to rid the upper lip of unwanted hair.  (Such are the indignities of post-menopausal life.)  Tired of waxing, tired of the daily tweezer runs.      This device yanks out all the hairs, dark ones and vellus hairs, with less violence than the word \\&quot;yank\\&quot; might suggest.  I like that vellus hairs are gone, too; it gives me a less furry, much smoother look in my magnifying mirror.  I have found that the darker hairs don&#x27;t always come out on the first pass, but eventually the device does grasp them and pull them out.  The results are well worth the slight tingly-stingy sensation.  I suspect that (as the instructions say) in time I will not notice it.      The manufacturer advises (wisely) that you wash the area before and after using the device, and that you end with a toner--presumably to make sure the pores and hair follicles are clean.  The instructions also say that the device lasts about 6-9 months, which is not bad for something that costs a lot less than a single salon waxing.</li>
            <li> My friends are making fun of me, I&#x27;m so addicted to this!  Finally, an easy way to keep up with the hereditary facial hair I was &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with.  Tired of paying for waxing and threading!  This is a godsend!!</li>
            <li> If you have poor eyesight, this thing removes hair. Mostly seems to grab the peach fuzz. Left my skin irritated and inflamed. which wasn&#x27;t worth the results of coarse hairs being left behind.</li>
            <li> It did work after it took sometime learning how to properly use it. What I didnt like was the fact that I broke out in some sort of rash after. I&#x27;m assuming it was because of the metal rolling up and down my skin. I only used once before trashing it.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but it sure isn&#x27;t a comfortable procedure.  What we women go through to be gorgeous!  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It gets some hairs off, but definitely not everything. There are some parts that it can&#x27;t get and it does kind of hurt. The whole time I use it, I think &amp;#34;Beauty is pain, beauty is pain!&amp;#34; but I wish it worked better. -Especially for all that pain!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I am not a waxer or threader. I tweeze my eyebrows and, until recently, used one of those tiny electric trimmers to deal with upper lip hair. But I got tired of the hair growing back so dark and so quickly, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a tube with detailed use and care instructions (you don&#x27;t get to choose the color). The instructions warn that you may feel a slight &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when the hair is removed. HA! It is not a tingle, my friends. It is pain. Not like waxing, since the hairs are pulled out not all at once: it feels rather like tweezing a bunch of hairs rapid-fire. The first couple of times I did it, my skin was left red and a developed a couple small zits. However, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, and it is getting easier. It&#x27;s still a little painful, but not as bad as before. Also, it delivers - the hair is gone, and the skin is smooth. I advise using it after the shower since your pores are open and your face is clean. I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good. Totally does the job, is inexpensive and small enough to stick in your purse or toiletry bag for travel. I use it on my upper lip, below my lip, chin, forehead, and even below my eyes toward my temples. Not for use around your eyebrows, though... it&#x27;s not for shaping. It&#x27;s a bit painful just beneath the nose area, but a few quick passes and it&#x27;s over. So worth it for removing unwanted facial hair. Get it!</li>
            <li> I like the Bellabe so much better than waxing!  It&#x27;s a one time investment and you can use it as often as you would like.  The Bellabe is easy to clean and makes no messes.</li>
            <li> I rarely take time to write reviews but I had to! This product is so awesome. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but it really works! It is good I found a demo video on youtube though...lol..I used it wrongly the first time. I went in a downward direction but you are supposed to go upwards! My skin honestly feels softer and smoother and no more peach fuzz or hairs...works great on upper lip, chin, cheeks. What a great invention! Wasted money over the years with waxing which would turn my skin red and not be much fun. WIsh I knew about this years ago. Although I don&#x27;t know how long its been around!</li>
            <li> This product is a little difficult to use at first. After perseverance and reading the instructions again, I found it remarkably effective. Remember to twist the ends near the hairs. It appears to grip even fine hairs on the skin and extracts them without pain.</li>
            <li> OK it does what it proclaims !! It totally removes unwanted hair but, it really hurts.  I have even used it for 3 weeks straight and although it hurts less with frequent use, well... I cringe when I think about using it.  It really stings !  Again, if you can endure the pain, it does remove the hair.</li>
            <li> Not too sure yet about the product yet. I feel I it gets all the chin hairs but the ones I am trying to remove.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS so I have a decent amount of darker hair on my face that I wanted to get rid of on the chin, upper lip, cheeks, sideburns, and temples. The Bellabe, according to the reviews, looked like it might be the answer to my problems with an easy, at-home care system, but it was not. I&#x27;d rather tweeze my whole face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I took the precautions of washing and exfoliating first, as well as washing the instrument, it was a no-go. I had very little luck grasping the hairs within the coils, no matter which way I manipulated the Bellabe. I&#x27;d manage to get a little patch here, a small patch there, but even after 30 minutes I had not even finished one section of my face! I have to admit that I gave up for the night. It&#x27;s probably good that I did, so that the fallout wasn&#x27;t worse than it was...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I woke up with red spots on my face. Those with PCOS know what those are: the hard beginnings of cysts starting under the surface of the skin. Everywhere I had used the Bellabe with success, I had clusters of cysts growing, particularly around my mouth (which is where I am most prone to get them). In total I had grown eight new cysts overnight, as well as a small scattering of whiteheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely not worth it for me! If you have PCOS, are prone to cysts, or have sensitive skin, I greatly caution you against using this product.</li>
            <li> This works really well!  It misses quite a few really short hairs.  But, for the most part, it works much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> I recently started getting hormone replacement therapy and found that it caused me to have fine blond hairs all over my chin and cheeks. I&#x27;m sure they were always there but I never felt them before, not like this. I tried waxing but it hurt, tore off my skin in places and was expensive. I thought about threading but again expensive and you have to go in often to keep up. I&#x27;ve heard Laser hair removal is effective but also very expensive and time consuming. Then along comes this wonderful little tool and after very little pain, effort or time my facial hair is gone. My skin feels smooth and makeup is easier to apply. No more looking like the bearded lady when the light hits my face. I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with unwanted facial hair. It small and fits right in your purse so you can take it when you travel.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Quick and easy!!</li>
            <li> In one word- ouch.  This will remove hair as stated, but I do not find the process particularly pleasant.  For me, it just hurts.  I prefer the wax strips because the overall process is just faster. even though it stings.  also to note, I don&#x27;t think this keeps the hair away any longer than the strips would- at least in my experience with it.  I still on occasion will get this out to use, but it is pretty rare.  This wasn&#x27;t a big expense, so I&#x27;m not upset that I bought it, but it just is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> It works just as it was described- nothing more nothing less. I used it on my upper lip and chin and it did what it was suppose to do- pulled the hairs out. I&#x27;m not sure why some people thought this wouldn&#x27;t hurt any more than regular threading but it does because you are ripping out your hair- duh. It&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling too. I took it on vacation with me for touch ups. No more going to the salon to get this done. I can really quickly touch up at home whenever I want. Worth it if you can tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> Yikes - this was so painful I couldn&#x27;t even bring myself to use it. After just a few hair pulls I decided the beauty wasn&#x27;t worth the pain in this case!</li>
            <li> i really love it!! it does hurt a little bit at first but so does waxing. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Tried this product immediately when I received, which was in a timely manner.  It does smart when you apply it.  But it does the job for a clean finish.  I applied some aloe vera cream afterwards, but the area did not turn red.  So glad I purchased this instead of NoNo</li>
            <li> I love Bellabe!!  Tried it out last week and my face feels so soft.  Grabs those long and short hairs.  Very impressed.  I love it!  only takes one time to see how great of a product this is.  I have very sensitive skin, wax breaks me out, the bleach and lotions really hurt my skin and give me open sores. With Bellabe, my hair is growing back slower and finer.  Bellabe is so easy to use.  Thanks Bellabe for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for such an awesome product! Finally, I found something that actually works, and it&#x27;s made in USA! I&#x27;ve tried waxing, threading, bleaching &amp; even laser! Could never find anything that actually works properly.  Now I feel more confident I can enjoy life more than before. Bellabe has saved me a lot of time &amp; money! Absolutely satisfied with the product. I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long to try it. There&#x27;s a little sting as the hair is being removed, and there&#x27;s a slight learning curve. But once you get the hang of it, ladies, it works!! Be patient and keep trying.  I am definitely going to spread the word to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> This product is super easy to use and I love the results.  It is quick, and I control exactly where I want the hair to come off.  For hair that I haven&#x27;t waxed as much in the past, I get a little bit of the pulling sensation (like tweezing) but in spots that I always target it is virtually painless.  It even worked on my thicker coarser hair, although I did have to manipulate the shape of the want a little tighter.  I tell all my friends how great this is.  What a great deal, I&#x27;ll never bleach or wax at home again.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  I will use one forever.  Thank you for making such a effective and inexpensive facial hair removal product.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe Facial Hair Remover effectively removes facial hair in minutes. There is a minor stinging sensation as the hair is pulled from its roots, but it goes away. Follow the directions and watch the remover leave your face hairless and smooth!</li>
            <li> I used to do threading but cant find a place that does it near me. Waxing and creams really destroy my skin. This is painful at first but gets better as more hairs are lifted. Redness doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as a wax either. Saves me a trip to the salon!</li>
            <li> This works as promised. It does a great job of removing hair, especially on the sides of the lip.  It is quite painful, but I like it better than tweezing.  It takes a lot longer than waxing, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all, which is my biggest problem with waxing.  It&#x27;s difficult to get a lot of smaller hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to latch on to hair in certain spots, but overall works really well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to scream, but it worked really well!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it pulls the hair from the follicle which is essential. This product also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It does not remove the facial hair as advertised I have tried to use it over and over again and it just does not remove the hair Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li> This hurts too much and my skin is too sensitive to use it.  Would have been nice if it would have worked though.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a few years now. I love it because it is really effective. You have to make sure that your skin is clean and moisturized otherwise you may feel some irritation. If you feel irritation stop using it because it can damage your skin. Wait a day and try again. Make sure you use a warm cloth to soften the skin and make the hairs come out. The hairs pull out easier when you do this. Try to go in the direction of the hair growth as much as possible. Make sure to use a little aloe afterward and exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wait as long as possible before using this product on my unwanted hair. That way the hairs will grow out and better hair removal will be achieved. Also, sometimes after using the warm compress on the area of hair to be removed, I splash cold water on my face. This also helps the hairs come out even more. Never exfoliate BEFORE using this product! ALWAYS make sure to cleanse and close the pores after use!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I was fully prepared to hate this product because it just looked too simple to be effective. I was curious, though, and since it was so affordable I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It&#x27;s not perfect, I still had to get out my trusty tweezers to finish things up, but all in all it did a good job. It was fast and easy, and the included instructions were no problem to follow. It will definitely cut down on the time I spend tweezing every day, and is alot gentler on the skin than most of the options out there. Good buy!</li>
            <li> I have had this thing for about 7 weeks and have not been able to pull one hair! I have read these reviews and used the tips I have read. I have twisted and twirlled this way and that..opposite directions...same directions..up..down...Nothing. Occasionally I will feel a little snag but don&#x27;t think it pulled out any hair. I am using on my face and neck by the way.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, it just does not do anything for me. Guess I will have to go back to my Sally Hansen strip wax again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Bellabe on QVC almost 2 years and I absolutely love it!  I have very sensitive skin and cannot get my upper lip waxed because I leave the salon with a red mustache.  Bellabe leaves absolutely no redness.  Yes, it stings the first time I used it, but the more I use it, the less it bothers it me and it certainly doesnt hurt anymore than having wax ripped off your upper lip (along with a layer of skin).  I still get my eyebrows waxed, Bellabe is not a precision tool and should not be used around the eyebrow.  It is for \\&quot;mass plucking\\&quot;.  I also love using it on my cheeks, sideburn area and up into the baby hairs around my forehead, you just need to be careful and go slow there, but the hair ends up growing back so much slower.  I aam definitely not hairy, but this is the perfect tool for me for cleaning up those fine hairs.  trimmers just cut the hair leaving stubble, Bellabe removes from the root leaving your skin soft and smooth.  I will never be without!  The directions recommend replacing Bellabe every 6-9 months depedning on use.  Mine have lasted a long time but I still replace them within 9 months, plus, it&#x27;s always fun to get different colors!  I love My Bellabe!</li>
            <li> Works well for fine hair, not so much for coarse, small hair. It just doesn&#x27;t have the grip for that kind of hair. So it will very effectively remove fine fuzz. But if you&#x27;re trying to remove stubborn, short strands, bring out your tweezers.</li>
            <li> In my experience, this does not work at all. I read some reviews that said that it takes practice, but frankly, I do not have time for that.</li>
            <li> I used to use creams and bleaches, but after a while, my skin got more and more sensitive to using them and I would get skin burns even before the hair is bleached or removed. Then I found the Bellabe!!  I&#x27;ve been using the Bellabe for many years now. I just recently ordered my 5th one. It is very simple to use although at first, it was a little awkward trying to get  both hands to do the twisting motion between my fingers and then making sure that I was continuing to turn the handles when I placed the Bellabe on my face.  But once you get it, it is so easy!! Initially, using it was a little painful, but that means that it is pulling the hair out.  After a while, you don&#x27;t even feel the pain anymore.  However, I found that the area around my mouth is more sensitive.  I used it around my mouth, cheeks and chin and it has pulled out all the fine hairs as well as the occasional thick hairs that sprout up under my chin. I will never go back to using any other hair removal products. Definitely something I would recommend to all my friends who need a hair remover.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad, works really well at hair removal but did cause a break out.</li>
            <li> This product works. Can&#x27;t believe I jus found out about it. I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mother and her sister.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the chin hairs out - probably breaks them off.</li>
            <li> Ok, it is not my favorite tool for hair removal.  It has taken me weeks to get the hang of it and I tend to use it when I have time on my hands, because it takes me longer to use it.  Once you get the motion down, it is very handy and relatively easy to use.  But it took me some time before I was actually seeing hair removed.  Maybe there is a you tube video somewhere that can explain it.  But I am a fan of threading and figured I could use it on my eyebrows as well.  I have not been able to figure that one out.  It works well on those stray hairs on cheeks and upper lips.  Not as well on the chin, where I have the majority of my hair.  Something about the curves don&#x27;t seem to allow me to maneuver as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s good to have in your hair removal arsenal.  But I find I still pull out my tweezers most often.  It is a little painful.  But you are pulling hairs out by the root.  One day I will remember the trick I learned at a spa to put the pain relieving gel (used for toothaches) on the area prior to tweezing or bellabeing.  What I really want is to find a completely fool proof way to not grow facial hair at all.  Plucking and tweezing is working my last nerve!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products that I buy but I think this time is an exception. I want everyone to know that this product really works. You just need to get used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of hair being pulled at first. Regardless, the hair does not grow back right away. With waxing and other hair removal stuff that I&#x27;ve tried before, I would usually have hair growing on my upper lip after about a week of removal. Now that I&#x27;ve used Bellabe, I can&#x27;t even feel any hair growth even after 2 weeks now... Counting the days....&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Bellabe!</li>
            <li> It will work if you are not concerned abt getting all of the hair. I have blonde hair and I am more interested in thinning my mustache as opposed to completely removing it. Waxing breaks me out. The Bellabe does thin it..although it breaks off quite a few hairs as well. It is extremely painful but waxing hurts to. I have actually gone back to just plucking with a wide slant tweezer.</li>
            <li> The best way to get rid of unwanted facial hair at a fraction...price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as a Stocking Stuffer at Christmas gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I hate using it lol, but it&#x27;s amazing.  I only use it for my upper lip and chin, and it&#x27;s like magic and strip every hair off. Ithe also hurts, pulling out hairs you didn&#x27;t know existed. But I love it. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more pulling power when I purchased this. Although I used it in a proper manner, I had to go over the hair quite a few times before it would pull some of them out. Some hairs wouldn&#x27;t pull out at all, maybe it has something to do with how fine my hair is. It&#x27;s useful but not quite as useful as I wish it were. It&#x27;s fairly effective with pulling out the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mother. It does not remove hairs. Maybe if someone has long &amp; fine hair that might work I don&#x27;t know, but otherwise a tweezer is a whole lot better in every way.</li>
            <li> WOW, this works GREAT and FAST!!! Does sting a little, but so does other hair removers, and this has no chemicals 😍</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure after reading the wide range of reviews.  Let&#x27;s face it… this product with either &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; for you, or it won&#x27;t.  But just because it&#x27;s not your cup of tea doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad product.  My evaluation is that if you have waxed your lip/chin area before and survived, then this product is worth a try.  For $15, that&#x27;s less than one waxing plus gratuity (at least where I live…)  The product is super easy to use and it removed all the fine fuzzy hair on my upper lip and chin area quickly and thoroughly.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing, and I would say also less painful than waxing.  I had zero problems with any bumps developing (which I would sometimes get from waxing) and no danger of someone applying wax that is too hot.  I think it&#x27;s best for all the fine little hairs.  If you&#x27;ve got thick rogue hairs to contend with, then tweezers will still be your best bet.  I&#x27;m one satisfied customer and I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and tried this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but docking stars for the pain factor is silly.  The pain is similar to threading, which is what this device is supposed to replicate.</li>
            <li> I am simply amazed with this facial hair remover. It did hurt more the first time I used it, but the pain is getting more tolerable. It certainly isn&#x27;t hurting me as much as waxing has in the past. I must say my skin has not felt this smooth in a very long time. Thank you Bellabe for making this truly amazing product and thank you Amazon for offering it!</li>
            <li> This hair remover definitely removes a fair amount of facial hair, with just a slight amount of discomfort.  I think perhaps most of my facial hair is too fine for the spring to grab it.  The remover is easy to use with just a bit of practice, and possibly does a much better job on hair that is a bit longer or perhaps not so fine.</li>
            <li> This works okay...well worth the price instead of the ridiculously priced NoNO Hair--at a cost of over $250!!! (I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for that gadget!!!)  My only complaint iwith the Bellabe is that it is a bit painful, and leaves skin redness.  Supposedly this goes away after your skin gets used to the process, but I don&#x27;t plan on using it that often.  Worth the try since it&#x27;s not much to buy.</li>
            <li> Such a simple concept, but wow, the results! You can use this without even having to stand in front of a mirror. You can actually *feel* the hairs on your face come plucking out. It&#x27;s really fast but still a little painful. I used to use wax strips but I prefer this a great deal. You can roll this all over your face and pull out hairs you never even knew existed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I bought mine and tried it, I brought it to work for other people to see -- it was a new thing for all of us. My girlfriend decided to buy one too. After she got hers, she demonstrated it for her husband and he was in absolute awe that such a small, simple looking gadget can produce such terrific results. Seriously, just buy one already, it&#x27;s totally worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Using the Bellabe is super easy once you get the hang of it.  First I was just rolling it and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything.  Then I realized I need to twist easy side and all of the sudden I was on a roll, literally!  I pulled out hairs I didn&#x27;t even realize I had there and yes I saw the proof in the Bellabe.  There were little hairs in there when I was done.  Now yes it hurt on sensitive spots like my upper lip but after a few times the pain didn&#x27;t bother me so much. Its just like little pinches as it is ripping your hair from its roots.  On my chin though it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I&#x27;d say it is just as annoying as waxing with how it pulls the hair from its roots but didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all or leave a mark.  When I have waxed in the past I have had a red mark for days showing exactly where I had waxed.  While shaving doesn&#x27;t leave a mark, it also doesn&#x27;t pull the hair from its roots.  I have only used the Bellabe a few times now but it does seem to last longer than traditional hair removal methods I have tried.  Its amazing how something so small can be so effective and useful.  Using the Bellabe though really is easy and I love that it lasts six months to a year!  The size makes it perfect for traveling or even just keeping in your purse.  I actually think I am going to keep it in the car for when I notice a stray hair and am out and about.</li>
            <li> I have been insecure since I was 18 because of my facial hair, I have had years of hair laser sessions w/ some improvement, but not 100% gone. I have waxed, plucked and even shaved my chin hairs for years. Have had the bellabe for a few days and no stubble, no hair at all!! Whole face- smooth!! Pain factor-tolerable everywhere except the upper lip, feels like a slow wax. The shorter the hair, the less pain. I will be ordering a few more to always have!!!</li>
            <li> Takes off a lot of baby fuzz and thin hairs, but you still need tweezers for coarse hair. Not that it won&#x27;t get it off, but you have to struggle with the angle and give it a few tries before it does any thing. I don&#x27;t have patience for that so....pretty much it works if you combine it with other hair removal tactics :/</li>
            <li> This works. Does it hurt? Yup! But it gets the hair out and works very well. I definitely prefer this to waxing or any other hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product works great but...ouch. Now, I was expecting some pain associated with a product that rips the hair out by the root, so I promise I&#x27;m not a complete fool :) Some areas are really not painful at all, but other areas (like the upper lip) are pretty rough. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and voila! A much more pleasant tool to use now. I just put some ice cubes in a plastic bag and apply to the sensitive areas for 10-15 seconds before I remove the hair. It&#x27;s not pain-free, but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> As an Amazon Prime member, I was a little disappointed that this took 4 dyes to get to me, even though the other items I ordered at the same time got to me in the regular 2 day time period. That said, 4 days is still pretty fast. I think I was mostly upset because I was so excited to try the Bellabe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And good news! It did not disappoint! It took me all of one minute to get the hang of using it, and then I was hair removing machine. It really feels like a little tingle as it pulls the hairs out. Not painful at all (and obviously quite satisfying). I was able to remove all my unwanted hair in less than 10 minutes in the comfort of my own home. Every woman should own one of these. Seriously genius product.</li>
            <li> I was paying $30 monthly for full facial threading. Now I pay only $8 for eyebrow threading, thanks to Bellabe Facial Hair Remover. It more than paid for itself on the very first use.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Love it.  Hard to believe how this works.  Very effective and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 5 star rating because I cannot honestly say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; tearing at my face.  Yes, it&#x27;s quite painful.  That&#x27;s actually how you can tell it&#x27;s working, if it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; a bit you&#x27;re not doing it right.  When it feels like it&#x27;s tearing off layers of skin and makes your eyes water, you&#x27;ve got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve long since suffered from blonde peach fuzz pretty much all over my face.  I wax my eyebrows but thats it as I&#x27;m really fair and it&#x27;s sometimes pretty obvious where the wax has been.  I was not too keen on my mustache area showing up as being obviously waxed. Shaving only goes so far and can get stubbly real fast.  I don&#x27;t like the idea of lasering my face and bleaching will do nothing as I&#x27;m already blonde.  Cut to the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover.  I did a fair bit of research and watched the youtube videos before I purchased it.  I chose Bellabe even though there were fair cheaper options because honestly, when it comes to my face, I can spare the few extra dollars to get a product thats on the higher end of the spectrum and won&#x27;t take a month to ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I look forward to using it? Nope.  Does it work?  Yes.  And like others say the more you use it the more you do get used to it.  There&#x27;s still certain areas on my face I will not use it on as it seems especially painful, most notable right underneath my nose and if you get close to the under eye area.  I also definitely recommend watching the youtube videos so you know how to get the technique right.  I would say each time you use it lasts about a week and half before you start noticing hair coming back and you need to talk yourself into doing it again.  I&#x27;m hoping in time it comes back thinner and less often, a hope I will cling to.  It does not make the hair grown back thicker (a myth).  Good luck!</li>
            <li> It better just to wax. This is torturous.</li>
            <li> Hated it. You have to move super slow, it&#x27;s friggin ANNOYING and basically just acts as a rolling tweezer. THAT TAKES FOREVER. May only be ideal for a few hairs, like less than 10. Oy Vey</li>
            <li> This thing really does pull the hair out by the roots! It does hurt though. I don&#x27;t believe I can use it because it hurts worse, to me, than waxing. If you can endure the pain then it&#x27;s worth it to save money. Plus it&#x27;s fairly easy to use. I got my product for free by giving an honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Bellabe a couple of years ago, and I use it frequently.  I have so much more confidence now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works just like it&#x27;s advertised. It&#x27;s very inexpensive, especially compared to other hair removal methods, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it lasts quite a long time. Although they say to replace it every year, I have used mine now for a couple of years, and only recently noticed that I am in need of a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I never have stubble, or irritation with this product, although it does give a slight tingling sensation when using it, it goes away after a minute or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to add that customer service was an absolute pleasure to deal with. I have never had such an awesome experience when dealing with customer service in my life. June treated me with such kindness, I felt like I made a new friend.&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this company.</li>
            <li> I bought this last month and received it as promised. It was so easy to use and removes facial fuzz without a doubt. You can feel the plucking, but not painful except for above the lip. That area is more sensitive for me. But it&#x27;s so much better than getting your face waxed and dealing with breakouts...not to mention the expense. This tool is worth every penny. There are cheaper versions out there, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use just a few easy motions and start taking those hairs out easier and faster than actual plucking one by one. I hate messing with wax and I&#x27;m not into the threading I see them put it in their mouths so I don&#x27;t want anyone&#x27;s spit on my face. The place to put your fingers is in a vibrant color which mine was purple and super cute.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review. And for me I would definitely recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> this does not remove fine fine hair. it only removed coarser hair. It kind of hurt. it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> Okay, Here is a MAJOR  warning for this product and products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off I am an African American woman aged 26, I was 25 when I bought this product, I am a healthy and beautiful woman with great skin (no acne or anything!) when I bought this. And here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally used this product for my upper lip (which I have always had a hair issue for) and my chin (which I NEVER had a hair issue for).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my upper lip this thing worked well, no problems hear came off, great! For my chin however, I began to grow ingrown hairs after the first use. I wish that I could post pictures of it, but several large and irritated bumps grew on the sides of my chin. When the bumps went away I noticed hair growth there that had never been there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES THIS THING MAKE ME GROW A BEARD!  The hairs are not small and light like they once where, they are thick and noticeable and I also have discoloration from where the ingrown hairs where. If I had known that this would have happened to me I would never have bought this product. It made things sooo much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now making plans to get YAG laser hair removal for dark skin due to the side effects from this product. For the upper lip this product worked fine, but for the chin where I had baby hairs, there are now dark thick hairs that grow regularly like a mans beard (not long but still noticeable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product!</li>
            <li> good delivery service, great product</li>
            <li> It takes some getting use to, but this product actually works.  It does sting a little bit, but gets better over time.</li>
            <li> This gadget works! Yes, it stings at first, but the pain only lasts for a second. It works like many tiny tweezers extracting hair all at the same time. I&#x27;m allergic to wax, threading causes my face to swell, and shaving is too harsh and only lasts for a few days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just too painful for me. It would probably be less painful if you could use the device quickly. However I could not.twist the ends quickly enough while moving the device across my cheek to lessen the pain, so each hair was pulled before being tweezed out, which was torture!  I think an epilator would be less painful as the machine tweezers the hair quickly. This manual device makes for a slower, more painful experience.</li>
            <li> I would rather use tweezers. This have my white wads where ever I used it</li>
            <li> I love this spring thing. Whenever my girl-stache starts to grow back, I just take it out, and within minutes it is gone, unlike tweezing which takes FOREVER! It hurst a little bit at first, but you get used to it because it goes so fast you don&#x27;t even notice it!</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little tricky to get used to how this works but IT DOES WORK!  At $15.00 it is well worth the money.  I used it on the upper and lower lip and jaw areas and it removed all the hair. I&#x27;ve done waxing threading and bleaching and this feels like the threading.  I don&#x27;t think I will wax or thread at a salon again!</li>
            <li> i bought this item because i have a hair lip. but when i tried using bellabe facial hair remover.im so.upset.because its painfull and it didn&amp;#34;t work at all</li>
            <li> ***WARNING TERRIBLE ACNE BREAKOUT ALERT*** I used  this on my upper lip and cheeks/chin for the peach fuzz. I am 18 and had never had acne problems in my life. It was pretty painful and I had to pause several instances but I decided the end result would be worth it. Everything was fine and my skin felt smooth. However, two days later I woke up to see my cheeks completely covered in big, red bumps and whiteheads--at least 10-15 whiteheads on each cheek. It has been three days since the acne breakout and I am still struggling to deal with the aftermath (using honey during day and aloe at night). The acne has gone down a bit--but I now have marks and feel incredibly self conscious going anywhere considering my face was impeccable a week ago. Honestly wish I&#x27;d never tried this product, it ruined my face. Also, I am noticing now a lot of the hair was simply cropped, and it feels almost stubbly (even though I made sure to use as instructed). EXTREMELY DISPLEASED with the product, please be careful if you decide to use and try a small patch first. Wait at least two days before doing more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted something that removed more than just upper-lip hair.&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t have noticeable facial hair, I do have dry skin, so I feel like make-up &#x27;sits&#x27; wrong on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t seem reasonable to have my entire face waxed for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this device really does work in removing the majority of those little fuzzies, however&lt;br /&gt;it really does hurt.  I was all freaked out to use it a second time, because the first time hurt so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it hurt less: after you&#x27;ve cleaned your face, get an ice cube and put it in a little sandwich baggie.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the outside doesn&#x27;t get wet.  Put the ice cube up against where you are planning to roll the Bellabe, for&lt;br /&gt;about 10 seconds, or until the area is a little numb.  Then roll the Bellabe as usual in that spot.  I found that it&#x27;s a lot less&lt;br /&gt;painful when used that way!</li>
            <li> I have really course hairs on my chin and throat from PCOS. I&#x27;ve tried automated tweezers but they could never grab the hairs. I&#x27;ve tried waxing, but usually end up pulling skin off as well, not to mention it&#x27;s horribly messy. When I friend told me about this, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work, but ordered it anyway because she raved about it. I will warn you, it hurts like hell at first, but the more often you use it, the less hurts. I only have to use it about once a wk to 2 wks and it is able to remove all the thick hairs. Thinner hairs are a bit more tricky, but once you get them at the right angle, it gets those too.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly easy to use and so effective!  Not sure if I can use on my brows, but otherwise, it gets rid of facial hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Hurts too much to use again.</li>
            <li> Works great, but very painful to use!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was as pictured.  It&#x27;s easy to use however it does sting which is to be expected&lt;br /&gt;because it&#x27;s pulling out hairs.  It works well enough on very fine hair but you will still need tweezers for coarser hair.  I would probably buy this type of facial hair remover again if I found one that costs less.</li>
            <li> It takes some doing to get the hang of it, but it does exactly what it claims and very easily. Yes, it stings like crazy but it&#x27;s worth the price and not worrying about running out of a cream or wax remover. When I first used it my upper lip broke out a tiny bit, but nothing horrible and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it since then. I&#x27;m glad I paid what I did instead of going for the cheaper ones; I have a feeling this will last for a few years at least!</li>
            <li> Age and hormones gifted me (thank you so much) with never-before peach fuzz on both cheeks.  It&#x27;s so fine and blonde that it&#x27;s virtually invisible, but I can feel it when I touch my face, and if I can feel it, anyone else touching my face can, too.  Fuzzy-face is so not the image I want to project!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Bellabe hurt?  A little, though hurt is a bit too strong a word. It pricks a bit every time it removes a hair.  The upper lip is especially sensitive, but I can put up with a few seconds of discomfort for beauty&#x27;s sake!  I wore 4&amp;#34; heels for decades, heck, I can handle this.  I roll it over my face in an upwards motion, then at a bit of an angle upwards (NE and NW), and emerge a little while later with skin as smooth as glass.  Inexpensive, safe, fast, hard to beat!</li>
            <li> Works great! Easier than plucking with tweezers once you get the feel for the angle to roll it. Faster too!</li>
            <li> It is much harder tyo use than they said it was. It really doesn&#x27;t tighten when twisted like they say it will. I followed the instructions as they said--but it just isnt effective</li>
            <li> I saw the first hairs grow off of my chin as a teenager. A TEENAGER!!!! Since then I have tried so many things to effectively remove hair, it is almost embarrassing. ALMOST. But this thing is a dream. It takes no time at all, removes hair pretty much without exception, and it does not require a mirror or special glasses and light to see hair that my old eyes cannot focus on.  Thank you to whomever created this product. The Nobel prize, I believe, is in order.</li>
            <li> Want to get rid of fuzzy cheeks, chin, and lip? Get good at the technique of twirling this little gem and you&#x27;ll have a smooth and silky face for the rest of your life! Excellent alternative to paying for expensive waxing and salon treatments. If you have light-colored facial hair, you can&#x27;t use a laser, so this is a perfect solution. When my stepson was about 7 years old, he asked me if &amp;#34;girls can grow beards.&amp;#34; He obviously saw the light blonde fuzz on my jawline where men would have an actual beard. Kids are dangerous because they only see the truth!  I couldn&#x27;t ignore the peach fuzz anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this &amp;#34;analog&amp;#34; device, and I&#x27;ll no longer pay for salon services. Give it a try! I think you&#x27;ll dig it, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for facial hair removals especially for the upper lip. I&#x27;ve used wax strips and the cream but none seem to work for me very well. I usually get irritation afterwards. So I decided to search here on Amazon for any other hair removal options and I found this amazing product! I never knew there was such thing! So before I decided to buy this product, I read some of the reviews and they were all positive and seemed that this product actually worked. I also looked on youtube to see other reviews and how it was used. Again, very good reviews and it looked easy to use. So i bought this and it came in on good time. So I tried it and it works! This is amazing! It does hurt a little the first time you try it or use it but then you&#x27;ll get used to it. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found something so awesome! Thank you Bellabe Facial Hair Removal! I think this is one of the best facial hair removals so far!</li>
            <li> All I can say is ouch! Especially the upper lip.  It is slow going too. You have to keep going over areas to get every hair.  I&#x27;ll just keep looking for a removal cream that works &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave burns on my face (that&#x27;s not too easy to do though).</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It does exactly what you need it to you in a matter of minutes.  Not only am I saving money by not going to get my upper lip threaded, but I can touch it at at any time that I want!!  Great idea and really gets down to the last follicle!</li>
            <li> I love my Bellabe!!! I have purchased other product (more expensive) and have not been as happy with there performance. Bellabe is simple, easy and effective. You do not need an electric outlet so you can use Bellabe anywhere. It takes up very little room, which makes it easy to travel with. No need to worry about going through airport security. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This product does work but it takes forever to remove hair from a small area. If you have patience buy it, if not stick to tweezers!</li>
            <li> Works better than I had hoped . I was worried from the reviews about it hurting , but it&#x27;s tolerable .  I would say maybe the same as tweezing .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and love it.  It does really hurt when you first start using it.  But after you get use to it it is not bad.  I got this one for a friend of mine and she ask me if it was suppose to hurt like crap and I told her yes at first.  This is so much quicker than having to warm the wax.  You can take this with you and remove the hair at anytime.</li>
            <li> This is frickin&#x27; awesome. It works really well and is way faster than other methods.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get the smaller hair that I have..I don&#x27;t have so much hair and my hair are thin and it really doesn&#x27;t get the thin one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this thing.  Read all the reviews before purchasing.  Felt the price was worth a try.  I was wrong.  Using this thing really &amp;#34;smarts&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It works but really uncomfortable</li>
            <li> What great item!  I was able to remove a lot of fine facial hair on my face very easily.  Thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> My sister had one of these so I thought I would try it out.  It works really well, surprisingly.  I do have to get after a few hair the good old fashion tweezers route, although less than usual when I use this facial hair remover first.</li>
            <li> Hurts horribly and have to go over area multiple times. I would rather wax than use this product.</li>
            <li> Painful, painful, painful and doesn&#x27;t work that well and painful. I can&#x27;t express enough how painful this thing is.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the the other reviewers.  This device works very well for me and now that I&#x27;m used to it, the pain is not nearly as bad as the first time I used it.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have no idea how this is better than waxing , very painful and hard to use.</li>
            <li> works. but clean well!</li>
            <li> It works. I could not believe it! Pretty painless and safe.</li>
            <li> I did not find it to work at all.  The directions are not in English but I think I got the idea and it just didn&#x27;t work. It may have grabbed a hair or two but not enough to even notice.  I would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It does the job!!!  It does the job!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick! Quality product!</li>
            <li> This thing grabs tiny hairs that I didn&#x27;t even knew were there, it really made a difference in my complexion. I used to just tweeze and there was still a bit of a shadow. It stings in a couple sensitive places (middle upper lip), but really not that bad. It also helps that you have control over the twist. Using different angles is extremely effective.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as taboo as wax.. It&#x27;s not like a &amp;#34;lock yourself in the bathroom for a half hour&amp;#34; sort of thing. I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend watching tv while I was using it and was completely comfortable. He&#x27;s asked, &amp;#34;what is that?&amp;#34; And I said, &amp;#34;let me show you&amp;#34; muaahahahaahaha :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it&#x27;s just me but I never quite got the technique right or else it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Every once in awhile I could feel it grab a hair and yank, but the results were very inconsistent.  I&#x27;m going back to shaving as this little jewel just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on more course chin hair. Mostly good for fine facial hair. Can be slightly painful, but I mostly use tweezers. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It really hurts! I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to use it more than the first time. I&#x27;d rather pluck them one at a time than this!</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and this is the only facial hair removal tool that has ever worked for me. I&#x27;m still working on removing all the hair (started using it yesterday), but I think it will be worth the pain and the time once I&#x27;m done. I have had a few bumps, but they&#x27;re gone in an hour&#x27;s time. They only appear right after I&#x27;m done. I am lucky that even with my PCOS, I don&#x27;t get much acne on my face (mostly on my back and around my hairline). In fact, shaving gives me more skin irritation than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have PCOS, this product is at least worth a try since a lot of the hairs are coming out with the root, which means if they ever come back, they will come back thinner and lighter and will be easier to remove. Maybe even at that point one of the creams will actually work. I&#x27;ve tried laser before and it was a waste of time and money and now I just can&#x27;t afford electrolysis. I think if you have PCOS, this product would be great combined with Vaniqua (a Rx cream that slows down hair growth) and balancing out your hormones with weight loss and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably have to shave most of it and remove the rest in patches so I can go out and live my life, but this product is a dream come true. My hair is very, very thick from over 14 years of shaving, so it does really hurt but it&#x27;s only a little worse than plucking my eyebrows. It takes longer and more hairs come out at one time. One thing that really helps is covering the area with a wet, hot washcloth before use as it opens up the pores.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and very well made. Very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, which is always a plus!&lt;br /&gt;If I said using this doesn&#x27;t hurt (at first) I would be lying...but...it works like a dream!!!  I would definitly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This does work I definitely recommend it for anyone I saw it had a five star and tried it its easy to use</li>
            <li> This product does not work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to try to be kind.  These removers didn&#x27;t work at all.  I regret falling for the hype and wasting my money.  What a joke.</li>
            <li> It HURTS so bad!!!!! I CRIED I&#x27;m serious! But I noticed that there is less hair on my upper lips.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to work-but seems a bit uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t get some of the more coarse hairs. On the plus side: no rash or redness.</li>
            <li> A bit painful but does the trick!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all on my face and chin.</li>
            <li> Not only was waxing costly, but my skin is very sensitive and I always ended up with a rash on my upper lip which took two weeks to heal.  I will never again endure this thanks to Bellabe!  Now although &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; sounds silly considering the fact that yes, it is not painless (in fact, the first time I used it I had to gain a little extra courage by drinking a glass of wine first), it is fast and efficient and I no longer have that unsightly mustache.  Simple to use and effective - What a FABULOUS tool!</li>
            <li> This product ROCKS!!  Fast, practicaly pain free and priceless!!  You don&#x27;t even need a mirror to use it.  And it is noiseless and small you can take it anywhere!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by imitation products make oversees, this is the orginal MADE IN THE USA product!&lt;br /&gt;You will save $$$ with this product..no need to pay for waxing and take a chance of burning your skin or the redness that occurs.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for this great product!!</li>
            <li> I hated using hair removal creams that contained chemicals - the Bellabe was the perfect find!!  This simple little product is so easy to use, and it works!  I use it a couple of times a week....what used to take 15 minutes of tweezing, now takes just a minute or two.  It is also a great gift for elderly women who have a hard time seeing and plucking those stray hairs on their upper lip or chin.  You can literally use the Bellabe with your eyes closed.</li>
            <li> It is not painless at all, there is more than just a slight tugging. Also it takes a lot of repeated going of the same spot over and over MANY times to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on a whim. I had been using a facial hair removal cream that worked okay but not great, and I hated how it often missed the coarser hairs. It was also annoying having to wait for the hair to grow out a bit between uses. Recently, I ended up with chemical burns from the cream and decided enough was enough and bought the Bellabe. I cannot begin to say how much I love this product. It only took a minute to learn how to use it. It actually works best when you work with it by feel rather than sight, so I sat down to watch a little TV and used it while I watched. It gets the thick, coarse hairs and well as the short, fine ones. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely painless, but if you are used to waxing and tweezing, this is definitely preferable, especially because it won&#x27;t tear and burn your skin. After a while, it feels relaxing, almost like acupuncture. My face has never been smoother. For me, the fact that I can use this as needed and without doing damage to my skin, makes it worth the price. I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing one for my mom to use as well.</li>
            <li> This also pinched my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product but it hurts a tad when you use it.</li>
            <li> I does the job just fine with very little pain. I will keep and so will my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover out of curiosity and am amazed at how well it works. I pay a small fortune to have facial hair removed and this product has let me stop doing that. Can&#x27;t reccomend the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover strongly enough. Really great product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it removes hair like it says it does, but the pain of pulling hair from your face takes some getting used to! I love the product and have used it several times since I received it and the pain has eased some (I must be getting used to it), I have found that the discomfort is WELL WORTH IT in the end!</li>
            <li> I love this and this product is so quick and easy, leaving not one hair behind! Please continue to sell this!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for chin, upper lip and face.  Quick and easy with just a tiny sting that I can live with.  This will save me $45-50 every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very  light colored hair above my lip and I use it in between threading my lip. It works very well for but not for my daughter who has a little darker hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than stringing but just keep in mind, it requires both hands. I did my brows.. it works! Tried to do my forearm but I need both hands so that didn&#x27;t work. Seems too much trouble to try to do my legs. Would be better to get a wider one to get more area but ...like I said it works.</li>
            <li> Does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money</li>
            <li> It did not work! I would not recommend it. It was imposible to work with it. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been using tweezers because I found that wax also took the skin off and left me red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do if used correctly. I have only had it for a few days and don&#x27;t know if it is breaking hairs of removing them at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works!</li>
            <li> Remove facial hair in minutes</li>
            <li> It pulled a lot and even after three weeks of pain, there isn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in less hair coming back</li>
            <li> I could not get this product to work.  Never removed all the hair.  Only a hair here and there.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Note to anyone with carpal tunnel - it can aggravate it. Product is great - really works!</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your face before and after use this thing. I only washed my face once (I think it was after I finished) and I BROKE OUT HORRIBLY. The next time I washed my face before and after and didn&#x27;t have any breakouts. The pain is tolerable, the only time it hurts more is when you do your upper lip or right below your eye socket.</li>
            <li> Works really well on peach fuzz and gets it off without  visual irritation! However it is pretty painful which you get used to the more you use it !</li>
            <li> iir appears to do what is stated but it made my face break out as in an acne attack and after 5 days i have not got my face to clear up. i am 59 years old and have not had an acne break out in decades! i also used it pn facial hair that had never been removed( the peach fuzz on the sides of the cheeks. that is were my breakout was&#x27;. the seller was prompt in delivery</li>
            <li> It works well and gets the little tiny hairs.  You don&#x27;t have to wait until it grows long again to use it.  Roll it in different directions to get as many hairs as possible.</li>
            <li> I have always have trouble with hair on my chin and lip and wanted something that worked better than Nair or the other facial hair remover because the hair always came back really think. The first time i used it it did hurt and knew that it would because i had read the reviews and people had said that it would hurt because it is pulling the hair out and on your face its sensitive anyways. I did break out alittle bit after the first time but since then i try to do a facial mask on the same day that i use the Bellabe so i have less of a problem with breaking out afterwards. I would totally recommend to anyone wanting to get rid of their facial hair!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get better results with scotch tape! Seriously, you could probably see if this product will work for you by taking a cheap spring out of one of your home electronics and rolling over your skin...because THAT is precisely what this product is, a cheap coiled spring. With pretty plastic handles on the end :)</li>
            <li> Seriously will take you a while to figure out how to work this thing.  It does remove the hair, very painfully......but so does waxing or a tweezer.  The difference is a tweezer is one hair at a time painful.....this is 25 hairs at a time painful.....LOL  Can you say.... OW!!  OW!!  OW!!</li>
            <li> This is the best, fastest, cheapest way to remove lip and chin hair. I LOVE that it&#x27;s made in the USA. You do need to purchase a new one every 6 months or so but it&#x27;s cheaper than a wax and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout or anything. I would beware of the cheap china knock-offs. the work, but not as well and they don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m a little silly, but the pictures have always shown more than one hair remover in it. I had thought I was getting multiple (maybe for different areas of the face?). So I was a bit disappointed when I opened my package today and only had one. Had I known this, I would&#x27;ve gone for a cheaper version (it&#x27;s basically a tightly coiled piece of metal). Oh well. Just be aware, you only get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, I&#x27;ll update when I do. I&#x27;ve never used this before... Or anything like it.</li>
            <li> Love this its awesome and its easy to use! i dont have to use any shave cream or other products to be able to use the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li> This is replacing the creams I used to use that left my face red and burned. Very pleased!  I also like it is small and easy to throw in a travel bag. It stings the most on the first use, but if used regularly, doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all because you have less hairs to pull out each time.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is so sensitive, I can&#x27;t use wax or chemicals.  For decades, I&#x27;ve been pulling out each individual unwanted facial hair with tweezers.  I would have to wear my glasses, turn on a bright light, and use a 10X magnification mirror.  Plus I was continually sending my tweezers out to be sharpened.  Now, in a minute or less, I can remove all my facial hair without a mirror!!  I could even do it in the dark.  It&#x27;s so easy, and so quick, I can even use it while I&#x27;m doing something else -- saving me even more time.  It tingles just a little; nothing I can&#x27;t tolerate.  I am amazed by the results.  So smooth!  All I can say now is, why did it take me so long to find you?  You&#x27;ve given me back 15 minutes of my life every single day, and my facial hair is GONE!  THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> My problem was caused by not using a toner on my face and neck after using Bellabe.  In a couple of days after using Bellabe, I started itching on my face and neck and did not know what caused it.  Finally, I remembered that I had a friend use Bellabe on my face and neck.  I have very sensitive skin since I am 91 years of age.  Also, I take several blood pressure medications and that  could have increased the sensitivity.  My &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; was caused by taking a blood pressure medicine which made the hair more prevalent.  All is well now and I did learn how to use it properly!</li>
            <li> Does a great job on removing the smallest of facial hair.  My face skin is very sensitive and there was no reaction to using this hair remover.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fair if I say it&#x27;s a no good item.  It a good idea but not easy to use. The material is good though.  it takes too much time to use it. I just don&#x27;t want to stand in the bathroom forever.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to grab the chin hair.</li>
            <li> It hurts when trying to remove facial hair. I have many small tiny thin hair near my ears, and its terrible to use this contraption. Its like using tweezers and removing them 1 by 1.Very painful</li>
            <li> not as user friendly as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Was a little awkward to use at first but got the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;Works good, does sting in areas you aren&#x27;t used to plucking, but after a couple&lt;br /&gt;weeks it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> Works for me. It&#x27;s so easy and pain free. No more waxing. Once or twice a week. All done🌹satisfied customer!!!</li>
            <li> It just doesnot work on the side of the cheeks, it just removes ion the front part which is easy anyways, it just didnot work on the side burn area.</li>
            <li> OW!  OUCH!  This thing is WAY too painful to use.  Waxing/plucking is a breeze compared to this thing!  I was amazed at how painful it was after reading other reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t that bad or that plucking hurt more.  Really?  Maybe if I had my face numbed I&#x27;d try it again.  Definitely returning this item.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described and is very easy to use. If you have ever had your eyebrows or face threaded, it feels similar. By using this at home I have completely eliminated breakouts after hair removal. Also,  each time I have used it, the discomfort is less and less.</li>
            <li> Useful and pretty good results</li>
            <li> This works great. I read the reviews saying this hurts as it pulls out hair - and yes it does hurt a bit! But not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, it beats the pants off waxing/shaving/bleaching or anything else. I can do this once a week, as a quick clean-up, and I don&#x27;t have to wait for hair to grow back like waxing. Plus I don&#x27;t have to bother with, or buy, any more wax! And I travel with it! Just absolutely brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, seems like a solid little device. Considering how much I use it, and how much I am going to save on not buying anything else, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for removing facial hair both visible and invisible. Hurts like the dickens! You&#x27;ll have tears pinging out of your eyes BUT you&#x27;ll have a naked face. Does not hurt like waxing and not half as messy.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of using this product, it can&#x27;t be beat. It remove chin hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.Seldom works well and when it does it&#x27;s very painful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way this works ~ would rather go for sugar waxing instead.</li>
            <li> must have for every women, love this product</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Works very well and its not that painful.I always use hair remover cream but I am glad I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Rachel Ray show a few years back. I had to try it. I have some hairs growing on my chin/neck. I won&#x27;t wax because it causes me to break out with little pimple bumps. This product resembles a long spring. Kind of like the springs you find in toys around the battery terminal - but longer and tighter. The end pieces are rubber, which make holding the spring easy. It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable at first, but once you find a method that works for your hair removal - the process is almost painless. The process involves bending the spring and rolling it across your skin. The sensation is almost like getting your wrist hairs caught in a rubber band or watch band/bracelet. I am happy with my purchase and product. It&#x27;s a simple system that leaves no marks or redness. The hair does grow back, but the product is not intended for permanent hair removal. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to complete the task, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Bellabe Facial Hair Remover is the best as a control-hair removal product.  I use it constantly.  It is painful when you start pulling out the hair, but the redness disappears quickly and the pain dissipates as fast.  Also, I have it handy enough where I can start doing it while sitting in traffic, or wait outside the school for my kids.  I do not have the outgrown hair on my face anymore, and do not have to wait to make an appt. for a wax or threading.  It is similar to threading, but you do all the work and you cause yourself the pain.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was quick and I loved buying and ordering from Amazon.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my Bellabe facial hair threader which arrived only 2 days after ordering it!  I had course thick dark hair above my upper lip and on chin.  The Bellabe facial hair threader works great (fast, easy-to-use, effective, inexpensive, virtually painless for me).  My skin stays smooth.  I wish I would have tried it years ago!  Thank you very much for such a wonderful, practical effective product!</li>
            <li> This is easy and really doesn&#x27;t hurt after the first use, when you remove all the little hairs at once.  After that, they grow back at different rates, so you only have to remove a few at a time.  Watch one of the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on Youtube to get the hang of it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought two of these exact products elsewhere, and as much as I dislike the epilator (because it hurts), I love it!  The key is to use it frequently.  I gave one to my mother who is 84 and legally blind with &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;, and she can sit in her lazy-boy chair (appropriately named) and remove all of the darn facial hair that seems to appear overnight...every night.  I seem to have inherited the same fine facial characteristics, and I leave the epilator by modern &amp;#34;lazy boy&amp;#34; chair...with glass of wine readily available.  Good product with good results...enhanced with good wine!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! Works very well on the upper lip. Not as well on little black hairs on the chin tho. Amazed at the fact that it&#x27;s a little spring, but overall pleased.</li>
            <li> This will slide across your skin if it&#x27;s damp, humid or hot.  It took me quite a few tries, watching a u-tube video,and an email to the company, to learn how to use it effectively, and I still cannot use it under my chin/jawline with any measure of success. It was quite painful at first, but now that I have used it consistently for several weeks, the pain has reduced to a &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;.  It does seem to be effective (other than under the jawline), but needs to be used for a few minutes daily.  I will continue to use it, but will be seeking another solution.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw Bubz from Youtube use it. It works really well, and quickly. Plucks from the root and saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for getting rid of unwanted hair on face. It hurts a little bit at first but you get used to it. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Ive bought 3 of these spring threaders and he other two only cost a few dollars. A lot less than this one and they work a whole lot better. I&#x27;ll stick to the least expensive kind next time. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I have read all the reviews, some for similar products, and I decided to buy from Bellabe.  I just made my second try after purchasing, and I am not happy!  I only have a few stubborn but noticeable hairs.  It took me half and hour to 45 minutes to remove three the first time, and half an hour to remove two the second.  Granted, it removed some of the finer hair that I wasn&#x27;t really concerned with (I felt the pain as it pulled them out!) but it took forever to removed the ones I intended to move.  I read so many reviews about how great it is; I now wonder how many of those were working for Bellabe. The reason I went for Bellabe was because the other brand was quite a bit longer and Bellabe is Made in the USA. I will keep trying and update my review as I see fit.</li>
            <li> My wife said the product works good and it arrived a day early!  Good ole USPS</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me. I&#x27;ve always had to be careful with the application of my makeup, specifically powders, because of the fine blonde hairs that covered my face. People didn&#x27;t notice the hair but it was always annoying having to go an extra mile trying to find the proper makeup that wouldn&#x27;t expose all the hairs. I am now free to use any makeup I please. I only have to use this product once a month on my face and once every couple weeks for above my lip. It doesn&#x27;t really hurt either, but I&#x27;m used to the feeling because I use an epilator for the rest of my body. I think the epilator hurts more on my legs than this product does on my face. Would recommend this to anyone with fine hairs like mine. My mom purchased this product shortly after me and she has also loved the results.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as stated.  Removes even the finest hairs.  It is painful w/o a doubt!!  Something you must stay on top of and do regularly to achieve the goal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend seller and product!!!</li>
            <li> I am no wimp. I&#x27;ve had all parts of me waxed. But this device is freaking torture.  Not only does it hurt like crazy, it&#x27;s incredibly time consuming. The WORST buy I&#x27;ve ever had on Amazon. Totally duped.</li>
            <li> It was great at first but it seems like the hair regrows faster then before. it hurts like hell too but i knew it would.</li>
            <li> Removes facial hair fast and easy, and with only mild discomfort.</li>
            <li> Great product. Liked much by my wife.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with peach fuzz on my face. I have waxed in the past and I get really really red and huge bumps on my skin. I have tried depilatory creams and I get horrible rashes. The Bellabe facial hair remover is easy to use. I watched some videos on youtube and I was able to use it and was amazed at how it worked. I did have a lil redness but not bad. After using I washed my face and used a mask to help close my pores. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product seemed really neat I thought I finally found a solution to unwanted hair without all the chemicals and hot wax. But after using this product once, the area I used it on broke out in tiny little pimples! It didn&#x27;t really hurt that bad but my face was irritated for two weeks. Needless to say I haven&#x27;t used it since.</li>
            <li> A bit of a pain to use it works well enough if you keep doing it  price was right</li>
            <li> I have overactive hair growth on my face since I was in my 20&#x27;s and I have been dealing with it in many ways, I think waxing was the only thing I haven&#x27;t had much success with.  I&#x27;ve tried no-no, hair remover creams, and battery operated Tweezee:  the no-no doesn&#x27;t make my face hair-free and I was afraid to put it in certain areas on my face because you need long straight strokes to make it halfway useful.  The creams don&#x27;t get everything, they smell, they burn my skin if left on more than 8 minutes, and I get stubble the next day.  Tweezee is good but my upper lip area was way too sensitive for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of this product before until I stumbled over it on Amazon about 2 weeks ago. I received it and it took me about 3 days (30-45 minutes a day) to get a 90% hair free face!!  I&#x27;m still working on the little fuzz around my cheeks and under my chin, but my lip area is completely smooth and hairless for the first time since I had hair there in the past 20 years!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s a bit painful but totally worth it.  Takes a little practice to get the hang of it but it&#x27;s fairly easy especially in areas with a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says not to use around eyes or for eyebrows but I did roll it around a bit above my brows to catch some stray hairs. Just be sure your head hair is completely out of the way :)</li>
            <li> Works great on hair that&#x27;s never been removed before but when it starts to grow back, there&#x27;s no grip until it gets long again. I want to remove the hair before it gets that long.</li>
            <li> This item does not work. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just like threading... hurts like HELL but the results are unbeatable</li>
            <li> Works extremely well, except on some longer, coarser hairs which I had to pluck with a tweezer.  It was really great with the small, fine hairs though, which is exactly what I was hoping for, since using the Epilady on my face was absolute torture.  This hurts a bit, but leaves me with only slight redness.  I also like that I can use it absent-mindedly while watching TV, intead of having to be in front of a mirror.</li>
            <li> Such a simple device, and yet it works really well.  I have purchased additional Bellabes for friends, too.</li>
            <li> For people who don&#x27;t get along with the instruction sheet well and don&#x27;t have a very good right and left hand co-ordination, I would not recommend this product. You have to hold it at each end and rotate your hands while moving it on your skin. I usually do threading to get rid of hair on upper lips or occasionally just tweeze. If you are good at following instructions, then you can challenge yourself. But I&#x27;m sorry but this product was just not for me, personally.</li>
            <li> I was surprised this actually works, but it does not remove all of the hairs even if I go over an area for 30 min.  It is quite painful and I have a high tolerance for pain, so I don&#x27;t use it anywhere but my chin &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> This crazy thing HURTS like he**!! It does not work on longer thicker hairs on my face. And the ones it does pull out is slow and painful. No thank you!! Waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, good &amp; bad, about this product, I decided to take a chance &amp; give it a try. From the reviews, this product was not the &amp;#34;magic beans&amp;#34; that I was hoping for. I feel that the longer the hair, the more effective the product is. I do not feel that it does a good job on some places, for example the upper lip, &amp; Especially I found it difficult, really impossible, around the corners of the mouth. Where hair is longer, jaw or cheeks, it seems to do OK. It does sting some, but I don&#x27;t feel intolerable. I found the cleaner you keep it, the better it works. I bought a soft toothbrush for a child, then use alcohol &amp; gently wipe dry. Would I buy this product again. No. While even using it, I still have to go back to additional shaving. And embarassment. I just don&#x27;t feel the product is as spectacular as it&#x27;s made out to be.</li>
            <li> Bearded lady no more!</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t work for me; perhaps my hair was too thin; but there is a lot of it and it just didn&#x27;t grab the hair as it should have.</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy the Bellabe. It kept my face smooth and hairless. My only problem is I couldn&#x27;t keep up with it! I&#x27;ve bought two of these and have lost both. Needless to say I&#x27;ll be purchasing another one.</li>
            <li> I love this product-very easy to use and not very painful.  I keep it by the tv and just use it when I watching tv.  Have battled facial hair all my life-now I never give it a second thought-sooo liberating!!!</li>
            <li> Menopause has not been kind to me and the peach fuzz on my face was making me CRAZY! I have looked into everything and nothing seemed ideal. Razors promoted fast re-growth, depilatories were too harsh on my skin and again, almost immediately, the fuzz would start growing back. I was seriously thinking about dropping the $300 for a No No but saw this and decided to give it a try and am I glad I did! This little gem is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold! It pulls the hairs out and re-growth time is slower than any other method I have used! You have to use it across your face in all directions to get all the hairs but it is super! Just clean your face then sit down in front of your tv and roll this puppy over your face and before your show ends, your face will be smooth and virtually hairless! I am going to purchase 2 more so I can stash one permanently in my luggage for when I travel, one in the bathroom, and one to hold in reserve! The upper lip did smart the first time I tried it there but your face will de-sensitize pretty quickly. NOTE: it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair plucked the first time you use it, but it de-hairs enough that you won&#x27;t feel embarrassed about going out into the sun and worrying your face is starting to resemble a hairy gorilla!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Found my new facial hair remover, way better than using creams or worse... shaving! Definitely getting this for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Pinches a bit at first, but it really works.  And you get used to the slight pinching.  This lasts forever.  You can use it over and over.  Hair seems to get thinner and finer the more you use it.  Hair stays away for long periods of time,for  about 6 to 9 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just received my Bellabe in the mail today and used in right away.  I am using this product to remove hair from my upper lip.  I was skeptical about this product at first because the hair I have is fine but noticeable so I was afraid the Bellabe wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively remove the hair.  I was pleasantly surprised when ALL the hair was removed, every last piece.  Does it hurt, yes it&#x27;s a pulling, slightly stinging sensation but not unbearable by any means.  I&#x27;m sure after a few more uses this slight sting will dissipate. I have tried everything from creams, waxes, electrolysis and finally resorted to just tweezing but this works much better than tweezing and grabs a larger amount of hair than just single tweezing.  Afterwards my skin was left very soft and smooth similar to a post facial.  I am very satisfied with this product and only wish I knew about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now. I really enjoy that I don&#x27;t need a mirror and proper lighting to use. I can absent-mindedly use the product while watching TV. This product really gets the small hairs that you can never get or see with tweezers. Excellent compliment to my grooming accessories.</li>
            <li> This did not have the ability to grasp fine hairs.  I practiced many times, since I know you need to &amp;#34;get the hang of it&amp;#34; based on videos I watched.  The Epilady facial depilitator is a better investment.  Save your money and avoid the Bellabe.</li>
            <li> It is painful so buy numbing gel also. I will try using product again when I have some. It does work just painful.</li>
            <li> it is really painful to use and I don&#x27;t think this will be helpful to me. I don&#x27;t think this is a great product</li>
            <li> Hurts like a son of a gun for awhile then get used to it but at least it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like depilatory creams.</li>
            <li> This hurts but so worth it because it removed every little hair from my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a couple of youtube videos prior to ordering this.  Amazing you can watch people do this on video&#x27;s and not grimace in pain.  I thought, how bad can it be?  No worse than plucking, right?  It&#x27;s pretty painful but in the end when you have smooth skin and no traces of hair, it makes the pain worth it.  After I was done, I did spread on some Neosporin cream.  Pain subsides around a half hour or so after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product and it&#x27;s so inexpensive you can&#x27;t really lose. It does feel as if you are tweezing a lot of hairs at once (you are) but it&#x27;s not bad. Much better than waxing, if you ask me. I do this for a couple of minutes every night around my lip and chin and everything is taken care of. It&#x27;s amazing because hair you can&#x27;t even see will be plucked. Sometimes there&#x27;s a specific hair  I can&#x27;t quite get with it, so a back up pair of tweezers is a good idea for me. And I had a little redness at the beginning so I do this at night. I wish I had found this a couple of years ago!</li>
            <li> This little tool is amazing... only wish I found and ordered it years ago.  Thanks Bellabe --- would give you 10 stars  if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> It easy to use and it a lot faster than tweezers.. At first it was a little painful but i got used to it..</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a year now &amp; it is still working great.</li>
            <li> Love it, really works!</li>
            <li> this is made like a big spring. It does get the hair pretty well.I do recommend for facial hair removal.</li>
            <li> is an amazing product. i agree with some others that i only wish i had learned about this product years ago. it came in the mail today and i love it already. it took 2 seconds to learn how to use and it hurt at first but im someone who has spent minutes each day with tweezers and i was getting so sick of it..the ingrown hairs on my chin were the worst. i love this product. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I call it the torture device.  Very painful, and does not get all the hairs off.  Would not recommend unless for very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> great product will order more in the future</li>
            <li> Works great!  I don&#x27;t think it hurts that much, but I have waxed my &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; before and I frequently have my legs waxed.  I actually like how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Like many others have posted,this thingie works and I WISH I HAD purchased  it a while ago.&lt;br /&gt;Sure you MIGHT HAVE TO tweeze a few here and there but for those of us out here that have had this  problem,tweezing is nothing new and remains TIME CONSUMING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reasons,post menopause maybe,my skin texture became coarse looking and a fine growth of hair /peach fuzz appeared seemingly in every enlarged pore--an omg moment !!!!!!!!! LOL !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;item arrived and i tried it and like others have said,the 1st time you MIGHT feel a twinge or 2 but after that,there is no problem and you simpy \\&quot;roll\\&quot; it around per the directions,no need for a mirror and take care of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can truly report that it works,works fine,requires no real effort and without that peach fuzz,my complexion looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;most hairs seem to be removed root and all so any regrowth has lessened and the regrowing 1s remain a fine tiny hair not coarse either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe excessive hair remains a VERY PRIVATE ISSUE so I can only recommend this here-&lt;br /&gt;like many others,I am happy with it and regret not getting one sooner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review of a product before this. I just had to do this one because I was so amazed at how well it works and how easy it is. I&#x27;m still learning to use it properly but I am very pleased. No pain, just a slight pinch that was almost unnoticeable. No reaction afterward, even though I have sensitive skin. The one time I did electrolysis, I broke out and the same for depilatory products. No more plucking and shaving for me. So easy I won&#x27;t mind if I do it daily, but it looks like that won&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li> Does not reliably or effectively remove hair at the root . The result is ingrown hairs which appear the same as acne .</li>
            <li> It works, but it feels like a medieval torture device. Not sure I can keep using it long enough to toughen up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention! It&#x27;s easy to use with minimal discomfort which diminishes over time. I bought one for my mom who also loves it!</li>
