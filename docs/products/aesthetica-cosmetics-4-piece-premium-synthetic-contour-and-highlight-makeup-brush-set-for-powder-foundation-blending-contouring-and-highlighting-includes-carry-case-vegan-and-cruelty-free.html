            <li>but it&#x27;s so subtle to other people that if you do it right you just look beautiful and they can&#x27;t figure out why!</li>
            <li>They just aren&#x27;t very well made.</li>
            <li>It works very well to blend when contouring.</li>
            <li>I go for this set, it really makes a difference</li>
            <li>used all 4 Aesthetica Brushes for this look, I might have used the brushes for different uses but hey if you are the artist you have the right to choose your painting brushes and you choose how you want to create with them:)&lt;br /&gt;Voila!</li>

            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend about a month ago. One of the brushes broke after first use, another one broke today. They just aren&#x27;t very well made.</li>
            <li> Terrible and a waste of money. The brushes fall out while using it. Spend your money on some good quality brushes.</li>

            <li> These are the brushes I used for the contour and highlighting product by Aesthetica. They are also cruelty free and vegan brushes. These contour brushes are so silky soft, no shedding and work wonderfully! This set included 1 large domed blending brush, 1 small domed contour brush, 1 angled contour brush and 1 flat highlighting/ blending brush in a nice carrying case.  I agreed to test this product out and give my honest review of the products. I will be looking for a full set of brushes like these for the rest of my makeup needs. My current brushes shed and I despise that. These are going to be easy to clean as well. I&#x27;m very impressed by the high quality products this company has. I recommend these products for any skill level user. They are affordable and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush set with the contour and highlighting kit by Aesthetica. The brushes come on a soft, padded, black zipper case. It&#x27;s great for traveling and makes it easy to store. The case helps to keep the brushes clean. There is also a flap inside the case that will cover the bristles of the brush for protection. On the other side of the case, there is a zipper pouch for storage. Each brush comes with a plastic protective cover. You will receive 4 brushes that are perfect to help define your face with the contouring kit. These brushes are silky soft and feel great on your skin. Even though the listing tells you what each brush is for, it would be handy if a pamphlet was included with your purchase. I love that these are cruelty free and vegan. So far I have experienced any shedding of the bristles. It&#x27;s looks like these brushes are very good quality and will last a very long time. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend these silky soft brushes. It&#x27;s goes great with the highlighting and contour kit. The zipper case is great for traveling and storing. This is a great set!</li>
            <li> I was offered these brushes in exchange for an unbiased review. I absolutely love these. Nice quality bristles perfect thickness. Also received contouring make-up &amp; instructions on how to apply properly. Love these! They come in a beautiful case as well.</li>
            <li> Love my new set of brush</li>
            <li> I prefer synthetic brushes and was really excited to receive this little kit. It works perfectly with the company&#x27;s contour palette! The brushes are soft, yet sturdy and well-made. I also like to the included case, which is great for traveling. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out these contour brushes from Aesthetica so when I was asked to review them I did not think twice lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for starters,&lt;br /&gt;I do not contour every day but I do a little contouring here and there shh lol. Ok definately not like the Kim K infamous contour.  I feel I don&#x27;t need it and also because that&#x27;s a little over board for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The places I usually contour are the hollow of my cheeks and nose. And I highlight my cheek bones, my nose, my cuspid&#x27;s bow and my brows.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I highlight more than I contour lol&lt;br /&gt;None the less I used these brushes for both contouring and highlighting.&lt;br /&gt; I did not use cream products for this beauty look  although these brushes can be used with powders or creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products I used to contour was a Wet N Wild bronzer and for the highlight were the Balm Cosmetics Mary Lou- Manizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that they detailed what each brush is good for but again it&#x27;s up to you how to choose what brush is suited for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, I used The smaller brush in the kit as an eyeshadow brush too and used a Pacifica eyeshadow to highlight my browbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the collages below I&#x27;m doing some contouring and highlighting then you will see the finished product. The make up was done very natural and so was the contouring and highlighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the flat brush to swirl in my foundation (Pur Minerals)&lt;br /&gt;I used the Bronzer to contour my cheeks and highlighted on the top of my cheekbones all using the Angled Brush&lt;br /&gt;On my nose I used the bronzer and small brush on the sides and tip of it&lt;br /&gt;Then I highlighted the center on my nose with the Mary Lou- Manizer with the same brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not with the large domed brush I blended the contouring on the sides of my nose&lt;br /&gt;I used all 4 Aesthetica Brushes for this look, I might have used the brushes for different uses but hey if you are the artist you have the right to choose your painting brushes and you choose how you want to create with them:)&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Slimmer nose and higher cheek bones and higher browbone:)ur painting brushes and you choose how you want to create with them:)&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Slimmer nose and higher cheek bones and higher browbone:)</li>
            <li> These are absolutely wonderful. These are synthetic brushes of course and they are great quality! They feel very soft and I like the thickness of the bristles. Not too lose not too tight, just perfect! I love that these come in a little zipper carrying case so I can make sure they stay clean and dust free. I have used these for a few days now and haven&#x27;t had any of the brushes shed so I&#x27;m extremely pleased. My favorite brush is the flat top, I&#x27;m obsessed. It works very well to blend when contouring. These are premium makeup brushes, great price and great quality!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes a few days ago in the mail and I was very pleased with them. The case is very nicely made and the brushes are of the finest quality. Fantastic shipper.......they arrived way ahead of schedule. No complaints here!!</li>
            <li> Anytime I dress up or feel like looking pretty I go for this set, it really makes a difference but it&#x27;s so subtle to other people that if you do it right you just look beautiful and they can&#x27;t figure out why! Lol</li>
            <li> Directions were very good but I didn&#x27;t like the makeup. Pigment is not good. Couldn&#x27;t even tell I did anything to my face.</li>
            <li> Every thing was to satisfaction! Product &amp; Delivery</li>
            <li> I would order this again - tried other brands, this one doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out</li>
            <li> Not the quality I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Brushes are of excellent quality.  Aesthetica makeup goes on smoothly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> Beautiful High Quality makeup brushes! I love these brushes. They look great and feel great! They are super soft and great for contouring the areas you want to highlight or add color too. I have not noticed any shedding at all. It glides my makeup on smoothly and looks beautiful. My blush looks great on my cheeks. I love using these brushes. I love the little brush that comes with this too. It&#x27;s great for blending my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these brushes blend your makeup beautifully. You can tell that these brushes are high quality. I am impressed with this makeup brush set and highly recommend! This product was received for the purpose of inspection and testing for unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Quality product. Very handy. I also recommend their contour kit:  http://goo.gl/qYSwID  it comes with easy instructions.</li>
            <li> I am new to brushes but these brushes made it so easy to contour my face. Not a lot of fallout but they definitively have a very strong smell when they arrived. I just had to wash them before first use.</li>
