            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Just saw this product at Best Buy for $20 more than it is listed here.</li>
            <li>Like many others my hair got caught it in so many times and it burnt some of my hair off!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried one more time, this time hold it for 5 beeps and perfect curl!</li>
            <li>believe my own eyes!..</li>
            <li>I tried so many but this was the best I think.</li>
            <li>It transforms hair I to the most beautiful curls!!</li>
            <li>I loving my Infiniti Pro!</li>
            <li>so this is perfect for me, but if you are going to use it every day, it seems more damaging than your every day curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love this thing and best of all</li>
            <li>The best ever:)))))))))</li>
            <li>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions, trust them, and practice makes perfect. :)</li>
            <li>Nice Curls though!</li>
            <li>Nice try Conair, but no!</li>
            <li>Nothing has been as successful as the pro curl.</li>
            <li>This product is good, and the concept is great.</li>
            <li>If I have 40 minutes, I use it and the curls are really nice!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure practice will make perfect!</li>
            <li>This curler is awesome glad</li>
            <li>so I went online and read some reviews and watched some you tube videos on the product and saw mostly positives so I ordered and am I happy!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking that the manufacture would be the best in that I had purchased from them before &amp;that item has lasted many yrs, but in the case of this product it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the one my sister bought &amp; let me borrow (Curl Genius, by Blisspro)</li>
            <li>I now have 10 friends who are purchasing this product after seeing a pic of my hair and i have had so many people tell me today my hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li>Great product and was just as good as advertised.</li>

            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Good thing all over.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.    </li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Good Luck if you decide to order this product</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s what I call a good use of technology.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li>But I think I have good hair for this product.  </li>
            <li>and I just have had the hardest time getting it to look good.  </li>
            <li>They loved the results.</li>
            <li>thing and good</li>
            <li>It was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Today, I have gorgeous beach waves and still have some defined curl ringlets.</li>
            <li>But then, every time I passed a mirror and caught myself, I really loved how my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I took a nap on the couch and the curls still looked good after.</li>
            <li>Maybe Good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this product that&#x27;s why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, I tried curling my hair but did not get the good result.</li>
            <li>This hair tool did not create good curl on either of my daughters or myself.</li>
            <li>This is fool proof, hassle free and best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use product to hold it.</li>
            <li>loved this product.  </li>
            <li>What I loved about this curling iron is the curls</li>
            <li>Got this because reviews were good......</li>
            <li>but hopefully it will prove to be a good investment.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that although my hair is often kind of frizzy (and</li>
            <li>I get nothing but compliments about how good my hair looks after using this.</li>

            <li>the curls are amazing..</li>
            <li>The idea is amazing.</li>
            <li>This Curling tool is AMAZING, i can curl my hair in 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Amazing-</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This device which I just used did amazing curls.</li>
            <li>It looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of product that in a couple years will be still selling well</li>
            <li>The babybliss works just as good as tulip but is much more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out really nice and with just some hairspray</li>
            <li>After trying to get my hair out on my own</li>
            <li>It did make one nice curl.</li>
            <li>But, when I went to do my own hair, I found it often pulled and tangled up my hair.  </li>
            <li>looks nice when its not getting stuck and pulling out your hair</li>
            <li>I have never been adept at curling or styling my own hair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly it took some time for her to get the knack of using it.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I would say that this product is best for straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would groan because I didn&#x27;t even know how to do my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I cannot make this curl my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I can say that I was quite scared about using it after some of the reviews saying their hair was getting caught</li>
            <li>but sometimes i straighten and just want to have the ends curled nicely, this product does just that.  </li>
            <li>It really works, now I have flawless curls.</li>
            <li>After reading all reviews I knew to read instructions instead of figuring it out on my own.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a kind of fraud that show something on market and send something else.</li>
            <li>It works nice, no tangles at all.</li>
            <li>BUT I will take that any day and have nice curled hair for  3 days in a row...</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>with practice you can and the results are nice.</li>
            <li>The curls are nice.</li>
            <li>On this one though I just really want to let it be known how awesome this hair styler is.</li>
            <li>I could never curl my own hair</li>
            <li>I curled my whole head perfectly in about 30 min....</li>
            <li>I see cute styles on others and can never get my hair to look as good.</li>
            <li>something gorgeous will come out :)</li>
            <li>Her hair looks nice when she does.</li>
            <li>This styler makes nice curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li>With this hair curler I don&#x27;t have to pay a lot of $ or make an appointment or drive somewhere, I just style my hair in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li>She liked nothing about this product.</li>
            <li>Plus... it is diverse in what kind of curls it provides.  </li>
            <li>Works great and my curls look phenomenal. :)</li>
            <li>Works nicely when it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair.</li>
            <li>and I was loving the curls.  </li>
            <li>I still really liked the concept of this styler and took a chance.</li>
            <li>Kind of a Gisele Bunchen hair.</li>
            <li>The curls are nice and hair does not get stuck if used according to instructions, despite what some people say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve officially ordered my own.</li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to but makes your curls look nice</li>
            <li>It has a lot of options which is nice</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and as soon as she received she used it and loving it.</li>
            <li>I have nice volume with hair that looks like a woman.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this hair curler, as it seemed perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li>but I am honestly amazed by the product.</li>
            <li>After my friend trying this product and loving it, i decided why not give it a try.</li>
            <li>I found it really makes super neat curls with ease!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My mother and I bought this curling iron because we thought it was awesome and a much easier way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks as good (and sometimes better)</li>
            <li>Somehow the curls didn&#x27;t turn out to be as nice as the pictures looks.</li>
            <li>working this out on your own in front of the mirror takes some time in the beginning.</li>
            <li>All are good - the Babyliss has more features.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot believe anyone wouldn&#x27;t give this five stars.</li>
            <li>If gave me a nice shaped curl.</li>
            <li>cause it makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is really THE BEST.</li>
            <li>Not the end of the world.very nice results.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t know what I did before this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>But this handy dandy tool has changed all that.</li>
            <li>so I could do my own hair for my bridal photos.  </li>

            <li>Work fine, it is really good.</li>
            <li>This was a good concept in theory, and honestly I was really excited about it.</li>
            <li>Never being able to curl my own hair with curl iron</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t curl my hair, and this is literally my magical wand.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my own hair</li>
            <li>Glad to say it works amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair does NOT hold a curl this iron if truly amazing love</li>
            <li>The first three curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have beautiful wavy locks that did not require hours of wearing rollers or struggling to curl my hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>These curls (best with some product in the hair first) are twisty, soft, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my best friend&#x27;s 9 year old daughter</li>
            <li>It came a day early, which was awesome, and I immediately opened it to try it out.  </li>
            <li>I looked into getting another tool that was much more effective at applying curls to my hair</li>
            <li>item I thought and was extremely thrilled and got many people ..</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair curler I&#x27;ve found to date!!!  </li>
            <li>Conair Infiniti Pro Curl is the best tool I have found thus far</li>
            <li>Wow, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>PROS: this thing works awesome on my naturally curly (frizzy curls) hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing way to keep my hair in a huge style!</li>
            <li>So far this is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever used to curl hair.</li>
            <li>but once you get it it is fun to use with great results</li>
            <li>This is really cool!!</li>

            <li>I was really excited to try this because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s turly amazing &amp; worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I then did my own, didn&#x27;t bother to brush it, just ran my fingers through it to get the more prominent tangles out,  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair on my own and with this I am able to</li>
            <li>but im glad i didnt listen by far the best product i have EVER used.</li>
            <li>Wow I  love it the best curler I ever purchased.</li>
            <li>Very easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li>I tried it out yesterday, very easy to use, make sure you have heat protection product on ur hair tho</li>
            <li>Love, love, love, love, this curling iron!</li>
            <li>My girls love it too because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the effects are very stylish.  </li>
            <li>I did my whole head in about 10 minutes with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who hates the curling iron but wants beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>backwards lol its funny</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone who wants beautiful hair and curly.</li>
            <li>The first two curls turned out great, although it hurt to pull the device out</li>
            <li>I have a really great hot tools curling iron, but the effect lasts 20 mins unless I blast it with hairspray</li>
            <li>I bought this to try it out, and I&#x27;m super happy with how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Able to curl and style easily!</li>
            <li>You must have very smooth hair to work well.  </li>
            <li>It made it easy to use and amazing curls.</li>
            <li>I saw a YouTube &amp; loved the quick looking tumbling waves that it made.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produces a really nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and nice to not have to worry about burning yourself.</li>
            <li>I was SUPER excited when perfect curls fell right out!</li>
            <li>This product produces very nice curls, but have in mind that you need to first brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so the low setting works best for me.</li>
            <li>Fun easy to use great product for curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>it works well, easy and fun, great curls instantly….</li>
            <li>It works the best with super straight hair not curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It sucked in a very important layer and it wouldn&#x27;t come out; I had to sit there and watch my hair smoke and burn free!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this wonderful product lets even a dummy like me (when it comes to hair, at least) be able to have the most beautiful curls I ever had.</li>
            <li>i believe it&#x27;s supposed to have the exactly certain portion of your hair before you snap it in the curler, so it will work great.</li>
            <li>I loved the machine from the first curl!  </li>
            <li>A huge hit!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>THIS, ladies, is the solution to all your problems :).</li>
            <li>Curl Magic.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure you have a well parted piece of hair when you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that being said there are many products I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite purchases of 2014.  </li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>But overall, I was incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Maybe more.</li>
            <li>If someone is looking for a more relaxed tousled look, that can be achieved too.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s flying around with a lot of static</li>
            <li>Be sure to listen to these, the timing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The more we use it the more we like it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>my kid love it and use it by herself.</li>
            <li>I do love the way the curls looks</li>
            <li>You will love this product.  </li>
            <li>Like many others I have NEVER been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>but it seems to work okay.</li>
            <li>, I had adorable all-over-the-head curls.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Such beautiful curls!</li>
            <li>I really love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say that the device should be recalled for faulty safety precautions-</li>
            <li>It does not work and it got stuck in my daughters hair that we had been growing out for locks of love.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased.</li>
            <li>Thought, if it worked, my daughter would love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions tell you to section off the hair, make sure it&#x27;s not tangled,</li>
            <li>It burned my head and more of my hair.</li>
            <li>But the words are printed on the device at what side needs to have your head so there shouldn&#x27;t be too many forgetfulness moments.</li>
            <li>it was for my daughter but all her girl friends are using it and love it</li>
            <li>and I tried it real quick on one strand</li>
            <li>My wife love it,  </li>
            <li>I received the product and curled most of my hair without getting any stuck.</li>
            <li>She loves it :)</li>
            <li>my hair got tangled more than once.</li>
            <li>it gives u a perfect curl,and i don&#x27;t even know how to curl my hair with a regular curler.</li>
            <li>have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li>I used it and fell in love.</li>
            <li>If you read the instructions and make sure to wait for the multiple beeps that indicate it&#x27;s done it works great!</li>
            <li>Great for straight hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I had no problems and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love this thing.</li>
            <li>have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li>I am getting better with it every day</li>
            <li>i,m in love with Infiniti Pro by Conair</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and i will order more</li>
            <li>and  after that its okay...</li>
            <li>I really love the well defined, coiled curls this product provides.</li>
            <li>but mostly you need to pick out the rat&#x27;s nest one strand at a time.</li>
            <li>You hold it for 5 beeps if you want more defined curls.</li>
            <li>Mine was a gift, tooooo much money, but great product :)</li>
            <li>:) Will get better with practice.</li>
            <li>I have been showing friends and family and all love to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/scared me:)</li>
            <li>hair is shoulder length, and it took me only 10 min&#x27;s at the most to do all my hair, it looks great!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, that one feature does not justify paying almost forty percent more.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t take more than 1&amp;#34; of hair.  </li>
            <li>This is much more user-friendly than both of those.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I can&#x27;t give this item any more than a 2 star rating because it burned off pieces of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Think, &amp;#34;That girl&#x27;s hair must tickle the top of her bum,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the curls</li>
            <li>I get many compliments.  </li>
            <li>The curls hold great and it takes no longer than 30 minutes for me to do my whole head</li>
            <li>more reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then again, if you have no talent in curling hair like me, then what better item can you find than this???</li>
            <li>I wish it would hold more quantity of hair.</li>
            <li>but she had the most glorious curls when it was time to go to bed</li>
            <li>Ok, my hair NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER...</li>
            <li>you have to make sure their is not lingering strands because your hair will GET STUCK and from experience I had to unplug and literally dig my hair out</li>
            <li>This happened twice but the closer you use it towards your scalp the more risk you take for it to get stuck.</li>
            <li>I clipped part of my hair on top of my head and worked in sections.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can also imagine so many uses for this.  </li>
            <li>For example, creating a simple ponytail with perfect ringlets.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do love this product, but please keep in mind</li>
            <li>I will try to update this review as I use the product more.  </li>
            <li>This makes really cute, curly hair</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to get your hair out by yourself and will require assistance.  </li>
            <li>and I think, with practice, I will be able to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li>&quot;  You need to practice using this tool, and each time you&#x27;ll become better and faster at</li>
            <li>I heard about how it was \\&quot;different\\&quot; because it heats your hair on all sides and retains your style better, so I decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li>it took forever, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of volume on top of my head, and boy did I get my hair tangled in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this would be even easier and faster if you had someone to help you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this tool and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that like most things, there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li>Product did not do any better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it wraps the hair for you.</li>
            <li>Best part is that I don&#x27;t wash it and the next day, it looks even better.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d researched it more.</li>
            <li>Perhaps even better than achieving Kate Middleton hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even slept with my hair curled, and my hair still looks perfect the next day.</li>
            <li>If you try more than that (or get the tool too close to your scalp)</li>
            <li>The curls are much better than a curling iron</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on my hair since using it.  </li>
            <li>I recently cut about 5 inches off, and it still curls great!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you don&#x27;t put it too close to your head or your hair will get stuck.</li>
            <li>5 stars I give this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this :)  </li>
            <li>It took me about 30 minutes to do all of my hair and the curls last all day at work and were still perfect all night.</li>
            <li>Follow tne instructions and all will be ok.</li>
            <li>However, it is enjoyable for her to do it herself.</li>
            <li>but i love curling my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it love it</li>
            <li>oh my god love it.</li>
            <li>We love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Everything ok.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put more in.</li>
            <li>so this is actually the best case scenario)</li>
            <li>Makes cute curls.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I think it might work better</li>
            <li>My hair had never looked better.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>I have been through so many hair curlers growing up and the curls never lasted longer then 1 hour.</li>
            <li>You must make sure there are not tangles in your hair</li>
            <li>What I love about this curler is you don&#x27;t need to worry about bumping it because it will not burn out.</li>
            <li>The hair will simply come out and unravel off the curler a bit, which is great if you are trying to curl a child&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the curl I get from this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I am saving alot of money and time.</li>
            <li>Still love it</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my hair than I ever have--literally have strangers stop me and ask me how I did my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>I had two options: cut my hair (which I am growing to donate to locks of love) or break the machine into millions of pieces to get my hair out.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my daughter is ok now, but we are returning the tool.</li>
            <li>This make lovely uniform curls and they stay for more then 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This kept coming up as one of the top models.</li>
            <li>You can see the results in the photo :)</li>
            <li>my straightener works better at curling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curler.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!:)</li>
            <li>Ok, that&#x27;s all for now.  </li>
            <li>In love, and I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Much better than using the wand where you can burn your hand or neck.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>We both really love it.  </li>
            <li>I would like it better if it rotated so</li>
            <li>This curler is better than the $150 one</li>
            <li>And if you can get someone else to do your hair, even better.</li>
            <li>By the time I was able to get her hair out it was fried from the heat and broke off.  </li>
            <li>My wife says she loves me more now that I made her morning routine easier.</li>
            <li>If you put more than a quarter inch of hair in ...</li>
            <li>We need to set up a foundation to make sure this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have told so many people</li>
            <li>Such an awesome product.</li>
            <li>If you are considering you have nothing left to consider its AWESOME</li>
            <li>For  $100 you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>It was a joy to give her so much pleasure.</li>
            <li>and I just love the results.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I think a curling iron better</li>
            <li>I love it ..</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>, if you follow the directions with facing the barrel towards your head, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled, and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the machine it will work great.</li>
            <li>and once you loosen your grip on the curler you should be able to get your hair out no problem.</li>
            <li>It curls mid length hair best.</li>
            <li>More time consuming than I thought.</li>
            <li>It is ok...</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>in short, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Did great on my medium length hair, just don&#x27;t put in too much at a time.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more pricey than most devices</li>
            <li>and it is wanting more to hold on to for a tighter curl.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It might work better for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THIS MACHINE.</li>
            <li>She is getting into that grow up stage and looks lovely with curls.</li>
            <li>I have rag-rolled my daughter&#x27;s hair many times</li>
            <li>(I did it in two sections, top and bottom, about 10 curls each section) in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>more of the reviews sounded ok.  </li>
            <li>I impulsively bought this out of desperation and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>, i would recommend de-frizzing your hair for better results</li>
            <li>Perfect product, Perfect curls, I am totally addicted to it Now!</li>
            <li>so make sure you have lengthy hair for this product.</li>
            <li>...use hairsray once you&#x27;re done :)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the curls are cute</li>
            <li>And it will look better--you&#x27;ll have more control over your hair and timing.</li>
            <li>The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls.  </li>
            <li>She is a teenager and is really into styling her hair and this has been a great tool and a time saver as well.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was more time consuming to use instead of just a curling iron</li>
            <li>Safe if you know how to use it correctly (if the hair gets stuck for any reason, just keep opening and closing and the hair comes out).</li>
            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I curl my hair with the Pro Curler, even from people that I don&#x27;t even know.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Some of the more elite versions of this product have choice of curl directions and alternating directions, which I would like.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it its fantastic!</li>
            <li>The heat and time settings are nice but don&#x27;t give me a huge range of curl types.</li>
            <li>The timer makes it even easier to make sure all your curls are uniform.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>but I have gotten better with every use.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li>and I love wearing my hair like this,</li>
            <li>I am so glad I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li>, I wished that I would be able to do something to it.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair has amazing curls! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>seems  to get &amp;#34; stuck&amp;#34; sort of scared me, but was able to get hair out.</li>
            <li>I totally love it</li>
            <li>This works better than you think it would.</li>
            <li>the medium curls on my side hair, then the largest curls on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I love that it lasts with or without product, like hair spray.</li>
            <li>I love the three sizes of curls it can give.</li>
            <li>I have ZERO experience using a curling iron and always wanted to be able to do so when I felt like dolling up,.</li>
            <li>so I can make BIG curls too! :D</li>
            <li>Though it is more ringlets than curls</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Got to love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that the bulk of the heating elements are encased.  </li>
            <li>I made sure my husband was home</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this \\&quot;Curling\\</li>
            <li>But I love it</li>
            <li>I love It</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I Love it and am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to hold a curl and in most cases even get a curl.</li>
            <li>She is always wanting to do something with her hair, but she isn&#x27;t gifted in the hair styling department.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the fact that it does the curling for you, and the curls turn out great.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure the amount of hair you take every time to curl if you take in more quantity</li>
            <li>I even watched youtube videos to make sure to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at Kohl&#x27;s because I had a discount on top of the existing sale they were running on</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>TRY IT! :)</li>
            <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray.</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Okay - here&#x27;s the deal...</li>
            <li>It was much more helpful for me to watch a demo on YouTube.</li>
            <li>and I would be able to get SOME curl.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The more you try to shove in this thing, the more chance you have of getting your hair</li>
            <li>I love this curler.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this curler.</li>
            <li>and I feel in love.  </li>
            <li>I was given this ad a gift since I love having curly hair but just can&#x27;t curl my hair myself.</li>
            <li>So glad I took a chance--</li>
            <li>Thankfully my father and I were able to somehow, miraculously, get her hair out</li>
            <li>THERE ARE MUCH BETTER IRONS THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN.</li>
            <li>I love the timer - beep -</li>
            <li>it like the it but better curls with curling iron</li>
            <li>i truly love this item</li>
            <li>have now used this curler about 4 times, and have gotten better with it.</li>
            <li>The trick is to keep strand of hair to 1-2 inches at the widest point, and to make sure it all fits in the channel of the curler.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I give this to someone for Christmas and the love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was very impressed with the results!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a more defective product and should be banned.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>If i  just brush the top and finger brush the rest, my hair stays in more ringlet type curls which I don&#x27;t prefer but which suit my daughter well.</li>
            <li>I really really love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that it beeps to let me know when it&#x27;s done, I don&#x27;t even have to think about what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see them being able to do it themselves.  </li>
            <li>, I repeat, NEVER been able to get a curl in my hair.</li>
            <li>VIOLA - magic curls.</li>
            <li>I actually plugged this beautiful baby in at my desk at work, and used a pocket mirror to test it out, I couldn&#x27;t stand the wait!</li>
            <li>I did my entire head today and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li>I got better and faster</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Why so many?</li>
            <li>I love love love it</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>so it holds a curl better than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>and their hair holds for days because they have thicker, more voluminous hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>However there are many negatives for a beginner.  </li>
            <li>I love the result but it is daunting to use and takes forever doing one inch at a time.  </li>
            <li>Love it -</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>otherwise, I love the product.</li>
            <li>Most of you are probably lyrics worried by it pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li>they are usually more competitive on price.  </li>
            <li>I thought since it was shorter hair, the curl would be even better.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you read the directions.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair holds the curl better with this tool than it ever has with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>but i love it.  </li>
            <li>My wife found the perfect product; spoke that no woman should miss this product in your beauty kit and to arrange for parties and casual events, The money is excellent;</li>
            <li>I have never been able to use a curling iron to curl my hair without messing it up somehow.</li>
            <li>and I was so impressed that it only took a week to arrived!</li>
            <li>I love this item</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Hope it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>gave it three because i am hoping it will work better tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the curls this produces.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls end up more like waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Got many compliments.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and recommend it .</li>
            <li>Gave this to my daughter for Christmas, she is not as pleased with it as she imagined.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Sounded like a good invention, but isn&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li>this is going to eat my hair!&amp;#34; You will love it.</li>
            <li>This here invention is greater than sliced bread.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than chunky peanut butter.</li>
            <li>I look forward to getting better at it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you com through your hair</li>
            <li>If this issue could be eliminated, I&#x27;d gladly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The product itself, however, is great, and very adjustable to what you want.</li>
            <li>It doesnt curl like a babyliss, is more for a Gisele Bundchen hair looking</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li>thinking it would stop it from burning, instead it kept my hair from being able to come out.</li>
            <li>And I still love it and continue to use it.</li>
            <li>and then he was able to pry up on a piece with a screwdriver</li>
            <li>and I was able to get my hair out.</li>
            <li>but i think it&#x27;s better if you have somebody use this tool for you.</li>
            <li>i love the way it came out, but i can&#x27;t do it myself.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure the barrel opening is always facing your head to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product works well for some</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I swear this thing is magic.</li>
            <li>we love it.</li>
            <li>I really, really love it.</li>
            <li>I plan on curling my hair much more often.</li>
            <li>Be sure the item you are purchasing is authentic.</li>
            <li>since I only have one usable arm, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that the curls hold up to 3 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair forever and love beachy waves and curls, but can&#x27;t seem to get me hair to hold a curl with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Got it for my wife in December as a holiday gift and she is in love with how well it does her hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hair dryer!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but it can and will damage your hair, so make sure you follow the pictures on how to position the curler, and don&#x27;t overload it with hair</li>
            <li>On the top layers of my hair</li>
            <li>my wife love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this curler.  </li>
            <li>and I love the three settings that it has.</li>
            <li>and I love how it curls.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>In love for this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the monetary luxury of trying out different curlers, and this was a gift to me, and it does what it needs to do, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li>I love it and another thing...</li>
            <li>And it beeps when it&#x27;s done! :)</li>
            <li>it just kept sucking it up and tangling it more while continuing to heat her hair.  </li>
            <li>curls are awesome and last for a couple of days!</li>
            <li>I even cut my hair up to my shoulders to try to get this thing to work better for me before I returned it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this item!  </li>
            <li>the results are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love it and will never be without one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes perfect curls, and they last forever with no spray at all.</li>
            <li>Love the curls.</li>
            <li>I just wish it could take more hair in.</li>
            <li>Love this product &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>it and enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Maybe better for someone with shorter, layered hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>The girls in the family all love this product</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>I love this machine, I&#x27;ve bought it at Amazon</li>
            <li>Then it got more touchy.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But with this my hair comes out in perfect curls every time and actually stays all day, even through the night and my bed head.</li>
            <li>It is easy to do and very easy to pick up on...</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and now looks shiny, full and healthy with amazing curls.</li>
            <li>READ THE DIRECTIONS FIRST!!! :)</li>
            <li>The quality of the curl once you get it right is good.  </li>
            <li>The hair became so gorgeous that I want to go out right now and show it out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to follow and that if you do the directions step by step you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my fine hair and it really gives you a beautiful shiny curl.</li>
            <li>It was so fun and easy to use!!  </li>
            <li>Finally after about 45 minutes I was able to untangle my hair!!!  </li>
            <li>I grabbed it (HOT !!! ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to use it over and over again so that I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this thing very much, but it does to an awesome job.</li>
            <li>I was kind of nervous at first thinking this thing would pull my hair up into it as it curled, but this thing was amazing.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for her although I am drafted to curl her hair as I can get to the back of her hair more easily than she can.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>very simple and easy to use, perfect curls</li>
            <li>Easy to use, great fast way for beach waves.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great to do the entire head when u have more time!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look natural and beautiful, and theres no product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a fair amount of hair, medium length, and it took me about 15 min to do my whole head!</li>
            <li>cause I loved this product at first.</li>
            <li>I get a pretty good Colm Meaney-look out of this item.</li>
            <li>am thoroughly impressed with how long the curls hold.  </li>
            <li>Look ladies, I have a pretty good sense of humor</li>
            <li>My 11 year old can work this, supervised, and ends up with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>The day after style is just as beautiful with soft waves &amp; curls.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to be good at using this the first time.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job of curling hair.  </li>
            <li>I would say its a pretty good product</li>
            <li>It quit working as good as it did when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and get a good quality hot curler set instead, trust me.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good - takes patients</li>
            <li>It really needs some kind of safety release switch for when your hair gets stuck!</li>
            <li>It is truly easy to use, but it also creates the most beautiful and natural looking curls and waves.</li>
            <li>This is the golden gem of hair tools!!</li>
            <li>Love this it is so cool!</li>
            <li>So excited!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out myself!</li>
            <li>They need some way to safely remove hair since it is so easily tangled in this device.</li>
            <li>I have chin length hair and it seems easy and safe.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and I have yet to have my hair get caught or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>But if you are on the fence, pick this product up from somewhere that you can easily return it -- then the dilemma is solved :)</li>
            <li>My hair curls easily, but by the end of an 8-10 hour day, my curling wand curls have mostly fallen out (and that&#x27;s with A LOT of hairspray).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it has an anti tangle feature.</li>
            <li>i really love it easy to use zero problems .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased mine at Target (to make for an easy return) because I was SO sure I would be returning it</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Really good product, reason why my wife bought this product again for a gift to her sister, the product is as described and the quality according to my wife is really good, but the only issue we found this time is that the price was increased in almost 20 dollars.</li>
            <li>She now has curly, wavy shoulder length hair instead of pin straight thanks to this great product!</li>
            <li>Good seller, good overall experience.</li>
            <li>-wise, it is OK but curls do not hold up much longer than i wish</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at the great quality</li>
            <li>It makes perfect beautiful curls that last and last literally for days.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to keep it at the recommended 1/2 inch to inch piece of hair and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect!  Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>, it curls so amazingly and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very cool product.</li>
            <li>have used it multiple times, very easy to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li>This is a great little machine that really leaves you with beautiful amazing curls.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely useful and gives amazing results</li>
            <li>With his help we were able to practically rip my hair free of the darned thing, but not before the damage was done.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is tangle free before using.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I have magic perm hair (straight perm) and was still able to get perfect hair without drying my hair further more.</li>
            <li>It ended up being the best $100 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair</li>
            <li>Best $100 I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I read so many of the reviews that made it sound like my hair would be sucked up and claimed by this curler.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was my own fault.</li>
            <li>As you notice the commercials and even the youtube vids show ppl with healthy smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous about using it because you see so many cheap products on the market</li>
            <li>I had three more weeks of fabulous hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still messing with the settings to find out how to do looser curls, but the two times I&#x27;ve used it so far, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I thought the concept was good, but there are much easier ways to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel inside that is of  good quality  and the whole timer /settings procedure..</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bough one myself</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for me and loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter, too.</li>
            <li>My wife simply loved and she is using too much.</li>
            <li>, if you try to jam to much hair in it, it can tangle, so patience and it will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li>If you make sure that all of your hair is seated down in the groove of the curler, then you will have perfect curls every time.  </li>
            <li>One of the best &#x27;as seen on TV...&#x27;  things I&#x27;ve ever gotten - worked much better than expected!!  </li>
            <li>and I got to say conair got this one right!!</li>
            <li>They love how quick it curls hair, just make sure you dont put it in</li>
            <li>This thing is Super Awesome and can&#x27;t believe the price I totally scored..</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it on my clients and is well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This product works extremely well and curls my hair from the root to the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this curler and it was worth it!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great product to use!</li>
            <li>I have titanium fused wrists and other hand joints, so the curler is the best.</li>
            <li>This is the first product ever that made me love having curls!</li>
            <li>Best 100 dollars I ever spent!</li>
            <li>but it was the best 100.00 i ever spent!</li>
            <li>If they can manage to make a more user friendly lighter unit this would rock, but until then, if you purchase this, prepare for a killer arm workout.</li>
            <li>This thing is cool!  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and this curler is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy, easy, easy.  </li>

            <li>I was amazed this was soooo easy, and not once did my hair get hung in the curler.</li>
            <li>(For reference, my hair has gotten tangled in it before, but it&#x27;s been really easy to remove).</li>
            <li>but once you do its easy.</li>

            <li>Quickly returned!</li>
            <li>We were all so scared and it took us about 10 minutes to get her hair out safely (after I of course quickly unplugged the machine)</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to pull my hair out of the machine when it got stuck....</li>
            <li>Supper quick and works on any type of hair!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and love, love, love it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, very easy to use and gives professional results in very short time and leaves the hair looking great</li>
            <li>I was very nervous about dropping a hundred bucks on a hair styling tool of all things, but I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li>The look that this creates is a very beautiful mess of curls.</li>
            <li>The curler is very easy to operate and it is very fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like tight curls, so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good produto for those that is not faniliar to the regular curling, because it&#x27;s very easy to manage, but if you are good on the regular one,I think it&#x27;s not for you, because it takes more time &#x27;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;m not very skilled with my hair, so it&#x27;s always awesome to be able to respond, \\&quot;thank you!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really easy, but just make sure you are doing it right.</li>
            <li>and I had little to no problem with getting perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li>Love using it on my hair, and love it even more for my 3 year old!</li>
            <li>But I love it and would tell anyone interested to go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!!JUST BE CAREFUL YOUR HAIR DOES&#x27;NT GET CAUGHT IN IT.....</li>
            <li>While it does an excellent job of achieving a certain type of curl, it doesn&#x27;t  necessarily  replace a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and surprised!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super speedy or magical, but it&#x27;s a really good tool!</li>
            <li>very fast and easy!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and bought one anyway- and lost a huge chunk of my hair</li>
            <li>The 8, 10, or 12 seconds doesn&#x27;t stop accurately ( curling the hair to release).</li>
            <li>Cheap parts, cheap labor &#x3D; cheap product.</li>
            <li>Just amazing and unbelievable, beautiful and shiny curles, delivered in time.</li>
            <li>SO happy I bought it and will likely be giving for presents this year.</li>
            <li>Works great just wish you take bigger sections of hair though.</li>
            <li>price at Amazon is also fantastic</li>
            <li>I would have a great idea for next Christmas</li>
            <li>However, it is extreeeeeeemely important to follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron takes only 45 minutes and looks great.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t work that great back there, but everywhere else..works great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but when I needed to buy it, it wasn&#x27;t available, so I picked up locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would be more fun to do with a friend.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>But if you follow the instructions works great and the curls last.</li>
            <li>It has well job with hair and  nice style with fast work.</li>
            <li>but I did panic for a second lol.</li>
            <li>My husband bless his heart had to literally disassemble the unit in order to free my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately we did not have to cut her hair.</li>
            <li>I got it in 2 days with my Prime shipping and had to option of free returns.</li>
            <li>I love it, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>She tried it on about 5 different family members over our Christmas gathering and it worked great on all but one -she</li>
            <li>Also, if the hair is not coiled correctly, it lets you know with a beeping sound.</li>
            <li>the middle setting works great.  </li>
            <li>Tangling occurred when I didn&#x27;t have a smooth section.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had the kind of hair that no matter how much heat, styling, gel, or spray I use, my curls are falling out while I&#x27;m in the car on my way to the event.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions</li>
            <li>It work great and has multiple settings to customize for your hair.</li>
            <li>well I followed them and my hair still got stuck despite being detangled, smooth,</li>
            <li>is a list of the features that were important to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do enjoy how this curls your hair in a snap, without having to twist the iron around sections yourself.</li>
            <li>I used it on my friends with different types of hair and works great.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased another one and gave it to my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth once I am finished.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium texture, curly, blown smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic curl.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I bought this and after 6 uses and never letting it fall the cheap plastic gear on it</li>
            <li>I saw this in various stores &amp; wanted to see if it was as great as it claimed to be &amp; boy</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic curler.</li>
            <li>works great in the front but how in the WORLD am I supposed to do the back of my hair???</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would love this product, but being able to have something to make curling fun and easier</li>
            <li>It still wouldn&#x27;t come off so we had to rip my hair out just to be free from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She feels comfortable using it</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable letting her use it.</li>
            <li>The curls weren&#x27;t as smooth</li>
            <li>Curling my whole head of hair in 1/2 hour is amazing.</li>
            <li>Happy with product overall.</li>
            <li>the next day i woke up and it still looked great.</li>
            <li>Try to practice using it before you have some important thing to go to.</li>
            <li>great and her hair was still curly the next morning and it took about 16 minutes to curl all her hair.</li>
            <li>Admittedly my hair is smooth so that may help</li>
            <li>Even when my hair didn&#x27;t get stuck, the curler would sound the &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and foolproof.</li>
            <li>and she has great curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to do my own hair, would just wear it straight or in a ponytail, but this has changed my ways.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t grab it)  and tried to free her hair.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t make really fast curls out of second-day hair</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well and fast.</li>
            <li>She uses it regularly and her hair comes out great.</li>
            <li>However, after using it the 4th time, all it does is make a clicking sound when plugged in, I have tried what I could</li>
            <li>I liked it, is very practical.</li>
            <li>And twist the section of hair lightly</li>
            <li>it and enjoy it!ell.</li>
            <li>If your still tempted to get one, you can have mine for free, along with my scissors that i used.</li>
            <li>the safety sensor is a bit sensitive (which is good since it prevents tangled messes).  </li>
            <li>Be very diligent in reading the instructions, and make sure your hair is combed and without tangles, once you get started with this curler and figure it out, you will love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; you need to practice with it and make sure you don&#x27;t have too much hair in the device, or it may tangle.  </li>
            <li>so I broke the machine into many pieces to find that the guard that is between the motor and the heater part was not such a good guard.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it and might buy my mom one, if she is good. :)</li>
            <li>I loved the shape of curls produced by this tool, however, my hair frequently got stuck, even when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loved the way it&#x27;s curled my natural hair though</li>
            <li>my curls stayed perfect throughout the dinner and even till the next day after a whole nights sleep ( i did use hair spray</li>
            <li>but my curls have never been perfect and my curling irons seems to do so much damage to the ends especially.</li>
            <li>Long story short--I have NEVER gotten the beautiful to a fault curl after 3 wks.</li>
            <li>it curled perfectly and fast and the curls held overnight and into the next day.</li>
            <li>It does produce beautiful curls, though patience is a must because it can be time consuming for long hair like my daughter.</li>
            <li>Make sure you brush your hair really well, and if it gets stuck, make sure to brush it again, otherwise it WILL get caught in the barrel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the most important thing : do not let go of the strand right away (</li>
            <li>So just to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li>We followed all the instructions and made sure the right part was facing our head every time we curled a strand of air.</li>
            <li>This was just so easy and so cool.  </li>
            <li>With this product you need to absolutely make sure your hair is clean and tangle free!</li>
            <li>I saw some video reviews on YouTube before ordering, one said ir was great and the other wasn&#x27;t able to get the handlg of it.</li>
            <li>You know when you see those infomercials and everything they say seem too easy to be true?</li>
            <li>Rushing through is the perfect recipe for a mess!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also curls my perfectly straight uncurling hair and it stays all day!!!</li>
            <li>And this did it for me, on the first try, in 20 minutes!!  </li>
            <li>Curls last forever and they are so stinkin&#x27; cute!!  </li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t even get hot!!</li>
            <li>i like it soo much!!!</li>
            <li>Overall this tool does it&#x27;s job very nicely and again matches</li>
            <li>She found it very useful for all her requirements.</li>
            <li>Very fun takes some time to learn how to use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to be patient and don&#x27;t try to rush it, then you won&#x27;t have any problems and it will be surprisingly quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well even when its clean!!</li>
            <li>but once you figure it out it&#x27;s super easy).</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>so she needs something quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for a quick and easy way to give my hair some style.</li>
            <li>This is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I bought this at Target just in case I needed a QUICK AND EASY return</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick to heat up, easy to use</li>
            <li>This really work, is very very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It is very easy to get hair tangled in it unless your hair is perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to learn to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is also important to get the best results to have clean hair with no or very little product and comb out all tangles.  </li>
            <li>so if you do want some really nice curls you need to have it on high.</li>
            <li>my wife love it very much</li>
            <li>If you like curls of any kind, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It works magic and ur job gets so easy and done much faster..</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, just make sure not to try to curl too much hair at once.  </li>
            <li>It is easy, just go slow and the curle look great!</li>
            <li>This really works well - curls your head within minutes - easy to do on my daughter - have yet to try on myself :)</li>
            <li>I used this about 3 times and it worked really good, except I had to wait for it to warm up again half way through doing my hair.  </li>
            <li>And as everyone else states, stay calm if your hair gets stuck!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU, Conair, for such an AMAZING product!</li>
            <li>First time I can get a curly hair for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>the results are worth it!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>not so great with really long hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this (first time) on my daughter&#x27;s ponytail and it came out really cute.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>You also have to make sure your hair is brushed PERFECTLY if its not separated and brushed neat it will eat your hair.</li>
            <li>She was so excited to use it until her hair got caught in it.</li>
            <li>Daughter was so excited to get it that she ripped box up.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it, I was in love.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price tag!</li>
            <li>It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Way better than the hot rollers I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>Well, after reading many reviews, watching lots of customer demo videos, and much consideration, I bit the bullet and bought this!</li>
            <li>What a fun product!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was ok -</li>
            <li>First I part the lower 1/4 of my hair with a comb and clip the rest to the top my head.  </li>
            <li>This works great if you have long hair.</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much!</li>
            <li>The Idea Is Unique</li>
            <li>Buy it and have fun this summer with your curlers!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it that I opened it immediately and read the directions and started curling away.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about it, I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This has to be the BEST beauty product I have bought for the past 10 years....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great! :/</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I put the top section of my hair up in a clippy, and do the bottom part first.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this for myself</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more curling my hair when I can use hot sticks and have curly hair in 5 min.</li>
            <li>but it is DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li>and I got excited but thought &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>I was really excited to order it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on long term durability but for now it works great.</li>
            <li>and she was so excited to see her princess curls.</li>
            <li>First of all, most of the times when I tried it, my hair got stuck and I had to yank it out.</li>
            <li>This product was also reviewed on WNEP-16 news and Kurt Aaron proved its worth!</li>
            <li>I love this invention, and so fast!</li>
            <li>This is truly a unique curling device.</li>
            <li>It worth the money!</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would do :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this curler so much!</li>
            <li>its worth the money!</li>
            <li>I have used it on myself (my hair is quite long) and it works great.</li>
            <li>Even with a straightener though, you have to use small strands to get best results.</li>
            <li>Love this, but my hair still won&#x27;t hold a curl ;)</li>
            <li>Ok first off..</li>
            <li>like I originally wanted.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hard to curl hair and it curls wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this curler today</li>
            <li>It works great and as long as you follow the instruction your hair won&#x27;t be caught in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>This is my first, I just love that fact though, after having to use straighteners before and burning my ear or hand.</li>
            <li>This worked great on it and the curls hold for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I rarely even leave reviews, but this works!</li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it takes less time to curl my hair and each curl comes out awesome if done right.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair that never keeps a curl, and I&#x27;ve spend $$$ (esp.</li>
            <li>that is true, you get too much and it&#x27;ll get caught, but hair comes out easy and just move on.. :)</li>
            <li>It made a very limp and lifeless wave at best.</li>
            <li>The clip-less interior combined with perfect all-around heating really does make curls last longer (just don&#x27;t touch until they are cool!).  </li>
            <li>found that if your lightly brush after the curl, you get a soft wavy look that also looks nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curls hold all day too which was a huge concern that was quickly dismissed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is, be sure to open the tool and kind of \\&quot;dump\\&quot; the curl out of the barrel.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but you need squeaky clean hair in order to get the curls you want.</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to use, one</li>
            <li>I would recommended that all girls get one or your really missing out on something great:)</li>
            <li>clean your hair throughly</li>
            <li>I ordered it with the ONE product and that really helps my hair look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It says that you have to use clean hair in it</li>
            <li>It does say to use with clean hair</li>
            <li>The amount of hair you can put into this thing is a lot smaller than you would put in rollers, but the curls are beautiful with no weird bends or crimps.</li>
            <li>Fun to use and effective on a very troublesome type of hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s lightweight and not cumbersome, it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the positive reviews I reiterate &amp;#34;read the instructions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li>It most definitely works best on shorter hair but for those of us with long locks; save your money &amp; seek out another device.  </li>
            <li>Comb small pieces of hair, make sure no tangles, glides hair into the chamber and beeps when  the curl is ready and you release the handle and out comes a perfect curl.</li>
            <li>I barely knew what I was doing because doing your own hair in a mirror wasn&#x27;t as easy as doing someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It can get hung up if you don&#x27;t do it just right but untangles easy</li>
            <li>and I think its more user error, if you to stick to large of sections in it they will get tangled, and stuck and your hair will burn a bit.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your strands of hair you put in the chamber are not to large or it won&#x27;t take the hair.  </li>
            <li>Instead I use it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>We were almost to the point of smashing the device with a hammer when I was able to hold the unit at a certain angle</li>
            <li>People are right when they say it&#x27;s idiot-proof!  </li>
            <li>it slides right out!</li>
            <li>I got this after reading such good reviews on it, finding that there were way more positive reviews than negative.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it is super fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>but if your anything like me and have a hard time getting perfect curls</li>
            <li>Works for very good for long straight hair.</li>
            <li>Loved it easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t fall down easy, its stays the sane till the end of the day</li>
            <li>GREAT JUST BE CAREFUL HAIR</li>
            <li>Following the success of the 1997 movie of the same name, featuring a long-haired Nicholas Cage, many of us were delighted by the introduction of the Conair line of styling tools, which allowed do-it-yourselfers to achieve Hollywood-quality hair in our own homes.</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT: If the warning beeps sound, STOP at once and completely release the hair.</li>
            <li>was a present for my granddaughter, she loved it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite doing most of the work, this curler isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;time saver&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I can get a full head of curl in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I woke up Christmas day and still had a full look, just needed to run over it and tune it up.  </li>
            <li>After much effort we were able to get my hair out, but it was burnt.  </li>
            <li>she can curl her own hair professionally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li>Much easier and better than curlers.</li>
            <li>i love it too much</li>
            <li>I have really healthy, but straight hair.</li>
            <li>Wait until your curler is cool and then twirl that thing around in the chamber</li>
            <li>Really cool device.</li>
            <li>but now my dreams come true with Conair.</li>
            <li>If I was to section my hair off this way and use a regular iron, I&#x27;d be there for a good hour.  </li>
            <li>I waited for the curls to cool, put some smoothing cream in,</li>
            <li>I slept on them last night, they still look good today.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend so much money on  this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>full body curls, like you see in magazines.</li>
            <li>I read online that this is perfect for people with thick hair; thus I bought this.</li>
            <li>i already have a curly hair but every once in a while you would like a nice curl rather than a natural messed up</li>
            <li>the next day takes a good 30 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is more straight and finer than mine, but she loves it, too.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it just looked too cool to pass up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different curling irons and can&#x27;t get any sort of curl that looks good</li>
            <li>Actually, my friend tested mine yesterday and loved it too.</li>
            <li>You really dont have to be skilled to use it.</li>
            <li>The curls lasted all day, they were full and bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I loved the simplicity of the curling machine and tried a different brand - Conair.</li>
            <li>With the curler, My 11 year old can now curl her own hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many curling irons before and really did not like the results.</li>
            <li>Really Works, Love this.  </li>
            <li>they even looked good the next morning after sleeping on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always had true using curling irons and rollers.</li>
            <li>Bought two of them, seems really cool.</li>
            <li>In just a few minutes and with total ease I create the perfect look, and I am actually enjoying it because it is so easy.</li>
            <li>But if you watch some YouTube videos and you&#x27;re careful with it until you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll be your new best friend.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this item, I was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve - the machine must be the right way around and hair must be tangle free.</li>
            <li>My hair got caught really easily and when it gets caught in a hot iron...</li>
            <li>My hair came out of it pretty easy</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it was so easy.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend that you first read the instructions in order not to have any problems or hair</li>
            <li>It really is super cool</li>
            <li>It is so easy and fast!  </li>
            <li>this is easy to use and it really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to new products like this, and I CANNOT believe how well and easily this works!</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine, smooth hair that looks nice curled...</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Love the curls and use it myself! :O)</li>
            <li>This curling iron is definitely a little intimidating, but after the very first use, I loved it!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to have the styler facing your head in the right direction, only use 1/2&amp;#34; - 1&amp;#34; sections of hair, and make sure your hair is tangle and product free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this new way of curling my hair!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this new hair product!</li>
            <li>Worked fine the first time, but I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>The best thing since sliced bread... seriously.</li>
            <li>Now I can seriously say that this one is one of must haves for women, you may not have  as perfect hairstyle as you can get from proffesional</li>
            <li>However my fine business in the front party in the rear is a real treat!</li>
            <li>Whoosh, the hair is drawn quickly in and curled.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>Even when my hair got tangled it did not hurt because it quickly releases it.</li>
            <li>You quickly get a feel for it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clearly part the sections of hair you wish to be heated into curly goodness and that they are tangle free.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep the open, circular end at the top, facing the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;ve had not catastrophic disasters.</li>
            <li>And it beeps quickly when it&#x27;s done with the curl.</li>
            <li>For me to have very well defined waves and a few ringlets after sleeping on it is an EXCELLENT result.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I end with the top of my head, which helps to achieve more volume.  </li>
            <li>I quickly unplugged it and had to get my daughter and husband to help me get my hair out.  </li>
            <li>You can curl your hair rather quickly with it.  </li>
            <li>And it gets it done quickly.</li>
            <li>Not only did they stay all night, but my hair was still perfectly curled the next day!</li>
            <li>item is super picky about how you hold it</li>
            <li>Product got to me quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick,</li>
            <li>The seller sent my gift quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li>I may do more research on the authentic MiraCurl and end up ordering that in the future.</li>
            <li>and I quickly became aggravated with the amount of time it took to curl my hair with a curling iron</li>
            <li>and it quickly curls your hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I immediately unplugged it hoping my hair wouldn&#x27;t burn off, and luckily it didnt, but I still couldn&#x27;t get my hair out...</li>
            <li>This machine is a miracle to me - the first time I have finally had the kind of hair I always wanted!</li>
            <li>The best part is that somehow the curls last all day vs. traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a cancel or release button to get your hair out of the curler if this happens so panic quickly ensues.</li>
            <li>You have to yank your hair out of the curler (and yes, hair also gets yanked out of your head) as quickly as you can since it can burn your hair while its stuck in there.</li>
            <li>I got this for my Mom for Christmas, and her hair used to be naturally super curly but now has straightened out to a wave.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for a v2 that will accommodate more hair - a quantity more similar to what a curling iron or electric hairsetter would accommodate.  </li>
            <li>, just quick movements of the handle)</li>
            <li>I was lucky and didn&#x27;t burn my hair</li>
            <li>You get the hang of it really quickly.</li>
            <li>Its quick and the curl lasts all day</li>
            <li>As advertised, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>This tool made me look like a super model.</li>
            <li>So far the return policy on prime seems very easy.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the tangles were very easy to clear.  </li>
            <li>To be completely HONEST, I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because of a major hair catastrophe.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the only thing I must warn you about is also the best quality of the machine: the vacuum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apart from that, all other is fine and good.</li>
            <li>I excitedly, and hurriedly, read the instructions on how to use the product and began right away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A high quality curling iron and some practice would be a much better investment.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curler, just please make sure you read the directions, and watch youtube videos</li>
            <li>Mostly people thought I just came from a high class salon.</li>
            <li>Love the tool and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Did my daughters very long straight hair and it came out beautifully.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast!  </li>
            <li>I get my hair chemically straightened, so I had pretty much relinquished the ability of my hair ever being able to have it hold a curl (since I opted out of the curly-haired life) though every once in awhile for a special occasion</li>
            <li>and it is difficult if not some times impossible to curl and this amazing product actually produces wonderful curls and waves on my hair that will stay all day without any hair spray if I wish and with hair spray it is beautiful and perfectly curled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my own hair with a curling iron and all other curlers have looked unnatural or haven&#x27;t held.</li>
            <li>The very first curl got stuck.</li>
            <li>I followed instructions but it still grabbed my hair &amp; got them stuck in it the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does not get very hot</li>
            <li>My daughter has average, shoulder length hair and works great on her too.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic, and my wife absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot .</li>
            <li>At first I struggled finding a comfortable way to hold the styler.</li>
            <li>;-) its been 4 hours now and my hair still looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it is by no means light weight.</li>
            <li>Another thing id like to add is that my hair does not hold curl well, its very straight but the curls from using this thing lasted all day!</li>
            <li>Every time I tried, it took too long, I burned myself, the curls never looked good, and were gone in minutes.</li>
            <li>For long hair it will curl a fair length</li>
            <li>I have wavy extensions down to my rear and this curler worked great.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve when using it, but once you get it down your great.</li>
            <li>That should be quick, easy, and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some getting used to, especially on the right side of my head, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Came in sealed in the original packaging in brand spanking new conditions!!!</li>
            <li>When using this tool against your scalp, the more fanned-out your hair is at the top near your scalp, the more likely the tool is to get stuck and rip your hair out.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty aid.</li>
            <li>Right after curling a length it has to cool for a bit so the curl can set.  </li>
            <li>Gave me nice curls on my very long fine hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and performs very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>In Infiniti Pro is totally simple to use and gives me nice full curls and they are long-lasting too.  </li>
            <li>try to rush by putting too much hair in at once or it can tangle, but it does have the ability to detangle easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li>It is just as fast and easy as the commercials show.</li>
            <li>The pro curl gives me a perfect long lasting curl every time.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and you will have a perfect long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>This product was super exciting to me.</li>
            <li>unit was fast to heat up and fairly easy for me to use on my daughters</li>
            <li>this is a really fun product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>but overall I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only once, but I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>but it works as advertised and produces a pretty look!</li>
            <li>Wifes red hair to waist, awsome curls, love it!</li>
            <li>This really works if you follow direction correctly!!</li>
            <li>Everything the commercial says it is and more!</li>
            <li>Overall, I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I knew everything about this product first!</li>
            <li>My hair is a little more than shoulder length and it takes around 20 minutes to do but looks adorable!</li>
            <li>, it took me 10 minutes to do my whole head !!</li>
            <li>was hesitant at first but this product delivers!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend said it was his favorite look, called it my wild hair!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sitting here at work sitting pretty with LOTS of curls!  </li>
            <li>VERY UPSET!This Contraption is a NIGHTMARE!!</li>
            <li>so you can see what I did on my FIRST try!</li>
            <li>Thank you,,,,, My 2 daughters really like them!!</li>
            <li>It holds curls better than standard curling iron and easy.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that falls to around my shoulder blades, and it has been my mother&#x27;s lifetime grievance that it refuses to hold a curl - not even when threatened with copious amounts of hairspray, mousse, or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put too much hair in and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight by the way.</li>
            <li>She has straight, fine hair and whenever I curled it and hair sprayed the heck out of it</li>
            <li>I have fine  hair and not too much of it.</li>
            <li>You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair or it gets tangled</li>
            <li>Works great on my little girls.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about the product because the first few curls looked great</li>
            <li>For me, the 12-second timer on high with small pieces makes perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li>This product creates beautiful springy curls with virtually very little effort.  </li>
            <li>Gave me amazing curls without having to worry about burning myself like with a regular curler.</li>
            <li>Hair will tangle if it is not combed smooth and if too much hair is fed into the machine.</li>
            <li>anyway, i tried it last night and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>The curls look amazing and last for days.</li>
            <li>make sure your hair is clean, dry and tangle free and</li>
            <li>whole sucking in and the sound of the machine might seem scary...but relax...</li>
            <li>I have never in my life gotten such amazing curls as I do with this product.  </li>
            <li>but as I read the instructions &amp; calmly tried it out, it became my friend.  </li>
            <li>I used this on second day hair and it worked amazing.</li>
            <li>yadda yadda, some beeping, stay calm...</li>
            <li>Stay calm and wait for the beeps.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li>Once finished and combed through (finger combing),  you get amazing curls that last!  </li>
            <li>But worth it.</li>
            <li>And that is extremely rare when it comes to any hair product.  </li>
            <li>But  it may be worth it</li>
            <li>I could never accomplish this on my own with a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try to do something fun with some all-over curls in my hair for some upcoming events this summer, and I have no patience for curlers or curling irons.</li>
            <li>also think it is worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li>We had to cut it out of her hair after trying to take it apart with out success.  </li>
            <li>I had seen it and similar things (Another popular hairstyling product maker makes one also) advertised.</li>
            <li>I have tried many curling irons/tools and this is by far the greatest!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool product.</li>
            <li>Now my teen can curl her own hair instead of me standing there for 20-30 min, she does her own hair up in about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I could see a person with thinner hair having success with the tool.  </li>
            <li>Curls last for 2 days nicely..</li>
            <li>make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled and use reasonable sections-large sections of hair get caught up.&lt;br /&gt;Getting &amp;#34;caught up&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the end of the world, you just gently pull, and voila!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Love this for my 11 year old.</li>
            <li>but, if you want fun wavy curls that add bounce, this is it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re golden.  </li>
            <li>Third (and most importantly)</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to use.</li>
            <li>Makes curling my hair FUN</li>
            <li>This was WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>Of course, I have no idea how to curl hair; for me, this product is worth every penny of</li>
            <li>soon as I got the product, I tried to use it and it didn&#x27;t work properly, it didn&#x27;t get warm.</li>
            <li>I just make one twist in the section I&#x27;m curling to feed it through easier, rarely get hair caught.</li>
            <li>Still, pretty cool</li>
            <li>There is no brush inside the motor, so it&#x27;s not like your hair is catching on internal bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(but I feel it&#x27;s worth it -- try using an Ulta 20% off coupon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $100.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>The curl secret kept perfect curls all night and that&#x27;s with her flipping and running around.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I watched a couple of YouTubers try it out and decided it was worth an investment.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do your research on the product and see if similar products are available cheaper.</li>
            <li>the curls were nice however it would take forever to do an entire head of hair.  </li>
            <li>this one is one of the cheapest ones and it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>#34;You got your hair all fixed up or something&amp;#34; ok, he&#x27;s 19.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the cheap traditional curling irons</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>The maker of Curl Secret is my best friend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s curled, it feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>It is also fun to watch your hair get pulls into the chamber .....</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this thing is actually worth the money.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried it on 5 different people including my own</li>
            <li>and i love love love that the curls stay till the next day , and when you go to touch up the curl the next day</li>
            <li>If I put more than two inches of my thin shoulder length hair in then it will either get caught in the chamber or not do a great job.</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing it away because I didn&#x27;t want to tell anyone it was worth using.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It NEVER curl it worth a damn.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the money</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t think it was worth the  amount of money it cost.</li>
            <li>She thinks it was worth the money,but then again, her mother bought it.</li>
            <li>The curls come out silky smooth, makes my hair look healthy, and -- I never thought I&#x27;s ever say this -- but the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>rarely submit reviews</li>
            <li>This curling magic wand gives me natural curls that make me look like I have a spiral perm.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting nearly 6 months to write this review, I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair that good because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li>But, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>It takes awhile to do all your hair, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>A Fun concept...but not for me.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron does its job, and the output is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>With the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret all I do is put in a strip of hair and presto, I have the perfect curl.</li>
            <li>The manufacturers of this product brag about how there are &amp;#34;built in features&amp;#34; to make sure your hair &amp;#34;never gets stuck&amp;#34; which is obviously a complete lie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy like most people are saying.</li>
            <li>This is going to be so much fun to use</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(you dont wanna fry ur hair lol), This will take quite sometimes to finish ur whole hair since it only takes a bit of hair at a time, it will stop if ur hair gets tangle or you put in too much at once.</li>
            <li>I think its worth the money</li>
            <li>My wife has long hair which is now perfectly curled &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34;  long hair.</li>
            <li>it worth the money</li>
            <li>Its pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much hair, face it th e correct way and make sure your hair is brushed well.</li>
            <li>so I thought it&#x27;d be useful, but the machine tangles my hair a lot</li>
            <li>I do not think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>When used on different types of hair, it was not as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair one night, then used the Curl Secret and my curls turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with Curl Secret .</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>so much fun.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only got caught because of my own fault.</li>
            <li>Heck, I&#x27;ll go as far as to say it&#x27;s better than Reese&#x27;s peanut  butter cups (which for me is saying a lot).    </li>
            <li>While the concept &amp; design of this curler is incredible, its actual performance varies dramatically on different hair types.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth the $79.</li>
            <li>It have a lot of hair it worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the soft curls that I can create with my curl pro.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It goes very quickly if I use the high setting on medium and 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>First thing first: I leave feedbacks very rare.</li>
            <li>this works amazing well, is super simple and for the first time ever, i didn&#x27;t even have to use any hair products.</li>
            <li>I decided to research videos on this product, and over all they were very positive.</li>
            <li>Makes beautiful soft curls in her very long hair.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good if you want to curl a lot of hair very fast and very curly, not for cute little waves curls at the end.</li>
            <li>But really works exactly as advertised and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The best way I can explain the curls it gives for those with long hair is akin to that which you get after a day on the beach after the wind whips your hair dry.  </li>
            <li>The Curl Secret works amazing, never tangles my hair (that is very fine, easy to tangle).</li>
            <li>The description is pretty accurate as well as some of the positive reviews of the product.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to do curls like this in my hair before, it did catch my hair like 2 times but it beeps, stops and unroll it, I have used it so many times and other then those 2 times</li>
            <li>Since I wash my hair every other day, I am impressed that the curl lasts for the second day.</li>
            <li>I thought that the Curl Secret would be a great way to make curls quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I unplugged the contraption and yelled for my husband to quickly come help me, because by that point I was already smelling burnt hair (keep in mind this thing is HOT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty quick way to get curls</li>
            <li>The delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li>but you get the hang of it pretty quickly..</li>
            <li>My fine hair is pretty straight and never holds curl.</li>
            <li>For long hair, don&#x27;t try to curl more than 1/2 inch at a time!  </li>
            <li>I always used flat iron but never managed to get nice curls with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem using it then you are not doing it right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a spaz, but trying to get the correct side facing my head while looking in the mirror and alligning the hair right...</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>so I just opened it up and the hair came right out.  </li>
            <li>Also there is a certain way you have to hold this device with one special side facing your head, otherwise it does not curl at all..</li>
            <li>If it stops winding hair in and beeps, don&#x27;t pull it right out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is revolutionary and if you do it right, it will provide you with curls that will have folks in the office asking &amp;</li>
            <li>yes i had it pointed in the right direction.)</li>
            <li>We tried it out right after I gave it to her</li>
            <li>right and getting the hair inserted correctly,</li>
            <li>I packed it right up for return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend brushing or combing through the piece of hair right before you put it in the tool</li>
            <li>just got a screwdriver slid it under my hair and pulled it right out</li>
            <li>But when it starts to tangle, you can feel it, and if you let go right away you can avoid the tangle.  </li>
            <li>the curl always fell right away, but this has lasted all night.</li>
            <li>process but right off the bat</li>
            <li>I will probably have to keep experimenting to get the right combination of heat and timing before I get results</li>
            <li>The curls or waves come right out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The curler states right on it which side should go toward your head so the hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve always wanted spiral curls and could never get them right.</li>
            <li>you did it right.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recommend brushing it right before putting it in the curl-chamber.</li>
            <li>(the curls don&#x27;t last otherwise) or Caruso steam curlers if I want curls in my hair which last 1-2 days and works beautifully with no damage</li>
            <li>Using this for 2 months I haven&#x27;t really noticed my hair being any more damaged than normal.</li>
            <li>We really wanted to keep the machine for its great curls but decided it just was not worth the hair getting stuck, etc.</li>
            <li>As an aside, my hair is fine and straight and this was able to make my hair wavy, but did not hold the curl for more than a few hours, even with hairspray.  </li>
            <li>it in clean straight hair.</li>
            <li>A gift for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;She said - that it was very easy and simple to use it.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and while I have gotten my hair stuck I open the chamber as soon as I feel it pulling.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the curls last all day.  </li>
            <li>I know she says its a time consuming process, but when no other curling iron has held the curls in her hair we both love it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just grab a half inch of unkempt hair and expect a nice looking smooth</li>
            <li>it is super safe with no exposed parts that could burn your hand since the hair is heated from the inner chamber...</li>
            <li>It works best with straight soft hair (well brushed) and it can be finicky when I try to curl too much hair at one time, but all in all I love the curl and though I don&#x27;t understand why, the curl stays all day long!</li>
            <li>The girls looked amazing and held all day long.</li>
            <li>My hair usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl so this is working out great for me.  </li>
            <li>For 18 minutes styling time (and that was my first time), I feel this is well worth it, because my hair is going to have style and wave until I wash it</li>
            <li>Also a great feature: the beep lets you know when it&#x27;s set so no more overheating hair.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at curling small sections of your hair.  </li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions and restrict your sections of hair to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, this curling iron provides amazing, professional-looking results.</li>
            <li>I used the hottest setting with most time and barely got a curl.  </li>
            <li>so glad I gave this a try, and spent an hour or so learning how to use this - it is saving me so much time, AND giving me better results  </li>
            <li>It worked great a few times and then it ATE MY HAIR!</li>
            <li>It is very user friendly but you must read the instructions first.</li>
            <li>all, I liked the device and if I had long hair</li>
            <li>did my hair once and liked it but felt like it took so long</li>
            <li>The heat is perfect and can give those tight or big curls.</li>
            <li>My daughter has Down Syndrome and sensory wise hates curling irons.  </li>
            <li>tends to imply, but when you want to take the time to make the extra effort to look amazing, this certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>I do put a little spray on the top of my hair just to hold the top like i want it, but the curls, get nothing.  </li>
            <li>Minutes later, my hair separated into perfect Little Bo Peep corkscrew curls again.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it truely does make the perfect curl and it&#x27;s very easy to use and takes less time to use compared to a regular curling iron or wand.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is pretty damaged right now, so my curls are not retaining as well as the should.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you learn the right way to use it, it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>I have shorter hair - right at my shoulders and it looks so pretty.  </li>
            <li>It draws the hair into it very quickly - and if someone&#x27;s natural reaction is to hold onto the end of the section of hair being curled, well that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s going to get stuck.</li>
            <li>Looks so easy on TV, but made a wild nest out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Have used it several times and when used correctly, it makes beautiful curls without having to guess how long to keep your</li>
            <li>/&gt;The commercial made it looked effortless to create perfect curls in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions and curl your hair when it&#x27;s clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Even if I put it in a quick pony tail, I can make a couple of curls, and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This is surprisingly easy to use and makes a soft curl.</li>
            <li>My hair got stuck a few times but overall seems like it will be great!</li>
            <li>so easy to use my 3 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair that never stays curled.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair</li>
            <li>I even tried just doing a few accent pieces instead of my whole head, when I was in a hurry, and it still looked great and held.</li>
            <li>Even starting with it frizzy but brushed, it curls my hair great.</li>
            <li>I went back to my good old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li>First two curls came out great, then the third partition, it swallowed up by hair and just frizzed it up and left it all tangled.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with your average curling iron anyway, especially time wise.</li>
            <li>Once you know what&#x27;s going on, its super easy and you can get your hair done quickly, even with really long hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li>Gives nice loose curls</li>
            <li>I have incredibly straight and curl-resistant hair, and have previously never been able to maintain anything even *resembling</li>
            <li>she has very straight hair</li>
            <li>It was very fast to curl all my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl.</li>
            <li>The product was deliveried very fast and it is working</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
            <li>Very very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it if you have very straight hair.</li>
            <li>I was very very hesitant to buy it and</li>
            <li>Very fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>Also, good luck feeding more than a few hairs in at a time- if you put more than a few hairs in, it will beep, and stop working.</li>
            <li>It does get super hot, so make sure you use a protective hair product and don&#x27;t leave your hair in the curler for long periods or you will burn it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest those who have frizzy hair like myself to run a flat iron over the hair to get it nice and straight, and it makes it easier to separate sections of hair.</li>
            <li>I had a coupon and the store has super easy returns, and I just knew that I would return in the next day.</li>
            <li>Not only was it super easy to use</li>
            <li>I have straight, straight, straight hair that is also quite fine..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always dreaded curling my own hair for special occasions with the round iron...</li>
            <li>You need a bit of practice but after my first try I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Its pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>overall verdict is to follow the directions and enjoy some miraculous results!</li>
            <li>this thing just gave me style again for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I use a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium set on 40 to straighten it and a Hot Tools curler with a marcel grip to curl.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: curl the hair.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time tonight, and of course I got my hair stuck in it, twice.  </li>
            <li>and as you keep doing it you learn the exact amount to put in your hair.</li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning it was still pretty wavy.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I did get my hair tangled up inside the device.</li>
            <li>I love this thing and the curls would last 3</li>
            <li>It will make growing my hair in much easier to deal with!</li>
            <li>Absolutely luv this!</li>
            <li>I was able to curl everything in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use it the iron refused to release my hair.</li>
            <li>Did the under side of my hair first.  </li>
            <li>Yes your hair does get stuck on occasion, but never stuck enough to not be able to get it out, or to damage it.  </li>
            <li>Was hesitant to buy at first.</li>
            <li>but this thing is the absolute bomb!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have your hair brushed and sectioned</li>
            <li>Had difficulty at first while getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>Got it for Christmas and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>, it happened the first time she used it</li>
            <li>I think it would be harder on my own head of course.</li>
            <li>Only use an inch of hair at a time and make sure you are facing the open part of the curler to the head.always brush out each piece to make sure there are no snarls.</li>
            <li>Plus the return shipping instructions were elaborate and not that simple to understand.</li>
            <li>Real deal!</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I saw in the TV ad</li>
            <li>My first attempt terrified me because I thought the curler would never dislodge from my head.  </li>
            <li>Watched u-tube video &amp; read instructions first, didn&#x27;t have any problems using first time.</li>
            <li>Stick with curlers, hot rollers, curling iron...</li>
            <li>first - before I made my purchase on Amazon.com</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny to watch the folks who didn&#x27;t follow the instructions too, but hey, this will help you know what NOT to do ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply put, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>* a curl/wave for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>I have done a tutorial on this product and unboxing and first impressions check it out</li>
            <li>It started to pull and tangle my hair, so I let go of the tension to try to unwrap my hair and get it free, but I couldn&#x27;t - it was completely stuck inside of the machine.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to only put in about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thickness of hair in it at a time or the safety will not allow the hair to enter the chamber.</li>
            <li>This thing kicks ass and gives me curly locks for two days straight!</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who was a big fan of a curling wand, I like this product a lot better.</li>
            <li>I have wanted tgis since the first time I had seen it on TV but just could not bring myself to buy it for 119$ well when it went on sale I had to get it</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it though :)</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know if she loves it or not!)</li>
            <li>It really curls your hair well, and the curls stay in through out the day!</li>
            <li>However, after using it the first time I knew it was a winner.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>I pulled the cable from the wall and finally after burning and losing some of my hair, I was able to get it out of the spiral chamber.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got a section of my hair stuck in it too</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I was really careful to keep the barrel facing my head and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what its supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Hot rollers wont stay in my hair and</li>
            <li>Lower heat will give you looser curls and higher heat will give you tighter curls.  </li>
            <li>I think that if your hair has multiple layers the result may have ben better.  </li>
            <li>your hair retain curls or styling better,\\&quot; hot rollers, foam rollers, curling irons, etc.</li>
            <li>sure when you open the tool and release your hair that you don&#x27;t \\&quot;drag\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it was hot and could have burned my hair.</li>
            <li>Patience is a virtue and will be tested at first.</li>
            <li>It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be.  </li>
            <li>Over filling the compartment is why my hair was caught in the first place.</li>
            <li>First time out of the box it was usable.  </li>
            <li>I watched a tutorial on You Tube first, which I think it helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly like hers.</li>
            <li>and the anti-tangle feature REALLY works!</li>
            <li>it was exactly what my daughter was looking for.</li>
            <li>, I am absolutely amazed that it did!</li>
            <li>If she were take more time and do smaller sections, she could (most likely) get tigher curls.</li>
            <li>When is hot it smells plastic melted.</li>
            <li>until i realized that after the 8-12 second beep/hold you have to let go of the handle and let the curl drop out without touching the edges of the iron, rather than pulling the curl from the device as you would with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different ways to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried hot rollers, curling irons, curl wands, over night techniques, you name it.</li>
            <li>For my first time I used the highest setting out of fear that my curls would fall out by the end of the night if I used the lower settings.</li>
            <li>As for my hair getting tangled, it happened twice during my first use.</li>
            <li>Overall this is probably my favorite hair purchase ever.</li>
            <li>It is way too hot and the motor sounds like it had a problem the first time I attempted to use it.</li>
            <li>The heat is way too hot.</li>
            <li>Upon comparison to my original there were several significant differences.</li>
            <li>or else you will end up with more of a wave then an actual curve.</li>
            <li>The actual hot curler faces your head so just make sure you dont have it touch your skin</li>
            <li>so it most likely won&#x27;t get tangled up in it.</li>
            <li>This is much faster and easier!</li>
            <li>My first time I used it, my hair got caught and I had to unplug it and literally pull my hair out.</li>
            <li>Only recommend using some mousse before drying your hair to make sure the curls stay.</li>
            <li>And this is FAST!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Just used for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The curl turns out so much better with smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it</li>
            <li>My 14yo niece got her hair stuck in this curler on her first attempt at using it.  </li>
            <li>I did a better job on the left side of my head</li>
            <li>I love this but gave it only three stars as girls across the country will be loosing chunks of hair with it!  </li>
            <li>It takes me about 5 minutes to do my hair and for the first time in my life I feel like a hot woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I looked funny</li>
            <li>I really like the Infiniti Pro.!</li>
            <li>The curls come out so pretty.</li>
            <li>First time she used it, it took her over an hour to do.  </li>
            <li>I curled my hair in the morning and for the most part it lasted through the night, with some curls loosening only a</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments i&#x27;ve only used it twice</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used the highest and longest settings.</li>
            <li>but I really think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love that it takes ten minutes to curl my whole head!  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty idiot-proof, albeit, your hair can get caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put it so close to your head, I tried the same thing again and most of the time it worked, if not I moved it 3mm from the roots and blam, it worked.</li>
            <li>What else can I say, it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It was weird at first to get the hang of it, but even on the first try it produced that perfect curl!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but have been getting Keratin treatments for five years for smoothing, frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, the curls last for days.  </li>
            <li>As with most teenaged, she sleeps till the last minute</li>
            <li>My daughters hair got stuck in in first attempt.</li>
            <li>When this product first came out I didn&#x27;t run out and try it because I JUST KNEW it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>First time this was used was on my granddaughters hair.</li>
            <li>I want to give it more stars, but this second one stopped working again.</li>
            <li>Also, its beeping mechanism tells you exactly when a curl is done and the hair never comes out too hot.  </li>
            <li>My daughters hair got stuck the first time,</li>
            <li>At first I was worried after reading peoples horror stories of needing to cut off their hair because it got stuck in this styler.</li>
            <li>Plus, the next day they relaxed a bit more and gave a softer look.</li>
            <li>At first it looked like a weapon</li>
            <li>He has replaced my &amp;#34;HUGE&amp;#34; hot roller&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve written on a product, although before buying just about anything I always read the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I comb each section first.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried I thought I would have to cut my hair out as it was so stuck.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this product is how I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or ears like I always did with a traditional curling iron!</li>
            <li>The only directions were printed on the box and most of those were covered up by silver tape.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t find it worth the money even before it broke.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this one really works!  </li>
            <li>Use smaller pieces for a better curl</li>
            <li>Hair consistently gets caught and doesn&#x27;t hold a bit of curl longer than maybe 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It does hold curl now for the first time ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first curl came out</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s stuck... stuck on the inside chamber of the hot turning wheel.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised but you must follow the directions exactly as printed.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty smooth, naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>Sure enough breaking the product allowed me to get my hair out.</li>
            <li>Curls last more than a day for me.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my hair held a curl</li>
            <li>it makes up for it ;)</li>
            <li>To all those who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, etc... make sure you are doing it properly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you hold it til you hear the multiple beeps in a row.&lt;br /&gt;-Take</li>
            <li>At first the product does seem intimidating</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey as it sells for around $99.99 retail price</li>
            <li>fast shipping and works!</li>
            <li>But this product really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict: It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair which normally won&#x27;t keep a curl unless I spray my hair to death with hairspray but these curls stay intact about 85% with just a light spray of hairspray.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this Curler!!</li>
            <li>The first time I curled my hair</li>
            <li>Came exactly when I was told it would</li>
            <li>At the first time, I can&#x27;t use it well.</li>
            <li>first off when I received it already had hair caught in it.</li>
            <li>In fact, her cousin was interested in getting one for herself.</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Either I have a newer model or others did not use it correctly by reading the directions first..  </li>
            <li>she begged me for it ,but when she first tried it her hair got all stuck in this</li>
            <li>I only gave this 3 stars because it is priced higher than most retailers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to get the Babyliss one now, because I like the idea of alternating curls plus the higher max temperature.  </li>
            <li>it really works and curl holds for a while !</li>
            <li>It makes nice curls and does not tangle as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in it.</li>
            <li>Seems to curle hair much better on finer thinner hair such as my mullet.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like spending time reading through instructions, just make sure you hold it properly and put the part that says \\&quot;This side faces head\\&quot; towards your head before putting your hair in.  </li>
            <li>and when I woke up the curls looked exactly as they did the night before.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t work like the higher priced ones I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li>hot quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Love it, the curls last for days.</li>
            <li>Learned that mistake first hand because I had to cut my hair from it getting so fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because you close it, let it work its magic, and then open it up and let the curls fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t even used it 15 times and doesn&#x27;t curl like it did at first .</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this thing but was surprisingly impressed.</li>
            <li>and i waited 30-40 minutes before it get hot.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have been going back and forth on this for months now.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great, and well designed, but the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5th star is that sometimes the curls fall out a bit, and it does take a bit long.</li>
            <li>The first time I inplugged it</li>
            <li>All it did was made it hot</li>
            <li>He tried loosening some screws which did absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li>And make sure your hair is brushed and don&#x27;t overload the machine.</li>
            <li>the hair, the more likely it tangles&lt;</li>
            <li>but beware that you may find yourself doing exactly what I had to do.</li>
            <li>I love this product though because I FINALLY can have curls that I have wanted for 24 years!</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey</li>
            <li>Use hair clips to section off hair and start with the under hairs first.</li>
            <li>It really is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a curl I have not been able to get with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact I simply can&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t get hot or smoke.</li>
            <li>we read the instructions and followed them EXACTLY...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I was very patient and found that if I wanted this to work it would literally take about 2 hours to curl all of my hair!</li>
            <li>First try tangled my hair and got stuck in barrel.</li>
            <li>Watch youtube videos of how to first:</li>
            <li>cause I am 100% sure that the curls will last by tomorrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I will the tool with its head first inside the sock.</li>
            <li>, I will the tool with its head first inside the sock.</li>
            <li>It was exact what I was look for</li>
            <li>I think it would work better on short hair.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>Everyone should feel fancy ;)</li>
            <li>It gets two stars, though, because the few curls that it did produce were gorgeous.</li>
            <li>My mother said it looked messy, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>but you can have everyday beautiful natural looking curles.</li>
            <li>I loved this product used it alot but after getting my hair trapped in it and it burned my scalp and hair</li>
            <li>She has long hair and I though, voila, easy for her to get curls!  </li>
            <li>Curl normally falls out of my hair pretty quick</li>
            <li>If you have unruly, wild hair - give this a try and watch it tame your hair into beautiful bouncy waves.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair, and it curls with the right iron, but this would not curl the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>but it barely hurt and was easy to untangle.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more satisfying than hearing those little beeps that mean &amp;#34;Hey, your hair&#x27;s done!,&amp;#34; except maybe a good slice of pizza or my mom&#x27;s pie.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that actually WORKS in that the curl doesn&#x27;t completely drop out of my hair after a couple of hours but mellows into beautiful curls &amp; waves that last all day with just a bit of hairspray..</li>
            <li>That seems totally obvious, but really, the smaller you make the curls, the better they come out and the better they stay.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo2S5WH0O20YK59]]After reading the many reviews of this product, it still sounded too good to be true, but I at least had to try it because I am SO inept about how to get spiral curls to stay in my long hair.</li>
            <li>I am 51, and have used a curling iron most of my life, and a flat iron since 2008.</li>
            <li>I have never had such strong beautiful curls that seriously lasted for days.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s because my hair is kind of wavy, and the product make my hair goes the other way, so my hair gets kinky when I use it.</li>
            <li>It is easy, quick and takes the frustration out of curling my short, fine locks - even in the back.</li>
            <li>It looks a little intimidating, but it beeps and releases before your hair gets stuck and was very easy to use with a quick read of the instructions.</li>
            <li>This product makes beautiful curls but is also is very hard on your hair.</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more products I was able to use it would be nice to do something with my hair other than letting it simply dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the worst skilled person for beauty purposes and this was just so easy to use with great results!</li>
            <li>Surprised as even the instructional booklet explained that clean hair works</li>
            <li>to use - much safer than many on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I am a total klutz</li>
            <li>Skeptical spending this much but it works great!</li>
            <li>I can absolutely see why some people who try this out still prefer more traditional curling tools.</li>
            <li>and I was able to do my whole head of hair in under ten minutes.</li>
            <li>If done properly, your hair will be left absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I am considering getting a second one, just in case.</li>
            <li>It makes a loud beeping sound if you put in too much hair or if it starts to get caught.</li>
            <li>Honestly, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it, it&#x27;s intimidating, but it&#x27;s really a fun and awesome experience!</li>
            <li>Curles don&#x27;t last very long,but that&#x27;s better that I used to have.</li>
            <li>However my curl and bounce days are over and my poker straight hair only reaches the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Good curls, but curls only go only one way.  </li>
            <li>more than medium thick hair, maybe it would be better.</li>
            <li>After pulling for a good ten minutes it finally came away from my head taking a bug chunk of hair and scalp with it, my head was bleeding and I was in lots of pain for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It makes sure that only a reasonable amount of hair is being curled at a time, so every curl is prefect, and  I can just keep going until all my hair is curled.</li>
            <li>I learned pretty fast that if you put more than what you can fit inside the little hook then it&#x27;s going to get stuck.</li>
            <li>The device has to held a certain way in order to allow the hair to be pulled in properly and you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t trying to curl too much hair at one time.  </li>
            <li>Once the curls cooled you can brush them and they bounce right back, all day which is huge for me.  </li>
            <li>It dang near looked like it did right after I curled it!</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t line it up with your hair properly, it gets stuck pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>The positive aspect of this is that there is a unlocking feature that beeps and lets go of the hair automatically.</li>
            <li>Do not listen to the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Considering I&#x27;ve never been able to master using regular curling irons, I give this a 5 since I managed to get the whole head done without burning myself, and it looked good enough (the wavy, messy, just got out of bed look) to go straight out!!!  </li>
            <li>My hair curls easily with just about everything: hot rollers, foam curlers, hot sticks, curling irons, wands, flat iron, etc.  </li>
            <li>Pretty simple there.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how easy this is to use I absolutely love how long the curls stay in.</li>
            <li>I have a little longer than shoulder length, layered, very fine, very straight hair ( and lots of it!)</li>
            <li>Only warning is make sure you take smaller pieces it will start to tangle if hair isnt combed and if you try to curl huge pieces, but my hair has never got stuck in here.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t wait that long to get one.</li>
            <li>The first time it took about 45 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>Works ok, takes too long if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Of course, it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t blink until it was ready either, but it was hot when I used it</li>
            <li>I am pretty much a dyslexic when it comes to curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>way better results than I&#x27;ve had with a traditional curling iron or curling wand, and the curls last significantly longer than with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>My sister who has poker straight hair also used it, and the curls lasted the whole day!  </li>
            <li>I still love it and got my sister the same thing as gift, but now I am a bit more careful while I use it..</li>
            <li>Might work better on someone with long hair.</li>
            <li>Takes longer if you have long hair, but I love the turn out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>I was releasing on the first beep and nothing was really curling.</li>
            <li>First of all, it beeped and flashed if I put too much hair in it.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair just wants to be straight!  </li>
            <li>I had many tangles in my hair and my hair is long.</li>
            <li>I will stick with my hot curlers as these are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even regret paying that much ;)</li>
            <li>Works fantastically but make sure you have medium length to long hair.</li>
            <li>, I have a head full of soft wavy curls</li>
            <li>I was curious about this product for a long time, and was hesitant to buy it because it sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m addicted now and often curl my hair just before bedtime so that in the morning I have beautiful curls as I&#x27;m rushing out the door for work.</li>
            <li>I use thelowest setting, let it cool completely and then brush it well with a brush</li>
            <li>did not work for me, i have a curly short hair, and thought this one is a safe and quick way to get nice curls, but it&#x27;s too big and wide for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have the finest hair any hairdresser has ever seen, never been able to keep a curl in for more than an hour with anything else, my whole life, without putting so much hair gel in my hair was hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great on daughter that has thicker hair, other daughter (whom i actually purchased for) has straight thinner hair, doesn&#x27;t curl hair, even on highest and longest setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the curls last for days.</li>
            <li>I had curled half of my hair and the curls were nice.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but at some point your hair will likely get tangled in the chamber.</li>
            <li>But, seemed rather easy to use if it had actually worked.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair I was able to curl my hair with one practice run</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, it sounded easy enough</li>
            <li>I only got her hair tangled once or twice, but it came out easily with no damage.</li>
            <li>and make sure your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your hair is tangle free, and that you take small sections, and it should work well for you.</li>
            <li>but I like the results better if I used a dry hairspray before curling the hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and only takes minutes</li>
            <li>sure your hair is dry or the curls won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use dry hair with no products in it...</li>
            <li>Too big and bulky to use easily.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and creates curls that last until my hair is washed.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy and</li>
            <li>Works good only on really long hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply any product just to see how long they will last and surprisingly my curls lasted for the duration of my event.</li>
            <li>This is only good for hair that are long, waist level or longer.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, and I followed the instructions which provided excellent results.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair, whose is thick and full seems to curls just nicely.</li>
            <li>If you try to curl too large of a section, the hair will get caught.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t come out as curly as the description says it will when set to a certain setting.</li>
            <li>Be mindful that large locks of hair don&#x27;t work well in the auto-feed mechanism.</li>
            <li>It does take a certain touch to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>Make sure the locks are small enough that the device can pull and wrap effectively.</li>
            <li>Dream come true for me to be able to actually do something different with my hair and have it hold up</li>
            <li>, the first time I used it I went out and someone said Wow, I love your hair, you look 10 years younger!.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a new hair gadget and this one has been different than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on various heat settings - high when I do a &#x27;complete&#x27; curl, low when I do end curls - works great either way.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair and it took a very long time but the results were awesome</li>
            <li>But Curl Secret makes AMAZING curls easily and they stay without buckets of hair spray.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use on her long hair and the curl is consistent all the way to the end of her hair.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to turn it upside down and use it with my right hand with no problem.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this curler is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li>and I have short fine hair.</li>
            <li>The very first try with the Infiniti Pro Curl was a Big Success  </li>
            <li>I did just fine on one side, but when I would try to curl the opposite side, I was having difficulty trying to figure out how to hold it.</li>
            <li>This is the only machine that keeps my fine hair curled WITHOUT any product in my hair.</li>
            <li>Did not curl my extra fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes doing hair a simple and quick process!</li>
            <li>Take your time, get a not too thick section of hair and make sure you are holding it straight on the hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to do as you look in the mirror</li>
            <li>[...]  this video is a pretty decent demo, it&#x27;s what made me change my mind.    </li>
            <li>none of which come close to the curls this one gives...  I highly recommend.. just be smart and read the directions first on how to use it..</li>
            <li>It IS very high priced, but it works.</li>
            <li>It doesnt really work as the way it is expected to, even if your hair is super silky and no tangles!!</li>
            <li>I read all of the instructions first, which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I am left with gorgeous loose, bouncy SMOOTH big waves.</li>
            <li>Little moment of panic if hair gets stuck for a second, but once you get the hang of it it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Best curler on the market, just be careful not to get your hair tangled in it because its hard to get it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to curl my own hair and other peoples hair and it looks quiet professional.</li>
            <li>Have lost chunks of hair from it getting stuck in the machine and nor accurately spinning the hair back out.</li>
            <li>The Conair Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is a great product to order if you do not want to spend much time curling your hair.</li>
            <li>To do my entire head it takes about 45 minutes, but I have a lot of hair - great for doing just a few curls, too</li>
            <li>Of course when I ran my hand over my now burnt hair huge clumps were left in my hand.</li>
            <li>Purchased this on a recent trip to Canada as it was much cheaper than the Babyliss version available in Europe, and I didn&#x27;t want to splash out on that without knowing it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she has really straight hair and rarely holds curls..</li>
            <li>I really suck at doing my hair..</li>
            <li>I dont really have to do much.</li>
            <li>When I would get in a hurry or put too much hair in there, then it would birdsnest every time.  </li>
            <li>My daughters pooled their money and bought this contraption, I didn&#x27;t join in because I wasn&#x27;t going to be involved in spending that much for a hair curler</li>
            <li>and....I use it just as much as they do.</li>
            <li>The hair still has to be sectioned off and curled, however because the curler times each curl what this curler does do is take the guess work out of the whole process.</li>
            <li>I either had it too close to my head or put way too much hair into the chamber.</li>
            <li>and it takes me about 15 min to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>If this happens I turn the hair curler off and gently tug on my hair to unroll it out of the device.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s because my hair is much</li>
            <li>it absolutely does not reverse so the hair can release resulting in severe damage.</li>
            <li>I can do my hair in 30 minutes and my daughter&#x27;s hair in about 45 minutes (her hair is much thicker than mine).</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really afford to do my hair according to directions lest I be caught by my girls playing with a Christmas gift</li>
            <li>I feel that maybe people with longer hair who tried to have this device curl from close to their scalp might have the issue with too much hair being pulled into the device.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product feels cheap</li>
            <li>It has always stopped when I used too much hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li>and there really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you curl your hair I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>My 21 year daugther is very please.</li>
            <li>so much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll learn how much hair causes it to get stuck, gently pulling hair out has not been an issue if you go from side to side, doesn&#x27;t burn or break hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time to get used to how to hold it, how much hair to put in at one time,</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve in regards to figuring out the amount of hair you can fit in and trying to maneuver the iron at the back of your head.  </li>
            <li>Very seldom does it tangle her hair.</li>
            <li>, she doesn&#x27;t use it all that much</li>
            <li>I am so happy I purchased the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li>so my hair is very stubborn.</li>
            <li>I used it on my 5 year olds hair who has never let me curl her hair and always just wants a pony tail.</li>
            <li>and I think if you try to curl too much you might have issues.</li>
            <li>When I was trying to curl the whole length sometimes it would get caught in the mechanism.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this thing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I feel as if I have so much hair now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>With the wand it takes me about 2 hours to do my whole head and</li>
            <li>The product works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight</li>
            <li>produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a time saving device to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>, I will just curl select pieces on the top, and it looks adorable, and that takes only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>is very practical and It takes just a couple of minutes to do the whole hair.</li>
            <li>Reason being, is because when it twirls and curls my hair strands, it sort of smoothes them out, and makes them a neater curl, so when my whole head is done, i finger brush my hair, and with my fingers i separate the curls and toussle them.</li>
            <li>It really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li>One of the times I think I had too much hair in it.  </li>
            <li>That is, until I was all done and ready to finish the style.  </li>
            <li>but it really does.</li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>Curls really fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put too much or it will beep.</li>
            <li>put my curls in a hair clip recurled about three pieces and had a whole nother hairstyle  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my daughters hair which is straight</li>
            <li>We read the directions carefully as you have to be sure to align it just so, when you are putting the hair inside of the tube.  </li>
            <li>Every woman who wants curls shoud buy it.</li>
            <li>Each section of hair has to be held until the iron is done beeping and you can&#x27;t put too much in at one time.</li>
            <li>(If there was a problem, like too much hair, it beeped an alert and stopped the motor, so I didn’t need to worry about my hair being ripped out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure you practice with it a few times before using it for a big night out. :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much use for it since I got it.</li>
            <li>Very traumatic.  </li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it so fast</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care that much about ONE hair style -- and</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care that much about ONE hair style -- and</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>Do not try to feed too much hair into it.</li>
            <li>; is about as much as it can take.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>The feed will push your hair out a bit so you can release pressure on the clamp and pull it out, holding by the roots with your fingers and wiggling gently as you go.</li>
            <li>It really needs to be ran through twice.</li>
            <li>If you get too much hair in the iron, it will beep at you and won&#x27;t take your hair.</li>
            <li>I did my whole head</li>
            <li>but it didnt have much power.  </li>
            <li>I have permed my hair straight and now if I want curls I can use this.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t get my hair caught, it realized the hair completely straight.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way they are real.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Takes me about 20-30 min to do my whole</li>
            <li>..imagine a straight line from the insertion point to the end of the strand.</li>
            <li>and hold the strand in this straight line for a lil bit until the barrel gets it all in...</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon return service</li>
            <li>Its works really well.</li>
            <li>so it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>And, if you don&#x27;t want it very curly, you can create a lot of waves!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the curling mechanism ..</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li>and when it does curl it falls out fast  </li>
            <li>I had been blow drying my hair straight for years, which is a process.  </li>
            <li>It has saved me so much time getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Because I have so much hair, it took me an hour to put spirals in.</li>
            <li>it was always more of a drag than anything else</li>
            <li>I talked about it so much</li>
            <li>I am not using it as much has I thought I&lt;</li>
            <li>Then I tried this out with much patience.</li>
            <li>and then it wasn&#x27;t much curl at all.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>and I spent most of my time pulling my hair out of it.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had not ordered it cause</li>
            <li>you are not taking too much hair into it, because the machine can &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; you hair or burn it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would indicate this to a friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll make a different sound while curling.</li>
            <li>so be careful and make sure you follow instructions.</li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>a fast.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t really achieve the versatility of curls that the 1/2 - 1 inch barrel curling irons can.</li>
            <li>I get so much compliments</li>
            <li>Ended up having to physically break this in order to free her hair.  </li>
            <li>That is much easier said than done when your hair is smoking and tangled up.</li>
            <li>But shoulder length didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Really just easier to curl with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it!</li>
            <li>I waited patiently, with plans to curl my hair the very day I received it.  </li>
            <li>how not tired my arms felt and how un-singed my fingers</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>By accident I have put too much hair in and it beeps at me, informing me that it won&#x27;t accept the allotted hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair holds a style very well, so I assume it could go longer if I dared.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very much!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>but up until now I have never had a curling iron that added this much curl.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>If you try to put too much hair in the styler beeps and will not pull your hair in.</li>
            <li>The curls stay very well and it doesn&#x27;t shorten your hair like when you use a curling iron..</li>
            <li>a ready to go.  </li>
            <li>and this is really upseting because the product is anything but cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I normally straight iron but the curl</li>
            <li>The box arrived very beat up.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li>I was worried about spending so much on this if it wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
            <li>But, it is so fast</li>
            <li>If you try to put too much hair in at one time it just beeps at you and won&#x27;t pull the hair into the chamber.</li>
            <li>Also shipping was so fast ordered on a Thursday got it on tuesday.</li>
            <li>s really fast to use even in a day of work.</li>
            <li>Still expirimenting with it, but recommend this to anyone who wants to save time curling their hair.</li>
            <li>but it really do what the curls as promised.</li>
            <li>my whole life, I&#x27;ve told people my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl.</li>
            <li>and we were ready to go.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t pay much mind to</li>
            <li>My hairs really frizzy because of this now.</li>
            <li>so I figured that this thing really does work</li>
            <li>Absolutely mortifying.</li>
            <li>bears repeating that you absolutely MUST MUST MUST limit your sections to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be much easier.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this yesterday - have been really putting off getting it based on the price.  </li>
            <li>So it takes longer to be ready.</li>
            <li>I have used this for 14 days straight now</li>
            <li>and I feel like it takes forever because I have very thickl/long hair.  </li>
            <li>I think the price is a bit much for what it is but its this price everywhere</li>
            <li>and it really reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li>Now, I haven&#x27;t done my whole head because I am a mom and have no desire to spend an hour doing my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you can follow simple directions you will enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking they may have tried to curl too much hair at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had a tangle problem, however when I&#x27;ve tried to curl too much hair</li>
            <li>Works great with thin hair, which I have.</li>
            <li>I curl my whole hair with this in 5 min</li>
            <li>I can curl my hair when getting dressed, and by the time I get downstairs, it&#x27;s straight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was too much curl and fluffiness for my liking.</li>
            <li>Doing it this way, the style was much too \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; for my liking.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>If you try to insert too much hair at once, it won&#x27;t wind up.</li>
            <li>Much.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length straight as a stick hair cut in about 3 layers.</li>
            <li>so much for that</li>
            <li>, the Curl Secret worked great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s part of the dance, go with it, release the handle and gently untangle.</li>
            <li>but if you try to put in too much it beeps and releases.</li>
            <li>and then the curls fall out really fast.</li>
            <li>but you do for sure need to be careful.</li>
            <li>Tween daughter recd as a Christmas gift and it works very well.</li>
            <li>This stays much longer.  </li>
            <li>If you want a product that really works must buy this .</li>
            <li>highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s frizzy, it&#x27;s not quite straight</li>
            <li>Anyway, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well.</li>
            <li>and then it ends up being crunchy all day, and even then it doesnt hold very well.</li>
            <li>There is a safety feature that releases the hair if you put in too much.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice to figure out how much hair you can do at once, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Be carful not to use to much hair, or it gets tangled.</li>
            <li>The curls hold up very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times with fantastic results and have yet to get my hair tangled in this thing.  </li>
            <li>Not how the ends are frizzy with a regular curling iron but smooth Shirley Temple curls.  </li>
            <li>and I really recommended.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so much fuller and with the Babyliss curl</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I was very up in the air about shelling out 100.00 for this</li>
            <li>Gentle waves every day, just the look I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I really like this tool.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve got too much hair in there - take it out!!!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I urge you - DON&#x27;T try to stuff too much hair in the machine.  </li>
            <li>If the machine tells you it&#x27;s too much</li>
            <li>being said, I was happy enough with the product, despite the obvious user error, I bought a second one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had stick straight hair since birth.</li>
            <li>My children were really looking forward to using this for their dance performance and couldn&#x27;t because it stopped working.</li>
            <li>If you put too much hair in it it won&#x27;t work, if there&#x27;s a knot in the hair it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>i have straight hair.</li>
            <li>sometimes the hair just went through the curler, it&#x27;s still straight.</li>
            <li>Once your whole head is curled, you can leave the curls defined and spritz them with hairspray</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls in my hair, my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight, but it isn&#x27;t curly.</li>
            <li>We have a dedicated team ready to assist you.</li>
            <li>Curls stay the whole night.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described.</li>
            <li>I am really all thumbs when it comes to styling my hair...</li>
            <li>If I try to get too much hair in it stops itself, but there is no tugging or pain.  </li>
            <li>This Conair Curl was much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this curler!</li>
            <li>I could not finish curling my whole head</li>
            <li>People complain way too much.</li>
            <li>but very traumatic for both of us.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you put to much hair it gets stuck</li>
            <li>This tool really deserves it.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter, perfectly straight hair and a lot of patience, this curler might work for you.  </li>
            <li>And i know, people say to be patient a wait and be gentle.</li>
            <li>, stick straight, lifeless)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>we had to break it apart very tramatic and a $100.00 loss</li>
            <li>It really will not keep going if it is tangled.  </li>
            <li>But I really like the curls.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it very often.</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>I love the volume and texture I get with the Curl Secret, and I have received many compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m good for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 30-40 minutes at most to complete my entire head.</li>
            <li>Overall it actually does what it says, it curls your hair in nice ringlet curls and are even and uniform each time.</li>
            <li>I am the least talented person k know when it comes to styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves nice curls, but I had to use less hair, 12 seconds and high heat.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>It tells you to use this on clean hair which I do, but I have to use it right after I blow dry my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>It really does curl faster and I have waist long hair that does not curl easy.  </li>
            <li>long, easy, straight.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, and did love the results after much fumbling, dropping, &amp; accidental hitting-of-myself due to not being designed for the left-handed user...</li>
            <li>I had no trouble figuring it out right away.</li>
            <li>it makes hair curly easy as 1,2,3 and result lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, but I have really long hair</li>
            <li>tool is easy to use, and the time it takes is as long as it would be to straighten one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It does curl hair and is easy to use but does not work well on hair this long.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the curl holds all day long.</li>
            <li>so I just had to make sure to brush each piece and not put in to much at a time due to the length.  </li>
            <li>The long story short, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to watch the commercial than to do at home.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight baby fine hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li>Get just the right amount of curl by removing it after two single beeps or leaving it on for the full three beep timer.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to be proven wrong!    </li>
            <li>i was wondering how many other&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>the extra step in getting out of the house is worth it!  </li>
            <li>All curls are going to be the same size, but if you don&#x27;t mind that this is much more user friendly than other products.</li>
            <li>Beware - look for a different product as this one isn&#x27;t worth the price!</li>
            <li>A must-buy for people that normally can&#x27;t curl hair!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this curler after reading such rave reviews!  </li>
            <li>I have never had problems with my hair curling with any other curling irons (including many Conair ones), so it can&#x27;t be my hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased a different brand but a plastic part that operates the curling mechanism</li>
            <li>and the result is better than any other.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally have something that would give me the curls I&#x27;ve always longed for.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long hair and this curled my hair perfectly!!</li>
            <li>But other than that its pretty, easy to use and shipped on time and not damaged</li>
            <li>It requires some practice specially having long hair, I was in panic the first time my hair got stock In it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to curl!</li>
            <li>I was super excited when my fiancé bought this for me and was let down after my hair got stuck.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and is a frizzy mess unless I straighten it.</li>
            <li>We all have long to medium length hair, on the fine side.</li>
            <li>I put in the appropriate amount of hair and the first few curls</li>
            <li>I have fairly long hair, and, while fine, there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li>So I thought maybe because my hair is too fine &amp; too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this product out a couple different days on totally clean hair, next day clean hair</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you keep it closed and it will start beeping, but don&#x27;t open it until you hear the 4 quick beeps in a row.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, probably medium thickness.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but you must follow directions when it tells you to only curl small sections at a time or hair can get tangled inside curler.  </li>
            <li>As long as the hair is combed out smooth and not too much at once, tangles are not an issue.  </li>
            <li>I successfully did a few curls and then on the fourth one.....</li>
            <li>If a section wasn&#x27;t curled as much as I wanted, I&#x27;d let it cool and go back and feed it through again.  </li>
            <li>I have never spent this much on a hair curler, but this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>, i have long fine hair</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be scared away by that, as long as just don&#x27;t just let it linger in the chamber, it is totally fine.</li>
            <li>After seeing a video about it, thought to give it a try, but I was skeptical as it looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard, girls!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t curl much at all even on high setting.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair naturally</li>
            <li>highly recommend it for naturally straight and damage-free hair.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to it but was highly disappopinted</li>
            <li>Not true - mine just pulled a large chunk of hair out by the roots and more is tangled in the chamber.  </li>
            <li>strands of hair bigger than 1- 1.1/2 inches, holding the strand at an angle that does not permit easy insertion of the hair inside the barrel AND letting go of the strand of hair TOO quick ( if its a long strand).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it for special occasions, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have prior curling experience or lots of time to learn it.</li>
            <li>so deep Channel 11 news is runnin a special on you...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t  expect the right curl the first or second time.  </li>
            <li>That seems to be obvious, but because this appliance looks so easy to use it might be tempting to hand it over to a young kid to use.</li>
            <li>Someone else may have better luck if they have thin hair that curls easy.</li>
            <li>Such a fast quick gadget.  </li>
            <li>When all is said and done, I&#x27;d recommend Curl Secret to anyone looking for a quick, effective, and easy-to-use hair tool.</li>
            <li>a super pretty long curl comes out every time.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair and it usually can&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product gives such a nice ringlet curl that stays in even overnight.  </li>
            <li>have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>It is laborious and time consuming to curl all my hair in very small segments, but the end result for an event is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>found that if I just want a nice soft wave, I only hold it in my hair until the second beep.  </li>
            <li>First use almost scalped my 12 yr old, daughter.</li>
            <li>Thinking about moving those old &#x27;hot curlers&#x27; out.</li>
            <li>that at nearly 30, I still can&#x27;t do my hair ;-)  </li>
            <li>This is actually faster than a flat iron for me because my hair really fights being straight, but seems to love to curl.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works on long hair, though it works best on hair that&#x27;s above shoulder length to just past the shoulders in length.</li>
            <li>The curl is exactly as described and soft.</li>
            <li>normal curling my whole head would take 2 hours.</li>
            <li>But I was surprised that it really works!</li>
            <li>Finally I took he plunge, forked over the money--$117.00 with taxes, and brought it home, full of excitement and expectation.</li>
            <li>I am surprised Amazon is so much higher</li>
            <li>I find the curls look exactly like the infomercial, spiral and soft.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions, followed them, and everything worked exactly as said except for one major problem:  NO CURLS!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair myself &amp; when others have curled it for me, the curls don&#x27;t last long because I have such fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair which my whole life never really curled using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>but once you get that down (be a bit patient with yourself), you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will break when it falls down.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will break when it falls down.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair probably just touching the shoulder.  </li>
            <li>Took a few times to figure out the ideal setting for my hair, but curls are very pretty and last a lot longer than my previous curling iron.</li>
            <li>curls last long and very easy to use...</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how it would take my hair because its naturally really wavy and a little frizzy</li>
            <li>I cant live without it!</li>
            <li>The best past was it only took 20 minutes to do my hair instead of close to an hour and the curls were soft and flowing because I used next to no hair spray.</li>
            <li>great ,but hard to do the back of your head.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous and doesn&#x27;t take long to get your curls!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite frankly, this worked better than the $200 model and was half the price.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes on my day two dry hair I will lightly spray some thermal protection on my hair and let it try before I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>bought for the wife and it has cut the curling time in half with a lot better results.</li>
            <li>Make a perfect curl before this was almost impossible...</li>
            <li>It no way is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; or wonderful and the directions are idiotic.</li>
            <li>Even with spraying hair spray before and after, my hair would NOT hold the curls more than half a day...</li>
            <li>If I use a curling iron, the curls don&#x27;t stay in for more than a couple hours, even if I use half a can of hairspray.  </li>
            <li>It stood up to the test and even produced better results with the presence of the previous product.  </li>
            <li>I think the less hair you feed into it, the better the results.  </li>
            <li>main points:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one being any better.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super short</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple and quick to use,</li>
            <li>I have tried hot rollers, hot twisty rollers, curling irons, and regular rollers.  </li>
            <li>I regret reading all the reviews because I became more and more skeptical as I came across</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably get the knack of it with enough practice, but even then there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be able to do the back by myself.</li>
            <li>She tried doing it twice on this same setting and it only did a fraction better.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and straight, but this curled it nicely.</li>
            <li>I struggle constantly to curl my hair with a curling wand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li>The key is not to panic but to try and remain calm and GENTLY untangle your hair out of it.</li>
            <li>but I will need more time playing with it to get a half way decent hairstyle.</li>
            <li>The unit does stop when it senses a tangle, but it&#x27;s not perfect, so better to make sure hair is property prepared.</li>
            <li>While I did finally get the hang of it doing the front of my head, in order to do the back by &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I had many stuck panic moments and hair ripping.  </li>
            <li>My favorite curls come from this iron, only wish it took bigger areas of hair at one time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I did differently this time, but only had my hair get tangled once and the curls came out SO much better...</li>
            <li>The curls last - it is so worth the cost (which I was very hesitant about).  </li>
            <li>I finally caved thinking I would more than likely return it.  </li>
            <li>Very usefull and the product is very soft.</li>
            <li>As a very busy mom,  I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to fool around with my hair.  </li>
            <li>The curls come out nice and last much longer than conventional curlers.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the purchase, but not for daily use, definetly only for special occasions.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with your hair holding curl or want a more modern and professional looking curl, this tool is definitely worth the cost...and this is coming from a major cheapskate!</li>
            <li>I have quite long straight hair &amp; have used many different curling methods.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really have to put too much hair spray on to keep the curls lasting like I have to with the hot rollers.</li>
            <li>The curls turned out really well on the left side, on the right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy after the first few times.</li>
            <li>so I was super careful when I first tried it out.</li>
            <li>(thinking i might need to hold the hair in longer than the 12 seconds) for a tighter one, but if you do it correctly it will produce a cute tight</li>
            <li>Then again, at the rate these are being sold they just might keep the price high.</li>
            <li>It by no means matches the quality of a high quality curling iron.</li>
            <li>We had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I used high heat, 12 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As A Licensed Cosmetologist I Had High Expectations</li>
            <li>I have a high level of intelligence.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thick, hard to curl hair that easily tangles because it is so fine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend going on youtube and watching some instructional videos before using.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>If you use the high heat setting, the curls stay in until you wash your hair again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I started off with the high setting, but it started burning my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t curl my hair  even when I put it on high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and</li>
            <li>I even turned it up to high and 12 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>add to my review, I have pretty fine hair that falls a little below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have long hair down to the middle of my back and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I really love this little machine.</li>
            <li>The original is 77W, this fake is 55W (it takes more time to be hot).</li>
            <li>Broke a little more than 30 days after purchase and have yet to get through to customer service......other than that....</li>
            <li>I would like for the curls to be a little more tighter.</li>
            <li>It worked extremely good the first few times then it kinda didn&#x27;t work as well the other times .</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, I was able to move a little faster.</li>
            <li>I used a little hair product to help the curls set better.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that it&#x27;s pretty bulky, but it&#x27;s nothing to complain about since it works!</li>
            <li>This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, naturally wavy, long hair already.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and always seems limp, even when I use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Some times it&#x27;s hard for her to do parts of her hair on her own</li>
            <li>The best was when I tried it on my 14 year old granddaughter who was very skeptical.</li>
            <li>This curling device was by far better then the more expensive product &#x27;curl freak&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I tried to remain calm whenever this happened, but the last time just freaked me out.  </li>
            <li>The curls really weren&#x27;t uniform, but they looked natural.</li>
            <li>I expected more but in general this curling iron does its job.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to think when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I have hard to curl, very fine straight hair and this curls</li>
            <li>Hannah has straight hair and a sensitive head.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my 11 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>And I was honestly not impressed--and I look for any excuse to buy a product that makes great curls.</li>
            <li>After two or three tries, you&#x27;ll be doing it with a cheap curling iron in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you have hair that tends to have some natural wave or curl this works but stick straight</li>
            <li>Very Hollywood old style.  </li>
            <li>Our granddaughter&#x27;s very curly hair was turned into soft flowing curls.</li>
            <li>far I can do curly waves without much</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally somewhere between straight and frizzy.</li>
            <li>andjust do a few touch up pieces of hair on the top.</li>
            <li>so I tried to take her hair out as normal.</li>
            <li>This is a fun way to get a different look</li>
            <li>This gadget is so great, I used when my granddaughter was visiting, she has a mass of thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>I have learned a few tricks to using this tool that seem to make it better and easier for me, and each time I use it I get faster.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to use small bits of hair and make sure and clip away the hair you are not using until you are ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy enough to put my hair in this machine, I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough for curls to really curl.</li>
            <li>and my curls look normal - not a frizz fest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to practice a few more times before I try it on a work day.</li>
            <li>It gives me full, voluminous bouncy curls that hold all day long, even through treacherous weather.</li>
            <li>By the time I got the last of her hair curled, the first part had already went straight.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have normal hair(and</li>
            <li>At least five of my friends have purchased their own once they saw my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The time is set automatically allowing 3 paused beeps so that each strand of hair gets the same exact time of heat and then beeps 3 times (fast) when it is complete...then you can release and VOILA!!!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I tried this at a friend&#x27;s--she has no idea how to curl hair with a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li>I followed the pointers given, fresh trimmed hair, hold wand properly, smaller sections.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall worth the price fir someone who can&#x27;t use a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li>I read the instruction thoroughly and tried all method,but couldn&#x27;t make work normally.</li>
            <li>It takes me 50 minutes to straighten my hair to an acceptable level with irons or three batches of Big Curl hot rollers to curl it (and then the ends don&#x27;t curl because there is too much hair).</li>
            <li>My hair flattens within an hour normally.  </li>
            <li>The times you do, it is normally just a couple hair stuck in, so just pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus, it takes a long time to curl a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Glad I got and gave me long lasting curls without using hair spray!</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS struggled with normal curlers and never had the patience to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>I saw the Curl Secret, I laughed to myself and rolled my eyes in contempt.</li>
            <li>This curls nice, but I have really thick hair</li>
            <li>I think my only down fall on this product is that it makes your hair smell pretty burnt, but most heat products do that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, with high humidity, and the curl stays in -</li>
            <li>and I have very thick healthy hair and luckily its 28&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t notice the gap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really hard but does take some practice with the machine and practice to figure out what gives you the look you want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as hard as it may appear.  </li>
            <li>I only gave this product a 4 because, although I love the type of curls, they do not say very long.</li>
            <li>I had a few problems with it getting stuck when I put too much hair in, but it untangled easily.</li>
            <li>So simple and easy, you only have to hold it while it does all the work for you.</li>
            <li>She can now do all her own curling in half the time the traditional curler takes.</li>
            <li>We tried the curler on my hair, my daughters hair and her friend to have a good opinion because we all have different hair types and got nadda, like some of the other reviews our hair got tangled and if there was a curl, the bend did not warrant being called a curl or even a bend taking back for a refund</li>
            <li>This tool does to my hair what the Chi flat iron does to my hair, only it makes it curly instead of flat; but the point is that it is quick &amp; easy and</li>
            <li>This product is real simple to use and as people have said before, if you do it the right way you will not have problems.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so you just have to play with it until you find the right setting for you.</li>
            <li>You literally have to brush out every tiny amount of hair to perfection right before putting it in.</li>
            <li>I also found that if I use curling clips right after I make the curl and clip it up to my head while I finish curling the rest of my hair, the curls last longer.  </li>
            <li>But I figured out how to use it the right way and the second time I used it</li>
            <li>I could make right curls and left curls.</li>
            <li>only one time it didnt spin my hair up right so it automatically stops so it doesnt hurt you. ...</li>
            <li>All I had to do was release my grip to open it, and my hair came right out.  </li>
            <li>I curled my hair and after a ten hour work shift it was still as curly as right after I did it.</li>
            <li>There is no option to curl left or right.</li>
            <li>and once you open it, the hair comes right out.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews on here, and some were negative, but most were positive</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do so well for super long hair</li>
            <li>and my hair came out easily, no scissors required to free it!</li>
            <li>hair got caught a few times but overall I love this product!</li>
            <li>When I got it home, I read the directions, tried it on the high setting and it only curled (and very loosely) the top part of the my hair.  </li>
            <li>and this is designed for short, fine hair only.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for my shorter pieces of hair (my hair is layered) but definitely unimpressed with it overall.</li>
            <li>When curling my hair with a curling iron I crank it way up, but I only used the low heat setting and it curled just fine.</li>
            <li>I have used it with an updo or partial updo to create beautifully long springy curls very easily.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and with this I have a different look, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>All the other times, you get to know the sound and release the handle and your hair comes out.  </li>
            <li>I was really nervous about getting it because usually you see these great things on TV and its a waste.</li>
            <li>After extended use in one setting, it seems like the curler will start snagging a little more frequently.</li>
            <li>This little thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I just was wondering,is new</li>
            <li>Because the device have a risk and had a smell like someone had used, does not smell like new since I already bought a new one for a friend and doing the comparison</li>
            <li>My hair did not curl or make new waves.  </li>
            <li>what was sent contained an order sticker which said infinity pro by conair curler - new, however, the product shipped was a USED Miracurl knockoff, (</li>
            <li>Every time a new product comes out I run out and try it.</li>
            <li>I got mine at Goodwill today for $ 2.99 it appeared it be brand new and in package still.</li>
            <li>My wife has two new shoulders and this lets her curl her hair once again,</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s just really good at curling hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is midway down my back and still very easy to curl when I divide my head up into sections.</li>
            <li>It is very important to use the small sections as recommended.  </li>
            <li>Wish it cost less, but it works well and is easy to use to create new hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I tried a little more forcefully to get my hair free, but it was still tightly wedged.  </li>
            <li>I really like the ease and have finally found something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>From start to finish on my first try, my whole head of long hair took about 20-30 minutes to curl.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well on soft young girl hair</li>
            <li>I loved the product when my hair was shorter, but it&#x27;s been such a hassle to use lately.</li>
            <li>I always used to curl my hair as a solution to second-day hair, and the Curl Secret works much better with freshly washed/dried hair.</li>
            <li>but, this unit is heavy, to try and do the back of  your own hair while waiting for this to curl</li>
            <li>Second time, I left it plugged in and just pulled on my hair until it came free.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to spend a long, hot time trying to curl your whole head.</li>
            <li>This lets me produce gorgeous bouncy, smooth hair from very thick, coarse, wavy/frizzy long hair.  </li>
            <li>She has fine hair down to her bum and it took about 20 minutes to curl her hair while she sat and played with my iphone.</li>
            <li>You just face it towards you, it is very clearly labeled and squeeze and voila.  </li>
            <li>and it is very fast compared to traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li>Quick, Uniform Curls (18 minutes for super long, super thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>If your hair is halfway down your back this may only be good for curls that start partway up instead of near the root.</li>
            <li>my curls were too loose and faded quickly.</li>
            <li>This thing really works - it takes a little bit of time since you can&#x27;t that much hair in each time but totally worth it</li>
            <li>Easy long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>It is definitely easy to use as long as you follow the directions and does not tangle your hair if used properly.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine hair, and a LOT of it), and even though the back hair is only a few inches long, it can still create a nice wavy look to match the longer curls in the front and sides.</li>
            <li>Easy way to wear your hair down and look professional.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it because I figured it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, blah, blah, blah.</li>
            <li>It really is several steps above the rest and totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>It does get hot, but it is designed in a way that their is not likely to burn you.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair or my daughter in law whose hair is even longer than mine.</li>
            <li>As of 11/21/15 - again, this one we use only once every 2 or 3 weeks and it continues to work better than any other curing method my girls have tried.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use small sections of hair,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like, either it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the amount of hair in the chamber to produce a curl or</li>
            <li>the first time and 1 out of every 20 curls actually came out curly.</li>
            <li>This might be an acceptable item if you always have someone else to help you curl your hair, but if you want to style your hair on your own this item is not a good idea.</li>
            <li>old!</li>
            <li>Straight hair that generally wont hold curl probably wont work with this either.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to use small sections</li>
            <li>Not sure why people love this product.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll definitely get your hair stuck in it, despite the fact that the product says \\&quot;guaranteed no tangles.\\</li>
            <li>tiers,\\&quot; using a comb to create the next part and clip the other \\&quot;tiers\\&quot; to the top of the head.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, on the third strand of hair, it yanked it up into the machine, made a noise and stalled out.  </li>
            <li>Very simple to use, heats up fast!</li>
            <li>I find the curls last longer than hot rollers too.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t suitable for thick hair</li>
            <li>the CONAIR LOGO is SOLID, (no fade lines on the &amp;#34;air&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Since getting the InfinitiPro I have numerous people complimenting me on my hair and recommending I keep it curled. ;)</li>
            <li>not waste your time or money!</li>
            <li>and it does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>I learned with this iron that the amount of each section for the most part can be usual</li>
            <li>This tool helps even out my hair and yet still allows it to look totally natural!</li>
            <li>and it looks exactly the same, no hair spray.</li>
            <li>The curls are soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it doesn&#x27;t typically hold a curl if my life depended on it.  </li>
            <li>I always search reviews of products before I make purchases, especially ones that have higher price tags.</li>
            <li>My hot rollers finally bit the dust</li>
            <li>I love to do the small curls underneath,</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and it is a hit!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use small pieces or your hair will get stuck.</li>
            <li>I have never had such pretty curls.</li>
            <li>Ok, so, as per usual, you have to ignore the one and two star reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I told them I&#x27;m not cutting my long hair.</li>
            <li>I will occasionally use an Instyler and a hot brush/dryer.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why so many reviews talk about hair getting caught...</li>
            <li>First, if your hair gets stuck, open and close the curler until it lets it go.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it though, only using the tricks that I mentioned because before I figured those out, I was ready to throw the thing away!</li>
            <li>I went and bought a better one on amazon for 60.00 this one destroyed my hair when I took small sections.</li>
            <li>My hair type is straight, medium thickness and generally does not hold curl at all.  </li>
            <li>I had a bachelorette party recently, where the girls made me demo this for the whole group!</li>
            <li>It may seem like a lot to pay for a curling iron but as long as it lasts, very much worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good at styling my own hair.</li>
            <li>If it isn&#x27;t held exactly perpendicular then jamming is possible.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest tool I have ever used on my hair!</li>
            <li>but this just made me go from eh stylist...to WOW!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top heavy though so don&#x27;t put it anywhere it can slip!</li>
            <li>I have paid more money for high temperature curling irons that curls last half the time of this curler.</li>
            <li>The downfall, no matter how little bot of hair you put in, it snags too easily.</li>
            <li>from the video clips they have in the little windows, it looks so easy to use it.</li>
            <li>The only thing to ever curl my long fine hair &amp; keep the curl.</li>
            <li>; look anymore - so when I do want to wear it down, this curler helps to smooth out the frizziness and is allowing my hair to grow out gracefully,</li>
            <li>On the day the do my whole head, I use the high heat setting and the 12 second timer (which is the longest)</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re never long enough), hot rollers, soup cans, rag curls, over-night rollers, those rolling sticks things, really, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it on shorter hair, mostly on long!</li>
            <li>used enough to wear paint off the handle) which came complete with beat up re - taped box and a good amount of somebody&#x27;s black hair tangled up inside it!!!  </li>
            <li>She had a huge hunk of hair only 2 inches long from her scalp.  </li>
            <li>I had to cut a huge chunk of my long blonde hair after it got stuck in this thing!</li>
            <li>I did find out that was too much; it gave my long hair too much of a Shirley Temple look.</li>
            <li>too time consuming to use, heavy and not that easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Within about 20 minutes I can have full, bouncy curls that last even until the next day.  </li>
            <li>Then I did some research and found out that BaByliss Pro is the higher end professional use line done by the same company by Conair.</li>
            <li>only downfall is it takes me for ever since I have such thick hair, but other then that this this is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron down from the color to how big it is.</li>
            <li>The only thing positive was it was sent and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>Unfortunely while I can give this a positive review I am returning it, with my layers I doubt I would use it enough to justify the cost.</li>
            <li>Be careful getting it too close to your head, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>They turned out SO pretty, though a little more curly than I like, next time I will use the middle setting.</li>
            <li>I use the highest heat, let each strand down after the first beep, let curls cool, then comb out my hair with only my fingers for the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>The Conair Curl Secret was easy to use and the results were well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>but you get an entire head of curls so quickly that overall</li>
            <li>As I used, I put less effort to carefully place hair and curls still came out nicely</li>
            <li>I was worried about her hair getting tangled in the iron so at first I was using super small sections of hair.</li>
            <li>A few that could be better are; 1) taking more hair - it only takes a small amount of hair and</li>
            <li>im in love, i have long thick crazy hair..and within 15-20 it gets all my hair looking beautiful!..</li>
            <li>I went over a bunch of areas a few times to fine tune it.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical but when it arrived I was able to curl my wife&#x27;s hair easily and the curls last.</li>
            <li>After using the Curl Secret for almost a year, my original impressions still hold true.</li>
            <li>but I also have limited dexterity in my right side.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stuck in the curler many times when i forgot by putting too much hair together in a big bunch, then the curler can&#x27;t work, it stops in the middle half way curling.</li>
            <li>I have super straight Asian hair and have had trouble keeping a curl for longer than 10minutes, haha.</li>
            <li>On the third (mine) it curled VERY WELL, but the biggest disappointment about this product is that in order to get a good curl you have to insert a tiny amount of hair &amp; it would easily take an hour to curl all of my fine but thick hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was over excited about using it that I did make the mistake and not following the exact instructions that I did tangle my hair a few times.  </li>
            <li>I suppose if you&#x27;re careful enough (as her sister was) it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li>Every curl after that seemed to be extremely loose and fell right</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight, dark hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product a little expensive thou, but worth the curls.</li>
            <li>I can easily spend 25-30 minutes with other curling irons/wands/etc and not get the same uniform result.  </li>
            <li>It is also hard to do the back of your head on your own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to do the back on your own.</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>The curler is clearly labeled as to which side should be facing the head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and I clearly still can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Jammed no matter how much I practiced or how much time I took to feed the hair in correctly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, slightly frizzy, medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>She said she can curl her whole head in about 10-15 minutes, and the curls last, even though her hair is naturally straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions weren&#x27;t clear about waiting for four consecutive beeps.</li>
            <li>It only curled my hair near the scalp, then the ends would still be straight.</li>
            <li>but the curls did not come out natural looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy mom and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GIGANTIC when I go natural.</li>
            <li>So resist that natural reaction and let go of the end of the hair as soon as the curler is clamped onto the hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 5 year old granddaughter....</li>
            <li>, I would be able to a least get a credit to purchase something else.</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old grandaughter received this as a Christmas gift a year or two ago.</li>
            <li>My husband bought it for me for Christmas and after reading the instructions several times and triple checking with online videos I felt that I was ready to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays curled for the whole day and is still wavy the next day (with No Product in it, at all!!!).</li>
            <li>so, I didn&#x27;t do anything fancy as far as prep and even still, inside of 20 minutes</li>
            <li>The curls look so natural.  </li>
            <li>Too early for 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Just got it and used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than a regular curling iron</li>
            <li>All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this product</li>
            <li>I recommend using a comb to create small sections of hair at first and then adding more hair until you figure out how wide the curler can handle -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist by any means, but I know how to work a straightener and curling iron pretty well.</li>
            <li>but they obviously don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>This was an early Christmas gift</li>
            <li>when I used this iron it was completely straightened.</li>
            <li>Everyone at work thought I had it professionally done.</li>
            <li>i decided to try it since i know how to use professional curling irons since i went to school for it...</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and the only curl that ever holds is with a 3-barrel waver.</li>
            <li>It only takes about 15 minutes for my whole head.</li>
            <li>It says for any length, but my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>It heats back up VERY QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 14 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>I immediately unplugged the machine then yanked on my hair softly to get it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and fought naturally wavy/curly hair all my life until 5 years ago, when I started having keratin treatments every 2 months.</li>
            <li>Finally stick straight hair that dries by itself.</li>
            <li>BUT about once per 10 curls your hair gets completely tangled in it and starts to fry.  </li>
            <li>I was completely surprised that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and the curls were still there the next morning.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with my hair being tangled in it at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 19 yr old daughter....</li>
            <li>it rolled up my daughters hair and did not release it when done, you have to leave the iron plugged in to try and get the hair out, but it keeps burning the hair, so after the smell of burnt hair in the house and her crying in pain by trying to free the hair</li>
            <li>but so far I think it works well.</li>
            <li>so much I bought a second on to have just in case&lt;</li>
            <li>The missing automatic release feature is just proof that it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>my hair cuticle is flattened making it look lush and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair feels just as soft as before using it</li>
            <li>I have the same conclusion for how much hair you should put in to curl.</li>
            <li>Our hair type is just really straight, this may be the reason for needing to do it twice on the same strand.</li>
            <li>but you will not get much of a curl with a low setting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slacking, being busy at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was recommended to by this  product buy a friend who saw a professional hair stylist use it for a wedding event.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She had brushed her hair really well beforehand and it paid off because the curls were so neat and identical</li>
            <li>we left it as is and the curls looked really shiny.</li>
            <li>The type of hair that no matter what, after about 3 hours will look basically straight, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li>I only had it beep at me once for putting in too much hair.</li>
            <li>Frequently catches, knots and pulls your hair in to the rotating automatic barrel.</li>
            <li>and I did not get my hair tangled once, but my 14 year old daughter did a couple times.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/</li>
            <li>I can let my hair do its natural thing</li>
            <li>but my natural hair stayed curly.</li>
            <li>Also the results were almost never just the way I wanted it to look: natural and even.</li>
            <li>After experimenting a bit with the different heat settings and how much hair to put in at a time etc.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like getting up early, so</li>
            <li>If one has course hair and some natural curl, it may work well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 9 and 10 yr old granddaughters  who can use it without help.</li>
            <li>Even with the unit completely switched off, the motor would run while plugged in.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair done by a professional for my sisters wedding</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair but tends to fuzz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use than a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far.</li>
            <li>I only twice had to stop and it gave the alarm that I had in to much hair</li>
            <li>I had no trouble with tangling in the machine.</li>
            <li>( I am a professional and know how to use this) over time my hair built up and</li>
            <li>It also completely fried my hair crispy (the part that was in the curler)..</li>
            <li>My hair looks natural and receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>My hair length touches my bra strap and it didn&#x27;t do any curls for me but just soft wavy tips.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but had to try it out.  </li>
            <li>After trying it out I have to say I&#x27;m surprised by some of the things I have read in reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than a traditional curling iron or wand.</li>
            <li>but I only really wanted to use the looser curl</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this curling contraption.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t curl your hair the old fashion way like me</li>
            <li>Got this for my 14 yr old neice for Xmas</li>
            <li>My 15 yr old LOVES this.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old can use it with ease</li>
            <li>The second not so much.</li>
            <li>I messed it up the first time I used it and was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t curl my long hair</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only reason why I gave it 4</li>
            <li>I will say I didn&#x27;t realize how long to hold the thing shut on the timer and was just letting go on the first beep.</li>
            <li>PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had my hair get stuck in it even once.</li>
            <li>This is much easier to use than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>you use too much and your hair gets stuck, just open it up</li>
            <li>my daughter with the natural wave/curl to her hair</li>
            <li>daughter with the pin straight hair is a different story....</li>
            <li>The curls last much longer</li>
            <li>It does hold a curl to the next morning but humidity does loosen pit fast.</li>
            <li>It is ultra sensitive in how you put the hair in it.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter can do it herself without any assistance.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter early for xmas ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy but looks professionally done and voluminous, not ringlets.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>A product that could actually produce curls in my straight, lifeless hair?  </li>
            <li>I sectioned my hair according to the instructions but about 1 of every 5 sections of hair would end up completely tangled inside the unit.</li>
            <li>I brought this as a gift for my 23 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls are completely gone from my hair after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 13 year old for christmas.  </li>
            <li>I would say 50% of the time it would wrap up my hair strand and nearly rip the hair out of my head.  </li>
            <li>and so far seems durable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for busy bees..</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I have curled my hair over the year, I ALWAYS tangle (at least one piece of) my hair.  </li>
            <li>Natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>It takes me about 20-30 minutes to completely curl all my hair, and that&#x27;s me being semi-cautious but also semi-impatient.</li>
            <li>(She is 19 years old.)  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try &amp; used it again the second time &amp; it was ok but still pulled a few strands of my hair.</li>
            <li>curls are crazy good, very uniform and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay, so after reading reviews for a few months, i decided to finally get this and try it out.</li>
            <li>you dont have to worry about burning your fingers ( I almost did every time I use a regular rod)&lt;br /&gt;-you&#x27;ll have a big smile on your face when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s well worth sharing that you will not regret the $99 spent.  </li>
            <li>LOVE Curl Secret because it doesn&#x27;t have just 12 rollers, or let me try to curl too much hair at once.</li>
            <li>But after a few times trying, I finally know that how to use it appropriately.</li>
            <li>And while normally I wouldn&#x27;t spent $100 on a curling iron because it looked cool on a commercial, this was an exception.</li>
            <li>you are good at curling your hair, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t buy this expensive equipment.</li>
            <li>I own the Bling Curl Secret purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li>The Curl Secret does deliver nice curls</li>
            <li>glad my hair is somewhat thick as it did pull some out during the &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair in long layers (ranging from my chin to the middle of my back).  </li>
            <li>Back to using the traditional flat iron which works just fine</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that curls pretty easily.</li>
            <li>No, it is not hard to get it back out, and no, it is not hard to get your hair correctly fed through.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I let it cool down while it was off and plugged in</li>
            <li>It has no type of safety feature for immediate cool down</li>
            <li>It tangled slightly on the first 2 tries, then all went smooth.</li>
            <li>will become an expert at this but as excited as I was to receive the Curl Secret, I have yet to pick it up since the first try!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m right handed) than on the left or back.</li>
            <li>hair length is right between the middle of my back and butt)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Not only do you have to comb, de-tangle and smooth out every tress -- but you will have to probably do it at least twice more for every other curl made.</li>
            <li>first, I was hesitant due to the high price</li>
            <li>but when you do - it really is easy even if you&#x27;re one of those people who generally have trouble curling their hair.  </li>
            <li>I think the iron is smart, because if you do get lazy and just want to be done by inserting more hair per 12 sec cycle, the wand lets you know that that is too much hair, and it will back track or unwind the hair to let you know!</li>
            <li>and I can fluff it with my fingers after brushing to get it just right.  </li>
            <li>not sure would&#x27;ve been easy without him and off</li>
            <li>My hair is middle of my back long and fine.</li>
            <li>Use small sections and it will easily come out if it does get caught.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and it created beautiful long lasting curls...</li>
            <li>The only negative is I wish you could place more hair into the barrel to make bigger waves, but none the less I love how it makes my hair turn out.</li>
            <li>Well get ready to hear it again because this little gem of a product is exactly that</li>
            <li>This product really curls my long straight hair, and the curls last.  </li>
            <li>After I was done showing her how to achieve the exact same look as this product with a $15 curling iron in 10 minutes versus 15-20 that this one takes, she was bummed she spent this much money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to explore the higher settings, but I opted for the lowest and ended up with neat looking loose waves.</li>
            <li>In the past I have not found a single Conair item that has been decent for safe hair use-</li>
            <li>timer settings (depending on whether you want tight curls, loose curls, or a wave)&lt;br /&gt;Indicator light which lets you know when the unit is ready</li>
            <li>I also love that you can put the curl chamber right up to the side of your head, so you don&#x27;t have curls starting awkwardly a few inches down your hair.</li>
            <li>You just put a reasonable amount of hair in the snapper and it sucks it right up!</li>
            <li>Its much easier and faster than a curling iron or a flat iron!</li>
            <li>The curls are very tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>That time I wasn&#x27;t holding it perfectly straight, so I&#x27;m thinking as long as you follow directions completely</li>
            <li>Even then they usually didn&#x27;t last more than 3 hours - tops.</li>
            <li>I was doubtful at first, but this product works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li>It did not take me more than 18 minutes to curl my entire head of hair, using small sections.  </li>
            <li>I have Extra Long, Thin, Super Straight, baby fine hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I was scared to death to be honest - afraid my hair would get sucked in and never come undone</li>
            <li>Have to take small pieces of hair and make sure you use it properly.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first because their are a lot of different products like this with different names.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone with long hair and wants natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>and so does my 5 year old with long hair who doesn&#x27;t really let me do her</li>
            <li>Regular curling irons take forever and there are never enough rollers in a hot roller set for all of my hair...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty short; length is between my ears and shoulders and it&#x27;s got a funky wave if left to air</li>
            <li>make sure hair is brushed out well, and in small sections.  </li>
            <li>next day - exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to keep the sections small and brush through them which is key with this curler.</li>
            <li>So, the first &amp; last time I used it, I curled only the surface locks.  </li>
            <li>Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li>While it did a nice job with the curl, it did jam on me a few times - which also slowed things down.</li>
            <li>I would suggest for super long hair only using the device half way, so just from the middle down you have a nice curl..</li>
            <li>After the hair is drawn in the curler makes spaced apart short, high pitched &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34;while</li>
            <li>For my hair type, I vary between the 8 or 10 second mark, always on the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this if you think curling hair has to bea big battle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has the proper length or longer layers.</li>
            <li>Actually 1 star is too high the item was defective and does not work at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend watching youtube videos prior to using the curler.</li>
            <li>Due to injuries I am unable to hold my arms up for more than a few seconds and this product is easy to use and is the first hair curling system that really works.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very thick and coarse hair and this made it really easy for her naturally curly hair to turn into pretty waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fast and easy, I have thin hair</li>
            <li>and if you just open the tool completely it usually falls out easily or with only a gentle tug.</li>
            <li>And if your hair is damaged like mine, be sure to massage in a few egg yolks for 15 minutes  (an incredibly effective and less expensive protein-filler mask), condition, and rinse, a few times a week, to get your hair in better condition, as well as moisturizing mask, and trims (to hold curl).&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>The only two cons is it&#x27;s not meant for super long hair (my hair is down to my stomach), it turned off on me when I was 3/4 done from being too hot.</li>
            <li>the first use, there was a really bad plastic odor, but most hot hair tools do that</li>
            <li>Fast at curling her hair but her hair is so long</li>
            <li>but it just does what the video shows... and so long as you don&#x27;t get too much hair..</li>
            <li>I have extremely straight hair, about shoulder length long.</li>
            <li>Takes a really long time to curl whole head, sometimes</li>
            <li>I used this yesterday, Christmas Day, on my straight, long hair.</li>
            <li>so it takes too long for every day use to be really practical.  </li>
            <li>She has long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes of trying to curl my 12 yr old&#x27;s hair with this tool that barely made the hair curly on the highest setting, she fainted.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair you will really see a lot of curl and bounce.</li>
            <li>I was not able to find any detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I have long stick straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and very staringht</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and never holds a curl for long.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair that is kinda frizzy unless straightened with a straightener</li>
            <li>The only time I am able to curl my hair is when I go to a salon and get it done and even then they only stay for a few hours.</li>
            <li>but first try it caught her hair in it and jammed into the motor.  </li>
            <li>I tried the first time on dirty hair and did 3 sections making bigger curls and last night, I curled it on clean hair and used 4 sections making more, smaller curls.</li>
            <li>When we called the 1-800-3-Conair number the customer service department seemed very flippant about our complaint and told us if we felt we needed to further vent our frustrations to send an email.</li>
            <li>But now I find myself wanting some loose curls for special occasions or just a little change, and this thing really delivers.</li>
            <li>i did exactly as the instructions states to have clean hair,a thin piece of hair, and to comb it out.</li>
            <li>go have fun curling your hair with a curler that will cut your styling time down in the morning!br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good for people who can&#x27;t get the hang of clipless curling irons and are sick of dents being left by the traditional irons that have clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>My hair actually burned a little trying to free it</li>
            <li>It pulls hair too easily and is really hard to get tangled hair out.  </li>
            <li>It has a little more weight than I expected so your arms can tire if you are not used to holding your arms up for periods of time.</li>
            <li>It can take a few minutes to complete, as only small portions of hair can be tsken at a time, but beautiful loose curls are created.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and frizzy hair, so this took me quite a while to do a full head of curls, but the outcome was pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I might look at other brands and replace it with something similar because the idea of this is just super</li>
            <li>This will save me so much time curling my long hair!</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, my daughter wanted to curl my hair, it took her maybe 15 minutes to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I have used all three products out there and this one is not too different from the baby bliss or instyler tulip, except with the Conair Infiniti you can only go one direction in curling your hair which is a real downside in comparison to its competition.</li>
            <li>then it takes FOREVER to curl your whole head of hair since it only works for a very tiny portion of hair for it to work.</li>
            <li>Also there is a note on the curler that tells you which side should face your head so you don&#x27;t put your hair in the wrong way and get a pull from your scalp, I&#x27;m sure that would really hurt.</li>
            <li>Second of all, when this product actually did work(Which wasn&#x27;t very often)</li>
            <li>I recommend a wand for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was outstanding though, as usual</li>
            <li>This product appears to be the same device I purchased on Amazon by a different manufacturer and paid almost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>For what it cost, this product is well worth what I spent since it actually does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no more flinging around my curling wand trying to wrap my long hair around it.</li>
            <li>Yes sometimes you do have your hair get stuck ( but I find this only happens when I attempt to put to much hair in it) and if it does get stuck, you just simply back out.  </li>
            <li>I am super clumsey and messy.</li>
            <li>own and use the ACTUAL Conair Infinity Pro Curl Secret.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to use and holds the curl for even thick hair.</li>
            <li>The curls came out uneven, and fell out quickly.</li>
            <li>When I got a tangle, I just quickly unplugged and untangled without trouble.</li>
            <li>I know it seems like such a good idea, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work with my hair</li>
            <li>i was a little weirded out by this when i got it and was sorta afraid to use it but turns out i absolutely love the curl secret, i am one who cannot curl my hair or anything at all really so this was super easy to do and really fast!</li>
            <li>My curls last all day, my hair feels very soft (not crispy or over-heated)....</li>
            <li>but I get pretty loose curls with this!!</li>
            <li>Way too much work for limited results.</li>
            <li>The curl secret can create perfect tight curls with less effort that will hold for hours without hairspray.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a cheap knock off because the box looked really shabby and awkward.</li>
            <li>Unless you like doing your hair regularly, or use a normal curling iron frequently, you won&#x27;t like it enough to use it.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.  </li>
            <li>so even when I put in a little bit it gets stuck, other than that I love the results.</li>
            <li>I did my first practice run the other day, with hubby standing by in case</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t properly brush her curls first and her long hair got STUCK!</li>
            <li>and I had major volume.  </li>
            <li>The key with long hair is that they have to be smaller sections, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone, although not sure how it would work - or even if it would work -  on short hair.  </li>
            <li>If your not careful it rips your hair out!  </li>
            <li>Not exactly what I want it to do and the price is pretty hefty.  </li>
            <li>On the shorter hair in back, it still curled but you have to be careful to hold it in position because if your arm starts to sag, the hair will slip right out.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine and extremely hard to hold a curl hair.</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy, however, you can only use small sections of hair..</li>
            <li>I actually did my hair the evening before and was able to wear it the next day and only had to touch up a few of the ones around my face.</li>
            <li>If you do it right you&#x27;ll get the hang of it and it will take you less time than if you try to shove a bunch of hair in there thinking it will give you faster results.</li>
            <li>You can easily get as tight or loose a curl as you want by adjusting the heat setting or time setting.</li>
            <li>Naturally wavy (not pretty wavy) and very frizzy.</li>
            <li>i think it would work fine, but not for thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so straight that by the time I&#x27;m done curling it with a traditional curling iron, it&#x27;s already flat again!</li>
            <li>and I should have had to go to all this trouble in the first place!</li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine and has trouble  holding a curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually, you can make several styles with this curls not only 3 styles which are described by Conair: tight, medium and light curls.</li>
            <li>The door of the tool, which is on the top looks very delicate to me and hope it does not break.</li>
            <li>The door of the tool, which is on the top looks very delicate to me and hope it does not break.</li>
            <li>Was broken but was very easy to return and get money back</li>
            <li>I can actually enjoy the feeling of curls instead of having hard hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the MAJOR things I love about Curl Secret is that..I wear extensions.</li>
            <li>might make this a bit harder to use, so on the days my hair has extra static I try and get that under control with a little bit of water</li>
            <li>So far I am having trouble curling my hair, I don&#x27;t think the problem is just that I need to play with it a little more.</li>
            <li>The curler is a little heavy, and it seems to have been designed to be used in the left hand (maybe for those curling their own hair).  </li>
            <li>go have fun curling your hair with a curler that will cut your styling time down in the morning!</li>
            <li>it took me 25 min max to curl my entire head (fine hair down to the middle of my back)</li>
            <li>Less hair &#x3D; tight curls and more hair &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I now can have sexy beach waves or tight spirals in 30min or less.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking there would be no way it works but gave it a chance based on other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But the other positive reviews made me give it a shot</li>
            <li>i am unsure if maybe I got a defective one, or that these just suck in general...</li>
            <li>Takes quite a bit of time to do the whole head and the curls don&#x27;t last too long on my hair.</li>
            <li>I assume people who are getting their hair stuck are not reading the instructions that clearly state to section your hair into 1/2 inch sections and hold the product with a specific side towards your head.  </li>
            <li>As far as price it can be found for the same price as the instyler tulip</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t being careful, I was trying to rush, I was trying to put too much hair in, or I wasn&#x27;t separating the sections of hair away from the rest of the hair allowing strays to roll up into the curler too.</li>
            <li>I do cross fit 3X a week, and I have to rest my arms to complete the second 1/2 of my hair because the iron is soo heavy!</li>
            <li>My 12 year old can use it around her face area, but not the back or sides of her head.</li>
            <li>(And I barely used any product in my hair - must be the ceramic).</li>
            <li>Only difference is if you have hair that does not curl well, set it on the highest heat setting and the timer to make a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; curl, so that when it falls some, it will look like natural, wavy curls.</li>
            <li>my curls were not coming out, they barely resembled any type of curl.</li>
            <li>So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item</li>
            <li>So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item</li>
            <li>Barely made a wave in my hair...</li>
            <li>but when we used it on the hottest setting and kept in the curler for the max time, the hair still came out with barely a bend in it</li>
            <li>I got this for my 12 year old and she can do only the front of her hair.</li>
            <li>My husband and I managed to get it far enough away from my scalp to cut it out, but we both burned our fingers doing so.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, but it was never wavy enough to go without curling my hair into some sort of style.</li>
            <li>A regular curling iron flattens my natural waves.</li>
            <li>far we have gotten 4 of these from various sources.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fixed as alternate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no different than an old school bristled curling iron in that respect.</li>
            <li>It does curl you hair but your hair must be somewhat smoothed prior to the use or there is still some areas near your scalp that will be frizzy.  </li>
            <li>apparently some reviewers had to cut their hair out.</li>
            <li>It barely made a kink in her hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for my 16 year old daughter, she did her entire head of hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I had her open it early</li>
            <li>Adult supervision DEFINITELY. ...</li>
            <li>(wow that was a lot of the same word) and medium thickness.</li>
            <li>Otherwise (for the vast majority of people) I recommend avoiding this curler completely.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s heavy, and gets hot, and spins, just as with any curling appliance it shouldn&#x27;t be used by young kid.</li>
            <li>There are no words to describe how much I love the Pro Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li>Being the good mama that I am, I decided to test it out to make sure it wasn&#x27;t overpriced gimmicky crap.</li>
            <li>Infiniti pro by conair curl secret is gifted to my friend.</li>
            <li>I usually do my makeup while the curls are pinned to let my hair cool into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>meaning, don&#x27;t use on freshly washed and dried hair.  </li>
            <li>Ok I have thick coarse hair, I&#x27;m mixed</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and lacks body, all the more reason I thought this curler would never work.  </li>
            <li>Really nice this Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret!</li>
            <li>I am in love with the curl secret.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use curlers before until I came across Infiniti Prof Curl Secret.</li>
            <li>Love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li>My sister was skeptical but once she tried it, she decided to go out to buy her own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The curl secret also has a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love my Conair curl secret.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Ever since I heard about the Conair curl secret and watched video reviews and read many written reviews about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely love the Curl Secret.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl .... until the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely competent with a curling iron, but it takes soooo long, when you have thick, long-ish hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my secret weapon for sure</li>
            <li>I also found it a little tricky to do the right side of my head, remembering to keep the correct side of the curler close to the head, and did get an achy arm after a while -</li>
            <li>But with this FANTASTIC machine, I can have tight curls, wavy curls, and medium loose curls.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I think I need to turn down the settings.</li>
            <li>to add: A year later and our Curl Secret is still going strong!</li>
            <li>made my hair dry and lifeless looking and the price is ridiculously high for it.</li>
            <li>The curls are large and loose (similar to Kate Middleton).  </li>
            <li>After only one try, I didn&#x27;t hesitate using it again for New Year&#x27;s Eve last night (attending a party with 350 guests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the timer was broken because it beeped right away on each setting.  </li>
            <li>And it was SO easy to use, no danger of hurting your hair (it beeps at you if you do it wrong or have tangled  hair), as it gently wraps your hair around the barrel, w/o pulling.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble getting your curls to look right?</li>
            <li>I have very thick, coarse, long wavy hair and masses of hairs - about 6 times as many as a normal person, my hairdresser says.</li>
            <li>This takes me 30 minutes or less for my whole head!  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair, make sure you curl very small sections at a time.</li>
            <li>Her hair is fine and hard to hold a curl unless you put ALOT of product, and then it will last an hour tops.</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time doing anything with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably never be able to bring myself to use the thing again, which is a shame because it does give pretty results (when it works) and was extremely expensive!</li>
            <li>Also, it did get hot but not nearly as hot as a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li>The parts that are too high to curl usually end up pretty frizzy and once the curl is made, you obviously can&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine hair, with an ugly kind of light kinky frizz.  </li>
            <li>(makes a HUGE difference in curl retention) and a few egg-yolk masks (for protein filler) at home, as well as my usual intense moisturizing masks, to bring my hair up tp grade.</li>
            <li>It can only accommodate small amounts of hair, and you cannot curl in the opposite direction (important to create dimension and avoid the &amp;#34;triangle head&amp;#34; look).</li>
            <li>It came out looking very tousled (due to not brushing hair).</li>
            <li>My hair is long enough to curl with hot sticks but not too long that this would be a pain.</li>
            <li>The third day, I washed my hair and curled the bottom sections of my long hair and held it only for three beeps instead of the four (it beeps to let you know that your hair is ready).  </li>
            <li>I frequently curl my hair, around 6 times a month, using either a flat iron or one of my curling irons.</li>
            <li>Yes, hair did get caught in chamber a couple times but came out without much effort due to auto reverse sensor motor.</li>
            <li>Being an Asian descendant with straight long hair I would never think it would be possible to have curls without going to a Beauty salon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see how other reviewers got it stuck in their hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use much hairspray or any other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little top heavy which I had to get used to</li>
            <li>To be fair, the Curl Secret takes a little bit of practice.</li>
            <li>Choose your heat setting and how tight a curl you want and get ready to be wowed!    </li>
            <li>Also no burnt fingers with the pro curler!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my circling iron as it does wonderfully tight curls, with staying power, but for ease of use, will use this first</li>
            <li>You have to be very careful not to take to much hair and hold the tool level.</li>
            <li>I was very careful to follow instructions and it does not matter how much hair you put into it because it gets stuck anyway.</li>
            <li>We got this for my daughters (one has pin straight hair and the other has a natural wave) as a Christmas present and now that we have used it several times</li>
            <li>I got the Curl Secret today and was so excited to try it out!</li>
            <li>I find I only use it if I know I have at least 30 mins free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It only took me 45 mins to do my friends hair, instead of old curling irons that would have taken 2-3 hours to get the same results..</li>
            <li>Before yesterday my hair styles included stick straight, messy bun, and natural waves.</li>
            <li>, just be careful also it does take a while to do your whole head, but once it&#x27;s done, they do last a while.</li>
            <li>Release before it tries to suck in your hair a second time and tightens and gently pull your hair out.</li>
            <li>Ultimately we had to break it and open it up as the hair was stuck so far in that it was cut it off or break the curler.</li>
            <li>If you start at the middle of your head, you can get natural waves, like if you would be using a regular hair straightener.</li>
            <li>The Curl Secret will not abide more than 1inch of hair in the feeder, nor will it accept hair that is not brushed.</li>
            <li>If the hair is sectioned up and small sections curled at a time just about anyone can achieve a full head of massive curls.</li>
            <li>The curls did not dry, damage or frizz my hair.</li>
            <li>No more waiting for rollers to cool in my hair before reheating them for the next batch.</li>
            <li>that got a little hotter, had a longer timer, and alternated right &amp; left spin directions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will demand some time and effort - specially if you are alone and have to grab hair on the back of your head - so be patient to take not too much hair at the same time (or the Conair Curl will stop working) and do not use in the highest temperature if you have damaged thin</li>
            <li>No more fumbling around with hot rollers ever again!  </li>
            <li>The curls stay at least a couple of days, even the most loose curl which is the 8 second setting.  </li>
            <li>You have to use small sections of hair at a time, but it&#x27;s quick and easier than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really long and thick), but it was so easy.  </li>
            <li>Having said that though I used the high settings and it only came out in a loose ringlet curl.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest it for different looks especially for women or girls with long hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy, so it&#x27;s really hard to try and do the back of your head yourself.</li>
            <li>I was only able to do half of my head when I realized that there were several dead ends coming out.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and gives you flexibility for tight or loose curls.</li>
            <li>As long as the segment of hair is small enough and smooth, I had no problem with it, but it just stopped working 2 days after the 90 day warranty was out of date.  </li>
            <li>I definitely agree with other reviewers who say it takes awhile to get the hang of using this, but once you do it really does work well.</li>
            <li>Using other curling methods, my hair was usually straight the next day after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>Using other curling methods, my hair was usually straight the next day after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>I have used it on myself, my 15 year old daughter (long hair) and her friends.  </li>
            <li>With this tool, I barely use any hairspray, and my curls last forever!</li>
            <li>there are no short cuts in life apparently.  </li>
            <li>I still have not used it enough to see anything different than expected, but it works really well in the highest temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say how old I am, but let&#x27;s just say I should have learned LONG ago how to curl my hair</li>
            <li>The first few curls she thought it was gonna pull her hair out</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s heavy.  </li>
            <li>This thing is pretty heavy, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working within a few uses, so I called con-air</li>
            <li>It takes some time as the amount of hair you can put into each curl is fairly small but still worth the effort.</li>
            <li>My hair is crazy thick, and this makes curling it so simple, although it still takes a bit of time, but that in no way is the fault of this amazing invention!!!</li>
            <li>I am usually a low maintenance kinda girl, so I hate spending a lot of time getting ready, but I do like looking good.</li>
            <li>Seriously this is worth the effort!  </li>
            <li>At first,  might think that it dont heat enough but seems it have to work a little bit  </li>
            <li>It weighs a little bit more than my straightener but not more than my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, super thick, and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li>, it takes forever styling your hair, poor quality.... just go with the remington ceramic curling stick (the pink one) and you&#x27;ll spend a lot less and get the beautiful hair style you want as you can control how long to keep your hair on the stick, you can put a lot more hair on it versus the thin hair strains that this curling machine allows you to and it will be a lot quicker (20 mins) and long lasting.</li>
            <li>thing is high speed, low drag (you know my story but not my swag).</li>
            <li>I have long,  very thick bone-straight hair, and I love this curler.  </li>
            <li>12 seconds is not very long, so before you know it each curl is done.  </li>
            <li>The only time it ever tangles is if I get a bit too much hair in a section, or the hair is wildly different lengths due to layers.</li>
            <li>that curls you get from other high temperature curling irons.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, medium thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>so it took me about an hour and a half to curl my whole head</li>
            <li>I can do my whole head in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>So i take a shower and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I always let it dry naturally  </li>
            <li>Being stuck in the machine for such a long period of time, it completely fried my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and does not hold curls for long but with this product I was able to curl my hair and style it without losing any of the curl .</li>
            <li>Curl Secret looked so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair, can do it all in 15 minutes easily.</li>
            <li>my hair is super thick and won&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li>I have super thick, processed hair</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>The Curl secret is too strong for that</li>
            <li>The little hot roller inside the machine will roll your hair up into the round part of the device until the whole strand is inside.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very frizzy, wavy hair, but I have to wear it back in a ponytail or straighten it every single day because I can&#x27;t let it air dry...</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, though it is a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li>I have not lost 1 single strand so far.  </li>
            <li>It took a few tries to figure out how to position the head of the tool, but was pretty easy after a few tries.</li>
            <li>It also has a very short cord making it super hard to use when moving around your head to curl hair.</li>
            <li>Upon looking at a few reviews, I learned that it was difficult for many people to use correctly the first time.</li>
            <li>The Curl Was Barely There &amp; Flat.</li>
            <li>I can barely use my flat iron.</li>
            <li>(For a right-hander to understand this, please use this product with one hand tied behind your back, it&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent).</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but not good for long hair.</li>
            <li>The whole process takes me about 15 min, the same time I would spend with a flat iron, ironing in sections, and the curl holds for me about 3 days, when I am due for my next wash.  </li>
            <li>the picture on the left is the original machine and on the right is the fake!</li>
            <li>They both have long hair and wear it straight as does every other tween.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it seems quite fast as well, whereas some Youtube videos showed other brands that you held for a long while.</li>
            <li>My daughter has lots of thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and it still got caught in the machine.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but definitely not worth $99!!</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit for each curl, so don&#x27;t expect to do your whole head in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Just use little sections of hair and don&#x27;t freak out if it gets tangled, turn it off, gently wiggle the hair out and start over.  </li>
            <li>, I absolutely love the results I get with Curl Secret - loose, bouncy curls that actually last all day.</li>
            <li>I now live with a movie star due to this machine.</li>
            <li>I was very much looking forward to this curling iron, even though Conair styling tools were disappointments in the past.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair and it curled it, and I usually am never able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective product, but mine smelled like burning plastic and constantly the red light would start blinking between curls (indicating it is not hot enough).</li>
            <li>Only once in the almost 2 months I have been using it did my hair get really stuck that I panicked a little.</li>
            <li>have very straight hair and have been curling my hair everyday for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>(middle of my back), fine hair; I usually have to set the curling iron about halfway down the shaft to avoid tangling as well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this petrified and intrigued, I had read bad reviews, but loved the idea.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad and that&#x27;s a good thing since I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li>We finally got it open, our house spelled of burnt hair, she lost a huge strand of hair but it could of been so much worse.</li>
            <li>like the pro curler as it is generally easier to use than the curling iron and, for me, the curls held a long time.</li>

            <li> Just saw this product at Best Buy for $20 more than it is listed here.</li>
            <li> Like many others my hair got caught it in so many times and it burnt some of my hair off!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried one more time, this time hold it for 5 beeps and perfect curl!</li>
            <li> believe my own eyes!..</li>
            <li> I tried so many but this was the best I think.</li>
            <li> It transforms hair I to the most beautiful curls!!</li>
            <li> I loving my Infiniti Pro!</li>
            <li> so this is perfect for me, but if you are going to use it every day, it seems more damaging than your every day curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love this thing and best of all</li>
            <li> The best ever:)))))))))</li>
            <li> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions, trust them, and practice makes perfect. :)</li>
            <li> Nice Curls though!</li>
            <li> Nice try Conair, but no!</li>
            <li> Nothing has been as successful as the pro curl.</li>
            <li> This product is good, and the concept is great.</li>
            <li> If I have 40 minutes, I use it and the curls are really nice!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure practice will make perfect!</li>
            <li> This curler is awesome glad</li>
            <li> so I went online and read some reviews and watched some you tube videos on the product and saw mostly positives so I ordered and am I happy!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that the manufacture would be the best in that I had purchased from them before &amp;that item has lasted many yrs, but in the case of this product it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the one my sister bought &amp; let me borrow (Curl Genius, by Blisspro)</li>
            <li> I now have 10 friends who are purchasing this product after seeing a pic of my hair and i have had so many people tell me today my hair looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>

            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Good Luck if you decide to order this product</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s what I call a good use of technology.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a really good product.</li>
            <li> But I think I have good hair for this product.  </li>
            <li> and I just have had the hardest time getting it to look good.  </li>
            <li> They loved the results.</li>
            <li> thing and good</li>
            <li> It was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Today, I have gorgeous beach waves and still have some defined curl ringlets.</li>
            <li> But then, every time I passed a mirror and caught myself, I really loved how my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I took a nap on the couch and the curls still looked good after.</li>
            <li> Maybe Good</li>

            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this product that&#x27;s why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> When I got it, I tried curling my hair but did not get the good result.</li>
            <li> This hair tool did not create good curl on either of my daughters or myself.</li>
            <li> This is fool proof, hassle free and best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use product to hold it.</li>
            <li> loved this product.  </li>
            <li> What I loved about this curling iron is the curls</li>
            <li> Got this because reviews were good......</li>
            <li> but hopefully it will prove to be a good investment.</li>

            <li> I get nothing but compliments about how good my hair looks after using this.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair looks so good</li>
            <li> even looks good</li>
            <li> Good for those going to work that like a polish look.</li>
            <li> In my experience of the product he really good and deserves 5 ​​stars</li>
            <li> but I figure it is a good work out for my arm muscles.</li>
            <li> I still felt like going with the good review and</li>
            <li> I loved the idea</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>

            <li> Put your section of hair in, squeeze, it twirls your hair in, wait for the beeps, release, and you come out with a truly amazing curl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this really is an amazing product for girls who can&#x27;t get curls otherwise.</li>
            <li> the curls are amazing..</li>
            <li> The idea is amazing.</li>
            <li> This Curling tool is AMAZING, i can curl my hair in 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Amazing-</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This device which I just used did amazing curls.</li>
            <li> It looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of product that in a couple years will be still selling well</li>
            <li> The babybliss works just as good as tulip but is much more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes out really nice and with just some hairspray</li>
            <li> After trying to get my hair out on my own</li>
            <li> It did make one nice curl.</li>
            <li> But, when I went to do my own hair, I found it often pulled and tangled up my hair.  </li>
            <li> looks nice when its not getting stuck and pulling out your hair</li>
            <li> I have never been adept at curling or styling my own hair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly it took some time for her to get the knack of using it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I would say that this product is best for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I would groan because I didn&#x27;t even know how to do my own hair.  </li>
            <li> I cannot make this curl my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I can say that I was quite scared about using it after some of the reviews saying their hair was getting caught</li>
            <li> but sometimes i straighten and just want to have the ends curled nicely, this product does just that.  </li>
            <li> It really works, now I have flawless curls.</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews I knew to read instructions instead of figuring it out on my own.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a kind of fraud that show something on market and send something else.</li>
            <li> It works nice, no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> BUT I will take that any day and have nice curled hair for  3 days in a row...</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li> with practice you can and the results are nice.</li>
            <li> The curls are nice.</li>
            <li> On this one though I just really want to let it be known how awesome this hair styler is.</li>
            <li> I could never curl my own hair</li>
            <li> I curled my whole head perfectly in about 30 min....</li>
            <li> I see cute styles on others and can never get my hair to look as good.</li>
            <li> something gorgeous will come out :)</li>
            <li> Her hair looks nice when she does.</li>
            <li> This styler makes nice curls without the frizz.</li>
            <li> With this hair curler I don&#x27;t have to pay a lot of $ or make an appointment or drive somewhere, I just style my hair in the privacy of my own home.</li>
            <li> She liked nothing about this product.</li>
            <li> Plus... it is diverse in what kind of curls it provides.  </li>
            <li> Works great and my curls look phenomenal. :)</li>
            <li> Works nicely when it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair.</li>
            <li> and I was loving the curls.  </li>
            <li> I still really liked the concept of this styler and took a chance.</li>
            <li> Kind of a Gisele Bunchen hair.</li>
            <li> The curls are nice and hair does not get stuck if used according to instructions, despite what some people say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve officially ordered my own.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but makes your curls look nice</li>
            <li> It has a lot of options which is nice</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and as soon as she received she used it and loving it.</li>
            <li> I have nice volume with hair that looks like a woman.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this hair curler, as it seemed perfect for my needs.  </li>
            <li> but I am honestly amazed by the product.</li>
            <li> After my friend trying this product and loving it, i decided why not give it a try.</li>
            <li> I found it really makes super neat curls with ease!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My mother and I bought this curling iron because we thought it was awesome and a much easier way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks as good (and sometimes better)</li>
            <li> Somehow the curls didn&#x27;t turn out to be as nice as the pictures looks.</li>
            <li> working this out on your own in front of the mirror takes some time in the beginning.</li>
            <li> All are good - the Babyliss has more features.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe anyone wouldn&#x27;t give this five stars.</li>
            <li> If gave me a nice shaped curl.</li>
            <li> cause it makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is really THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Not the end of the world.very nice results.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t know what I did before this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> But this handy dandy tool has changed all that.</li>
            <li> so I could do my own hair for my bridal photos.  </li>
            <li> and yes, it looks very..very nice.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used yet!  </li>
            <li> Nice curls.</li>
            <li> I always do my own hair when going to an affair.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it, it curled nicely.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to use and makes amazing curls!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my hair, has auto stop features, and works amazingly!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works and is easy to curl your own hair!  </li>

            <li> i was able to curl all my hair in about 20 min on the first try with the Infiniti Pro, and all my curls turned out great!</li>
            <li> Follow the directions the first time...and make sure to comb through each section before you put it in the tool and your hair will come out perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works very easily and gives nice curls.</li>
            <li> My daughters and daughters-in-law love it, find it easy to use, and it does a great job.</li>

            <li> normal curlers cant hold my hair but with this miracle they are the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> but with this product iam full of woolly  (lol) .</li>
            <li> What I love about this iron is I don&#x27;t have to separate my layers so much to get perfect curls.  </li>
            <li> You need to make sure you don&#x27;t put more then 1/2 inch of hair into the product to get some really good curls.</li>

            <li> Very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and was very easy to use but did not perform as written on my or my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>

            <li> I did manage to get my hair &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; once but it was because of my own misuse and after a very light pull it cut off</li>
            <li> Work fine, it is really good.</li>
            <li> This was a good concept in theory, and honestly I was really excited about it.</li>
            <li> Never being able to curl my own hair with curl iron</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t curl my hair, and this is literally my magical wand.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my own hair</li>
            <li> Glad to say it works amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT hold a curl this iron if truly amazing love</li>
            <li> The first three curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have beautiful wavy locks that did not require hours of wearing rollers or struggling to curl my hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> These curls (best with some product in the hair first) are twisty, soft, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my best friend&#x27;s 9 year old daughter</li>
            <li> It came a day early, which was awesome, and I immediately opened it to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I looked into getting another tool that was much more effective at applying curls to my hair</li>
            <li> item I thought and was extremely thrilled and got many people ..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair curler I&#x27;ve found to date!!!  </li>
            <li> Conair Infiniti Pro Curl is the best tool I have found thus far</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> PROS: this thing works awesome on my naturally curly (frizzy curls) hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing way to keep my hair in a huge style!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever used to curl hair.</li>
            <li> but once you get it it is fun to use with great results</li>
            <li> This is really cool!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s turly amazing &amp; worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I then did my own, didn&#x27;t bother to brush it, just ran my fingers through it to get the more prominent tangles out,  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair on my own and with this I am able to</li>
            <li> but im glad i didnt listen by far the best product i have EVER used.</li>
            <li> Wow I  love it the best curler I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Very easy and safe to use.</li>
            <li> I tried it out yesterday, very easy to use, make sure you have heat protection product on ur hair tho</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love, this curling iron!</li>
            <li> My girls love it too because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the effects are very stylish.  </li>
            <li> I did my whole head in about 10 minutes with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone who hates the curling iron but wants beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> backwards lol its funny</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who wants beautiful hair and curly.</li>
            <li> The first two curls turned out great, although it hurt to pull the device out</li>
            <li> I have a really great hot tools curling iron, but the effect lasts 20 mins unless I blast it with hairspray</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out, and I&#x27;m super happy with how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Able to curl and style easily!</li>
            <li> You must have very smooth hair to work well.  </li>
            <li> It made it easy to use and amazing curls.</li>
            <li> I saw a YouTube &amp; loved the quick looking tumbling waves that it made.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and produces a really nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and nice to not have to worry about burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I was SUPER excited when perfect curls fell right out!</li>
            <li> This product produces very nice curls, but have in mind that you need to first brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so the low setting works best for me.</li>
            <li> Fun easy to use great product for curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> it works well, easy and fun, great curls instantly….</li>
            <li> It works the best with super straight hair not curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It sucked in a very important layer and it wouldn&#x27;t come out; I had to sit there and watch my hair smoke and burn free!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this wonderful product lets even a dummy like me (when it comes to hair, at least) be able to have the most beautiful curls I ever had.</li>
            <li> i believe it&#x27;s supposed to have the exactly certain portion of your hair before you snap it in the curler, so it will work great.</li>
            <li> I loved the machine from the first curl!  </li>
            <li> A huge hit!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> THIS, ladies, is the solution to all your problems :).</li>
            <li> Curl Magic.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure you have a well parted piece of hair when you use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , that being said there are many products I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite purchases of 2014.  </li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> But overall, I was incredibly impressed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Maybe more.</li>
            <li> If someone is looking for a more relaxed tousled look, that can be achieved too.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s flying around with a lot of static</li>
            <li> Be sure to listen to these, the timing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The more we use it the more we like it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> my kid love it and use it by herself.</li>
            <li> I do love the way the curls looks</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  </li>
            <li> Like many others I have NEVER been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> but it seems to work okay.</li>
            <li> , I had adorable all-over-the-head curls.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Such beautiful curls!</li>
            <li> I really love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to say that the device should be recalled for faulty safety precautions-</li>
            <li> It does not work and it got stuck in my daughters hair that we had been growing out for locks of love.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased.</li>
            <li> Thought, if it worked, my daughter would love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions tell you to section off the hair, make sure it&#x27;s not tangled,</li>
            <li> It burned my head and more of my hair.</li>
            <li> But the words are printed on the device at what side needs to have your head so there shouldn&#x27;t be too many forgetfulness moments.</li>
            <li> it was for my daughter but all her girl friends are using it and love it</li>
            <li> and I tried it real quick on one strand</li>
            <li> My wife love it,  </li>
            <li> I received the product and curled most of my hair without getting any stuck.</li>
            <li> She loves it :)</li>
            <li> my hair got tangled more than once.</li>
            <li> it gives u a perfect curl,and i don&#x27;t even know how to curl my hair with a regular curler.</li>
            <li> have not been able to use it.</li>
            <li> I used it and fell in love.</li>
            <li> If you read the instructions and make sure to wait for the multiple beeps that indicate it&#x27;s done it works great!</li>
            <li> Great for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I had no problems and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love this thing.</li>
            <li> have gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> I am getting better with it every day</li>
            <li> i,m in love with Infiniti Pro by Conair</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and i will order more</li>
            <li> and  after that its okay...</li>
            <li> I really love the well defined, coiled curls this product provides.</li>
            <li> but mostly you need to pick out the rat&#x27;s nest one strand at a time.</li>
            <li> You hold it for 5 beeps if you want more defined curls.</li>
            <li> Mine was a gift, tooooo much money, but great product :)</li>
            <li> :) Will get better with practice.</li>
            <li> I have been showing friends and family and all love to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /scared me:)</li>
            <li> hair is shoulder length, and it took me only 10 min&#x27;s at the most to do all my hair, it looks great!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, that one feature does not justify paying almost forty percent more.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take more than 1&amp;#34; of hair.  </li>
            <li> This is much more user-friendly than both of those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t give this item any more than a 2 star rating because it burned off pieces of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Think, &amp;#34;That girl&#x27;s hair must tickle the top of her bum,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the curls</li>
            <li> I get many compliments.  </li>
            <li> The curls hold great and it takes no longer than 30 minutes for me to do my whole head</li>
            <li> more reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then again, if you have no talent in curling hair like me, then what better item can you find than this???</li>
            <li> I wish it would hold more quantity of hair.</li>
            <li> but she had the most glorious curls when it was time to go to bed</li>
            <li> Ok, my hair NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER...</li>
            <li> you have to make sure their is not lingering strands because your hair will GET STUCK and from experience I had to unplug and literally dig my hair out</li>
            <li> This happened twice but the closer you use it towards your scalp the more risk you take for it to get stuck.</li>
            <li> I clipped part of my hair on top of my head and worked in sections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can also imagine so many uses for this.  </li>
            <li> For example, creating a simple ponytail with perfect ringlets.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do love this product, but please keep in mind</li>
            <li> I will try to update this review as I use the product more.  </li>
            <li> This makes really cute, curly hair</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to get your hair out by yourself and will require assistance.  </li>
            <li> and I think, with practice, I will be able to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li> &quot;  You need to practice using this tool, and each time you&#x27;ll become better and faster at</li>
            <li> I heard about how it was \\&quot;different\\&quot; because it heats your hair on all sides and retains your style better, so I decided to try it out.  </li>
            <li> it took forever, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of volume on top of my head, and boy did I get my hair tangled in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this would be even easier and faster if you had someone to help you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this tool and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that like most things, there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> Product did not do any better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it wraps the hair for you.</li>
            <li> Best part is that I don&#x27;t wash it and the next day, it looks even better.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d researched it more.</li>
            <li> Perhaps even better than achieving Kate Middleton hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even slept with my hair curled, and my hair still looks perfect the next day.</li>
            <li> If you try more than that (or get the tool too close to your scalp)</li>
            <li> The curls are much better than a curling iron</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on my hair since using it.  </li>
            <li> I recently cut about 5 inches off, and it still curls great!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you don&#x27;t put it too close to your head or your hair will get stuck.</li>
            <li> 5 stars I give this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this :)  </li>
            <li> It took me about 30 minutes to do all of my hair and the curls last all day at work and were still perfect all night.</li>
            <li> Follow tne instructions and all will be ok.</li>
            <li> However, it is enjoyable for her to do it herself.</li>
            <li> but i love curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it love it</li>
            <li> oh my god love it.</li>
            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Everything ok.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put more in.</li>
            <li> so this is actually the best case scenario)</li>
            <li> Makes cute curls.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I think it might work better</li>
            <li> My hair had never looked better.</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I have been through so many hair curlers growing up and the curls never lasted longer then 1 hour.</li>
            <li> You must make sure there are not tangles in your hair</li>
            <li> What I love about this curler is you don&#x27;t need to worry about bumping it because it will not burn out.</li>
            <li> The hair will simply come out and unravel off the curler a bit, which is great if you are trying to curl a child&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the curl I get from this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I am saving alot of money and time.</li>
            <li> Still love it</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my hair than I ever have--literally have strangers stop me and ask me how I did my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> I had two options: cut my hair (which I am growing to donate to locks of love) or break the machine into millions of pieces to get my hair out.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my daughter is ok now, but we are returning the tool.</li>
            <li> This make lovely uniform curls and they stay for more then 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This kept coming up as one of the top models.</li>
            <li> You can see the results in the photo :)</li>
            <li> my straightener works better at curling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!:)</li>
            <li> Ok, that&#x27;s all for now.  </li>
            <li> In love, and I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Much better than using the wand where you can burn your hand or neck.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> We both really love it.  </li>
            <li> I would like it better if it rotated so</li>
            <li> This curler is better than the $150 one</li>
            <li> And if you can get someone else to do your hair, even better.</li>
            <li> By the time I was able to get her hair out it was fried from the heat and broke off.  </li>
            <li> My wife says she loves me more now that I made her morning routine easier.</li>
            <li> If you put more than a quarter inch of hair in ...</li>
            <li> We need to set up a foundation to make sure this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have told so many people</li>
            <li> Such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> If you are considering you have nothing left to consider its AWESOME</li>
            <li> For  $100 you couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> It was a joy to give her so much pleasure.</li>
            <li> and I just love the results.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I think a curling iron better</li>
            <li> I love it ..</li>
            <li> I love it ...</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> , if you follow the directions with facing the barrel towards your head, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled, and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the machine it will work great.</li>
            <li> and once you loosen your grip on the curler you should be able to get your hair out no problem.</li>
            <li> It curls mid length hair best.</li>
            <li> More time consuming than I thought.</li>
            <li> It is ok...</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> in short, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Did great on my medium length hair, just don&#x27;t put in too much at a time.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more pricey than most devices</li>
            <li> and it is wanting more to hold on to for a tighter curl.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It might work better for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THIS MACHINE.</li>
            <li> She is getting into that grow up stage and looks lovely with curls.</li>
            <li> I have rag-rolled my daughter&#x27;s hair many times</li>
            <li> (I did it in two sections, top and bottom, about 10 curls each section) in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> more of the reviews sounded ok.  </li>
            <li> I impulsively bought this out of desperation and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> , i would recommend de-frizzing your hair for better results</li>
            <li> Perfect product, Perfect curls, I am totally addicted to it Now!</li>
            <li> so make sure you have lengthy hair for this product.</li>
            <li> ...use hairsray once you&#x27;re done :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the curls are cute</li>
            <li> And it will look better--you&#x27;ll have more control over your hair and timing.</li>
            <li> The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls.  </li>
            <li> She is a teenager and is really into styling her hair and this has been a great tool and a time saver as well.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was more time consuming to use instead of just a curling iron</li>
            <li> Safe if you know how to use it correctly (if the hair gets stuck for any reason, just keep opening and closing and the hair comes out).</li>
            <li> More than that</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I curl my hair with the Pro Curler, even from people that I don&#x27;t even know.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Some of the more elite versions of this product have choice of curl directions and alternating directions, which I would like.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it its fantastic!</li>
            <li> The heat and time settings are nice but don&#x27;t give me a huge range of curl types.</li>
            <li> The timer makes it even easier to make sure all your curls are uniform.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> but I have gotten better with every use.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE this thing.</li>
            <li> and I love wearing my hair like this,</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li> , I wished that I would be able to do something to it.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair has amazing curls! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> seems  to get &amp;#34; stuck&amp;#34; sort of scared me, but was able to get hair out.</li>
            <li> I totally love it</li>
            <li> This works better than you think it would.</li>
            <li> the medium curls on my side hair, then the largest curls on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I love that it lasts with or without product, like hair spray.</li>
            <li> I love the three sizes of curls it can give.</li>
            <li> I have ZERO experience using a curling iron and always wanted to be able to do so when I felt like dolling up,.</li>
            <li> so I can make BIG curls too! :D</li>
            <li> Though it is more ringlets than curls</li>
            <li> and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Got to love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that the bulk of the heating elements are encased.  </li>
            <li> I made sure my husband was home</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this \\&quot;Curling\\</li>
            <li> But I love it</li>
            <li> I love It</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I Love it and am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to hold a curl and in most cases even get a curl.</li>
            <li> She is always wanting to do something with her hair, but she isn&#x27;t gifted in the hair styling department.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the fact that it does the curling for you, and the curls turn out great.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure the amount of hair you take every time to curl if you take in more quantity</li>
            <li> I even watched youtube videos to make sure to use it correctly.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it at Kohl&#x27;s because I had a discount on top of the existing sale they were running on</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> TRY IT! :)</li>
            <li> and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Okay - here&#x27;s the deal...</li>
            <li> It was much more helpful for me to watch a demo on YouTube.</li>
            <li> and I would be able to get SOME curl.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> The more you try to shove in this thing, the more chance you have of getting your hair</li>
            <li> I love this curler.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this curler.</li>
            <li> and I feel in love.  </li>
            <li> I was given this ad a gift since I love having curly hair but just can&#x27;t curl my hair myself.</li>
            <li> So glad I took a chance--</li>
            <li> Thankfully my father and I were able to somehow, miraculously, get her hair out</li>
            <li> THERE ARE MUCH BETTER IRONS THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN.</li>
            <li> I love the timer - beep -</li>
            <li> it like the it but better curls with curling iron</li>
            <li> i truly love this item</li>
            <li> have now used this curler about 4 times, and have gotten better with it.</li>
            <li> The trick is to keep strand of hair to 1-2 inches at the widest point, and to make sure it all fits in the channel of the curler.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I give this to someone for Christmas and the love it.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was very impressed with the results!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a more defective product and should be banned.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> If i  just brush the top and finger brush the rest, my hair stays in more ringlet type curls which I don&#x27;t prefer but which suit my daughter well.</li>
            <li> I really really love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE that it beeps to let me know when it&#x27;s done, I don&#x27;t even have to think about what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see them being able to do it themselves.  </li>
            <li> , I repeat, NEVER been able to get a curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> VIOLA - magic curls.</li>
            <li> I actually plugged this beautiful baby in at my desk at work, and used a pocket mirror to test it out, I couldn&#x27;t stand the wait!</li>
            <li> I did my entire head today and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li> I got better and faster</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Why so many?</li>
            <li> I love love love it</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> so it holds a curl better than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> and their hair holds for days because they have thicker, more voluminous hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> However there are many negatives for a beginner.  </li>
            <li> I love the result but it is daunting to use and takes forever doing one inch at a time.  </li>
            <li> Love it -</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> otherwise, I love the product.</li>
            <li> Most of you are probably lyrics worried by it pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li> they are usually more competitive on price.  </li>
            <li> I thought since it was shorter hair, the curl would be even better.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you read the directions.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair holds the curl better with this tool than it ever has with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but i love it.  </li>
            <li> My wife found the perfect product; spoke that no woman should miss this product in your beauty kit and to arrange for parties and casual events, The money is excellent;</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use a curling iron to curl my hair without messing it up somehow.</li>
            <li> and I was so impressed that it only took a week to arrived!</li>
            <li> I love this item</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> gave it three because i am hoping it will work better tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on the curls this produces.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Curls end up more like waves.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Got many compliments.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and recommend it .</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas, she is not as pleased with it as she imagined.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Sounded like a good invention, but isn&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> this is going to eat my hair!&amp;#34; You will love it.</li>
            <li> This here invention is greater than sliced bread.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than chunky peanut butter.</li>
            <li> I look forward to getting better at it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you com through your hair</li>
            <li> If this issue could be eliminated, I&#x27;d gladly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The product itself, however, is great, and very adjustable to what you want.</li>
            <li> It doesnt curl like a babyliss, is more for a Gisele Bundchen hair looking</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li> thinking it would stop it from burning, instead it kept my hair from being able to come out.</li>
            <li> And I still love it and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> and then he was able to pry up on a piece with a screwdriver</li>
            <li> and I was able to get my hair out.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s better if you have somebody use this tool for you.</li>
            <li> i love the way it came out, but i can&#x27;t do it myself.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure the barrel opening is always facing your head to avoid tangling.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product works well for some</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I swear this thing is magic.</li>
            <li> we love it.</li>
            <li> I really, really love it.</li>
            <li> I plan on curling my hair much more often.</li>
            <li> Be sure the item you are purchasing is authentic.</li>
            <li> since I only have one usable arm, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that the curls hold up to 3 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair forever and love beachy waves and curls, but can&#x27;t seem to get me hair to hold a curl with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend !</li>

            <li> Fantastic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but it can and will damage your hair, so make sure you follow the pictures on how to position the curler, and don&#x27;t overload it with hair</li>
            <li> On the top layers of my hair</li>

            <li> curls are awesome and last for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I even cut my hair up to my shoulders to try to get this thing to work better for me before I returned it</li>

            <li> Love this product &amp;lt;3</li>

            <li> I tried it on my fine hair and it really gives you a beautiful shiny curl.</li>
            <li> It was so fun and easy to use!!  </li>
            <li> Finally after about 45 minutes I was able to untangle my hair!!!  </li>
            <li> I grabbed it (HOT !!! ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use it over and over again so that I get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this thing very much, but it does to an awesome job.</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous at first thinking this thing would pull my hair up into it as it curled, but this thing was amazing.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for her although I am drafted to curl her hair as I can get to the back of her hair more easily than she can.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very simple and easy to use, perfect curls</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great fast way for beach waves.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great to do the entire head when u have more time!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look natural and beautiful, and theres no product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a fair amount of hair, medium length, and it took me about 15 min to do my whole head!</li>
            <li> cause I loved this product at first.</li>
            <li> I get a pretty good Colm Meaney-look out of this item.</li>
            <li> am thoroughly impressed with how long the curls hold.  </li>
            <li> Look ladies, I have a pretty good sense of humor</li>
            <li> My 11 year old can work this, supervised, and ends up with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> The day after style is just as beautiful with soft waves &amp; curls.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to be good at using this the first time.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job of curling hair.  </li>
            <li> I would say its a pretty good product</li>
            <li> It quit working as good as it did when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and get a good quality hot curler set instead, trust me.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good - takes patients</li>
            <li> It really needs some kind of safety release switch for when your hair gets stuck!</li>
            <li> It is truly easy to use, but it also creates the most beautiful and natural looking curls and waves.</li>
            <li> This is the golden gem of hair tools!!</li>
            <li> Love this it is so cool!</li>
            <li> So excited!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it out myself!</li>
            <li> They need some way to safely remove hair since it is so easily tangled in this device.</li>
            <li> I have chin length hair and it seems easy and safe.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and I have yet to have my hair get caught or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> But if you are on the fence, pick this product up from somewhere that you can easily return it -- then the dilemma is solved :)</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily, but by the end of an 8-10 hour day, my curling wand curls have mostly fallen out (and that&#x27;s with A LOT of hairspray).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it has an anti tangle feature.</li>
            <li> i really love it easy to use zero problems .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Target (to make for an easy return) because I was SO sure I would be returning it</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really good product, reason why my wife bought this product again for a gift to her sister, the product is as described and the quality according to my wife is really good, but the only issue we found this time is that the price was increased in almost 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> She now has curly, wavy shoulder length hair instead of pin straight thanks to this great product!</li>
            <li> Good seller, good overall experience.</li>
            <li> -wise, it is OK but curls do not hold up much longer than i wish</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the great quality</li>
            <li> It makes perfect beautiful curls that last and last literally for days.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to keep it at the recommended 1/2 inch to inch piece of hair and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> , it curls so amazingly and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very cool product.</li>
            <li> have used it multiple times, very easy to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li> This is a great little machine that really leaves you with beautiful amazing curls.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely useful and gives amazing results</li>
            <li> With his help we were able to practically rip my hair free of the darned thing, but not before the damage was done.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is tangle free before using.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I have magic perm hair (straight perm) and was still able to get perfect hair without drying my hair further more.</li>
            <li> It ended up being the best $100 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair</li>
            <li> Best $100 I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I read so many of the reviews that made it sound like my hair would be sucked up and claimed by this curler.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was my own fault.</li>
            <li> As you notice the commercials and even the youtube vids show ppl with healthy smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous about using it because you see so many cheap products on the market</li>
            <li> I had three more weeks of fabulous hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still messing with the settings to find out how to do looser curls, but the two times I&#x27;ve used it so far, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was good, but there are much easier ways to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel inside that is of  good quality  and the whole timer /settings procedure..</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bough one myself</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for me and loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter, too.</li>
            <li> My wife simply loved and she is using too much.</li>
            <li> , if you try to jam to much hair in it, it can tangle, so patience and it will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li> If you make sure that all of your hair is seated down in the groove of the curler, then you will have perfect curls every time.  </li>
            <li> One of the best &#x27;as seen on TV...&#x27;  things I&#x27;ve ever gotten - worked much better than expected!!  </li>
            <li> and I got to say conair got this one right!!</li>
            <li> They love how quick it curls hair, just make sure you dont put it in</li>
            <li> This thing is Super Awesome and can&#x27;t believe the price I totally scored..</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it on my clients and is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and curls my hair from the root to the tips perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this curler and it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a great product to use!</li>
            <li> I have titanium fused wrists and other hand joints, so the curler is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the first product ever that made me love having curls!</li>
            <li> Best 100 dollars I ever spent!</li>
            <li> but it was the best 100.00 i ever spent!</li>
            <li> If they can manage to make a more user friendly lighter unit this would rock, but until then, if you purchase this, prepare for a killer arm workout.</li>
            <li> This thing is cool!  </li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this curler is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy, easy, easy.  </li>

            <li> It is fairly easy to use (there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve</li>
            <li> I was amazed this was soooo easy, and not once did my hair get hung in the curler.</li>
            <li> (For reference, my hair has gotten tangled in it before, but it&#x27;s been really easy to remove).</li>
            <li> but once you do its easy.</li>
            <li> and it was surprisingly easy to use.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>

            <li> well first off im a beginner at curling hair , i never curl my hair because honestly i suck at it ..</li>
            <li> I felt it kind of knot up as it started to be sucked into the machine, but it instantly released, as smoothly as it comes out with a good curl.</li>
            <li> The idea is really nice and is exactly the way it is showed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on some girlfriend&#x27;s and it does SUCH a beautiful job.  </li>
            <li> but once you get it down, it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li> very good quality, I recommend to you will want different hair comb, left very happy, thanks.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron and its everything that i was hoping for, very easy to use your hair don&#x27;t get tangled in it and the curls hold very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the fine side and straight but curls pretty easily, so I followed the directions and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The first time they were great and lasted for some time but ever since then they last two hours at most!</li>
            <li> I used it first the day before catching a long overnight flight and my hair still looked good after arriving and then after a cat nap!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy fine hair.</li>
            <li> Work fine and do the job.</li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair, colored &amp; highlighted hair, with the thickness fine to medium.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Okay, first off I love this product.</li>
            <li> She is 16 and can use it just fine by herself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law has long natural curly hair , she used it and loved it, her hair did look great ,my daughter also has long fine hair and loved how quick it was to look great when using the Infiniti Pro .Good product</li>
            <li> as soon as i mastered that slight detail, my curls came out picture perfect!</li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and my hair has never held curl all that well.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is why:&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have a shoulder length bob, fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Would probably work fine on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> is use a fine tooth comb to comb out each strand before you curl it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and baby fine.</li>
            <li> and I can easily pull the hair free with no issue.</li>
            <li> straight and love love love soft, gorgeous &amp;#34;Victoria Secret&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair but its somewhat fine hair...</li>
            <li> I did it with my curling iron and it was just fine.  </li>
            <li> The section that stuck was perfectly fine as this device will not heat your hair for longer than 12 seconds.</li>
            <li> She has hair that is fine</li>
            <li> We both have fine hair but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair it does work.</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a super neat product!  </li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t a quick hairstyler!</li>
            <li> , it cooled off quickly, and I was able to turn it around and unwind my hair.  </li>
            <li> Quickly returned!</li>
            <li> We were all so scared and it took us about 10 minutes to get her hair out safely (after I of course quickly unplugged the machine)</li>
            <li> Luckily, I was able to pull my hair out of the machine when it got stuck....</li>
            <li> Supper quick and works on any type of hair!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, very easy to use and gives professional results in very short time and leaves the hair looking great</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about dropping a hundred bucks on a hair styling tool of all things, but I&#x27;m really glad I did!</li>
            <li> The look that this creates is a very beautiful mess of curls.</li>
            <li> The curler is very easy to operate and it is very fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like tight curls, so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good produto for those that is not faniliar to the regular curling, because it&#x27;s very easy to manage, but if you are good on the regular one,I think it&#x27;s not for you, because it takes more time &#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;m not very skilled with my hair, so it&#x27;s always awesome to be able to respond, \\&quot;thank you!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really easy, but just make sure you are doing it right.</li>
            <li> and I had little to no problem with getting perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li> Love using it on my hair, and love it even more for my 3 year old!</li>
            <li> But I love it and would tell anyone interested to go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!!JUST BE CAREFUL YOUR HAIR DOES&#x27;NT GET CAUGHT IN IT.....</li>
            <li> While it does an excellent job of achieving a certain type of curl, it doesn&#x27;t  necessarily  replace a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and surprised!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super speedy or magical, but it&#x27;s a really good tool!</li>
            <li> very fast and easy!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought one anyway- and lost a huge chunk of my hair</li>
            <li> The 8, 10, or 12 seconds doesn&#x27;t stop accurately ( curling the hair to release).</li>
            <li> Cheap parts, cheap labor &#x3D; cheap product.</li>
            <li> Just amazing and unbelievable, beautiful and shiny curles, delivered in time.</li>
            <li> SO happy I bought it and will likely be giving for presents this year.</li>
            <li> Works great just wish you take bigger sections of hair though.</li>
            <li> price at Amazon is also fantastic</li>
            <li> I would have a great idea for next Christmas</li>
            <li> However, it is extreeeeeeemely important to follow the instructions.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron takes only 45 minutes and looks great.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t work that great back there, but everywhere else..works great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when I needed to buy it, it wasn&#x27;t available, so I picked up locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would be more fun to do with a friend.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product.</li>
            <li> But if you follow the instructions works great and the curls last.</li>
            <li> It has well job with hair and  nice style with fast work.</li>
            <li> but I did panic for a second lol.</li>
            <li> My husband bless his heart had to literally disassemble the unit in order to free my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately we did not have to cut her hair.</li>
            <li> I got it in 2 days with my Prime shipping and had to option of free returns.</li>
            <li> I love it, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> She tried it on about 5 different family members over our Christmas gathering and it worked great on all but one -she</li>
            <li> Also, if the hair is not coiled correctly, it lets you know with a beeping sound.</li>
            <li> the middle setting works great.  </li>
            <li> Tangling occurred when I didn&#x27;t have a smooth section.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had the kind of hair that no matter how much heat, styling, gel, or spray I use, my curls are falling out while I&#x27;m in the car on my way to the event.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions</li>
            <li> It work great and has multiple settings to customize for your hair.</li>
            <li> well I followed them and my hair still got stuck despite being detangled, smooth,</li>
            <li> is a list of the features that were important to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do enjoy how this curls your hair in a snap, without having to twist the iron around sections yourself.</li>
            <li> I used it on my friends with different types of hair and works great.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased another one and gave it to my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth once I am finished.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium texture, curly, blown smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic curl.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I bought this and after 6 uses and never letting it fall the cheap plastic gear on it</li>
            <li> I saw this in various stores &amp; wanted to see if it was as great as it claimed to be &amp; boy</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic curler.</li>
            <li> works great in the front but how in the WORLD am I supposed to do the back of my hair???</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would love this product, but being able to have something to make curling fun and easier</li>
            <li> It still wouldn&#x27;t come off so we had to rip my hair out just to be free from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She feels comfortable using it</li>
            <li> and I feel comfortable letting her use it.</li>
            <li> The curls weren&#x27;t as smooth</li>
            <li> Curling my whole head of hair in 1/2 hour is amazing.</li>
            <li> Happy with product overall.</li>
            <li> the next day i woke up and it still looked great.</li>
            <li> Try to practice using it before you have some important thing to go to.</li>
            <li> great and her hair was still curly the next morning and it took about 16 minutes to curl all her hair.</li>
            <li> Admittedly my hair is smooth so that may help</li>
            <li> Even when my hair didn&#x27;t get stuck, the curler would sound the &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and foolproof.</li>
            <li> and she has great curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to do my own hair, would just wear it straight or in a ponytail, but this has changed my ways.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t grab it)  and tried to free her hair.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t make really fast curls out of second-day hair</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well and fast.</li>
            <li> She uses it regularly and her hair comes out great.</li>
            <li> However, after using it the 4th time, all it does is make a clicking sound when plugged in, I have tried what I could</li>
            <li> I liked it, is very practical.</li>
            <li> And twist the section of hair lightly</li>
            <li> it and enjoy it!ell.</li>
            <li> If your still tempted to get one, you can have mine for free, along with my scissors that i used.</li>
            <li> the safety sensor is a bit sensitive (which is good since it prevents tangled messes).  </li>
            <li> Be very diligent in reading the instructions, and make sure your hair is combed and without tangles, once you get started with this curler and figure it out, you will love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product; you need to practice with it and make sure you don&#x27;t have too much hair in the device, or it may tangle.  </li>
            <li> so I broke the machine into many pieces to find that the guard that is between the motor and the heater part was not such a good guard.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it and might buy my mom one, if she is good. :)</li>
            <li> I loved the shape of curls produced by this tool, however, my hair frequently got stuck, even when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Loved the way it&#x27;s curled my natural hair though</li>
            <li> my curls stayed perfect throughout the dinner and even till the next day after a whole nights sleep ( i did use hair spray</li>
            <li> but my curls have never been perfect and my curling irons seems to do so much damage to the ends especially.</li>
            <li> Long story short--I have NEVER gotten the beautiful to a fault curl after 3 wks.</li>
            <li> it curled perfectly and fast and the curls held overnight and into the next day.</li>
            <li> It does produce beautiful curls, though patience is a must because it can be time consuming for long hair like my daughter.</li>
            <li> Make sure you brush your hair really well, and if it gets stuck, make sure to brush it again, otherwise it WILL get caught in the barrel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the most important thing : do not let go of the strand right away (</li>
            <li> So just to make sure I was doing it right</li>
            <li> We followed all the instructions and made sure the right part was facing our head every time we curled a strand of air.</li>
            <li> This was just so easy and so cool.  </li>
            <li> With this product you need to absolutely make sure your hair is clean and tangle free!</li>
            <li> I saw some video reviews on YouTube before ordering, one said ir was great and the other wasn&#x27;t able to get the handlg of it.</li>
            <li> You know when you see those infomercials and everything they say seem too easy to be true?</li>
            <li> Rushing through is the perfect recipe for a mess!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also curls my perfectly straight uncurling hair and it stays all day!!!</li>
            <li> And this did it for me, on the first try, in 20 minutes!!  </li>
            <li> Curls last forever and they are so stinkin&#x27; cute!!  </li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t even get hot!!</li>
            <li> i like it soo much!!!</li>
            <li> Overall this tool does it&#x27;s job very nicely and again matches</li>
            <li> She found it very useful for all her requirements.</li>
            <li> Very fun takes some time to learn how to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to be patient and don&#x27;t try to rush it, then you won&#x27;t have any problems and it will be surprisingly quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well even when its clean!!</li>
            <li> but once you figure it out it&#x27;s super easy).</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy.</li>

            <li> This is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I bought this at Target just in case I needed a QUICK AND EASY return</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick to heat up, easy to use</li>
            <li> This really work, is very very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li> It is very easy to learn to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is also important to get the best results to have clean hair with no or very little product and comb out all tangles.  </li>

            <li> First I part the lower 1/4 of my hair with a comb and clip the rest to the top my head.  </li>
            <li> This works great if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much!</li>
            <li> The Idea Is Unique</li>
            <li> Buy it and have fun this summer with your curlers!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it that I opened it immediately and read the directions and started curling away.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about it, I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> This has to be the BEST beauty product I have bought for the past 10 years....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great! :/</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I put the top section of my hair up in a clippy, and do the bottom part first.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for myself</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more curling my hair when I can use hot sticks and have curly hair in 5 min.</li>
            <li> but it is DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li> and I got excited but thought &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> I was really excited to order it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on long term durability but for now it works great.</li>
            <li> and she was so excited to see her princess curls.</li>
            <li> First of all, most of the times when I tried it, my hair got stuck and I had to yank it out.</li>
            <li> This product was also reviewed on WNEP-16 news and Kurt Aaron proved its worth!</li>
            <li> I love this invention, and so fast!</li>
            <li> This is truly a unique curling device.</li>
            <li> It worth the money!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would do :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this curler so much!</li>
            <li> its worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have used it on myself (my hair is quite long) and it works great.</li>
            <li> Even with a straightener though, you have to use small strands to get best results.</li>
            <li> Love this, but my hair still won&#x27;t hold a curl ;)</li>
            <li> Ok first off..</li>
            <li> like I originally wanted.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hard to curl hair and it curls wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this curler today</li>
            <li> It works great and as long as you follow the instruction your hair won&#x27;t be caught in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is my first, I just love that fact though, after having to use straighteners before and burning my ear or hand.</li>
            <li> This worked great on it and the curls hold for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I rarely even leave reviews, but this works!</li>
            <li> bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it takes less time to curl my hair and each curl comes out awesome if done right.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair that never keeps a curl, and I&#x27;ve spend $$$ (esp.</li>
            <li> that is true, you get too much and it&#x27;ll get caught, but hair comes out easy and just move on.. :)</li>
            <li> It made a very limp and lifeless wave at best.</li>
            <li> The clip-less interior combined with perfect all-around heating really does make curls last longer (just don&#x27;t touch until they are cool!).  </li>
            <li> found that if your lightly brush after the curl, you get a soft wavy look that also looks nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curls hold all day too which was a huge concern that was quickly dismissed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That is, be sure to open the tool and kind of \\&quot;dump\\&quot; the curl out of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but you need squeaky clean hair in order to get the curls you want.</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use, one</li>
            <li> I would recommended that all girls get one or your really missing out on something great:)</li>
            <li> clean your hair throughly</li>
            <li> I ordered it with the ONE product and that really helps my hair look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It says that you have to use clean hair in it</li>
            <li> It does say to use with clean hair</li>
            <li> The amount of hair you can put into this thing is a lot smaller than you would put in rollers, but the curls are beautiful with no weird bends or crimps.</li>
            <li> Fun to use and effective on a very troublesome type of hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s lightweight and not cumbersome, it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the positive reviews I reiterate &amp;#34;read the instructions&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> It most definitely works best on shorter hair but for those of us with long locks; save your money &amp; seek out another device.  </li>
            <li> Comb small pieces of hair, make sure no tangles, glides hair into the chamber and beeps when  the curl is ready and you release the handle and out comes a perfect curl.</li>
            <li> I barely knew what I was doing because doing your own hair in a mirror wasn&#x27;t as easy as doing someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It can get hung up if you don&#x27;t do it just right but untangles easy</li>
            <li> and I think its more user error, if you to stick to large of sections in it they will get tangled, and stuck and your hair will burn a bit.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your strands of hair you put in the chamber are not to large or it won&#x27;t take the hair.  </li>
            <li> Instead I use it for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> We were almost to the point of smashing the device with a hammer when I was able to hold the unit at a certain angle</li>
            <li> People are right when they say it&#x27;s idiot-proof!  </li>
            <li> it slides right out!</li>
            <li> I got this after reading such good reviews on it, finding that there were way more positive reviews than negative.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it is super fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> but if your anything like me and have a hard time getting perfect curls</li>
            <li> Works for very good for long straight hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t fall down easy, its stays the sane till the end of the day</li>
            <li> GREAT JUST BE CAREFUL HAIR</li>
            <li> Following the success of the 1997 movie of the same name, featuring a long-haired Nicholas Cage, many of us were delighted by the introduction of the Conair line of styling tools, which allowed do-it-yourselfers to achieve Hollywood-quality hair in our own homes.</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANT: If the warning beeps sound, STOP at once and completely release the hair.</li>
            <li> was a present for my granddaughter, she loved it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite doing most of the work, this curler isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;time saver&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I can get a full head of curl in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I woke up Christmas day and still had a full look, just needed to run over it and tune it up.  </li>
            <li> After much effort we were able to get my hair out, but it was burnt.  </li>
            <li> she can curl her own hair professionally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool</li>
            <li> Much easier and better than curlers.</li>
            <li> i love it too much</li>
            <li> I have really healthy, but straight hair.</li>
            <li> Wait until your curler is cool and then twirl that thing around in the chamber</li>
            <li> Really cool device.</li>
            <li> but now my dreams come true with Conair.</li>
            <li> If I was to section my hair off this way and use a regular iron, I&#x27;d be there for a good hour.  </li>
            <li> I waited for the curls to cool, put some smoothing cream in,</li>
            <li> I slept on them last night, they still look good today.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on  this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> full body curls, like you see in magazines.</li>
            <li> I read online that this is perfect for people with thick hair; thus I bought this.</li>
            <li> i already have a curly hair but every once in a while you would like a nice curl rather than a natural messed up</li>
            <li> the next day takes a good 30 to 40 minutes</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is more straight and finer than mine, but she loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it just looked too cool to pass up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different curling irons and can&#x27;t get any sort of curl that looks good</li>
            <li> Actually, my friend tested mine yesterday and loved it too.</li>
            <li> You really dont have to be skilled to use it.</li>
            <li> The curls lasted all day, they were full and bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I loved the simplicity of the curling machine and tried a different brand - Conair.</li>
            <li> With the curler, My 11 year old can now curl her own hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons before and really did not like the results.</li>
            <li> Really Works, Love this.  </li>
            <li> they even looked good the next morning after sleeping on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had true using curling irons and rollers.</li>
            <li> Bought two of them, seems really cool.</li>
            <li> In just a few minutes and with total ease I create the perfect look, and I am actually enjoying it because it is so easy.</li>
            <li> But if you watch some YouTube videos and you&#x27;re careful with it until you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll be your new best friend.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this item, I was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve - the machine must be the right way around and hair must be tangle free.</li>
            <li> My hair got caught really easily and when it gets caught in a hot iron...</li>
            <li> My hair came out of it pretty easy</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was so easy.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend that you first read the instructions in order not to have any problems or hair</li>
            <li> It really is super cool</li>
            <li> It is so easy and fast!  </li>
            <li> this is easy to use and it really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to new products like this, and I CANNOT believe how well and easily this works!</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, smooth hair that looks nice curled...</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the curls and use it myself! :O)</li>
            <li> This curling iron is definitely a little intimidating, but after the very first use, I loved it!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to have the styler facing your head in the right direction, only use 1/2&amp;#34; - 1&amp;#34; sections of hair, and make sure your hair is tangle and product free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this new way of curling my hair!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this new hair product!</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first time, but I don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> The best thing since sliced bread... seriously.</li>
            <li> Now I can seriously say that this one is one of must haves for women, you may not have  as perfect hairstyle as you can get from proffesional</li>
            <li> However my fine business in the front party in the rear is a real treat!</li>
            <li> Whoosh, the hair is drawn quickly in and curled.</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair got tangled it did not hurt because it quickly releases it.</li>
            <li> You quickly get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clearly part the sections of hair you wish to be heated into curly goodness and that they are tangle free.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep the open, circular end at the top, facing the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;ve had not catastrophic disasters.</li>
            <li> And it beeps quickly when it&#x27;s done with the curl.</li>
            <li> For me to have very well defined waves and a few ringlets after sleeping on it is an EXCELLENT result.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I end with the top of my head, which helps to achieve more volume.  </li>
            <li> I quickly unplugged it and had to get my daughter and husband to help me get my hair out.  </li>
            <li> You can curl your hair rather quickly with it.  </li>
            <li> And it gets it done quickly.</li>
            <li> Not only did they stay all night, but my hair was still perfectly curled the next day!</li>
            <li> item is super picky about how you hold it</li>
            <li> Product got to me quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick,</li>
            <li> The seller sent my gift quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I may do more research on the authentic MiraCurl and end up ordering that in the future.</li>
            <li> and I quickly became aggravated with the amount of time it took to curl my hair with a curling iron</li>
            <li> and it quickly curls your hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I immediately unplugged it hoping my hair wouldn&#x27;t burn off, and luckily it didnt, but I still couldn&#x27;t get my hair out...</li>
            <li> This machine is a miracle to me - the first time I have finally had the kind of hair I always wanted!</li>
            <li> The best part is that somehow the curls last all day vs. traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a cancel or release button to get your hair out of the curler if this happens so panic quickly ensues.</li>
            <li> You have to yank your hair out of the curler (and yes, hair also gets yanked out of your head) as quickly as you can since it can burn your hair while its stuck in there.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom for Christmas, and her hair used to be naturally super curly but now has straightened out to a wave.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for a v2 that will accommodate more hair - a quantity more similar to what a curling iron or electric hairsetter would accommodate.  </li>
            <li> , just quick movements of the handle)</li>
            <li> I was lucky and didn&#x27;t burn my hair</li>
            <li> You get the hang of it really quickly.</li>
            <li> Its quick and the curl lasts all day</li>
            <li> As advertised, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This tool made me look like a super model.</li>
            <li> So far the return policy on prime seems very easy.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the tangles were very easy to clear.  </li>
            <li> To be completely HONEST, I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because of a major hair catastrophe.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the only thing I must warn you about is also the best quality of the machine: the vacuum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apart from that, all other is fine and good.</li>
            <li> I excitedly, and hurriedly, read the instructions on how to use the product and began right away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A high quality curling iron and some practice would be a much better investment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curler, just please make sure you read the directions, and watch youtube videos</li>
            <li> Mostly people thought I just came from a high class salon.</li>
            <li> Love the tool and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did my daughters very long straight hair and it came out beautifully.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast!  </li>
            <li> I get my hair chemically straightened, so I had pretty much relinquished the ability of my hair ever being able to have it hold a curl (since I opted out of the curly-haired life) though every once in awhile for a special occasion</li>
            <li> and it is difficult if not some times impossible to curl and this amazing product actually produces wonderful curls and waves on my hair that will stay all day without any hair spray if I wish and with hair spray it is beautiful and perfectly curled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my own hair with a curling iron and all other curlers have looked unnatural or haven&#x27;t held.</li>
            <li> The very first curl got stuck.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions but it still grabbed my hair &amp; got them stuck in it the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot</li>
            <li> My daughter has average, shoulder length hair and works great on her too.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, and my wife absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot .</li>
            <li> At first I struggled finding a comfortable way to hold the styler.</li>
            <li> ;-) its been 4 hours now and my hair still looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it is by no means light weight.</li>
            <li> Another thing id like to add is that my hair does not hold curl well, its very straight but the curls from using this thing lasted all day!</li>
            <li> Every time I tried, it took too long, I burned myself, the curls never looked good, and were gone in minutes.</li>
            <li> For long hair it will curl a fair length</li>
            <li> I have wavy extensions down to my rear and this curler worked great.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve when using it, but once you get it down your great.</li>
            <li> That should be quick, easy, and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some getting used to, especially on the right side of my head, but it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Came in sealed in the original packaging in brand spanking new conditions!!!</li>
            <li> When using this tool against your scalp, the more fanned-out your hair is at the top near your scalp, the more likely the tool is to get stuck and rip your hair out.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty aid.</li>
            <li> Right after curling a length it has to cool for a bit so the curl can set.  </li>
            <li> Gave me nice curls on my very long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and performs very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> In Infiniti Pro is totally simple to use and gives me nice full curls and they are long-lasting too.  </li>
            <li> try to rush by putting too much hair in at once or it can tangle, but it does have the ability to detangle easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li> It is just as fast and easy as the commercials show.</li>
            <li> The pro curl gives me a perfect long lasting curl every time.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and you will have a perfect long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> This product was super exciting to me.</li>
            <li> unit was fast to heat up and fairly easy for me to use on my daughters</li>
            <li> this is a really fun product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> but overall I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it only once, but I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> but it works as advertised and produces a pretty look!</li>
            <li> Wifes red hair to waist, awsome curls, love it!</li>
            <li> This really works if you follow direction correctly!!</li>
            <li> Everything the commercial says it is and more!</li>
            <li> Overall, I LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I knew everything about this product first!</li>
            <li> My hair is a little more than shoulder length and it takes around 20 minutes to do but looks adorable!</li>
            <li> , it took me 10 minutes to do my whole head !!</li>
            <li> was hesitant at first but this product delivers!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said it was his favorite look, called it my wild hair!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sitting here at work sitting pretty with LOTS of curls!  </li>
            <li> VERY UPSET!This Contraption is a NIGHTMARE!!</li>
            <li> so you can see what I did on my FIRST try!</li>
            <li> Thank you,,,,, My 2 daughters really like them!!</li>
            <li> It holds curls better than standard curling iron and easy.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that falls to around my shoulder blades, and it has been my mother&#x27;s lifetime grievance that it refuses to hold a curl - not even when threatened with copious amounts of hairspray, mousse, or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put too much hair in and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight by the way.</li>
            <li> She has straight, fine hair and whenever I curled it and hair sprayed the heck out of it</li>
            <li> I have fine  hair and not too much of it.</li>
            <li> You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair or it gets tangled</li>
            <li> Works great on my little girls.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about the product because the first few curls looked great</li>
            <li> For me, the 12-second timer on high with small pieces makes perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li> This product creates beautiful springy curls with virtually very little effort.  </li>
            <li> Gave me amazing curls without having to worry about burning myself like with a regular curler.</li>
            <li> Hair will tangle if it is not combed smooth and if too much hair is fed into the machine.</li>
            <li> anyway, i tried it last night and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> The curls look amazing and last for days.</li>
            <li> make sure your hair is clean, dry and tangle free and</li>
            <li> whole sucking in and the sound of the machine might seem scary...but relax...</li>
            <li> I have never in my life gotten such amazing curls as I do with this product.  </li>
            <li> but as I read the instructions &amp; calmly tried it out, it became my friend.  </li>
            <li> I used this on second day hair and it worked amazing.</li>
            <li> yadda yadda, some beeping, stay calm...</li>
            <li> Stay calm and wait for the beeps.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li> Once finished and combed through (finger combing),  you get amazing curls that last!  </li>
            <li> But worth it.</li>
            <li> And that is extremely rare when it comes to any hair product.  </li>
            <li> But  it may be worth it</li>
            <li> I could never accomplish this on my own with a traditional curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try to do something fun with some all-over curls in my hair for some upcoming events this summer, and I have no patience for curlers or curling irons.</li>
            <li> also think it is worth the $$$.  </li>
            <li> We had to cut it out of her hair after trying to take it apart with out success.  </li>
            <li> I had seen it and similar things (Another popular hairstyling product maker makes one also) advertised.</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons/tools and this is by far the greatest!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product.</li>
            <li> Now my teen can curl her own hair instead of me standing there for 20-30 min, she does her own hair up in about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I could see a person with thinner hair having success with the tool.  </li>
            <li> Curls last for 2 days nicely..</li>
            <li> make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled and use reasonable sections-large sections of hair get caught up.&lt;br /&gt;Getting &amp;#34;caught up&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the end of the world, you just gently pull, and voila!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this for my 11 year old.</li>
            <li> but, if you want fun wavy curls that add bounce, this is it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re golden.  </li>
            <li> Third (and most importantly)</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to use.</li>
            <li> Makes curling my hair FUN</li>
            <li> This was WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> Of course, I have no idea how to curl hair; for me, this product is worth every penny of</li>
            <li> soon as I got the product, I tried to use it and it didn&#x27;t work properly, it didn&#x27;t get warm.</li>
            <li> I just make one twist in the section I&#x27;m curling to feed it through easier, rarely get hair caught.</li>
            <li> Still, pretty cool</li>
            <li> There is no brush inside the motor, so it&#x27;s not like your hair is catching on internal bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (but I feel it&#x27;s worth it -- try using an Ulta 20% off coupon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $100.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fun to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> The curl secret kept perfect curls all night and that&#x27;s with her flipping and running around.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of YouTubers try it out and decided it was worth an investment.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your research on the product and see if similar products are available cheaper.</li>
            <li> the curls were nice however it would take forever to do an entire head of hair.  </li>
            <li> this one is one of the cheapest ones and it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> #34;You got your hair all fixed up or something&amp;#34; ok, he&#x27;s 19.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the cheap traditional curling irons</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> The maker of Curl Secret is my best friend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curled, it feels healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> It is also fun to watch your hair get pulls into the chamber .....</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this thing is actually worth the money.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried it on 5 different people including my own</li>
            <li> and i love love love that the curls stay till the next day , and when you go to touch up the curl the next day</li>
            <li> If I put more than two inches of my thin shoulder length hair in then it will either get caught in the chamber or not do a great job.</li>
            <li> Ended up throwing it away because I didn&#x27;t want to tell anyone it was worth using.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It NEVER curl it worth a damn.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll worth the money</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t think it was worth the  amount of money it cost.</li>
            <li> She thinks it was worth the money,but then again, her mother bought it.</li>
            <li> The curls come out silky smooth, makes my hair look healthy, and -- I never thought I&#x27;s ever say this -- but the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> rarely submit reviews</li>
            <li> This curling magic wand gives me natural curls that make me look like I have a spiral perm.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting nearly 6 months to write this review, I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair that good because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> But, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile to do all your hair, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> A Fun concept...but not for me.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The curling iron does its job, and the output is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> With the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret all I do is put in a strip of hair and presto, I have the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers of this product brag about how there are &amp;#34;built in features&amp;#34; to make sure your hair &amp;#34;never gets stuck&amp;#34; which is obviously a complete lie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy like most people are saying.</li>
            <li> This is going to be so much fun to use</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> (you dont wanna fry ur hair lol), This will take quite sometimes to finish ur whole hair since it only takes a bit of hair at a time, it will stop if ur hair gets tangle or you put in too much at once.</li>
            <li> I think its worth the money</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair which is now perfectly curled &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34;  long hair.</li>
            <li> it worth the money</li>
            <li> Its pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much hair, face it th e correct way and make sure your hair is brushed well.</li>
            <li> so I thought it&#x27;d be useful, but the machine tangles my hair a lot</li>
            <li> I do not think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> When used on different types of hair, it was not as effective as advertised.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair one night, then used the Curl Secret and my curls turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with Curl Secret .</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so much fun.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only got caught because of my own fault.</li>
            <li> Heck, I&#x27;ll go as far as to say it&#x27;s better than Reese&#x27;s peanut  butter cups (which for me is saying a lot).    </li>
            <li> While the concept &amp; design of this curler is incredible, its actual performance varies dramatically on different hair types.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was worth the $79.</li>
            <li> It have a lot of hair it worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the soft curls that I can create with my curl pro.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It goes very quickly if I use the high setting on medium and 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> First thing first: I leave feedbacks very rare.</li>
            <li> this works amazing well, is super simple and for the first time ever, i didn&#x27;t even have to use any hair products.</li>
            <li> I decided to research videos on this product, and over all they were very positive.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful soft curls in her very long hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good if you want to curl a lot of hair very fast and very curly, not for cute little waves curls at the end.</li>
            <li> But really works exactly as advertised and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best way I can explain the curls it gives for those with long hair is akin to that which you get after a day on the beach after the wind whips your hair dry.  </li>
            <li> The Curl Secret works amazing, never tangles my hair (that is very fine, easy to tangle).</li>
            <li> The description is pretty accurate as well as some of the positive reviews of the product.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to do curls like this in my hair before, it did catch my hair like 2 times but it beeps, stops and unroll it, I have used it so many times and other then those 2 times</li>
            <li> Since I wash my hair every other day, I am impressed that the curl lasts for the second day.</li>
            <li> I thought that the Curl Secret would be a great way to make curls quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I unplugged the contraption and yelled for my husband to quickly come help me, because by that point I was already smelling burnt hair (keep in mind this thing is HOT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty quick way to get curls</li>
            <li> The delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li> but you get the hang of it pretty quickly..</li>
            <li> My fine hair is pretty straight and never holds curl.</li>
            <li> For long hair, don&#x27;t try to curl more than 1/2 inch at a time!  </li>
            <li> I always used flat iron but never managed to get nice curls with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem using it then you are not doing it right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a spaz, but trying to get the correct side facing my head while looking in the mirror and alligning the hair right...</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> so I just opened it up and the hair came right out.  </li>
            <li> Also there is a certain way you have to hold this device with one special side facing your head, otherwise it does not curl at all..</li>
            <li> If it stops winding hair in and beeps, don&#x27;t pull it right out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is revolutionary and if you do it right, it will provide you with curls that will have folks in the office asking &amp;</li>
            <li> yes i had it pointed in the right direction.)</li>
            <li> We tried it out right after I gave it to her</li>
            <li> right and getting the hair inserted correctly,</li>
            <li> I packed it right up for return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend brushing or combing through the piece of hair right before you put it in the tool</li>
            <li> just got a screwdriver slid it under my hair and pulled it right out</li>
            <li> But when it starts to tangle, you can feel it, and if you let go right away you can avoid the tangle.  </li>
            <li> the curl always fell right away, but this has lasted all night.</li>
            <li> process but right off the bat</li>
            <li> I will probably have to keep experimenting to get the right combination of heat and timing before I get results</li>
            <li> The curls or waves come right out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The curler states right on it which side should go toward your head so the hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always wanted spiral curls and could never get them right.</li>
            <li> you did it right.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend brushing it right before putting it in the curl-chamber.</li>
            <li> (the curls don&#x27;t last otherwise) or Caruso steam curlers if I want curls in my hair which last 1-2 days and works beautifully with no damage</li>
            <li> Using this for 2 months I haven&#x27;t really noticed my hair being any more damaged than normal.</li>
            <li> We really wanted to keep the machine for its great curls but decided it just was not worth the hair getting stuck, etc.</li>
            <li> As an aside, my hair is fine and straight and this was able to make my hair wavy, but did not hold the curl for more than a few hours, even with hairspray.  </li>
            <li> it in clean straight hair.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;She said - that it was very easy and simple to use it.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and while I have gotten my hair stuck I open the chamber as soon as I feel it pulling.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the curls last all day.  </li>
            <li> I know she says its a time consuming process, but when no other curling iron has held the curls in her hair we both love it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just grab a half inch of unkempt hair and expect a nice looking smooth</li>
            <li> it is super safe with no exposed parts that could burn your hand since the hair is heated from the inner chamber...</li>
            <li> It works best with straight soft hair (well brushed) and it can be finicky when I try to curl too much hair at one time, but all in all I love the curl and though I don&#x27;t understand why, the curl stays all day long!</li>
            <li> The girls looked amazing and held all day long.</li>
            <li> My hair usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl so this is working out great for me.  </li>
            <li> For 18 minutes styling time (and that was my first time), I feel this is well worth it, because my hair is going to have style and wave until I wash it</li>
            <li> Also a great feature: the beep lets you know when it&#x27;s set so no more overheating hair.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at curling small sections of your hair.  </li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and restrict your sections of hair to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, this curling iron provides amazing, professional-looking results.</li>
            <li> I used the hottest setting with most time and barely got a curl.  </li>
            <li> so glad I gave this a try, and spent an hour or so learning how to use this - it is saving me so much time, AND giving me better results  </li>
            <li> It worked great a few times and then it ATE MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> It is very user friendly but you must read the instructions first.</li>
            <li> all, I liked the device and if I had long hair</li>
            <li> did my hair once and liked it but felt like it took so long</li>
            <li> The heat is perfect and can give those tight or big curls.</li>
            <li> My daughter has Down Syndrome and sensory wise hates curling irons.  </li>
            <li> tends to imply, but when you want to take the time to make the extra effort to look amazing, this certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> I do put a little spray on the top of my hair just to hold the top like i want it, but the curls, get nothing.  </li>
            <li> Minutes later, my hair separated into perfect Little Bo Peep corkscrew curls again.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it truely does make the perfect curl and it&#x27;s very easy to use and takes less time to use compared to a regular curling iron or wand.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is pretty damaged right now, so my curls are not retaining as well as the should.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you learn the right way to use it, it does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair - right at my shoulders and it looks so pretty.  </li>
            <li> It draws the hair into it very quickly - and if someone&#x27;s natural reaction is to hold onto the end of the section of hair being curled, well that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s going to get stuck.</li>
            <li> Looks so easy on TV, but made a wild nest out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Have used it several times and when used correctly, it makes beautiful curls without having to guess how long to keep your</li>
            <li> /&gt;The commercial made it looked effortless to create perfect curls in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions and curl your hair when it&#x27;s clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Even if I put it in a quick pony tail, I can make a couple of curls, and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This is surprisingly easy to use and makes a soft curl.</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck a few times but overall seems like it will be great!</li>
            <li> so easy to use my 3 year old granddaughter</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair that never stays curled.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair</li>
            <li> I even tried just doing a few accent pieces instead of my whole head, when I was in a hurry, and it still looked great and held.</li>
            <li> Even starting with it frizzy but brushed, it curls my hair great.</li>
            <li> I went back to my good old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li> First two curls came out great, then the third partition, it swallowed up by hair and just frizzed it up and left it all tangled.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with your average curling iron anyway, especially time wise.</li>
            <li> Once you know what&#x27;s going on, its super easy and you can get your hair done quickly, even with really long hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li> Gives nice loose curls</li>
            <li> I have incredibly straight and curl-resistant hair, and have previously never been able to maintain anything even *resembling</li>
            <li> she has very straight hair</li>
            <li> It was very fast to curl all my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl.</li>
            <li> The product was deliveried very fast and it is working</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
            <li> Very very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it if you have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> I was very very hesitant to buy it and</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Also, good luck feeding more than a few hairs in at a time- if you put more than a few hairs in, it will beep, and stop working.</li>
            <li> It does get super hot, so make sure you use a protective hair product and don&#x27;t leave your hair in the curler for long periods or you will burn it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest those who have frizzy hair like myself to run a flat iron over the hair to get it nice and straight, and it makes it easier to separate sections of hair.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon and the store has super easy returns, and I just knew that I would return in the next day.</li>
            <li> Not only was it super easy to use</li>
            <li> I have straight, straight, straight hair that is also quite fine..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dreaded curling my own hair for special occasions with the round iron...</li>
            <li> You need a bit of practice but after my first try I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Its pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> overall verdict is to follow the directions and enjoy some miraculous results!</li>
            <li> this thing just gave me style again for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I use a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium set on 40 to straighten it and a Hot Tools curler with a marcel grip to curl.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: curl the hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time tonight, and of course I got my hair stuck in it, twice.  </li>
            <li> and as you keep doing it you learn the exact amount to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> When I woke up in the morning it was still pretty wavy.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I did get my hair tangled up inside the device.</li>
            <li> I love this thing and the curls would last 3</li>
            <li> It will make growing my hair in much easier to deal with!</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv this!</li>
            <li> I was able to curl everything in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use it the iron refused to release my hair.</li>
            <li> Did the under side of my hair first.  </li>
            <li> Yes your hair does get stuck on occasion, but never stuck enough to not be able to get it out, or to damage it.  </li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy at first.</li>
            <li> but this thing is the absolute bomb!</li>
            <li> Make sure you have your hair brushed and sectioned</li>
            <li> Had difficulty at first while getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> Got it for Christmas and used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> , it happened the first time she used it</li>
            <li> I think it would be harder on my own head of course.</li>
            <li> Only use an inch of hair at a time and make sure you are facing the open part of the curler to the head.always brush out each piece to make sure there are no snarls.</li>
            <li> Plus the return shipping instructions were elaborate and not that simple to understand.</li>
            <li> Real deal!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I saw in the TV ad</li>
            <li> My first attempt terrified me because I thought the curler would never dislodge from my head.  </li>
            <li> Watched u-tube video &amp; read instructions first, didn&#x27;t have any problems using first time.</li>
            <li> Stick with curlers, hot rollers, curling iron...</li>
            <li> first - before I made my purchase on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to watch the folks who didn&#x27;t follow the instructions too, but hey, this will help you know what NOT to do ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> * a curl/wave for more than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> First things first</li>
            <li> I have done a tutorial on this product and unboxing and first impressions check it out</li>
            <li> It started to pull and tangle my hair, so I let go of the tension to try to unwrap my hair and get it free, but I couldn&#x27;t - it was completely stuck inside of the machine.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to only put in about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thickness of hair in it at a time or the safety will not allow the hair to enter the chamber.</li>
            <li> This thing kicks ass and gives me curly locks for two days straight!</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who was a big fan of a curling wand, I like this product a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have wanted tgis since the first time I had seen it on TV but just could not bring myself to buy it for 119$ well when it went on sale I had to get it</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it though :)</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t know if she loves it or not!)</li>
            <li> It really curls your hair well, and the curls stay in through out the day!</li>
            <li> However, after using it the first time I knew it was a winner.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time</li>
            <li> I pulled the cable from the wall and finally after burning and losing some of my hair, I was able to get it out of the spiral chamber.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got a section of my hair stuck in it too</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I was really careful to keep the barrel facing my head and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what its supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Hot rollers wont stay in my hair and</li>
            <li> Lower heat will give you looser curls and higher heat will give you tighter curls.  </li>
            <li> I think that if your hair has multiple layers the result may have ben better.  </li>
            <li> your hair retain curls or styling better,\\&quot; hot rollers, foam rollers, curling irons, etc.</li>
            <li> sure when you open the tool and release your hair that you don&#x27;t \\&quot;drag\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it was hot and could have burned my hair.</li>
            <li> Patience is a virtue and will be tested at first.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be.  </li>
            <li> Over filling the compartment is why my hair was caught in the first place.</li>
            <li> First time out of the box it was usable.  </li>
            <li> I watched a tutorial on You Tube first, which I think it helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> My hair looks exactly like hers.</li>
            <li> and the anti-tangle feature REALLY works!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what my daughter was looking for.</li>
            <li> , I am absolutely amazed that it did!</li>
            <li> If she were take more time and do smaller sections, she could (most likely) get tigher curls.</li>
            <li> When is hot it smells plastic melted.</li>
            <li> until i realized that after the 8-12 second beep/hold you have to let go of the handle and let the curl drop out without touching the edges of the iron, rather than pulling the curl from the device as you would with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different ways to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried hot rollers, curling irons, curl wands, over night techniques, you name it.</li>
            <li> For my first time I used the highest setting out of fear that my curls would fall out by the end of the night if I used the lower settings.</li>
            <li> As for my hair getting tangled, it happened twice during my first use.</li>
            <li> Overall this is probably my favorite hair purchase ever.</li>
            <li> It is way too hot and the motor sounds like it had a problem the first time I attempted to use it.</li>
            <li> The heat is way too hot.</li>
            <li> Upon comparison to my original there were several significant differences.</li>
            <li> or else you will end up with more of a wave then an actual curve.</li>
            <li> The actual hot curler faces your head so just make sure you dont have it touch your skin</li>
            <li> so it most likely won&#x27;t get tangled up in it.</li>
            <li> This is much faster and easier!</li>
            <li> My first time I used it, my hair got caught and I had to unplug it and literally pull my hair out.</li>
            <li> Only recommend using some mousse before drying your hair to make sure the curls stay.</li>
            <li> And this is FAST!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just used for the first time today.</li>
            <li> The curl turns out so much better with smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it</li>
            <li> My 14yo niece got her hair stuck in this curler on her first attempt at using it.  </li>
            <li> I did a better job on the left side of my head</li>
            <li> I love this but gave it only three stars as girls across the country will be loosing chunks of hair with it!  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 5 minutes to do my hair and for the first time in my life I feel like a hot woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I looked funny</li>
            <li> I really like the Infiniti Pro.!</li>
            <li> The curls come out so pretty.</li>
            <li> First time she used it, it took her over an hour to do.  </li>
            <li> I curled my hair in the morning and for the most part it lasted through the night, with some curls loosening only a</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments i&#x27;ve only used it twice</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used the highest and longest settings.</li>
            <li> but I really think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love that it takes ten minutes to curl my whole head!  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pretty idiot-proof, albeit, your hair can get caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it so close to your head, I tried the same thing again and most of the time it worked, if not I moved it 3mm from the roots and blam, it worked.</li>
            <li> What else can I say, it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It was weird at first to get the hang of it, but even on the first try it produced that perfect curl!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but have been getting Keratin treatments for five years for smoothing, frizz free hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, the curls last for days.  </li>
            <li> As with most teenaged, she sleeps till the last minute</li>
            <li> My daughters hair got stuck in in first attempt.</li>
            <li> When this product first came out I didn&#x27;t run out and try it because I JUST KNEW it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> First time this was used was on my granddaughters hair.</li>
            <li> I want to give it more stars, but this second one stopped working again.</li>
            <li> Also, its beeping mechanism tells you exactly when a curl is done and the hair never comes out too hot.  </li>
            <li> My daughters hair got stuck the first time,</li>
            <li> At first I was worried after reading peoples horror stories of needing to cut off their hair because it got stuck in this styler.</li>
            <li> Plus, the next day they relaxed a bit more and gave a softer look.</li>
            <li> At first it looked like a weapon</li>
            <li> He has replaced my &amp;#34;HUGE&amp;#34; hot roller&#x27;s set.</li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve written on a product, although before buying just about anything I always read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I comb each section first.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried I thought I would have to cut my hair out as it was so stuck.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is how I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or ears like I always did with a traditional curling iron!</li>
            <li> The only directions were printed on the box and most of those were covered up by silver tape.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t find it worth the money even before it broke.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this one really works!  </li>
            <li> Use smaller pieces for a better curl</li>
            <li> Hair consistently gets caught and doesn&#x27;t hold a bit of curl longer than maybe 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It does hold curl now for the first time ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first curl came out</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s stuck... stuck on the inside chamber of the hot turning wheel.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised but you must follow the directions exactly as printed.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty smooth, naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> Sure enough breaking the product allowed me to get my hair out.</li>
            <li> Curls last more than a day for me.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my hair held a curl</li>
            <li> it makes up for it ;)</li>
            <li> To all those who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, etc... make sure you are doing it properly.</li>
            <li> Make sure you hold it til you hear the multiple beeps in a row.&lt;br /&gt;-Take</li>
            <li> At first the product does seem intimidating</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey as it sells for around $99.99 retail price</li>
            <li> fast shipping and works!</li>
            <li> But this product really works!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair which normally won&#x27;t keep a curl unless I spray my hair to death with hairspray but these curls stay intact about 85% with just a light spray of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this Curler!!</li>
            <li> The first time I curled my hair</li>
            <li> Came exactly when I was told it would</li>
            <li> At the first time, I can&#x27;t use it well.</li>
            <li> first off when I received it already had hair caught in it.</li>
            <li> In fact, her cousin was interested in getting one for herself.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Either I have a newer model or others did not use it correctly by reading the directions first..  </li>
            <li> she begged me for it ,but when she first tried it her hair got all stuck in this</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars because it is priced higher than most retailers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get the Babyliss one now, because I like the idea of alternating curls plus the higher max temperature.  </li>
            <li> it really works and curl holds for a while !</li>
            <li> It makes nice curls and does not tangle as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in it.</li>
            <li> Seems to curle hair much better on finer thinner hair such as my mullet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like spending time reading through instructions, just make sure you hold it properly and put the part that says \\&quot;This side faces head\\&quot; towards your head before putting your hair in.  </li>
            <li> and when I woke up the curls looked exactly as they did the night before.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t work like the higher priced ones I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
            <li> hot quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Love it, the curls last for days.</li>
            <li> Learned that mistake first hand because I had to cut my hair from it getting so fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because you close it, let it work its magic, and then open it up and let the curls fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even used it 15 times and doesn&#x27;t curl like it did at first .</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this thing but was surprisingly impressed.</li>
            <li> and i waited 30-40 minutes before it get hot.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have been going back and forth on this for months now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great, and well designed, but the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5th star is that sometimes the curls fall out a bit, and it does take a bit long.</li>
            <li> The first time I inplugged it</li>
            <li> All it did was made it hot</li>
            <li> He tried loosening some screws which did absolutely NOTHING!</li>
            <li> And make sure your hair is brushed and don&#x27;t overload the machine.</li>
            <li> the hair, the more likely it tangles&lt;</li>
            <li> but beware that you may find yourself doing exactly what I had to do.</li>
            <li> I love this product though because I FINALLY can have curls that I have wanted for 24 years!</li>
            <li> It is pretty pricey</li>
            <li> Use hair clips to section off hair and start with the under hairs first.</li>
            <li> It really is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a curl I have not been able to get with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> I also love the fact I simply can&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t get hot or smoke.</li>
            <li> we read the instructions and followed them EXACTLY...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very patient and found that if I wanted this to work it would literally take about 2 hours to curl all of my hair!</li>
            <li> First try tangled my hair and got stuck in barrel.</li>
            <li> Watch youtube videos of how to first:</li>
            <li> cause I am 100% sure that the curls will last by tomorrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I will the tool with its head first inside the sock.</li>
            <li> , I will the tool with its head first inside the sock.</li>
            <li> It was exact what I was look for</li>
            <li> I think it would work better on short hair.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> Everyone should feel fancy ;)</li>
            <li> It gets two stars, though, because the few curls that it did produce were gorgeous.</li>
            <li> My mother said it looked messy, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> but you can have everyday beautiful natural looking curles.</li>
            <li> I loved this product used it alot but after getting my hair trapped in it and it burned my scalp and hair</li>
            <li> She has long hair and I though, voila, easy for her to get curls!  </li>
            <li> Curl normally falls out of my hair pretty quick</li>
            <li> If you have unruly, wild hair - give this a try and watch it tame your hair into beautiful bouncy waves.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair, and it curls with the right iron, but this would not curl the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> but it barely hurt and was easy to untangle.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more satisfying than hearing those little beeps that mean &amp;#34;Hey, your hair&#x27;s done!,&amp;#34; except maybe a good slice of pizza or my mom&#x27;s pie.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that actually WORKS in that the curl doesn&#x27;t completely drop out of my hair after a couple of hours but mellows into beautiful curls &amp; waves that last all day with just a bit of hairspray..</li>
            <li> That seems totally obvious, but really, the smaller you make the curls, the better they come out and the better they stay.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2S5WH0O20YK59]]After reading the many reviews of this product, it still sounded too good to be true, but I at least had to try it because I am SO inept about how to get spiral curls to stay in my long hair.</li>
            <li> I am 51, and have used a curling iron most of my life, and a flat iron since 2008.</li>
            <li> I have never had such strong beautiful curls that seriously lasted for days.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s because my hair is kind of wavy, and the product make my hair goes the other way, so my hair gets kinky when I use it.</li>
            <li> It is easy, quick and takes the frustration out of curling my short, fine locks - even in the back.</li>
            <li> It looks a little intimidating, but it beeps and releases before your hair gets stuck and was very easy to use with a quick read of the instructions.</li>
            <li> This product makes beautiful curls but is also is very hard on your hair.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more products I was able to use it would be nice to do something with my hair other than letting it simply dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the worst skilled person for beauty purposes and this was just so easy to use with great results!</li>
            <li> Surprised as even the instructional booklet explained that clean hair works</li>
            <li> to use - much safer than many on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I am a total klutz</li>
            <li> Skeptical spending this much but it works great!</li>
            <li> I can absolutely see why some people who try this out still prefer more traditional curling tools.</li>
            <li> and I was able to do my whole head of hair in under ten minutes.</li>
            <li> If done properly, your hair will be left absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I am considering getting a second one, just in case.</li>
            <li> It makes a loud beeping sound if you put in too much hair or if it starts to get caught.</li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it, it&#x27;s intimidating, but it&#x27;s really a fun and awesome experience!</li>
            <li> Curles don&#x27;t last very long,but that&#x27;s better that I used to have.</li>
            <li> However my curl and bounce days are over and my poker straight hair only reaches the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Good curls, but curls only go only one way.  </li>
            <li> more than medium thick hair, maybe it would be better.</li>
            <li> After pulling for a good ten minutes it finally came away from my head taking a bug chunk of hair and scalp with it, my head was bleeding and I was in lots of pain for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It makes sure that only a reasonable amount of hair is being curled at a time, so every curl is prefect, and  I can just keep going until all my hair is curled.</li>
            <li> I learned pretty fast that if you put more than what you can fit inside the little hook then it&#x27;s going to get stuck.</li>
            <li> The device has to held a certain way in order to allow the hair to be pulled in properly and you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t trying to curl too much hair at one time.  </li>
            <li> Once the curls cooled you can brush them and they bounce right back, all day which is huge for me.  </li>
            <li> It dang near looked like it did right after I curled it!</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t line it up with your hair properly, it gets stuck pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> The positive aspect of this is that there is a unlocking feature that beeps and lets go of the hair automatically.</li>
            <li> Do not listen to the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Considering I&#x27;ve never been able to master using regular curling irons, I give this a 5 since I managed to get the whole head done without burning myself, and it looked good enough (the wavy, messy, just got out of bed look) to go straight out!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair curls easily with just about everything: hot rollers, foam curlers, hot sticks, curling irons, wands, flat iron, etc.  </li>
            <li> Pretty simple there.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how easy this is to use I absolutely love how long the curls stay in.</li>
            <li> I have a little longer than shoulder length, layered, very fine, very straight hair ( and lots of it!)</li>
            <li> Only warning is make sure you take smaller pieces it will start to tangle if hair isnt combed and if you try to curl huge pieces, but my hair has never got stuck in here.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t wait that long to get one.</li>
            <li> The first time it took about 45 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Works ok, takes too long if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Of course, it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t blink until it was ready either, but it was hot when I used it</li>
            <li> I am pretty much a dyslexic when it comes to curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> way better results than I&#x27;ve had with a traditional curling iron or curling wand, and the curls last significantly longer than with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My sister who has poker straight hair also used it, and the curls lasted the whole day!  </li>
            <li> I still love it and got my sister the same thing as gift, but now I am a bit more careful while I use it..</li>
            <li> Might work better on someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Takes longer if you have long hair, but I love the turn out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I was releasing on the first beep and nothing was really curling.</li>
            <li> First of all, it beeped and flashed if I put too much hair in it.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair just wants to be straight!  </li>
            <li> I had many tangles in my hair and my hair is long.</li>
            <li> I will stick with my hot curlers as these are much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even regret paying that much ;)</li>
            <li> Works fantastically but make sure you have medium length to long hair.</li>
            <li> , I have a head full of soft wavy curls</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product for a long time, and was hesitant to buy it because it sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted now and often curl my hair just before bedtime so that in the morning I have beautiful curls as I&#x27;m rushing out the door for work.</li>
            <li> I use thelowest setting, let it cool completely and then brush it well with a brush</li>
            <li> did not work for me, i have a curly short hair, and thought this one is a safe and quick way to get nice curls, but it&#x27;s too big and wide for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have the finest hair any hairdresser has ever seen, never been able to keep a curl in for more than an hour with anything else, my whole life, without putting so much hair gel in my hair was hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great on daughter that has thicker hair, other daughter (whom i actually purchased for) has straight thinner hair, doesn&#x27;t curl hair, even on highest and longest setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the curls last for days.</li>
            <li> I had curled half of my hair and the curls were nice.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but at some point your hair will likely get tangled in the chamber.</li>
            <li> But, seemed rather easy to use if it had actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair I was able to curl my hair with one practice run</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , it sounded easy enough</li>
            <li> I only got her hair tangled once or twice, but it came out easily with no damage.</li>
            <li> and make sure your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Make sure that your hair is tangle free, and that you take small sections, and it should work well for you.</li>
            <li> but I like the results better if I used a dry hairspray before curling the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and only takes minutes</li>
            <li> sure your hair is dry or the curls won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use dry hair with no products in it...</li>
            <li> Too big and bulky to use easily.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and creates curls that last until my hair is washed.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy and</li>
            <li> Works good only on really long hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply any product just to see how long they will last and surprisingly my curls lasted for the duration of my event.</li>
            <li> This is only good for hair that are long, waist level or longer.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, and I followed the instructions which provided excellent results.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair, whose is thick and full seems to curls just nicely.</li>
            <li> If you try to curl too large of a section, the hair will get caught.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t come out as curly as the description says it will when set to a certain setting.</li>
            <li> Be mindful that large locks of hair don&#x27;t work well in the auto-feed mechanism.</li>
            <li> It does take a certain touch to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Make sure the locks are small enough that the device can pull and wrap effectively.</li>
            <li> Dream come true for me to be able to actually do something different with my hair and have it hold up</li>
            <li> , the first time I used it I went out and someone said Wow, I love your hair, you look 10 years younger!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new hair gadget and this one has been different than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on various heat settings - high when I do a &#x27;complete&#x27; curl, low when I do end curls - works great either way.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and it took a very long time but the results were awesome</li>
            <li> But Curl Secret makes AMAZING curls easily and they stay without buckets of hair spray.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use on her long hair and the curl is consistent all the way to the end of her hair.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to turn it upside down and use it with my right hand with no problem.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this curler is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li> and I have short fine hair.</li>
            <li> The very first try with the Infiniti Pro Curl was a Big Success  </li>
            <li> I did just fine on one side, but when I would try to curl the opposite side, I was having difficulty trying to figure out how to hold it.</li>
            <li> This is the only machine that keeps my fine hair curled WITHOUT any product in my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not curl my extra fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes doing hair a simple and quick process!</li>
            <li> Take your time, get a not too thick section of hair and make sure you are holding it straight on the hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to do as you look in the mirror</li>
            <li> [...]  this video is a pretty decent demo, it&#x27;s what made me change my mind.    </li>
            <li> none of which come close to the curls this one gives...  I highly recommend.. just be smart and read the directions first on how to use it..</li>
            <li> It IS very high priced, but it works.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work as the way it is expected to, even if your hair is super silky and no tangles!!</li>
            <li> I read all of the instructions first, which I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I am left with gorgeous loose, bouncy SMOOTH big waves.</li>
            <li> Little moment of panic if hair gets stuck for a second, but once you get the hang of it it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Best curler on the market, just be careful not to get your hair tangled in it because its hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to curl my own hair and other peoples hair and it looks quiet professional.</li>
            <li> Have lost chunks of hair from it getting stuck in the machine and nor accurately spinning the hair back out.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is a great product to order if you do not want to spend much time curling your hair.</li>
            <li> To do my entire head it takes about 45 minutes, but I have a lot of hair - great for doing just a few curls, too</li>
            <li> Of course when I ran my hand over my now burnt hair huge clumps were left in my hand.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on a recent trip to Canada as it was much cheaper than the Babyliss version available in Europe, and I didn&#x27;t want to splash out on that without knowing it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she has really straight hair and rarely holds curls..</li>
            <li> I really suck at doing my hair..</li>
            <li> I dont really have to do much.</li>
            <li> When I would get in a hurry or put too much hair in there, then it would birdsnest every time.  </li>
            <li> My daughters pooled their money and bought this contraption, I didn&#x27;t join in because I wasn&#x27;t going to be involved in spending that much for a hair curler</li>
            <li> and....I use it just as much as they do.</li>
            <li> The hair still has to be sectioned off and curled, however because the curler times each curl what this curler does do is take the guess work out of the whole process.</li>
            <li> I either had it too close to my head or put way too much hair into the chamber.</li>
            <li> and it takes me about 15 min to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> If this happens I turn the hair curler off and gently tug on my hair to unroll it out of the device.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s because my hair is much</li>
            <li> it absolutely does not reverse so the hair can release resulting in severe damage.</li>
            <li> I can do my hair in 30 minutes and my daughter&#x27;s hair in about 45 minutes (her hair is much thicker than mine).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really afford to do my hair according to directions lest I be caught by my girls playing with a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> I feel that maybe people with longer hair who tried to have this device curl from close to their scalp might have the issue with too much hair being pulled into the device.</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> Overall, the product feels cheap</li>
            <li> It has always stopped when I used too much hair.  </li>
            <li> Heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li> and there really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you curl your hair I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> My 21 year daugther is very please.</li>
            <li> so much easier than using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll learn how much hair causes it to get stuck, gently pulling hair out has not been an issue if you go from side to side, doesn&#x27;t burn or break hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to get used to how to hold it, how much hair to put in at one time,</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve in regards to figuring out the amount of hair you can fit in and trying to maneuver the iron at the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> Very seldom does it tangle her hair.</li>
            <li> , she doesn&#x27;t use it all that much</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is very stubborn.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 5 year olds hair who has never let me curl her hair and always just wants a pony tail.</li>
            <li> and I think if you try to curl too much you might have issues.</li>
            <li> When I was trying to curl the whole length sometimes it would get caught in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this thing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I feel as if I have so much hair now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> With the wand it takes me about 2 hours to do my whole head and</li>
            <li> The product works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight</li>
            <li> produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a time saving device to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> , I will just curl select pieces on the top, and it looks adorable, and that takes only a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> is very practical and It takes just a couple of minutes to do the whole hair.</li>
            <li> Reason being, is because when it twirls and curls my hair strands, it sort of smoothes them out, and makes them a neater curl, so when my whole head is done, i finger brush my hair, and with my fingers i separate the curls and toussle them.</li>
            <li> It really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li> One of the times I think I had too much hair in it.  </li>
            <li> That is, until I was all done and ready to finish the style.  </li>
            <li> but it really does.</li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Curls really fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put too much or it will beep.</li>
            <li> put my curls in a hair clip recurled about three pieces and had a whole nother hairstyle  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my daughters hair which is straight</li>
            <li> We read the directions carefully as you have to be sure to align it just so, when you are putting the hair inside of the tube.  </li>
            <li> Every woman who wants curls shoud buy it.</li>
            <li> Each section of hair has to be held until the iron is done beeping and you can&#x27;t put too much in at one time.</li>
            <li> (If there was a problem, like too much hair, it beeped an alert and stopped the motor, so I didn’t need to worry about my hair being ripped out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure you practice with it a few times before using it for a big night out. :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much use for it since I got it.</li>
            <li> Very traumatic.  </li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it so fast</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care that much about ONE hair style -- and</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care that much about ONE hair style -- and</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> Do not try to feed too much hair into it.</li>
            <li> ; is about as much as it can take.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> The feed will push your hair out a bit so you can release pressure on the clamp and pull it out, holding by the roots with your fingers and wiggling gently as you go.</li>
            <li> It really needs to be ran through twice.</li>
            <li> If you get too much hair in the iron, it will beep at you and won&#x27;t take your hair.</li>
            <li> I did my whole head</li>
            <li> but it didnt have much power.  </li>
            <li> I have permed my hair straight and now if I want curls I can use this.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t get my hair caught, it realized the hair completely straight.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way they are real.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Takes me about 20-30 min to do my whole</li>
            <li> ..imagine a straight line from the insertion point to the end of the strand.</li>
            <li> and hold the strand in this straight line for a lil bit until the barrel gets it all in...</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon return service</li>
            <li> Its works really well.</li>
            <li> so it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> And, if you don&#x27;t want it very curly, you can create a lot of waves!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the curling mechanism ..</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> and when it does curl it falls out fast  </li>
            <li> I had been blow drying my hair straight for years, which is a process.  </li>
            <li> It has saved me so much time getting ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Because I have so much hair, it took me an hour to put spirals in.</li>
            <li> it was always more of a drag than anything else</li>
            <li> I talked about it so much</li>
            <li> I am not using it as much has I thought I&lt;</li>
            <li> Then I tried this out with much patience.</li>
            <li> and then it wasn&#x27;t much curl at all.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> and I spent most of my time pulling my hair out of it.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had not ordered it cause</li>
            <li> you are not taking too much hair into it, because the machine can &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; you hair or burn it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would indicate this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely what I wanted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll make a different sound while curling.</li>
            <li> so be careful and make sure you follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  </li>
            <li> a fast.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t really achieve the versatility of curls that the 1/2 - 1 inch barrel curling irons can.</li>
            <li> I get so much compliments</li>
            <li> Ended up having to physically break this in order to free her hair.  </li>
            <li> That is much easier said than done when your hair is smoking and tangled up.</li>
            <li> But shoulder length didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Really just easier to curl with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> I waited patiently, with plans to curl my hair the very day I received it.  </li>
            <li> how not tired my arms felt and how un-singed my fingers</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> By accident I have put too much hair in and it beeps at me, informing me that it won&#x27;t accept the allotted hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair holds a style very well, so I assume it could go longer if I dared.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very much!&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> but up until now I have never had a curling iron that added this much curl.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> If you try to put too much hair in the styler beeps and will not pull your hair in.</li>
            <li> The curls stay very well and it doesn&#x27;t shorten your hair like when you use a curling iron..</li>
            <li> a ready to go.  </li>
            <li> and this is really upseting because the product is anything but cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I normally straight iron but the curl</li>
            <li> The box arrived very beat up.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li> I was worried about spending so much on this if it wasn&#x27;t going to work</li>
            <li> But, it is so fast</li>
            <li> If you try to put too much hair in at one time it just beeps at you and won&#x27;t pull the hair into the chamber.</li>
            <li> Also shipping was so fast ordered on a Thursday got it on tuesday.</li>
            <li> s really fast to use even in a day of work.</li>
            <li> Still expirimenting with it, but recommend this to anyone who wants to save time curling their hair.</li>
            <li> but it really do what the curls as promised.</li>
            <li> my whole life, I&#x27;ve told people my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl.</li>
            <li> and we were ready to go.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t pay much mind to</li>
            <li> My hairs really frizzy because of this now.</li>
            <li> so I figured that this thing really does work</li>
            <li> Absolutely mortifying.</li>
            <li> bears repeating that you absolutely MUST MUST MUST limit your sections to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be much easier.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday - have been really putting off getting it based on the price.  </li>
            <li> So it takes longer to be ready.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 14 days straight now</li>
            <li> and I feel like it takes forever because I have very thickl/long hair.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is a bit much for what it is but its this price everywhere</li>
            <li> and it really reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li> Now, I haven&#x27;t done my whole head because I am a mom and have no desire to spend an hour doing my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you can follow simple directions you will enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thinking they may have tried to curl too much hair at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a tangle problem, however when I&#x27;ve tried to curl too much hair</li>
            <li> Works great with thin hair, which I have.</li>
            <li> I curl my whole hair with this in 5 min</li>
            <li> I can curl my hair when getting dressed, and by the time I get downstairs, it&#x27;s straight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was too much curl and fluffiness for my liking.</li>
            <li> Doing it this way, the style was much too \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; for my liking.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> If you try to insert too much hair at once, it won&#x27;t wind up.</li>
            <li> Much.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length straight as a stick hair cut in about 3 layers.</li>
            <li> so much for that</li>
            <li> , the Curl Secret worked great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s part of the dance, go with it, release the handle and gently untangle.</li>
            <li> but if you try to put in too much it beeps and releases.</li>
            <li> and then the curls fall out really fast.</li>
            <li> but you do for sure need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Tween daughter recd as a Christmas gift and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This stays much longer.  </li>
            <li> If you want a product that really works must buy this .</li>
            <li> highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s frizzy, it&#x27;s not quite straight</li>
            <li> Anyway, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well.</li>
            <li> and then it ends up being crunchy all day, and even then it doesnt hold very well.</li>
            <li> There is a safety feature that releases the hair if you put in too much.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to figure out how much hair you can do at once, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Be carful not to use to much hair, or it gets tangled.</li>
            <li> The curls hold up very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times with fantastic results and have yet to get my hair tangled in this thing.  </li>
            <li> Not how the ends are frizzy with a regular curling iron but smooth Shirley Temple curls.  </li>
            <li> and I really recommended.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so much fuller and with the Babyliss curl</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I was very up in the air about shelling out 100.00 for this</li>
            <li> Gentle waves every day, just the look I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I really like this tool.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got too much hair in there - take it out!!!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I urge you - DON&#x27;T try to stuff too much hair in the machine.  </li>
            <li> If the machine tells you it&#x27;s too much</li>
            <li> being said, I was happy enough with the product, despite the obvious user error, I bought a second one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stick straight hair since birth.</li>
            <li> My children were really looking forward to using this for their dance performance and couldn&#x27;t because it stopped working.</li>
            <li> If you put too much hair in it it won&#x27;t work, if there&#x27;s a knot in the hair it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i have straight hair.</li>
            <li> sometimes the hair just went through the curler, it&#x27;s still straight.</li>
            <li> Once your whole head is curled, you can leave the curls defined and spritz them with hairspray</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls in my hair, my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight, but it isn&#x27;t curly.</li>
            <li> We have a dedicated team ready to assist you.</li>
            <li> Curls stay the whole night.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described.</li>
            <li> I am really all thumbs when it comes to styling my hair...</li>
            <li> If I try to get too much hair in it stops itself, but there is no tugging or pain.  </li>
            <li> This Conair Curl was much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this curler!</li>
            <li> I could not finish curling my whole head</li>
            <li> People complain way too much.</li>
            <li> but very traumatic for both of us.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you put to much hair it gets stuck</li>
            <li> This tool really deserves it.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter, perfectly straight hair and a lot of patience, this curler might work for you.  </li>
            <li> And i know, people say to be patient a wait and be gentle.</li>
            <li> , stick straight, lifeless)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> we had to break it apart very tramatic and a $100.00 loss</li>
            <li> It really will not keep going if it is tangled.  </li>
            <li> But I really like the curls.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it very often.</li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> I love the volume and texture I get with the Curl Secret, and I have received many compliments on my hair since I started using it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m good for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 30-40 minutes at most to complete my entire head.</li>
            <li> Overall it actually does what it says, it curls your hair in nice ringlet curls and are even and uniform each time.</li>
            <li> I am the least talented person k know when it comes to styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves nice curls, but I had to use less hair, 12 seconds and high heat.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> It tells you to use this on clean hair which I do, but I have to use it right after I blow dry my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> It really does curl faster and I have waist long hair that does not curl easy.  </li>
            <li> long, easy, straight.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, and did love the results after much fumbling, dropping, &amp; accidental hitting-of-myself due to not being designed for the left-handed user...</li>
            <li> I had no trouble figuring it out right away.</li>
            <li> it makes hair curly easy as 1,2,3 and result lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but I have really long hair</li>
            <li> tool is easy to use, and the time it takes is as long as it would be to straighten one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> It does curl hair and is easy to use but does not work well on hair this long.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the curl holds all day long.</li>
            <li> so I just had to make sure to brush each piece and not put in to much at a time due to the length.  </li>
            <li> The long story short, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to watch the commercial than to do at home.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight baby fine hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
            <li> Get just the right amount of curl by removing it after two single beeps or leaving it on for the full three beep timer.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to be proven wrong!    </li>
            <li> i was wondering how many other&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> the extra step in getting out of the house is worth it!  </li>
            <li> All curls are going to be the same size, but if you don&#x27;t mind that this is much more user friendly than other products.</li>
            <li> Beware - look for a different product as this one isn&#x27;t worth the price!</li>
            <li> A must-buy for people that normally can&#x27;t curl hair!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this curler after reading such rave reviews!  </li>
            <li> I have never had problems with my hair curling with any other curling irons (including many Conair ones), so it can&#x27;t be my hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased a different brand but a plastic part that operates the curling mechanism</li>
            <li> and the result is better than any other.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally have something that would give me the curls I&#x27;ve always longed for.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair and this curled my hair perfectly!!</li>
            <li> But other than that its pretty, easy to use and shipped on time and not damaged</li>
            <li> It requires some practice specially having long hair, I was in panic the first time my hair got stock In it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to curl!</li>
            <li> I was super excited when my fiancé bought this for me and was let down after my hair got stuck.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and is a frizzy mess unless I straighten it.</li>
            <li> We all have long to medium length hair, on the fine side.</li>
            <li> I put in the appropriate amount of hair and the first few curls</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair, and, while fine, there&#x27;s a lot of it.</li>
            <li> So I thought maybe because my hair is too fine &amp; too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product out a couple different days on totally clean hair, next day clean hair</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you keep it closed and it will start beeping, but don&#x27;t open it until you hear the 4 quick beeps in a row.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, probably medium thickness.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but you must follow directions when it tells you to only curl small sections at a time or hair can get tangled inside curler.  </li>
            <li> As long as the hair is combed out smooth and not too much at once, tangles are not an issue.  </li>
            <li> I successfully did a few curls and then on the fourth one.....</li>
            <li> If a section wasn&#x27;t curled as much as I wanted, I&#x27;d let it cool and go back and feed it through again.  </li>
            <li> I have never spent this much on a hair curler, but this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> , i have long fine hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scared away by that, as long as just don&#x27;t just let it linger in the chamber, it is totally fine.</li>
            <li> After seeing a video about it, thought to give it a try, but I was skeptical as it looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard, girls!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl much at all even on high setting.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight hair naturally</li>
            <li> highly recommend it for naturally straight and damage-free hair.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to it but was highly disappopinted</li>
            <li> Not true - mine just pulled a large chunk of hair out by the roots and more is tangled in the chamber.  </li>
            <li> strands of hair bigger than 1- 1.1/2 inches, holding the strand at an angle that does not permit easy insertion of the hair inside the barrel AND letting go of the strand of hair TOO quick ( if its a long strand).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it for special occasions, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have prior curling experience or lots of time to learn it.</li>
            <li> so deep Channel 11 news is runnin a special on you...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  expect the right curl the first or second time.  </li>
            <li> That seems to be obvious, but because this appliance looks so easy to use it might be tempting to hand it over to a young kid to use.</li>
            <li> Someone else may have better luck if they have thin hair that curls easy.</li>
            <li> Such a fast quick gadget.  </li>
            <li> When all is said and done, I&#x27;d recommend Curl Secret to anyone looking for a quick, effective, and easy-to-use hair tool.</li>
            <li> a super pretty long curl comes out every time.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair and it usually can&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product gives such a nice ringlet curl that stays in even overnight.  </li>
            <li> have very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> It is laborious and time consuming to curl all my hair in very small segments, but the end result for an event is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> found that if I just want a nice soft wave, I only hold it in my hair until the second beep.  </li>
            <li> First use almost scalped my 12 yr old, daughter.</li>
            <li> Thinking about moving those old &#x27;hot curlers&#x27; out.</li>
            <li> that at nearly 30, I still can&#x27;t do my hair ;-)  </li>
            <li> This is actually faster than a flat iron for me because my hair really fights being straight, but seems to love to curl.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works on long hair, though it works best on hair that&#x27;s above shoulder length to just past the shoulders in length.</li>
            <li> The curl is exactly as described and soft.</li>
            <li> normal curling my whole head would take 2 hours.</li>
            <li> But I was surprised that it really works!</li>
            <li> Finally I took he plunge, forked over the money--$117.00 with taxes, and brought it home, full of excitement and expectation.</li>
            <li> I am surprised Amazon is so much higher</li>
            <li> I find the curls look exactly like the infomercial, spiral and soft.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions, followed them, and everything worked exactly as said except for one major problem:  NO CURLS!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair myself &amp; when others have curled it for me, the curls don&#x27;t last long because I have such fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair which my whole life never really curled using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> but once you get that down (be a bit patient with yourself), you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it will break when it falls down.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will break when it falls down.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair probably just touching the shoulder.  </li>
            <li> Took a few times to figure out the ideal setting for my hair, but curls are very pretty and last a lot longer than my previous curling iron.</li>
            <li> curls last long and very easy to use...</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure how it would take my hair because its naturally really wavy and a little frizzy</li>
            <li> I cant live without it!</li>
            <li> The best past was it only took 20 minutes to do my hair instead of close to an hour and the curls were soft and flowing because I used next to no hair spray.</li>
            <li> great ,but hard to do the back of your head.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous and doesn&#x27;t take long to get your curls!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite frankly, this worked better than the $200 model and was half the price.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes on my day two dry hair I will lightly spray some thermal protection on my hair and let it try before I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> bought for the wife and it has cut the curling time in half with a lot better results.</li>
            <li> Make a perfect curl before this was almost impossible...</li>
            <li> It no way is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; or wonderful and the directions are idiotic.</li>
            <li> Even with spraying hair spray before and after, my hair would NOT hold the curls more than half a day...</li>
            <li> If I use a curling iron, the curls don&#x27;t stay in for more than a couple hours, even if I use half a can of hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It stood up to the test and even produced better results with the presence of the previous product.  </li>
            <li> I think the less hair you feed into it, the better the results.  </li>
            <li> main points:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one being any better.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super short</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple and quick to use,</li>
            <li> I have tried hot rollers, hot twisty rollers, curling irons, and regular rollers.  </li>
            <li> I regret reading all the reviews because I became more and more skeptical as I came across</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably get the knack of it with enough practice, but even then there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be able to do the back by myself.</li>
            <li> She tried doing it twice on this same setting and it only did a fraction better.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight, but this curled it nicely.</li>
            <li> I struggle constantly to curl my hair with a curling wand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> The key is not to panic but to try and remain calm and GENTLY untangle your hair out of it.</li>
            <li> but I will need more time playing with it to get a half way decent hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The unit does stop when it senses a tangle, but it&#x27;s not perfect, so better to make sure hair is property prepared.</li>
            <li> While I did finally get the hang of it doing the front of my head, in order to do the back by &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I had many stuck panic moments and hair ripping.  </li>
            <li> My favorite curls come from this iron, only wish it took bigger areas of hair at one time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did differently this time, but only had my hair get tangled once and the curls came out SO much better...</li>
            <li> The curls last - it is so worth the cost (which I was very hesitant about).  </li>
            <li> I finally caved thinking I would more than likely return it.  </li>
            <li> Very usefull and the product is very soft.</li>
            <li> As a very busy mom,  I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to fool around with my hair.  </li>
            <li> The curls come out nice and last much longer than conventional curlers.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the purchase, but not for daily use, definetly only for special occasions.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with your hair holding curl or want a more modern and professional looking curl, this tool is definitely worth the cost...and this is coming from a major cheapskate!</li>
            <li> I have quite long straight hair &amp; have used many different curling methods.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really have to put too much hair spray on to keep the curls lasting like I have to with the hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The curls turned out really well on the left side, on the right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy after the first few times.</li>
            <li> so I was super careful when I first tried it out.</li>
            <li> (thinking i might need to hold the hair in longer than the 12 seconds) for a tighter one, but if you do it correctly it will produce a cute tight</li>
            <li> Then again, at the rate these are being sold they just might keep the price high.</li>
            <li> It by no means matches the quality of a high quality curling iron.</li>
            <li> We had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I used high heat, 12 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As A Licensed Cosmetologist I Had High Expectations</li>
            <li> I have a high level of intelligence.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thick, hard to curl hair that easily tangles because it is so fine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend going on youtube and watching some instructional videos before using.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> If you use the high heat setting, the curls stay in until you wash your hair again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started off with the high setting, but it started burning my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my hair  even when I put it on high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and</li>
            <li> I even turned it up to high and 12 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> add to my review, I have pretty fine hair that falls a little below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to the middle of my back and this works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I really love this little machine.</li>
            <li> The original is 77W, this fake is 55W (it takes more time to be hot).</li>
            <li> Broke a little more than 30 days after purchase and have yet to get through to customer service......other than that....</li>
            <li> I would like for the curls to be a little more tighter.</li>
            <li> It worked extremely good the first few times then it kinda didn&#x27;t work as well the other times .</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I was able to move a little faster.</li>
            <li> I used a little hair product to help the curls set better.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it&#x27;s pretty bulky, but it&#x27;s nothing to complain about since it works!</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, naturally wavy, long hair already.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and always seems limp, even when I use hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Some times it&#x27;s hard for her to do parts of her hair on her own</li>
            <li> The best was when I tried it on my 14 year old granddaughter who was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> This curling device was by far better then the more expensive product &#x27;curl freak&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I tried to remain calm whenever this happened, but the last time just freaked me out.  </li>
            <li> The curls really weren&#x27;t uniform, but they looked natural.</li>
            <li> I expected more but in general this curling iron does its job.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I have hard to curl, very fine straight hair and this curls</li>
            <li> Hannah has straight hair and a sensitive head.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my 11 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> And I was honestly not impressed--and I look for any excuse to buy a product that makes great curls.</li>
            <li> After two or three tries, you&#x27;ll be doing it with a cheap curling iron in under 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you have hair that tends to have some natural wave or curl this works but stick straight</li>
            <li> Very Hollywood old style.  </li>
            <li> Our granddaughter&#x27;s very curly hair was turned into soft flowing curls.</li>
            <li> far I can do curly waves without much</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally somewhere between straight and frizzy.</li>
            <li> andjust do a few touch up pieces of hair on the top.</li>
            <li> so I tried to take her hair out as normal.</li>
            <li> This is a fun way to get a different look</li>
            <li> This gadget is so great, I used when my granddaughter was visiting, she has a mass of thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have learned a few tricks to using this tool that seem to make it better and easier for me, and each time I use it I get faster.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to use small bits of hair and make sure and clip away the hair you are not using until you are ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy enough to put my hair in this machine, I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough for curls to really curl.</li>
            <li> and my curls look normal - not a frizz fest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to practice a few more times before I try it on a work day.</li>
            <li> It gives me full, voluminous bouncy curls that hold all day long, even through treacherous weather.</li>
            <li> By the time I got the last of her hair curled, the first part had already went straight.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have normal hair(and</li>
            <li> At least five of my friends have purchased their own once they saw my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The time is set automatically allowing 3 paused beeps so that each strand of hair gets the same exact time of heat and then beeps 3 times (fast) when it is complete...then you can release and VOILA!!!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s--she has no idea how to curl hair with a normal curling iron.</li>
            <li> I followed the pointers given, fresh trimmed hair, hold wand properly, smaller sections.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall worth the price fir someone who can&#x27;t use a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> I read the instruction thoroughly and tried all method,but couldn&#x27;t make work normally.</li>
            <li> It takes me 50 minutes to straighten my hair to an acceptable level with irons or three batches of Big Curl hot rollers to curl it (and then the ends don&#x27;t curl because there is too much hair).</li>
            <li> My hair flattens within an hour normally.  </li>
            <li> The times you do, it is normally just a couple hair stuck in, so just pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus, it takes a long time to curl a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Glad I got and gave me long lasting curls without using hair spray!</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS struggled with normal curlers and never had the patience to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I saw the Curl Secret, I laughed to myself and rolled my eyes in contempt.</li>
            <li> This curls nice, but I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I think my only down fall on this product is that it makes your hair smell pretty burnt, but most heat products do that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, with high humidity, and the curl stays in -</li>
            <li> and I have very thick healthy hair and luckily its 28&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t notice the gap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really hard but does take some practice with the machine and practice to figure out what gives you the look you want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as hard as it may appear.  </li>
            <li> I only gave this product a 4 because, although I love the type of curls, they do not say very long.</li>
            <li> I had a few problems with it getting stuck when I put too much hair in, but it untangled easily.</li>
            <li> So simple and easy, you only have to hold it while it does all the work for you.</li>
            <li> She can now do all her own curling in half the time the traditional curler takes.</li>
            <li> We tried the curler on my hair, my daughters hair and her friend to have a good opinion because we all have different hair types and got nadda, like some of the other reviews our hair got tangled and if there was a curl, the bend did not warrant being called a curl or even a bend taking back for a refund</li>
            <li> This tool does to my hair what the Chi flat iron does to my hair, only it makes it curly instead of flat; but the point is that it is quick &amp; easy and</li>
            <li> This product is real simple to use and as people have said before, if you do it the right way you will not have problems.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so you just have to play with it until you find the right setting for you.</li>
            <li> You literally have to brush out every tiny amount of hair to perfection right before putting it in.</li>
            <li> I also found that if I use curling clips right after I make the curl and clip it up to my head while I finish curling the rest of my hair, the curls last longer.  </li>
            <li> But I figured out how to use it the right way and the second time I used it</li>
            <li> I could make right curls and left curls.</li>
            <li> only one time it didnt spin my hair up right so it automatically stops so it doesnt hurt you. ...</li>
            <li> All I had to do was release my grip to open it, and my hair came right out.  </li>
            <li> I curled my hair and after a ten hour work shift it was still as curly as right after I did it.</li>
            <li> There is no option to curl left or right.</li>
            <li> and once you open it, the hair comes right out.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on here, and some were negative, but most were positive</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do so well for super long hair</li>
            <li> and my hair came out easily, no scissors required to free it!</li>
            <li> hair got caught a few times but overall I love this product!</li>
            <li> When I got it home, I read the directions, tried it on the high setting and it only curled (and very loosely) the top part of the my hair.  </li>
            <li> and this is designed for short, fine hair only.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for my shorter pieces of hair (my hair is layered) but definitely unimpressed with it overall.</li>
            <li> When curling my hair with a curling iron I crank it way up, but I only used the low heat setting and it curled just fine.</li>
            <li> I have used it with an updo or partial updo to create beautifully long springy curls very easily.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and with this I have a different look, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> All the other times, you get to know the sound and release the handle and your hair comes out.  </li>
            <li> I was really nervous about getting it because usually you see these great things on TV and its a waste.</li>
            <li> After extended use in one setting, it seems like the curler will start snagging a little more frequently.</li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I just was wondering,is new</li>
            <li> Because the device have a risk and had a smell like someone had used, does not smell like new since I already bought a new one for a friend and doing the comparison</li>
            <li> My hair did not curl or make new waves.  </li>
            <li> what was sent contained an order sticker which said infinity pro by conair curler - new, however, the product shipped was a USED Miracurl knockoff, (</li>
            <li> Every time a new product comes out I run out and try it.</li>
            <li> I got mine at Goodwill today for $ 2.99 it appeared it be brand new and in package still.</li>
            <li> My wife has two new shoulders and this lets her curl her hair once again,</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s just really good at curling hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is midway down my back and still very easy to curl when I divide my head up into sections.</li>
            <li> It is very important to use the small sections as recommended.  </li>
            <li> Wish it cost less, but it works well and is easy to use to create new hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I tried a little more forcefully to get my hair free, but it was still tightly wedged.  </li>
            <li> I really like the ease and have finally found something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> From start to finish on my first try, my whole head of long hair took about 20-30 minutes to curl.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well on soft young girl hair</li>
            <li> I loved the product when my hair was shorter, but it&#x27;s been such a hassle to use lately.</li>
            <li> I always used to curl my hair as a solution to second-day hair, and the Curl Secret works much better with freshly washed/dried hair.</li>
            <li> but, this unit is heavy, to try and do the back of  your own hair while waiting for this to curl</li>
            <li> Second time, I left it plugged in and just pulled on my hair until it came free.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to spend a long, hot time trying to curl your whole head.</li>
            <li> This lets me produce gorgeous bouncy, smooth hair from very thick, coarse, wavy/frizzy long hair.  </li>
            <li> She has fine hair down to her bum and it took about 20 minutes to curl her hair while she sat and played with my iphone.</li>
            <li> You just face it towards you, it is very clearly labeled and squeeze and voila.  </li>
            <li> and it is very fast compared to traditional curling irons.</li>
            <li> Quick, Uniform Curls (18 minutes for super long, super thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> If your hair is halfway down your back this may only be good for curls that start partway up instead of near the root.</li>
            <li> my curls were too loose and faded quickly.</li>
            <li> This thing really works - it takes a little bit of time since you can&#x27;t that much hair in each time but totally worth it</li>
            <li> Easy long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> It is definitely easy to use as long as you follow the directions and does not tangle your hair if used properly.  </li>
            <li> (I have fine hair, and a LOT of it), and even though the back hair is only a few inches long, it can still create a nice wavy look to match the longer curls in the front and sides.</li>
            <li> Easy way to wear your hair down and look professional.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it because I figured it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, blah, blah, blah.</li>
            <li> It really is several steps above the rest and totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> It does get hot, but it is designed in a way that their is not likely to burn you.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair or my daughter in law whose hair is even longer than mine.</li>
            <li> As of 11/21/15 - again, this one we use only once every 2 or 3 weeks and it continues to work better than any other curing method my girls have tried.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use small sections of hair,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like, either it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the amount of hair in the chamber to produce a curl or</li>
            <li> the first time and 1 out of every 20 curls actually came out curly.</li>
            <li> This might be an acceptable item if you always have someone else to help you curl your hair, but if you want to style your hair on your own this item is not a good idea.</li>
            <li> old!</li>
            <li> Straight hair that generally wont hold curl probably wont work with this either.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to use small sections</li>
            <li> Not sure why people love this product.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll definitely get your hair stuck in it, despite the fact that the product says \\&quot;guaranteed no tangles.\\</li>
            <li> tiers,\\&quot; using a comb to create the next part and clip the other \\&quot;tiers\\&quot; to the top of the head.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, on the third strand of hair, it yanked it up into the machine, made a noise and stalled out.  </li>
            <li> Very simple to use, heats up fast!</li>
            <li> I find the curls last longer than hot rollers too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t suitable for thick hair</li>
            <li> the CONAIR LOGO is SOLID, (no fade lines on the &amp;#34;air&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Since getting the InfinitiPro I have numerous people complimenting me on my hair and recommending I keep it curled. ;)</li>
            <li> not waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> and it does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> I learned with this iron that the amount of each section for the most part can be usual</li>
            <li> This tool helps even out my hair and yet still allows it to look totally natural!</li>
            <li> and it looks exactly the same, no hair spray.</li>
            <li> The curls are soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it doesn&#x27;t typically hold a curl if my life depended on it.  </li>
            <li> I always search reviews of products before I make purchases, especially ones that have higher price tags.</li>
            <li> My hot rollers finally bit the dust</li>
            <li> I love to do the small curls underneath,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and it is a hit!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use small pieces or your hair will get stuck.</li>
            <li> I have never had such pretty curls.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, as per usual, you have to ignore the one and two star reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I told them I&#x27;m not cutting my long hair.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally use an Instyler and a hot brush/dryer.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why so many reviews talk about hair getting caught...</li>
            <li> First, if your hair gets stuck, open and close the curler until it lets it go.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it though, only using the tricks that I mentioned because before I figured those out, I was ready to throw the thing away!</li>
            <li> I went and bought a better one on amazon for 60.00 this one destroyed my hair when I took small sections.</li>
            <li> My hair type is straight, medium thickness and generally does not hold curl at all.  </li>
            <li> I had a bachelorette party recently, where the girls made me demo this for the whole group!</li>
            <li> It may seem like a lot to pay for a curling iron but as long as it lasts, very much worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at styling my own hair.</li>
            <li> If it isn&#x27;t held exactly perpendicular then jamming is possible.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest tool I have ever used on my hair!</li>
            <li> but this just made me go from eh stylist...to WOW!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top heavy though so don&#x27;t put it anywhere it can slip!</li>
            <li> I have paid more money for high temperature curling irons that curls last half the time of this curler.</li>
            <li> The downfall, no matter how little bot of hair you put in, it snags too easily.</li>
            <li> from the video clips they have in the little windows, it looks so easy to use it.</li>
            <li> The only thing to ever curl my long fine hair &amp; keep the curl.</li>
            <li> ; look anymore - so when I do want to wear it down, this curler helps to smooth out the frizziness and is allowing my hair to grow out gracefully,</li>
            <li> On the day the do my whole head, I use the high heat setting and the 12 second timer (which is the longest)</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re never long enough), hot rollers, soup cans, rag curls, over-night rollers, those rolling sticks things, really, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it on shorter hair, mostly on long!</li>
            <li> used enough to wear paint off the handle) which came complete with beat up re - taped box and a good amount of somebody&#x27;s black hair tangled up inside it!!!  </li>
            <li> She had a huge hunk of hair only 2 inches long from her scalp.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut a huge chunk of my long blonde hair after it got stuck in this thing!</li>
            <li> I did find out that was too much; it gave my long hair too much of a Shirley Temple look.</li>
            <li> too time consuming to use, heavy and not that easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Within about 20 minutes I can have full, bouncy curls that last even until the next day.  </li>
            <li> Then I did some research and found out that BaByliss Pro is the higher end professional use line done by the same company by Conair.</li>
            <li> only downfall is it takes me for ever since I have such thick hair, but other then that this this is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron down from the color to how big it is.</li>
            <li> The only thing positive was it was sent and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunely while I can give this a positive review I am returning it, with my layers I doubt I would use it enough to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> Be careful getting it too close to your head, it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> They turned out SO pretty, though a little more curly than I like, next time I will use the middle setting.</li>
            <li> I use the highest heat, let each strand down after the first beep, let curls cool, then comb out my hair with only my fingers for the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> The Conair Curl Secret was easy to use and the results were well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> but you get an entire head of curls so quickly that overall</li>
            <li> As I used, I put less effort to carefully place hair and curls still came out nicely</li>
            <li> I was worried about her hair getting tangled in the iron so at first I was using super small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> A few that could be better are; 1) taking more hair - it only takes a small amount of hair and</li>
            <li> im in love, i have long thick crazy hair..and within 15-20 it gets all my hair looking beautiful!..</li>
            <li> I went over a bunch of areas a few times to fine tune it.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but when it arrived I was able to curl my wife&#x27;s hair easily and the curls last.</li>
            <li> After using the Curl Secret for almost a year, my original impressions still hold true.</li>
            <li> but I also have limited dexterity in my right side.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stuck in the curler many times when i forgot by putting too much hair together in a big bunch, then the curler can&#x27;t work, it stops in the middle half way curling.</li>
            <li> I have super straight Asian hair and have had trouble keeping a curl for longer than 10minutes, haha.</li>
            <li> On the third (mine) it curled VERY WELL, but the biggest disappointment about this product is that in order to get a good curl you have to insert a tiny amount of hair &amp; it would easily take an hour to curl all of my fine but thick hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was over excited about using it that I did make the mistake and not following the exact instructions that I did tangle my hair a few times.  </li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re careful enough (as her sister was) it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> Every curl after that seemed to be extremely loose and fell right</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight, dark hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product a little expensive thou, but worth the curls.</li>
            <li> I can easily spend 25-30 minutes with other curling irons/wands/etc and not get the same uniform result.  </li>
            <li> It is also hard to do the back of your head on your own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to do the back on your own.</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> The curler is clearly labeled as to which side should be facing the head.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> and I clearly still can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Jammed no matter how much I practiced or how much time I took to feed the hair in correctly.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, slightly frizzy, medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> She said she can curl her whole head in about 10-15 minutes, and the curls last, even though her hair is naturally straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions weren&#x27;t clear about waiting for four consecutive beeps.</li>
            <li> It only curled my hair near the scalp, then the ends would still be straight.</li>
            <li> but the curls did not come out natural looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy mom and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s GIGANTIC when I go natural.</li>
            <li> So resist that natural reaction and let go of the end of the hair as soon as the curler is clamped onto the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 5 year old granddaughter....</li>
            <li> , I would be able to a least get a credit to purchase something else.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old grandaughter received this as a Christmas gift a year or two ago.</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me for Christmas and after reading the instructions several times and triple checking with online videos I felt that I was ready to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays curled for the whole day and is still wavy the next day (with No Product in it, at all!!!).</li>
            <li> so, I didn&#x27;t do anything fancy as far as prep and even still, inside of 20 minutes</li>
            <li> The curls look so natural.  </li>
            <li> Too early for 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Just got it and used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> So much easier than a regular curling iron</li>
            <li> All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this product</li>
            <li> I recommend using a comb to create small sections of hair at first and then adding more hair until you figure out how wide the curler can handle -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist by any means, but I know how to work a straightener and curling iron pretty well.</li>
            <li> but they obviously don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> This was an early Christmas gift</li>
            <li> when I used this iron it was completely straightened.</li>
            <li> Everyone at work thought I had it professionally done.</li>
            <li> i decided to try it since i know how to use professional curling irons since i went to school for it...</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and the only curl that ever holds is with a 3-barrel waver.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 15 minutes for my whole head.</li>
            <li> It says for any length, but my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> It heats back up VERY QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 14 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I immediately unplugged the machine then yanked on my hair softly to get it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and fought naturally wavy/curly hair all my life until 5 years ago, when I started having keratin treatments every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Finally stick straight hair that dries by itself.</li>
            <li> BUT about once per 10 curls your hair gets completely tangled in it and starts to fry.  </li>
            <li> I was completely surprised that this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and the curls were still there the next morning.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with my hair being tangled in it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 19 yr old daughter....</li>
            <li> it rolled up my daughters hair and did not release it when done, you have to leave the iron plugged in to try and get the hair out, but it keeps burning the hair, so after the smell of burnt hair in the house and her crying in pain by trying to free the hair</li>
            <li> but so far I think it works well.</li>
            <li> so much I bought a second on to have just in case&lt;</li>
            <li> The missing automatic release feature is just proof that it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> my hair cuticle is flattened making it look lush and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair feels just as soft as before using it</li>
            <li> I have the same conclusion for how much hair you should put in to curl.</li>
            <li> Our hair type is just really straight, this may be the reason for needing to do it twice on the same strand.</li>
            <li> but you will not get much of a curl with a low setting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slacking, being busy at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was recommended to by this  product buy a friend who saw a professional hair stylist use it for a wedding event.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had brushed her hair really well beforehand and it paid off because the curls were so neat and identical</li>
            <li> we left it as is and the curls looked really shiny.</li>
            <li> The type of hair that no matter what, after about 3 hours will look basically straight, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I only had it beep at me once for putting in too much hair.</li>
            <li> Frequently catches, knots and pulls your hair in to the rotating automatic barrel.</li>
            <li> and I did not get my hair tangled once, but my 14 year old daughter did a couple times.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/</li>
            <li> I can let my hair do its natural thing</li>
            <li> but my natural hair stayed curly.</li>
            <li> Also the results were almost never just the way I wanted it to look: natural and even.</li>
            <li> After experimenting a bit with the different heat settings and how much hair to put in at a time etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting up early, so</li>
            <li> If one has course hair and some natural curl, it may work well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 9 and 10 yr old granddaughters  who can use it without help.</li>
            <li> Even with the unit completely switched off, the motor would run while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair done by a professional for my sisters wedding</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair but tends to fuzz by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use than a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far.</li>
            <li> I only twice had to stop and it gave the alarm that I had in to much hair</li>
            <li> I had no trouble with tangling in the machine.</li>
            <li> ( I am a professional and know how to use this) over time my hair built up and</li>
            <li> It also completely fried my hair crispy (the part that was in the curler)..</li>
            <li> My hair looks natural and receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> My hair length touches my bra strap and it didn&#x27;t do any curls for me but just soft wavy tips.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but had to try it out.  </li>
            <li> After trying it out I have to say I&#x27;m surprised by some of the things I have read in reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier than a traditional curling iron or wand.</li>
            <li> but I only really wanted to use the looser curl</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this curling contraption.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t curl your hair the old fashion way like me</li>
            <li> Got this for my 14 yr old neice for Xmas</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old LOVES this.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old can use it with ease</li>
            <li> The second not so much.</li>
            <li> I messed it up the first time I used it and was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t curl my long hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only reason why I gave it 4</li>
            <li> I will say I didn&#x27;t realize how long to hold the thing shut on the timer and was just letting go on the first beep.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had my hair get stuck in it even once.</li>
            <li> This is much easier to use than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> you use too much and your hair gets stuck, just open it up</li>
            <li> my daughter with the natural wave/curl to her hair</li>
            <li> daughter with the pin straight hair is a different story....</li>
            <li> The curls last much longer</li>
            <li> It does hold a curl to the next morning but humidity does loosen pit fast.</li>
            <li> It is ultra sensitive in how you put the hair in it.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter can do it herself without any assistance.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter early for xmas ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy but looks professionally done and voluminous, not ringlets.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> A product that could actually produce curls in my straight, lifeless hair?  </li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair according to the instructions but about 1 of every 5 sections of hair would end up completely tangled inside the unit.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my 23 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Curls are completely gone from my hair after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old for christmas.  </li>
            <li> I would say 50% of the time it would wrap up my hair strand and nearly rip the hair out of my head.  </li>
            <li> and so far seems durable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that simple.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for busy bees..</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I have curled my hair over the year, I ALWAYS tangle (at least one piece of) my hair.  </li>
            <li> Natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 20-30 minutes to completely curl all my hair, and that&#x27;s me being semi-cautious but also semi-impatient.</li>
            <li> (She is 19 years old.)  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try &amp; used it again the second time &amp; it was ok but still pulled a few strands of my hair.</li>
            <li> curls are crazy good, very uniform and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay, so after reading reviews for a few months, i decided to finally get this and try it out.</li>
            <li> you dont have to worry about burning your fingers ( I almost did every time I use a regular rod)&lt;br /&gt;-you&#x27;ll have a big smile on your face when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s well worth sharing that you will not regret the $99 spent.  </li>
            <li> LOVE Curl Secret because it doesn&#x27;t have just 12 rollers, or let me try to curl too much hair at once.</li>
            <li> But after a few times trying, I finally know that how to use it appropriately.</li>
            <li> And while normally I wouldn&#x27;t spent $100 on a curling iron because it looked cool on a commercial, this was an exception.</li>
            <li> you are good at curling your hair, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t buy this expensive equipment.</li>
            <li> I own the Bling Curl Secret purchased from Ulta.</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret does deliver nice curls</li>
            <li> glad my hair is somewhat thick as it did pull some out during the &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair in long layers (ranging from my chin to the middle of my back).  </li>
            <li> Back to using the traditional flat iron which works just fine</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that curls pretty easily.</li>
            <li> No, it is not hard to get it back out, and no, it is not hard to get your hair correctly fed through.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I let it cool down while it was off and plugged in</li>
            <li> It has no type of safety feature for immediate cool down</li>
            <li> It tangled slightly on the first 2 tries, then all went smooth.</li>
            <li> will become an expert at this but as excited as I was to receive the Curl Secret, I have yet to pick it up since the first try!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m right handed) than on the left or back.</li>
            <li> hair length is right between the middle of my back and butt)&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Not only do you have to comb, de-tangle and smooth out every tress -- but you will have to probably do it at least twice more for every other curl made.</li>
            <li> first, I was hesitant due to the high price</li>
            <li> but when you do - it really is easy even if you&#x27;re one of those people who generally have trouble curling their hair.  </li>
            <li> I think the iron is smart, because if you do get lazy and just want to be done by inserting more hair per 12 sec cycle, the wand lets you know that that is too much hair, and it will back track or unwind the hair to let you know!</li>
            <li> and I can fluff it with my fingers after brushing to get it just right.  </li>
            <li> not sure would&#x27;ve been easy without him and off</li>
            <li> My hair is middle of my back long and fine.</li>
            <li> Use small sections and it will easily come out if it does get caught.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it created beautiful long lasting curls...</li>
            <li> The only negative is I wish you could place more hair into the barrel to make bigger waves, but none the less I love how it makes my hair turn out.</li>
            <li> Well get ready to hear it again because this little gem of a product is exactly that</li>
            <li> This product really curls my long straight hair, and the curls last.  </li>
            <li> After I was done showing her how to achieve the exact same look as this product with a $15 curling iron in 10 minutes versus 15-20 that this one takes, she was bummed she spent this much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to explore the higher settings, but I opted for the lowest and ended up with neat looking loose waves.</li>
            <li> In the past I have not found a single Conair item that has been decent for safe hair use-</li>
            <li> timer settings (depending on whether you want tight curls, loose curls, or a wave)&lt;br /&gt;Indicator light which lets you know when the unit is ready</li>
            <li> I also love that you can put the curl chamber right up to the side of your head, so you don&#x27;t have curls starting awkwardly a few inches down your hair.</li>
            <li> You just put a reasonable amount of hair in the snapper and it sucks it right up!</li>
            <li> Its much easier and faster than a curling iron or a flat iron!</li>
            <li> The curls are very tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> That time I wasn&#x27;t holding it perfectly straight, so I&#x27;m thinking as long as you follow directions completely</li>
            <li> Even then they usually didn&#x27;t last more than 3 hours - tops.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this product works great on all hair types.</li>
            <li> It did not take me more than 18 minutes to curl my entire head of hair, using small sections.  </li>
            <li> I have Extra Long, Thin, Super Straight, baby fine hair, but a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was scared to death to be honest - afraid my hair would get sucked in and never come undone</li>
            <li> Have to take small pieces of hair and make sure you use it properly.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous at first because their are a lot of different products like this with different names.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with long hair and wants natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> and so does my 5 year old with long hair who doesn&#x27;t really let me do her</li>
            <li> Regular curling irons take forever and there are never enough rollers in a hot roller set for all of my hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty short; length is between my ears and shoulders and it&#x27;s got a funky wave if left to air</li>
            <li> make sure hair is brushed out well, and in small sections.  </li>
            <li> next day - exactly the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to keep the sections small and brush through them which is key with this curler.</li>
            <li> So, the first &amp; last time I used it, I curled only the surface locks.  </li>
            <li> Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li> Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li> While it did a nice job with the curl, it did jam on me a few times - which also slowed things down.</li>
            <li> I would suggest for super long hair only using the device half way, so just from the middle down you have a nice curl..</li>
            <li> After the hair is drawn in the curler makes spaced apart short, high pitched &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34;while</li>
            <li> For my hair type, I vary between the 8 or 10 second mark, always on the high heat setting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this if you think curling hair has to bea big battle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has the proper length or longer layers.</li>
            <li> Actually 1 star is too high the item was defective and does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend watching youtube videos prior to using the curler.</li>
            <li> Due to injuries I am unable to hold my arms up for more than a few seconds and this product is easy to use and is the first hair curling system that really works.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick and coarse hair and this made it really easy for her naturally curly hair to turn into pretty waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fast and easy, I have thin hair</li>
            <li> and if you just open the tool completely it usually falls out easily or with only a gentle tug.</li>
            <li> And if your hair is damaged like mine, be sure to massage in a few egg yolks for 15 minutes  (an incredibly effective and less expensive protein-filler mask), condition, and rinse, a few times a week, to get your hair in better condition, as well as moisturizing mask, and trims (to hold curl).&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> The only two cons is it&#x27;s not meant for super long hair (my hair is down to my stomach), it turned off on me when I was 3/4 done from being too hot.</li>
            <li> the first use, there was a really bad plastic odor, but most hot hair tools do that</li>
            <li> Fast at curling her hair but her hair is so long</li>
            <li> but it just does what the video shows... and so long as you don&#x27;t get too much hair..</li>
            <li> I have extremely straight hair, about shoulder length long.</li>
            <li> Takes a really long time to curl whole head, sometimes</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday, Christmas Day, on my straight, long hair.</li>
            <li> so it takes too long for every day use to be really practical.  </li>
            <li> She has long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes of trying to curl my 12 yr old&#x27;s hair with this tool that barely made the hair curly on the highest setting, she fainted.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you will really see a lot of curl and bounce.</li>
            <li> I was not able to find any detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I have long stick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and very staringht</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and never holds a curl for long.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that is kinda frizzy unless straightened with a straightener</li>
            <li> The only time I am able to curl my hair is when I go to a salon and get it done and even then they only stay for a few hours.</li>
            <li> but first try it caught her hair in it and jammed into the motor.  </li>
            <li> I tried the first time on dirty hair and did 3 sections making bigger curls and last night, I curled it on clean hair and used 4 sections making more, smaller curls.</li>
            <li> When we called the 1-800-3-Conair number the customer service department seemed very flippant about our complaint and told us if we felt we needed to further vent our frustrations to send an email.</li>
            <li> But now I find myself wanting some loose curls for special occasions or just a little change, and this thing really delivers.</li>
            <li> i did exactly as the instructions states to have clean hair,a thin piece of hair, and to comb it out.</li>
            <li> go have fun curling your hair with a curler that will cut your styling time down in the morning!br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good for people who can&#x27;t get the hang of clipless curling irons and are sick of dents being left by the traditional irons that have clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair actually burned a little trying to free it</li>
            <li> It pulls hair too easily and is really hard to get tangled hair out.  </li>
            <li> It has a little more weight than I expected so your arms can tire if you are not used to holding your arms up for periods of time.</li>
            <li> It can take a few minutes to complete, as only small portions of hair can be tsken at a time, but beautiful loose curls are created.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and frizzy hair, so this took me quite a while to do a full head of curls, but the outcome was pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might look at other brands and replace it with something similar because the idea of this is just super</li>
            <li> This will save me so much time curling my long hair!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, my daughter wanted to curl my hair, it took her maybe 15 minutes to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I have used all three products out there and this one is not too different from the baby bliss or instyler tulip, except with the Conair Infiniti you can only go one direction in curling your hair which is a real downside in comparison to its competition.</li>
            <li> then it takes FOREVER to curl your whole head of hair since it only works for a very tiny portion of hair for it to work.</li>
            <li> Also there is a note on the curler that tells you which side should face your head so you don&#x27;t put your hair in the wrong way and get a pull from your scalp, I&#x27;m sure that would really hurt.</li>
            <li> Second of all, when this product actually did work(Which wasn&#x27;t very often)</li>
            <li> I recommend a wand for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was outstanding though, as usual</li>
            <li> This product appears to be the same device I purchased on Amazon by a different manufacturer and paid almost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> For what it cost, this product is well worth what I spent since it actually does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no more flinging around my curling wand trying to wrap my long hair around it.</li>
            <li> Yes sometimes you do have your hair get stuck ( but I find this only happens when I attempt to put to much hair in it) and if it does get stuck, you just simply back out.  </li>
            <li> I am super clumsey and messy.</li>
            <li> own and use the ACTUAL Conair Infinity Pro Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to use and holds the curl for even thick hair.</li>
            <li> The curls came out uneven, and fell out quickly.</li>
            <li> When I got a tangle, I just quickly unplugged and untangled without trouble.</li>
            <li> I know it seems like such a good idea, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work with my hair</li>
            <li> i was a little weirded out by this when i got it and was sorta afraid to use it but turns out i absolutely love the curl secret, i am one who cannot curl my hair or anything at all really so this was super easy to do and really fast!</li>
            <li> My curls last all day, my hair feels very soft (not crispy or over-heated)....</li>
            <li> but I get pretty loose curls with this!!</li>
            <li> Way too much work for limited results.</li>
            <li> The curl secret can create perfect tight curls with less effort that will hold for hours without hairspray.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a cheap knock off because the box looked really shabby and awkward.</li>
            <li> Unless you like doing your hair regularly, or use a normal curling iron frequently, you won&#x27;t like it enough to use it.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.  </li>
            <li> so even when I put in a little bit it gets stuck, other than that I love the results.</li>
            <li> I did my first practice run the other day, with hubby standing by in case</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t properly brush her curls first and her long hair got STUCK!</li>
            <li> and I had major volume.  </li>
            <li> The key with long hair is that they have to be smaller sections, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone, although not sure how it would work - or even if it would work -  on short hair.  </li>
            <li> If your not careful it rips your hair out!  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I want it to do and the price is pretty hefty.  </li>
            <li> On the shorter hair in back, it still curled but you have to be careful to hold it in position because if your arm starts to sag, the hair will slip right out.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine and extremely hard to hold a curl hair.</li>
            <li> Instructions are easy, however, you can only use small sections of hair..</li>
            <li> I actually did my hair the evening before and was able to wear it the next day and only had to touch up a few of the ones around my face.</li>
            <li> If you do it right you&#x27;ll get the hang of it and it will take you less time than if you try to shove a bunch of hair in there thinking it will give you faster results.</li>
            <li> You can easily get as tight or loose a curl as you want by adjusting the heat setting or time setting.</li>
            <li> Naturally wavy (not pretty wavy) and very frizzy.</li>
            <li> i think it would work fine, but not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so straight that by the time I&#x27;m done curling it with a traditional curling iron, it&#x27;s already flat again!</li>
            <li> and I should have had to go to all this trouble in the first place!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine and has trouble  holding a curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually, you can make several styles with this curls not only 3 styles which are described by Conair: tight, medium and light curls.</li>
            <li> The door of the tool, which is on the top looks very delicate to me and hope it does not break.</li>
            <li> The door of the tool, which is on the top looks very delicate to me and hope it does not break.</li>
            <li> Was broken but was very easy to return and get money back</li>
            <li> I can actually enjoy the feeling of curls instead of having hard hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the MAJOR things I love about Curl Secret is that..I wear extensions.</li>
            <li> might make this a bit harder to use, so on the days my hair has extra static I try and get that under control with a little bit of water</li>
            <li> So far I am having trouble curling my hair, I don&#x27;t think the problem is just that I need to play with it a little more.</li>
            <li> The curler is a little heavy, and it seems to have been designed to be used in the left hand (maybe for those curling their own hair).  </li>
            <li> go have fun curling your hair with a curler that will cut your styling time down in the morning!</li>
            <li> it took me 25 min max to curl my entire head (fine hair down to the middle of my back)</li>
            <li> Less hair &#x3D; tight curls and more hair &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I now can have sexy beach waves or tight spirals in 30min or less.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking there would be no way it works but gave it a chance based on other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But the other positive reviews made me give it a shot</li>
            <li> i am unsure if maybe I got a defective one, or that these just suck in general...</li>
            <li> Takes quite a bit of time to do the whole head and the curls don&#x27;t last too long on my hair.</li>
            <li> I assume people who are getting their hair stuck are not reading the instructions that clearly state to section your hair into 1/2 inch sections and hold the product with a specific side towards your head.  </li>
            <li> As far as price it can be found for the same price as the instyler tulip</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t being careful, I was trying to rush, I was trying to put too much hair in, or I wasn&#x27;t separating the sections of hair away from the rest of the hair allowing strays to roll up into the curler too.</li>
            <li> I do cross fit 3X a week, and I have to rest my arms to complete the second 1/2 of my hair because the iron is soo heavy!</li>
            <li> My 12 year old can use it around her face area, but not the back or sides of her head.</li>
            <li> (And I barely used any product in my hair - must be the ceramic).</li>
            <li> Only difference is if you have hair that does not curl well, set it on the highest heat setting and the timer to make a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; curl, so that when it falls some, it will look like natural, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> my curls were not coming out, they barely resembled any type of curl.</li>
            <li> So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item</li>
            <li> So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item</li>
            <li> Barely made a wave in my hair...</li>
            <li> but when we used it on the hottest setting and kept in the curler for the max time, the hair still came out with barely a bend in it</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old and she can do only the front of her hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and I managed to get it far enough away from my scalp to cut it out, but we both burned our fingers doing so.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, but it was never wavy enough to go without curling my hair into some sort of style.</li>
            <li> A regular curling iron flattens my natural waves.</li>
            <li> far we have gotten 4 of these from various sources.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fixed as alternate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no different than an old school bristled curling iron in that respect.</li>
            <li> It does curl you hair but your hair must be somewhat smoothed prior to the use or there is still some areas near your scalp that will be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> apparently some reviewers had to cut their hair out.</li>
            <li> It barely made a kink in her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my 16 year old daughter, she did her entire head of hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had her open it early</li>
            <li> Adult supervision DEFINITELY. ...</li>
            <li> (wow that was a lot of the same word) and medium thickness.</li>
            <li> Otherwise (for the vast majority of people) I recommend avoiding this curler completely.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s heavy, and gets hot, and spins, just as with any curling appliance it shouldn&#x27;t be used by young kid.</li>
            <li> There are no words to describe how much I love the Pro Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> Being the good mama that I am, I decided to test it out to make sure it wasn&#x27;t overpriced gimmicky crap.</li>
            <li> Infiniti pro by conair curl secret is gifted to my friend.</li>
            <li> I usually do my makeup while the curls are pinned to let my hair cool into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> meaning, don&#x27;t use on freshly washed and dried hair.  </li>
            <li> Ok I have thick coarse hair, I&#x27;m mixed</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and lacks body, all the more reason I thought this curler would never work.  </li>
            <li> Really nice this Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the curl secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use curlers before until I came across Infiniti Prof Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> Love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> My sister was skeptical but once she tried it, she decided to go out to buy her own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curl secret also has a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love my Conair curl secret.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Ever since I heard about the Conair curl secret and watched video reviews and read many written reviews about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely love the Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl .... until the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely competent with a curling iron, but it takes soooo long, when you have thick, long-ish hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my secret weapon for sure</li>
            <li> I also found it a little tricky to do the right side of my head, remembering to keep the correct side of the curler close to the head, and did get an achy arm after a while -</li>
            <li> But with this FANTASTIC machine, I can have tight curls, wavy curls, and medium loose curls.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I think I need to turn down the settings.</li>
            <li> to add: A year later and our Curl Secret is still going strong!</li>
            <li> made my hair dry and lifeless looking and the price is ridiculously high for it.</li>
            <li> The curls are large and loose (similar to Kate Middleton).  </li>
            <li> After only one try, I didn&#x27;t hesitate using it again for New Year&#x27;s Eve last night (attending a party with 350 guests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the timer was broken because it beeped right away on each setting.  </li>
            <li> And it was SO easy to use, no danger of hurting your hair (it beeps at you if you do it wrong or have tangled  hair), as it gently wraps your hair around the barrel, w/o pulling.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble getting your curls to look right?</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, long wavy hair and masses of hairs - about 6 times as many as a normal person, my hairdresser says.</li>
            <li> This takes me 30 minutes or less for my whole head!  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, make sure you curl very small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> Her hair is fine and hard to hold a curl unless you put ALOT of product, and then it will last an hour tops.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time doing anything with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably never be able to bring myself to use the thing again, which is a shame because it does give pretty results (when it works) and was extremely expensive!</li>
            <li> Also, it did get hot but not nearly as hot as a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> The parts that are too high to curl usually end up pretty frizzy and once the curl is made, you obviously can&#x27;t brush it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair, with an ugly kind of light kinky frizz.  </li>
            <li> (makes a HUGE difference in curl retention) and a few egg-yolk masks (for protein filler) at home, as well as my usual intense moisturizing masks, to bring my hair up tp grade.</li>
            <li> It can only accommodate small amounts of hair, and you cannot curl in the opposite direction (important to create dimension and avoid the &amp;#34;triangle head&amp;#34; look).</li>
            <li> It came out looking very tousled (due to not brushing hair).</li>
            <li> My hair is long enough to curl with hot sticks but not too long that this would be a pain.</li>
            <li> The third day, I washed my hair and curled the bottom sections of my long hair and held it only for three beeps instead of the four (it beeps to let you know that your hair is ready).  </li>
            <li> I frequently curl my hair, around 6 times a month, using either a flat iron or one of my curling irons.</li>
            <li> Yes, hair did get caught in chamber a couple times but came out without much effort due to auto reverse sensor motor.</li>
            <li> Being an Asian descendant with straight long hair I would never think it would be possible to have curls without going to a Beauty salon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how other reviewers got it stuck in their hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use much hairspray or any other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little top heavy which I had to get used to</li>
            <li> To be fair, the Curl Secret takes a little bit of practice.</li>
            <li> Choose your heat setting and how tight a curl you want and get ready to be wowed!    </li>
            <li> Also no burnt fingers with the pro curler!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my circling iron as it does wonderfully tight curls, with staying power, but for ease of use, will use this first</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to take to much hair and hold the tool level.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to follow instructions and it does not matter how much hair you put into it because it gets stuck anyway.</li>
            <li> We got this for my daughters (one has pin straight hair and the other has a natural wave) as a Christmas present and now that we have used it several times</li>
            <li> I got the Curl Secret today and was so excited to try it out!</li>
            <li> I find I only use it if I know I have at least 30 mins free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took me 45 mins to do my friends hair, instead of old curling irons that would have taken 2-3 hours to get the same results..</li>
            <li> Before yesterday my hair styles included stick straight, messy bun, and natural waves.</li>
            <li> , just be careful also it does take a while to do your whole head, but once it&#x27;s done, they do last a while.</li>
            <li> Release before it tries to suck in your hair a second time and tightens and gently pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> Ultimately we had to break it and open it up as the hair was stuck so far in that it was cut it off or break the curler.</li>
            <li> If you start at the middle of your head, you can get natural waves, like if you would be using a regular hair straightener.</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret will not abide more than 1inch of hair in the feeder, nor will it accept hair that is not brushed.</li>
            <li> If the hair is sectioned up and small sections curled at a time just about anyone can achieve a full head of massive curls.</li>
            <li> The curls did not dry, damage or frizz my hair.</li>
            <li> No more waiting for rollers to cool in my hair before reheating them for the next batch.</li>
            <li> that got a little hotter, had a longer timer, and alternated right &amp; left spin directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will demand some time and effort - specially if you are alone and have to grab hair on the back of your head - so be patient to take not too much hair at the same time (or the Conair Curl will stop working) and do not use in the highest temperature if you have damaged thin</li>
            <li> No more fumbling around with hot rollers ever again!  </li>
            <li> The curls stay at least a couple of days, even the most loose curl which is the 8 second setting.  </li>
            <li> You have to use small sections of hair at a time, but it&#x27;s quick and easier than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really long and thick), but it was so easy.  </li>
            <li> Having said that though I used the high settings and it only came out in a loose ringlet curl.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest it for different looks especially for women or girls with long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy, so it&#x27;s really hard to try and do the back of your head yourself.</li>
            <li> I was only able to do half of my head when I realized that there were several dead ends coming out.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and gives you flexibility for tight or loose curls.</li>
            <li> As long as the segment of hair is small enough and smooth, I had no problem with it, but it just stopped working 2 days after the 90 day warranty was out of date.  </li>
            <li> I definitely agree with other reviewers who say it takes awhile to get the hang of using this, but once you do it really does work well.</li>
            <li> Using other curling methods, my hair was usually straight the next day after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> Using other curling methods, my hair was usually straight the next day after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I have used it on myself, my 15 year old daughter (long hair) and her friends.  </li>
            <li> With this tool, I barely use any hairspray, and my curls last forever!</li>
            <li> there are no short cuts in life apparently.  </li>
            <li> I still have not used it enough to see anything different than expected, but it works really well in the highest temperature.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say how old I am, but let&#x27;s just say I should have learned LONG ago how to curl my hair</li>
            <li> The first few curls she thought it was gonna pull her hair out</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s heavy.  </li>
            <li> This thing is pretty heavy, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working within a few uses, so I called con-air</li>
            <li> It takes some time as the amount of hair you can put into each curl is fairly small but still worth the effort.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy thick, and this makes curling it so simple, although it still takes a bit of time, but that in no way is the fault of this amazing invention!!!</li>
            <li> I am usually a low maintenance kinda girl, so I hate spending a lot of time getting ready, but I do like looking good.</li>
            <li> Seriously this is worth the effort!  </li>
            <li> At first,  might think that it dont heat enough but seems it have to work a little bit  </li>
            <li> It weighs a little bit more than my straightener but not more than my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, super thick, and naturally curly.  </li>
            <li> , it takes forever styling your hair, poor quality.... just go with the remington ceramic curling stick (the pink one) and you&#x27;ll spend a lot less and get the beautiful hair style you want as you can control how long to keep your hair on the stick, you can put a lot more hair on it versus the thin hair strains that this curling machine allows you to and it will be a lot quicker (20 mins) and long lasting.</li>
            <li> thing is high speed, low drag (you know my story but not my swag).</li>
            <li> I have long,  very thick bone-straight hair, and I love this curler.  </li>
            <li> 12 seconds is not very long, so before you know it each curl is done.  </li>
            <li> The only time it ever tangles is if I get a bit too much hair in a section, or the hair is wildly different lengths due to layers.</li>
            <li> that curls you get from other high temperature curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, medium thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> so it took me about an hour and a half to curl my whole head</li>
            <li> I can do my whole head in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> So i take a shower and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I always let it dry naturally  </li>
            <li> Being stuck in the machine for such a long period of time, it completely fried my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and does not hold curls for long but with this product I was able to curl my hair and style it without losing any of the curl .</li>
            <li> Curl Secret looked so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair, can do it all in 15 minutes easily.</li>
            <li> my hair is super thick and won&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> I have super thick, processed hair</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> The Curl secret is too strong for that</li>
            <li> The little hot roller inside the machine will roll your hair up into the round part of the device until the whole strand is inside.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very frizzy, wavy hair, but I have to wear it back in a ponytail or straighten it every single day because I can&#x27;t let it air dry...</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, though it is a little on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> I have not lost 1 single strand so far.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to figure out how to position the head of the tool, but was pretty easy after a few tries.</li>
            <li> It also has a very short cord making it super hard to use when moving around your head to curl hair.</li>
            <li> Upon looking at a few reviews, I learned that it was difficult for many people to use correctly the first time.</li>
            <li> The Curl Was Barely There &amp; Flat.</li>
            <li> I can barely use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> (For a right-hander to understand this, please use this product with one hand tied behind your back, it&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent).</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but not good for long hair.</li>
            <li> The whole process takes me about 15 min, the same time I would spend with a flat iron, ironing in sections, and the curl holds for me about 3 days, when I am due for my next wash.  </li>
            <li> the picture on the left is the original machine and on the right is the fake!</li>
            <li> They both have long hair and wear it straight as does every other tween.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it seems quite fast as well, whereas some Youtube videos showed other brands that you held for a long while.</li>
            <li> My daughter has lots of thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it still got caught in the machine.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but definitely not worth $99!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit for each curl, so don&#x27;t expect to do your whole head in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Just use little sections of hair and don&#x27;t freak out if it gets tangled, turn it off, gently wiggle the hair out and start over.  </li>
            <li> , I absolutely love the results I get with Curl Secret - loose, bouncy curls that actually last all day.</li>
            <li> I now live with a movie star due to this machine.</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to this curling iron, even though Conair styling tools were disappointments in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair and it curled it, and I usually am never able to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective product, but mine smelled like burning plastic and constantly the red light would start blinking between curls (indicating it is not hot enough).</li>
            <li> Only once in the almost 2 months I have been using it did my hair get really stuck that I panicked a little.</li>
            <li> have very straight hair and have been curling my hair everyday for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> (middle of my back), fine hair; I usually have to set the curling iron about halfway down the shaft to avoid tangling as well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this petrified and intrigued, I had read bad reviews, but loved the idea.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad and that&#x27;s a good thing since I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> We finally got it open, our house spelled of burnt hair, she lost a huge strand of hair but it could of been so much worse.</li>
            <li> like the pro curler as it is generally easier to use than the curling iron and, for me, the curls held a long time.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so this makes the process time consuming, but the results make it worth the time.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair down to the top of my butt.</li>
            <li> I still find it hard to do the back of my hair and get it in right without it getting stuck.</li>
            <li> It can give you a tight curl which you can leave &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; or you can brush that tight curl out and just give you full waves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell when it will not go right.  </li>
            <li> I ended up losing so much hair because we have to cut my hair after half an hr trying to get my hair out!</li>
            <li> at least i did curl my hair, i mean it came out nice, and curly for 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> (and I am not very good at using a standard curling iron in the first place).  </li>
            <li> If you try to load too thick a strand, it will beep 3 times right off the bat to let you know it&#x27;s overloaded.  </li>
            <li> She has long, fine, but very thick hair.</li>
            <li> : I had my completely hair clueless husband do the back of my hair for me the other day</li>
            <li> not easy to use , and the curls not so much , not like the curling iron result</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with other curling irons and this tool was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> Also, I found that it&#x27;s not a good idea to go over the same area more than once as it just burns the hair with little curl.  </li>
            <li> Along with working with law enforcement we also actively monitor online marketplaces such as Amazon.com for counterfeit products and take immediate action against all counterfeit sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really not that complicated to use its very easy to catch on.</li>
            <li> This curler also eliminates the &amp;#34;twist and hold&amp;#34; action other curlers require and that alone is a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was excited but skeptical, however I got the real product by Conair and not a knock off despite other reviews.</li>
            <li> I watched several tutorials and tried several times, but I was never able to achieve real curls.  </li>
            <li> It took my 14 and 16 year old daughters 2 hours to do each other hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it only takes me about 30 minutes to curl my entire head on the 12 second setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only touched my flat iron once, since purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> I have watched the infomercials about the Curl Secret for months and was so excited to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to experiment and see what will happen if I do it wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, do not be lazy, if you want your hair to look gorgeous and last for two days, take a piece of hair no thicker than 1 inch and brush it well.</li>
            <li> I mean, how could you not be, right?</li>
            <li> a little high priced, but was a gift and they receiver like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the heat settings are hot enough for thick hair (unlike my flat iron that goes to 30; which at that level I still have to go over the hair several times).</li>
            <li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> If you are seriously inept at doing hair, it might be worth the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just not ideal for fine heair...</li>
            <li> use it every other day, doesn&#x27;t damage hair as much as the other curlers.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, think hair to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> butiI only place the curls in the back of my long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with long hair.</li>
            <li> However after the first few tries, my hair got stuck, I tried everything to get it out, ended up having to get the strands out one at a time and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to every woman who wants to put a little sass in her hair!  </li>
            <li> the settings really do let you create loose to tight curls.</li>
            <li> It states that this item was new but it seems as if that is not a true statement.</li>
            <li> Hardly put any curl in my hair and jammed most times no matter how little hair I worked on.</li>
            <li> Hard for teenagers to use alone, does exactly what it is suppose to do.  </li>
            <li> At first I was hesitant, because it looked like it might be hard to use or tangle my hair...</li>
            <li> My hair is a couple of inches past my shoulders, not thick but not thin, not coarse but not fine, and I keep it permed so that I can just &amp;#34;scrunch &amp;</li>
            <li> and this is coming from someone whose hair is a little past her shoulders and is not thick but not thin either.</li>
            <li> My hair goes down to about the bottom of my back and when I used this, only half of the hair came out curled, the rest was still straight.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about trying this, but I did and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has straight hair and usually nothing we do helps her hair hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about three inches past my shoulders and it takes about 15-20 minutes to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> Once I got past the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34;, it now takes me 10-15 minutes to do my whole head, using the 12-second setting.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten my hair pulled in it before but usually because I try to put too much in it.</li>
            <li> My hair was stuck in there for at least twenty minutes, and it was really hot and burning my skin, and hair.</li>
            <li> : there is a timer that beeps at you when your hair has been in long enough.</li>
            <li> You have to have long enough hair for the curler to feed the hair into the mechanism before it can produce any time of a curl - that&#x27;s where it differs from using a tradition curling iron or curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long hair and my curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair, I set it for low heat and soft curls and that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair , so</li>
            <li> They hold all day and night long and even into the next morning.  </li>
            <li> , is how long these curls last.</li>
            <li> but these curls last a really long time.</li>
            <li> , I have not had to use a flat iron before using this product.</li>
            <li> This should be marketed to those with long hair only.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but enough, it is long and in layers.  </li>
            <li> I have every curling iron and flat iron known to man in my bathroom</li>
            <li> For years a flat iron (babyliss) has been my salvation.  </li>
            <li> I wanted lose long curls so after curling all my hair, I ran my fingers through it several times.</li>
            <li> and I can flat iron and straighten it like a pro</li>
            <li> girlfriends hair is long enough to reach her butt and she has no tangling issues or anything of the like.</li>
            <li> : the curl does not last as long as my curling wand.</li>
            <li> The curls dont last too long.</li>
            <li> Curls are long lasting.</li>
            <li> It took entirely too long to get set-up to use.  </li>
            <li> As long as you read the directions, and use it properly, you will never have a problem with tangling!</li>
            <li> may work on short hair not recommended for long hair  </li>
            <li> But didn&#x27;t last long for the price</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to curl an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s actually a wedge where I place my hair against and as long as I put a not-too-large section of my hair against it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems.</li>
            <li> While this does take as long as regular curling iron..</li>
            <li> Read the instructions take it slow the first time you use watch</li>
            <li> This curl secret is so cool</li>
            <li> I have decided to return the curl secret with hopefully a full refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type who buys every type of hair tool imaginable, uses them for a couple weeks, typically with major frustration, then they land in a vast wasteland in the back of my closet never to be heard from again.    </li>
            <li> I have used when my hair was short, above my shoulder, like a long bob, and it works too!!</li>
            <li> go&amp;#34; when I want to wear it down, but most days I just put it up in a messy pony/bun type of thing because I&#x27;m usually wearing workout clothes.  </li>
            <li> I had to go over a few pieces twice because the curl looked a little weird, but I think it just takes more practice to get it the first time.</li>
            <li> It seems to prefer width to depth, i.e. divide hair into layers which do not go too far down the head.</li>
            <li> I can do my whole head of tons of hair in half the time of any other iron - flat or otherwise.</li>
            <li> But that takes nearly an hour, sleeping on it overnight, taking them out the next morning, and dealing with a little frizz.</li>
            <li> The curler is a little heavy, but it is fun to use so</li>
            <li> The first time I used the curler, I had it set to the high heat setting with the longest curl setting because my hair is usually difficult to curl and doesn&#x27;t hold curl.</li>
            <li> The process is much longer than using a curling iron &amp; it is VERY heavy.</li>
            <li> a touch difficult to use alone because you must face The barrel the same way the whole time which makes it a little  tricky (but not impossible) to do both sides of your head.</li>
            <li> , hairspray before using and your curls will last all night long!</li>
            <li> so curls LAST LONG!</li>
            <li> ; wide piece of hair straight out, put it in the machine, press  the handle down, wait for the beeps, and presto!  </li>
            <li> This new one has worked a while (a few months)</li>
            <li> The curls are very long lasting and they seem to shine.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to use dry shampoo on my hair the next day</li>
            <li> It has a feature on it that beeps if you put it in wrong or if there was too much hair so that really helps.</li>
            <li> Your hair must be dry, brushed and tangle-free before you begin.  </li>
            <li> Anyone with dry, kinky hair, I cannot imagine would do well for the same reason.  </li>
            <li> has problems curling her hair anyway, but after trying different methods, she found that keeping it on her hair longer than usual resulted in otherwise normal curls.  </li>
            <li> Its not a perfect machine, but I think its also maybe about being more careful and learning to use it.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the amount of hair you place in the curler especially while curling hair in the back.  </li>
            <li> She has long blonde hair and the comercials showed it making long ringlets.</li>
            <li> I usually just turn it off, let it cool for a few moments, then start up again.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that the product is a little bit heavy and my arm was getting a little tired after doing my entire head, but other than that I love this curling iron and it was well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The curls last all day even when used on very straight, hard to curl hair!</li>
            <li> I found the first few times I used this, I was pulling the tool down the curls and straightening them out a bit and losing some curl.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little bit hard to do the back of your hair by yourself, but not impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a wild frizzball mess.</li>
            <li> it takes long to use because you have to use such thin strands, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to use, if you don&#x27;t get your strip of hair in the exact right place you risk it getting tangled and stuck inside the hair curler.</li>
            <li> You just need to be diligent about the amount of hair you use for each section &amp; how close you are to flyaways or loose hairs from outside the hair section you are curling.</li>
            <li> I can leave the house with loose curls, sprayed curls, or sleek brushed</li>
            <li> However, the curls don&#x27;t last long at all!!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t feel frustrated when using Curl Secret, which is the most important thing for me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, colored/damaged hair mid-length down my back, I did my entire head in 30 minutes, first time, and my hair was not pulled once.</li>
            <li> I was upset and seriously was ready to cut my hair!  </li>
            <li> I was extremely reluctant to try this product especially because of the cost and only did so because of the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are correct when they state that you also must re-comb each strand before allowing it to go into the roller, even after you&#x27;ve brushed your hair several times.</li>
            <li> Try not to get baby hairs or really really small sections caught in your main section that you&#x27;re curling - I&#x27;ve found that this tends to a) make the tool spit out your hair or b)</li>
            <li> section your hair off into at least three large sections, THEN you need to pull each section out, comb, de-tangle, suck it in and THEN wait the 10 seconds, then take it out, move it over, comb, de-tangle, suck it in, and THEN wait the 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to learn how to use this new type of hair styler (reading the instructions, watching a couple of YouTube videos, reading though some Amazon reviews), but once I got it, bam!</li>
            <li> also, with long hair, it is very advisable to take very small strains of hair only.</li>
            <li> I have wasted, yes wasted, thousands of dollars on hair products, hot curlers, curling irons, flat irons, elixir&#x27;s, potions, etc.  </li>
            <li> Works well if you are not sloppy and grab the hair at least 1 1/2 inches away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but apparently I just do not have the skills to work this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> $100 bucks is too much to spend on something that does not work, at least for me.  </li>
            <li> That is what I was most afraid of with this device, but it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the curler very cautiously and was not thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it often because I tend to curl my hair when it&#x27;s not perfectly tangle free</li>
            <li> curler is definitely more expensive than the average curling iron or roller set</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve wanted this product for so long.</li>
            <li> It keeps the curl for a long time.</li>
            <li> Or you can leave the hair in for all 3 beeps, don&#x27;t comb or brush, and have long tigher curls.</li>
            <li> I had a harder time in the back.  </li>
            <li> long.</li>
            <li> The curls stay in place ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had this long ago</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that can become quite frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, layer and colored  </li>
            <li> My hair is long</li>
            <li> I have long hair below my elbows.</li>
            <li> It still takes almost as long, but i don&#x27;t have to burn my fingers, or spend time wrapping and re-wrapping my hair around the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to curl hair with this.</li>
            <li> and my hair is holding the curls for a long time.</li>
            <li> I called Conair to ask if they EVER manufacture anything with a SOLID LOGO - they said absolutely NOT.</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t curl it well at all.  </li>
            <li> It does all the work for you and takes roughly the same amount of time as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The only area that you need to be careful of is the side that faces the head.</li>
            <li> Wish I had not waited this long.</li>
            <li> and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is you can only curl a small amount of hair, I only use it to curl the front of my hair and finish it with the a wane curly for the back,  because it takes an hour to do the whole head.</li>
            <li> When I haven&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t curl as well or stay in as long.  </li>
            <li> It works, but cumbersome to work and takes a long time,  </li>
            <li> , I burned myself a lot, and it took so long to get it all</li>
            <li> but she has extreamly long, (to her butt hair)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get it.</li>
            <li> do not stay long-</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair</li>
            <li> It works well on my shorter sections but not the long ones.  </li>
            <li> My hair didnt get caught even being long....</li>
            <li> and my hair is about 18 inches long.  </li>
            <li> As long as you comb out the lock</li>
            <li> It takes too long though.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be careful of is keeping within the 1/2 inch width of hair that you put in the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have long</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of hair and its long</li>
            <li> It even tells you how long to hold a strand of hair in its grasp.</li>
            <li> I expected the same results as I saw on tv, but got nothing close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I think as long as you don&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Because it only curls 1\\&quot; sections, you have to be careful or you&#x27;ll get Shirley temple</li>
            <li> To get volume, it is cut into long layers.</li>
            <li> Also, I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it got caught in it.</li>
            <li> I was left with no curls and had spent $100.00 for something I could not use.</li>
            <li> did not work as expected.. sent back.</li>
            <li> have really long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Long spiral curls..</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter who has long hair.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is long dont start at the root</li>
            <li> We followed the instuctions and let it heat as long as it said, then had it grab the hair where the instuctions told us to.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues getting it tangled, but I am careful to keep the correct side to my head (it tells you which side) and not put in too big of sections.  </li>
            <li> I used my few times and so far no complains.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product as long as you READ THE DIRECTIONS</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the instructions, you will not be dis-satisfied.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any long haired girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time but couldn&#x27;t see spending $100 at the store.</li>
            <li> Sometimes days with minor touch ups!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a learning curve, but the learning curve is, like, one trial run long.</li>
            <li> I just hope the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Broke after one week makes a loud noise and ate my daughters hair, took me forever to untangle it,  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my long hair at all.</li>
            <li> It does take a long time for me to use this because of the amount of hair I have</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret is the first &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; tool I&#x27;ve used that actually lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> have long hair, so unless I spent three hours curling it with a standard curling iron,&lt;br /&gt;I would have to go to a hair</li>
            <li> It takes me 20 minutes to curl my whole head of long thick hair-not</li>
            <li> Because the instructions were not clear.</li>
            <li> However, with this Conair curl secret it made curling her hair fun b/c</li>
            <li> You will probably get your hair caught in it at some point-don&#x27;t freak, just tug slowly and gentle and it will come out.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight &amp;#34;Cher&amp;#34; hair and</li>
            <li> to probably because my hair is quite thick and naturally straight.</li>
            <li> Even though she didn&#x27;t feel the heat of the appliance on her head, the high heat traveled down to her hair and affected the nerve endings, causing her brain to shut down.</li>
            <li> typically use the Instyler curling iron if I wear my hair straight and want a little boost</li>
            <li> It then beeps at 3 different intervals so you can take it down at the same beep for consistant curls through out your hair.</li>
            <li> : Whatever setting you use, when it does its final set of beeps, open the device and then pull the device down.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I have long, rather thick hair and found the Curl Secret easy to use - and the curl lasts days and days!  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that is usually hard to curl because it tangles easily</li>
            <li> Super heavy, hard to hold, and takes a TON of practice.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, medium length hair and after reading several positive reviews, I thought I would purchase the Infiniti and give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> (hair a few inches below my shoulders and super thick)</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to do long hair.</li>
            <li> It kept getting tighter and tighter until it finally tore out a big chunk of hair and left me with a big knot on my head from where it was pulling my hair so hard.</li>
            <li> this point, I would highly recommend this curler for anyone with long, hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> this point, I would highly recommend this curler for anyone with long, hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-really only makes one type of curl, either loose of tight depending on how long you hold it (vs. an iron where you can alternate direction,</li>
            <li> What I mean by fluffy is that because this is just an engineered machine, it recognizes only straight and brushed hair inside as the correct one.</li>
            <li> Tried it on several other women&#x27;s hair and it worked on their type of hair and texture as well.</li>
            <li> love this product-unfortunatley, I can&#x27;t keep it a Secret!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all three size curls and they are all different from the other.  </li>
            <li> I use it on the tightest curl setting and go over each curl twice due to the fact that you only curl your hair with this for maybe 15 seconds?</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T TAKE LONG AND DOES GIVE MY HAIR THE FULLNESS IT NEEDS!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thing that the other brand</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t plan on curling my hair every day (probably once every other week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about doing the &amp;#34;girly thing,&amp;#34; as long as it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time!</li>
            <li> I have found that in order for the curl to stay in my hair, I have to do very small sections of hair, so it takes me an hour to curl my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews and the reason why it&#x27;s frizzy is because you didn&#x27;t wait for the final four beeps before removing it from your hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was suuuuper excited to try the Curl Secret!</li>
            <li> My hair will hold these curls all day long!  </li>
            <li> Curls without cursing that last longer than the other curling irons.</li>
            <li> and it does not take to long!</li>
            <li> Due to the strict positioning of this product to &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; pull the hair thru the coil, it is built completely opposite of what is innate for a lefty.</li>
            <li> Here is a picture where I did one side http://imgur.com/dLP45uY and left the other side for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t had any other curling method that would last even one day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really have to work on very SMALL sections of hair -</li>
            <li> It was such a chore with all the other curlers I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE CURL SECRET!!</li>
            <li> and I have a lotttt and LONG hair!</li>
            <li> thought I would try something other than a traditional curling iron....  </li>
            <li> It took me several tries but by the third time, I had it down.  </li>
            <li> and my hair looked great even though it was dirty and messy from being in a very messy bun all day at work.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to put a very small amount of hair (like a third of what they do in the commercial) &amp; put hair strand in as parallel as possible.  </li>
            <li> I did some internet searching, however, and found videos from Conair of very long hair being curled.  </li>
            <li> Very long.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long</li>
            <li> Beware, not made for very long hair, it jams up</li>
            <li> I had them for a very long time too &amp; after medications seemingly led to my hair changing, I sought out all sorts of hair curling implements.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used it for but not for very long.</li>
            <li> Been wanting this for a very long time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The middle setting gives a little tighter curl, but still loose enough.</li>
            <li> I put some moose in my hair after the shower then let it dry or blow dry.</li>
            <li> guideline of how much hair you have to put in the &#x27;chamber&#x27; is serious.</li>
            <li> then I brush the roots and let it dry, after that I used this curler at the ends and voila perfct wave  hair.</li>
            <li> I combed my DRY hair and curled about 1/2&amp;#34; at a time, holding my hair &amp;#34;loosely&amp;#34; as the machine pulled it in so that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled w/other strands causing it to get caught inside the curler.  </li>
            <li> Shocked that I found it today for such a dirt cheap price!</li>
            <li> let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I am not one to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, somewhat frizzy and can be bushy.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product after watching one of those infomercials with my Mom for her for Christmas and I used it on her hair first which is long and thin and</li>
            <li> I literally can only take an inch or less at a time which takes extremely long when you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazon processed a return label for me and helped me re-order the Infiniti Pro from a different seller, but I ended up canceling that order because I&#x27;m so annoyed with the whole process.</li>
            <li> It is also kind of scary when it sucks your hair into it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my hair after having it up the night before where my hair had air dried from a wet up do with plenty of product to give that natural curly look.  </li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;The trick to the Curl Secret is to not put too thick of a section in your hair at once, and after I pick the section I run a brush though it just to make sure it&#x27;s not tangled at all.  </li>
            <li> If you want to spend at least twice as long and get at least four times as frustrated doing your hair, this is great for you!</li>
            <li> Usually my hand gets tired holding up a regular curling iron, but not with this as it sucks in the hair on its own.</li>
            <li> every single time as promised.  </li>
            <li> Since i bought it, i&#x27;ve been using every single week.  </li>
            <li> I buy a lot thru Amazon and just don&#x27;t have the time anymore to write product reviews on every single item i purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is typical or if something has happened, but it has seemed to become much louder when it runs now.</li>
            <li> So I usually wear it straight with a slight curl.</li>
            <li> but no-- apparently I am the idiot who doesn&#x27;t follow directions, otherwise I would be delighted and buying this for half my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, down to lower back, and it had no problem taking the hair in.</li>
            <li> I had to complete destroy it to get it off her head!</li>
            <li> Tried it several times but no success.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, past the middle of my back, and I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying g for the past 10 minutes but am getting no curl action.</li>
            <li> Say each section takes the average time of 10 seconds to heat and you have 30 seconds per side, 30 sections on the back &#x3D; 90 sections.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair looks like some wierd straight puffy mess.</li>
            <li> have included pictures of the first time I used the Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not really built to curl long hair.</li>
            <li> first purchased the curl secret</li>
            <li> a little hard to use at first.</li>
            <li> Pulled the plug and my husband helped get my hair loose from the thing.</li>
            <li> The curls I get are loose,</li>
            <li> but it seems to get loose inside the device and stop working .</li>
            <li> We were just about to have to cut her strand of hair off, when he got it loose.</li>
            <li> I know it does sound ridiculous but at least until they manufacture a pouch for this tool.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I know it does sound ridiculous but at least until they manufacture a pouch for this tool.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> She has hair down to her lower back and was concerned that her hair would get tangled in the curling iron.</li>
            <li> when the timer goes off, I needed to open the curler all the way before pulling down - it made all the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you read the directions then you wouldn&#x27;t be putting this product down and you wouldn&#x27;t have had to chop your hair off.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t have it completely down on how to do the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t open the device while simultaneously pulling down.</li>
            <li> Read the directions several times and had them down pat.</li>
            <li> I also cut back on my conditioner so that it&#x27;s not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The plug - two prong plug didn&#x27;t even work - one prong was larger than the other and couldn&#x27;t even be used!</li>
            <li> Conair Corporation is actively working with local, state, federal and international law enforcement, as well as U.S and foreign customs officials, to stop the sale and manufacture of counterfeit and imitation goods.  </li>
            <li> Only slight thing is you must do 1 inch pieces.</li>
            <li> but at half the current price.</li>
            <li> I can curl my daughters hair in less than 10 minutes and the curls last for  2 days.  </li>
            <li> and it took about an hour and a half to do my entire head.</li>
            <li> I can curl my entire head in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I like how the ends go in last, less damage that way.</li>
            <li> It technically will put a slight curl in my hair,  but it doesn&#x27;t come close to what is advertised.</li>
            <li> I can see how someone could possibly get their hair caught, but not very easily with this one.</li>
            <li> My hair length is past the middle of my back almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> I have to pull the shorter layers back into a half pony and just curl the longer hair.</li>
            <li> If the owner of the handful of black hair would like it back, please contact Amazon returns or Bunche Park Deals (if you can find them!)</li>
            <li> this took me only about a half hour</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long term quality as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> that expensive bombshell curling iron, regular curling irons, hot rollers, etc.  </li>
            <li> the curling barrel is teeny tiny and can handle only small strands.  </li>
            <li> and i only got the bottom half of my hair done.  </li>
            <li> You can get the same look with a curling iron for much less money</li>
            <li> A traditional curling iron (which cost a lot less) takes about the same amount of time with less &amp;#34;mechanical&amp;#34; issues.</li>
            <li> Only buy this if you have tons of patience, time, and don&#x27;t mind getting hot and tired from trying to curl your hair!</li>
            <li> For the money, I am not sure it is worth it for someone like me with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical but that changed very quickly.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go over all the words we exchanged, but they ended up refunding me the hard earned money I spent and sending me a new tool, which I refuse to</li>
            <li> I can have loose waves or tight curls, and they legitimately last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> it did mess up 3 times,but you&#x27;ll know instantly...</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is difficult to curl and doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed after reading seemingly great reviews...</li>
            <li> Historically, curling irons and curlers do not work for very long, and I end up with no curl within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I just used it to curl my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> Not super thick hair, but not thin either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had even half the success with a curling iron that I have with the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t hold the hair tight enough to curl it</li>
            <li> Feel like it doesn&#x27;t wind her hair tight enough for it to curl.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it goes in messy it, it&#x27;s going to come out messy, at least the overall look was consistent.</li>
            <li> Had a little learning curve on which way to hold to have the barrel closest to head, but the curls last all day!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is only a little con..</li>
            <li> If I use this later on in the day after my hair gets a little oily than this does not produce any curls, just waves even on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> You only have to pull a little in order to get the hair out of the compartment it is in.</li>
            <li> plus, we had to use several styling products including a bunch of hair spray with made her curls seem a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; instead of bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the curling slot for the hair is extremely slim, so you can only curl a small section of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> The middle part melted a little</li>
            <li> And if you use the Curl Secret in the &amp;#34;8sec + low heat&amp;#34; set up you get loose, natural curls.</li>
            <li> It is also very thick and straight.</li>
            <li> The curls held up very well, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Doing the left side of my head was a little harder because of the way you need to orient the device.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to do on the back; trying to get the hair into the machine, when you can&#x27;t see it well.</li>
            <li> I wash it every other day to keep it from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and do it yourself the old hard way.</li>
            <li> Suprisingly fast..did my whole head (and I have thick hair down past my shoulder blades) using teeny tiny sections and still only took about a half hour.</li>
            <li> Which doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but remember, you have to spend an appropriate amount of time combing, detangling (or risk being the moron who can&#x27;t follow directions) section your hair off into at least three large sections, THEN you need to pull each section out, comb, de-tangle, suck it in and THEN wait the 10 seconds, then take it out, move it over, comb, de-tangle, suck it in, and THEN wait the 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It pulled my hair nicely into the unit, but my split ends get pulled a little harder, but it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> If someone said this is hard to use, I am sure that she used in a wrong way.</li>
            <li> As long as the hair is a small enough section, theres no reason it should get stuck.</li>
            <li> Only curls small portions of hair, and dosnt stay for long at all</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to do your hair because you have to use such small pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> Total waste</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully</li>
            <li> Could it be hotter and use a few extra seconds for my hair?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will get your hair stuck a few times with this curlers but relax and try smaller amounts.</li>
            <li> When I am ready to wear my extensions I will take some time to see what I can do with the Curl secret.  </li>
            <li> She spent about 15 minutes trying to get my hair out -</li>
            <li> Does not really work like they show on TV</li>
            <li> I tried few times and it does not even look curl at all or similar to all the videos and commercials in TV.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> We had to unplug the curler to keep her hair from burning while we spent 5 minutes untangling it.</li>
            <li> Since I have thin hair to start with, I really didn&#x27;t need a bald spot.</li>
            <li> but I think you gotta be kinda careful when using this because your hair might get stuck</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no hair styling skills.</li>
            <li> Did not perform as I Expected.</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only curl that does not die out of my hair in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> would like to know what you can do to solve my problem, because I spent 80 hundred dollars for something that is not working.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> $100 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to my hair losing its style, I have never really been \\&quot;good\\&quot; at doing hair.  </li>
            <li> You cannot put strands of hair wider than 1/2\\&quot;- maybe 1\\&quot; wide in the tool.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer then expected to curl hair</li>
            <li> We spent hours trying to get this to work and no results flourished.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t panic if it happens, Just carefully take your hair out.</li>
            <li> Also, BE CAREFUL of getting your hair stuck.</li>
            <li> Also, it helps that she puts some hair styling (curl) product on her hair while it is wet THEN when it dries she uses the Infiniti.</li>
            <li> I just placed a section of my hair through the guide, closed the handle and waited for the beep.</li>
            <li> I am the woman with the pink hair in the product images; my hair is product-free in the images</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is very loose and, unless you manage to severely tangle yourself in it, it lets go just like that as soon as you release the clamp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, you CAN get your hair stuck in it if you put too much in or partially miss the feed when inserting your hair.</li>
            <li> Remember: A few extra seconds of heat while you get your hair out isn&#x27;t going to burn it off.</li>
            <li> I have heavy high-lights on my hair, so I only curl my hair on occasions because of the time it takes to roll my hair and to prevent additional damage to my hair from curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> Do be careful not to overload with too wide of a section.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens and expected it to be something that I would try once and never use.</li>
            <li> I did that, and I had absolutely NO problems with my hair getting tangled.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of my time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to remove her hair from the machine, we jammed a screwdriver into the curling wheel to turn it in the reverse direction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That was quite alarming ..</li>
            <li> I was curious about this iron.</li>
            <li> I will be doing this a lot over the next few years...</li>
            <li> It burnt and tore out a chunk of hair about 1 1/12 wide</li>
            <li> It heats up real fast and has 3 different sets so you can control how thick or thin you want your curls to turn</li>
            <li> It sucked in my daughters hair, wrapped it around the inside barrel and then jammed.  </li>
            <li> Without hairspray they last a few hours before they start falling.</li>
            <li> I have tried regular curling irons and a lot of hairspray but a few hours in</li>
            <li> I read the directions carefully, also I went and watched a youtube video of someone using it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful using this product since once in awhile the hair likes to get stuck in the product.</li>
            <li> but all in all it works like I expected it would.</li>
            <li> My hair did get stuck a few times, but once I got the hang of it and took smaller pieces it worked perfectly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!!!!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it really never get a chance to tangle your hair.</li>
            <li> I watched a YouTube video, read the instructions carefully, and then gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I curl before bed (which takes minimal effort and time) and in the morning, &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; through with my fingers for a professional-looking all day curl.  </li>
            <li> To get her curls to last an entire school day, I have to use the Curl Secret on the highest setting with the timer set to the longest time (plus I tend to leave the hair in for an extra couple of seconds)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s from the motor in it so necessary but does get heavy.  </li>
            <li> And if for some reason your hair is harder to keep curl then use a styling product or spritz curl booster.</li>
            <li> Ironically I still recommend this product, just not for the inexperienced.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to... spent a lot of time looking like i had dread locks, or practicing the art of removing my hair from the darn thing</li>
            <li> and we just spent an hour trying to untangle my daughters hair from this device.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> and i had minimal snags when using this</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> so I take sections that are too wide into the machine.&lt;br /&gt;-tangles</li>
            <li> exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> my curls only lasted a few hours.  </li>
            <li> but I have had trouble getting the curler to take my hair in the  back</li>
            <li> I even carefully read the instructions before i used this with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair that reaches past my chest</li>
            <li> i am going to give it one more try hoping I can see some improvement if not, I will be sending this 100 piece of crap back!!</li>
            <li> but I also look at all the money I have spent on perms over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick, coarse hair which is just above my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair down to my waist to shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> hair gets tangled in it way to easy - even using small &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of hair - not impressed</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with the curl secret after i&#x27;d been not so subtly hinting for a while that I would really like one.  </li>
            <li> The only trouble I had was due to split ends.</li>
            <li> Not easy for travelling because it is only 110V.</li>
            <li> : my hair type is thick and naturally wavy, so I can&#x27;t speak to other hair types using this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Alas I am taking this &amp;#34;no curling&amp;#34; piece of hot metal back and to say I am disappointed is a true understatement.</li>
            <li> I have learned it will only curl a small amount of hair properly or keeps winding one way or the other until you&#x27;ve got a mess and have to start over.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had scored a more expensive item at the less expensive price, but then I did some MORE research and found out that the version I had was a fake.</li>
            <li> There was a limp curl that went flat immediately.</li>
            <li> I fully expected to have to be extremely patient to get the learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I have straight Asian hair and usually by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell I curled anything but with Curl Secret</li>
            <li> My hair is down to a little above my shoulders</li>
            <li> Read the instructions carefully and only use small sections.  </li>
            <li> I would only get results if took ten strands of hair at a time.. not good for people with a lot of hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this product, because it was smelling burned above normal when it was turned on.</li>
            <li> Especially if your hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> Also I have long thick hair so using the lower heat setting for looser waves is the issue not the actual machine.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to buythis product, I was a little scared it would not work</li>
            <li> but just a little bit of practice goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair that hangs down to my middle back.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very thick straight hard to style hair and the curls lasted till the next day with NO product in our hair!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I have long thick hair but even when it would tangle up it was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The warranty requires me to fork over money to ship it back to them AND send them a check for shipping to send me a new one, which will probably fail as well.</li>
            <li> hand gets a little bit tired from holding it at a certain angle for every strand...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it really does work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to spend hours curling my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut my hair other then trimming the ends since 1988</li>
            <li> After carefully reading the reviews (Pros: It&#x27;s life-changing!</li>
            <li> The curls stayed all day with no hairspray or any other product.</li>
            <li> This curler can be downright scary the first time using it.</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I also use a small amount of mousse or whatever I&#x27;ve got on hand to make styles last longer.</li>
            <li> I saw that some other reviewers had a couple of easy-to-fix hair tangling issues, but it didn&#x27;t happen to me.  </li>
            <li> I returned the other and kept this Conair Infiniti pro.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely No Complaints!</li>
            <li> YouTube videos don&#x27;t try to use big pieces of hair small pieces.</li>
            <li> but I had absolutely no problems with this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day since it got it about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> So do your due diligence and take about 10-15 minutes to watch other users work this curling device</li>
            <li> and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3w9T0HVKEZ4 for a comparison with other products.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> a one-star is due to:&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It will hold extra body until I wash it, but not much more than that.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s meant for those that find themselves incapable of using any other iron.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after reading the reviews, bought it.</li>
            <li> It only curls small sections of hair at a time</li>
            <li> The curls haven&#x27;t varied to either big, or small.</li>
            <li> hair is due as</li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> all my other reviews aread  on purchases I def made here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time to do your hair with it since you can only part small section at a time.</li>
            <li> I have used traditional curling irons in the past, but none ever like this.</li>
            <li> There is no release other than pulling, tugging and praying to god that you can get  it out before you hair burns off.  </li>
            <li> It did not stop as expected and tore my wives hair!  </li>
            <li> The other iron guaranteed it wouldn&#x27;t snag your hair and have it caught to the point of almost needing to cut it out.</li>
            <li> and I have one small section of hair that just won&#x27;t hold a curl overnight), but it only takes me 10 minutes to touch up.  </li>
            <li> You have to use such a small amount of hair to get a curl, it would take forever to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had to repeat the same small section 5x</li>
            <li> My girlfriend read the instructions, and when she tried to use this for the first time, it pulled and twisted her hair and would not release.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviews say, it does take some practice, but once you get the hang of it, your hair is curled in no time.  </li>
            <li> Small sections is KEY.</li>
            <li> result, that I&#x27;ve never got with any other curler.</li>
            <li> And since all I have to do with my other hand is hold a section of hair, my weaker side does not tire nor do I experience the frustration of the inability to handle, twist, turn, clip or whatever with my other hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other trick I learned is do not try to control the hair that is swirling up into the iron.</li>
            <li> other reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> I called their customer service to ask for help, she put me on hold - meanwhile I&#x27;m holding onto the curling iron with the other hand to avoid it pulling my hair - she said she talked to the manager and he doesn&#x27;t know how to help me</li>
            <li> like I have with other curling wands</li>
            <li> The key seems to be not holding it to close to my scalp and doing small portions of hair.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to use small sections of hair for this as well.</li>
            <li> again: small strains only</li>
            <li> We had used other curling wands and irons that didn&#x27;t create the pretty curls she was looking for but the Curl secret did!  </li>
            <li> Small brushed pieces, 1-inch,</li>
            <li> with Khols cash and other coupons, so I didnt pay but</li>
            <li> 6 other curling irons I have</li>
            <li> Even with shorter hair, if you have any bit of out of place hair, this thing WILL tangle it, be careful!</li>
            <li> Also, the beeper that tells you that your hair is finished curling, was not consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned this one&amp; purchased the other.</li>
            <li> If you use it properly per the instructions (brush hair and use small amount) it wont get stuck..</li>
            <li> While the apparatus does make curls, what one does not  know is that you have to use such a small amount of hair that it takes forever to do it.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser asked me what I did in the back and sides but not top of my hair.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you this ... it gets tangled to the point where it takes one person to hold it, and the other person to go at it with a screwdriver.  </li>
            <li> I have not figured out how to get it t curl the other way yet</li>
            <li> It only allows small sections of hair to be done at one time, so you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I will say that I did get my hair stuck in the curler twice (probably due to my error) and freaked out and yanked it out thinking it was going to catch on fire.</li>
            <li> (small sections of a time only).</li>
            <li> I guess it feels heavier than other tools, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> did not hold a curl on my hair and you could only curl small strips of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> No spray or other hair products.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let other reviews scare you</li>
            <li> BUT, IT DOES ONLY FOR THOSE LAZY PEOPLE(NO OFFENCE</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was very curious and extremely terrified.</li>
            <li> Untangling it usually takes less time than it takes for properly fed hair to curl, but rough treatment may tear your hair out or get you legitimately stuck.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky, and heavy, but can be managed alone, especially for the front of your head.  </li>
            <li> It got a little stuck a few times, but nothing like the reviewers who were saying they had to cut the hair or break open the curler!  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it&#x27;s just a little heavy.</li>
            <li> a little expensive but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully</li>
            <li> Note:  Be VERY VERY careful not to release the tension on the handle (this will make sense once using it)  </li>
            <li> I am just bringing this up as a word of caution to be VERY careful and follow instructions TO THE T!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very curious about this product but would never spend $ 100 on a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I use the high heat setting for 12 seconds, and my thick, heavy hair will hold a curl for 3 days with no products other than a little bit of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first regarding this product due to mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> So just comb the little section, loosely hold it out, and let go when it starts feeding into the drum.</li>
            <li> Also, since my hair is very thick and very long, I left it in the closed iron for about 20 seconds, anything less provided a loose, inconsistent curl.  </li>
            <li> Took some getting used to and it does take a long time because I have a lot of hair, its thick, and its long.</li>
            <li> I had seen the commercial for the Curl Secret, as well as YouTube videos, and finally I saw a friend use one</li>
            <li> I got this roughly a month and a half ago.</li>
            <li> It makes me angry that I spent so much on it</li>
            <li> In fact, I could&#x27;ve curled my entire head with a traditional curling iron in the time it took to curl 1 section with the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> No hairspray required and curl will last at least three days with minimal maintenance (just re-comb with fingers as needed.)  </li>
            <li> With the Curl Secret, not only can I curl it myself but the curls last even overnight!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long long hair, that never hold a curl - this thing works without hairspray even.</li>
            <li> Three family members with hair ranging from very thick and long to very thin and fine tried it, and nobody&#x27;s hair curled.  </li>
            <li> so I usually just stick with a flat iron...</li>
            <li> My hair usually falls flat within a hour...</li>
            <li> My hair is about half way down my back; so, longer hair might be hard to get loose.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, I got her loose.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing I would say it&#x27;s hard to curl back of your head since you can&#x27;t see to put the hair exactly right into it</li>
            <li> so please follow the instructions carefully and only attempt to do very small sections of your hair at a time, trust me,</li>
            <li> I could never master curling my hair the conventional way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the conventional curly to get the wavy look.</li>
            <li> Be careful, there is a little bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I have a little longer than shoulder length hair and had absolutely no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of hair, and it is colored/bleached/fragile, so I have to be careful with each little section that I place in the iron.</li>
            <li> my other options, I decided it would be less time and money to try</li>
            <li> But have a hard time doing the back part of my head!</li>
            <li> This product was hard to work with and the curls didn&#x27;t come out like the picture on the box even after following the directions.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have a hard time holding it</li>
            <li> I was worried about doing the back of my head with this, but it wasn&#x27;t hard at all.</li>
            <li> It hard to do the back though.</li>
            <li> Really hard to do on the back since I cant see how to put the hair in.</li>
            <li> My hair was is  shoulder length little shorter brushed it well used small sections.  </li>
            <li> The price is way better than others I&#x27;ve seen and also as for the \\&quot;ripping your hair out\\&quot; in my opinion you need to be stupid to let that happen because you can automatically feel the tug, which makes you automatically stop.</li>
            <li> (I assumed it was your average piece of hair garbage.)</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, I found it much too difficult to use, I prefer a curling iron while my hair is somewhat shorter.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment that I would make about this product is that my hair was caught in the spinning mechanism a couple times.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t eligible for return and is totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> it was possible to give a negative star rating I would.o can&#x27;t follow directions)</li>
            <li> it was possible to give a negative star rating I would.</li>
            <li> Mine was dark plum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how anyone got their hair caught enough to have to cut it out, but my hair caught in it a few times and it stopped spinning</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that some folks paid over $100 for this because it&#x27;s NOT worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, medium to long length and only takes about 5 minutes to do my hair when I am rushing.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine, who is a hairdresser, tried it too, and had no success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ripped out whole pieces of my hair in this thing, and it is literally quite scary...</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> and now it is too late to send it back......</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no more guessing how long you&#x27;ve been sitting there waiting for it to curl</li>
            <li> Once or twice I&#x27;ve had a few years get pulled on, or snagged, but no more than I would have with a regular barrel iron.  </li>
            <li> I think that this method allowed the curler to have ample space to evenly wrap the strands of hair and prevented tangles.placing sections that are too thick or having stray pieces of hair that falls outside the boundaries of the curler</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair just use smaller sections.</li>
            <li> I had to redo several curls because I tried curling too thick of a section.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair slightly past shoulder length.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it could do larger sections of hair, as I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to learn the tool</li>
            <li> I spent a ton of money on a few of these and of course unreturnable</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of my $$ I&#x27;ve ever spent</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and the curler allowed such a small amount of hair to be curled each time it took FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and is to my lower back.</li>
            <li> Hairdressers always tell me they have  never seen such thick hair, and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually fun to curl my hair again and not a long tedious chore!!</li>
            <li> and I have long hair (about 2-3 inches below my brastrap).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li> It clearly states to use small strands, like 1 inch width, NO MORE!</li>
            <li> once I get the process down.</li>
            <li> The sooner you take it down, the looser the curl.</li>
            <li> I went down to a 1/4\\&quot; sections of hair and it still would not curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE Read the instructions because if you using upside down you can lost your hair.</li>
            <li> the iron down your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and my hair goes down to my hips.</li>
            <li> I had to tone down the jewelry  to avoid it.</li>
            <li> this curler, I did my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair with no problem, her hair is down to her waist.</li>
            <li> Like everyone said, read the directions or put the curler down.</li>
            <li> so I headed down to the nearest drugstore to replace them and there, like the Xmas tree in &amp;#34;Whooville&amp;#34;,</li>
            <li> I will buy another set when the price goes down again.</li>
            <li> What a let down.</li>
            <li> and then I let them down</li>
            <li> After giving to one daughter for Christmas, and then her demonstrating/trying it out on other females at the gathering they all wanted one!</li>
            <li> I threw out all of my other curling items and strictly use my curler!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get caught or pulled like the other reviews state!</li>
            <li> Money well spent!!</li>
            <li> Sometimes on day 3, I can put a small amount of dry shampoo around my hairline</li>
            <li> If you mess up either you put the hair in wrong or you grabbed too much hair</li>
            <li> I sent it back and was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work better for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint  is that the curls aren&#x27;t  as tight as I would like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little hard to do the back of my head by myself.  </li>
            <li> my hair got a little stuck, but it wasn&#x27;t too terribly hard to get it back out.</li>
            <li> , my mom has very thin hair and straight</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and it is difficult to style.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries but it works!</li>
            <li> Enormous and difficult to manage on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> and I thought that his would cut that time in half.</li>
            <li> , I use smaller sections.&lt;br /&gt;Normally for a formal event I will visit the salon - my next one will be DIY with Curl Secret!</li>
            <li> It does not tangle your hair, curls your hair faster than a typical iron.</li>
            <li> and it takes half the time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> She then snapped the thing in half in order to try to get my friends haor out of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> For a tighter curl I would have to use less than an inch of hair.</li>
            <li> Just made a slight wave.</li>
            <li> However, only curls small small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> This truly does take a lot less time.</li>
            <li> have no talent whatsoever when it comes to the subject of beauty.</li>
            <li> I set my hair as instructed and it took my hair into the chamber, beeped and then released half of it.</li>
            <li> It broke half way through...</li>
            <li> LESS SUBSTANTIAL&lt;br /&gt;DARKER</li>
            <li> It takes me about a half hour to do all my hair.  </li>
            <li> A typical case of the product not matching the ads.</li>
            <li> , much less stays for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Lousy I am currently trying to send it back.</li>
            <li> a slightly curly to wavy look.  </li>
            <li> I wish it cost less</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, it seems to be less of a problem though.</li>
            <li> It takes a while because you have to do hair in 1 in or less sections but each time I do it, I get faster.  </li>
            <li> It took about an hour and a half to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I would not advise anyone to use this product as it is highly unpredictable and can get you stuck in a situation like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just load it again with less hair.  </li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that the longer your hair, the less the chamber can handle at a time.</li>
            <li> You do have to use half to one inch sections</li>
            <li> Then I used it on my hair today, with less than optimal results.  </li>
            <li> it takes me less time to curl with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> plus the curls look less shirley temple like (i used the lowest heat setting for the lowest heating time).  </li>
            <li> I have hair shorter than my shoulders and can do my hair in less than 20 minutes with this.  </li>
            <li> But my hair does&#x27;t work for this odd tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical about the high price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Curl Secret!  </li>
            <li> When it came it was a HUGE disappointment!</li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> FOR SHORT HAIR IS NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> Not good for younger clientele!</li>
            <li> and I curl my long hair at least 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> And use small pieces otherwise it will get jammed be patient</li>
            <li> but it is just not true..</li>
            <li> My hair is too long and thick.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that could NEVER hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I just think that you need to not have thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter whose hair is 26 inches long and thick.</li>
            <li> I do not normally leave negative comments but for me this product was not worth the shipping.</li>
            <li> I curled my hair and my friends hair (who have long thick hair).</li>
            <li> I have extremely long thick hair and even with product have yet to get caught.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest if you have thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair which requires me to curl about 30-40 strands.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavey, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Usually this has happened because the section being curled is too wide, or the end of the section of hair was being held onto too tightly when the curler was drawing the hair</li>
            <li> My hair is a little longer then shoulder length and took about a half hour to do.  </li>
            <li> I found this did not hold the curl or make a tight curl.</li>
            <li> The highest setting gives a tight curl, but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The curls are not uber tight -- they make \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; spirals.</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of shoulder length hair) within 20 minutes and tight spiral curls.</li>
            <li> The curling iron doesn&#x27;t leave a tight hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a tight curl that I can finger through and loosen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curls do not hold on tight although I put it on the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> I did everything by the instructions, and It wound up my hair so tight that I could not get it out.  </li>
            <li> With the time settings (12, 10 or 8 seconds) I can have anything from tight curls to wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> There are two setting depending on how tight the curl is you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> I use it on tight setting (12 seconds, Hi temperature).</li>
            <li> The curl starts out tight but the end looks like it ran out if heat to hold the curl.</li>
            <li> The curls can be tight or looser depending on the setting you choose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-multiple heat settings allows a variety of curl coil (tight or loose)&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect</li>
            <li> Not so, each section of hair you curl has to be held inside the device for 8 to 12 seconds (depending on how tight of a curl you want.</li>
            <li> 3 settings one for tight curls one for med curls and one for a looser curl..</li>
            <li> It holds it tight.</li>
            <li> It holds it tight.</li>
            <li> It is at first a little awkward..</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long thick hair though</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very long and thick.</li>
            <li> , that is very long with layers and THICK.</li>
            <li> This is for anyone who walks into a hair salon with an explanation that typically starts off with &amp;#34;It&#x27;s complicated,&amp;#34; before you even bother to sit in the stylist&#x27;s chair and waste their time and yours.</li>
            <li> My daughter begs me to curl her hair all the time and we have tried a whole bunch of roller styles and they all have left her disappointed.</li>
            <li> about a month and a half in, now the curls come out limp, bent, and crimped.</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro doesn&#x27;t waste any of my time and gets the job done in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> When blow dried it is typically wavy with some frizz.  </li>
            <li> its very simple to use once you get the hang of it, and is pretty much idiot proof.</li>
            <li> the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I havent had any trouble using it, and I&#x27;m no good at using regular curling irons</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me, this process is time consuming and grueling, but I&#x27;m not going to fault the curling iron simply because I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> I also held the curler closed for a few seconds past the 3 beeps for done.</li>
            <li> I also held the curler closed for a few seconds past the 3 beeps for done.</li>
            <li> It was a heavy item and just not very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd at the time, and now I assume she&#x27;s probably seen a few returns on this</li>
            <li> Does not work for my thick hair, it can only take a few strands of my hair and If I continued to use this, it will take me forever to get my hair done!</li>
            <li> The only other complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to do the back of my head, I have to bring the sections to the sides where I can see in the mirror and for the life of me</li>
            <li> You have little control, the curls are weird, it doesn&#x27;t go high enough to root, and worse of all my hair kept getting caught.</li>
            <li> Just takes a little practice to get used to.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is use a little hairspray</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mom for Christmas, I was a little weary about it after reading some of the reviews but decided to buy it anyways because it was what she asked for.</li>
            <li> While this little baby is slurping in your hair it also might get hair that&#x27;s not meant to go into it, causing a chain of profanities to escape our lips which are not at all lady-like.</li>
            <li> If it does, just take your time and pull the hair out a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to learn how to use it, be patient.</li>
            <li> There is a little learning curve with holding the iron</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to do anything other than just put a small piece of hair</li>
            <li> It took a little practice</li>
            <li> No, it does not damage hair (no more than any other heating tool does, anyway.)</li>
            <li> I bought a wand for $20 and although it takes a little longer, I will keep using the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I realized.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have never given anything a one star rating before, but it had ONE job, and that was to CURL my hair, which it did not do even a little.</li>
            <li> so I like to straighten it and put just a little bit of wave in it.</li>
            <li> and I would use the little glove to protect myself and</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking at this little gem for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> it gives you a little item to wind the hair out.</li>
            <li> but I had to share my thoughts given past experience with other products.</li>
            <li> A little bit of a learning curve but nothing horrendous.  </li>
            <li> I looked like a Latina Little Bo Peep</li>
            <li> --her hair is about shoulder length and it gave her the cutest little curls--almost like flips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The perm didn&#x27;t take too well in the front, so it needs a little touch up.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little trickey</li>
            <li> And no more failed curling attempts with a heated tong, because I got impatient and started trying to curl way too much hair at once just to get it finished.  </li>
            <li> I have a little longer than shoulder length hair with layers.</li>
            <li> This little machine just pulls the hair in and curls it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I have a little longer then shoulder length hair &amp; it takes me about 30 minutes from start to finish.  </li>
            <li> This curler is a little too picky.  </li>
            <li> (little pass shoulder length)</li>
            <li> Since he curl is so small and my hair is about hip-length, I can only put small amounts of hair in and it takes forever!</li>
            <li> She cut of 3 inches due to excessive damage</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this not worth it!</li>
            <li> and it took me a little over 20 minutes to get it done..</li>
            <li> little heavier than I thought.</li>
            <li> and I panicked a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair (little past my shoulders) and my daughters (her hair goes past her waist, very long) and for both hair types</li>
            <li> I spent at least half of that time on the phone with Conair as they went step by step to get it unstuck.</li>
            <li> There were a few times it snagged and caught my hair so tightly that I had to yank it out.</li>
            <li> Easy to use after a few initial terrifying seconds.</li>
            <li> You can only put a very small, and I&#x27;m talking small amount of hair into the chamber for it to give your hair any sort of curl.  </li>
            <li> (I have a tough scalp so that is saying something), then I tried a third curl, again with a little bit off hair, this time however I could get it to release my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid if the machine, it&#x27;s all in the way you place your hair in the machine and don&#x27;t use large strips if your hair.</li>
            <li> The secret is to dampen ends of hair &amp; use tiny pieces for tight curls.</li>
            <li> I was initially pretty nervous; I&#x27;ve gotten into some doozies with other styling tools and something that sucks your hair into a machine could have been dangerous for me.</li>
            <li> If I were to rate the curls it would be 4 stars but the item is heavy and you have to use little pieces of hair so it takes longer</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy but not unreasonably so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit heavy to hold</li>
            <li> or  you can run your fingers through it to break up the curls, but that makes it a little messy and morning hair-ish.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> A method that worked well for me, but which also took time, was to twist my hair up tightly in each section about 2 inches from the root and using the twisted section to place inside the open device and then clamping it closed.</li>
            <li> After approximately 1 1/2 hours, much pain, and lost time we did finally untangle the mess and got the hair out of the dangerous rod.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to curl the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a good investment for Long hair.</li>
            <li> This also didn&#x27;t curl my hair... more like crazy weird curls.</li>
            <li> so it crazy curly and straight in some points.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work waste of money.  </li>
            <li> You WILL experience some tangling with the Curl Secret, but don&#x27;t panic, if you have brushed the hair beforehand it should slide without any issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly heavy, something to consider for anyone who doesn&#x27;t/can&#x27;t hold up a fairly heavy hair</li>
            <li> Yes, my hair got tangled a few times but it was always my fault.</li>
            <li> but it took a few minutes to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist,  so naturally I was skeptical of this device.  </li>
            <li> I did get my hair stuck a few times, but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t curling</li>
            <li> got called Shirley temple a few times.....</li>
            <li> It is also heavy and cumbersome to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched a few tutorials/reviews on YouTube before giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been only TOO EAGER to write my review since my Curl Secret arrived on Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have not had any trouble with hair getting tangled in the curler.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to get used to</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> When you consider the price to have your hair styled, this product pays for itself in a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it heavy</li>
            <li> I read the directions, watched a few videos, and set to work.  </li>
            <li> The curl needs a few seconds to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes forever, and the curl is worse looking than with a regular, inexpensive curling iron.  </li>
            <li> but I have arthritis in my hands and shoulders and the curler is heavy.</li>
            <li> Product is a waste of time and money, I returned the product never worked as advertised...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> , it took me over 50 minutes to do a half-assed job that I ended up putting in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> , it took me over 50 minutes to do a half-assed job that I ended up putting in a messy bun.</li>
            <li> It would give me a lifelong negative association to the CONAIR brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up with for a few hairstyles...</li>
            <li> I sent the Conair curl secret back</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> it gets a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Not like a ton of bricks heavy, just a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I do have to touch up a few curls everyday</li>
            <li> A few minutes after turning this on it started to smell like burning plastic.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is unevenly waved/curled.</li>
            <li> and then just touch it up in a few spots; it takes just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and so you can see how heavy it can get on your arm/hand.</li>
            <li> On my daughter hair however had a a problem getting stuck a few times..</li>
            <li> I have gotten countless comments since I use the Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> It is heavy.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> Wait a few seconds, it curls, whether it likes it or not...</li>
            <li> This is a heavy curler</li>
            <li> It did tangle my hair a few times, but all I needed to do was release the handle</li>
            <li> I have read some find the product too heavy, but I had no problem holding it.</li>
            <li> Really a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> I really wasted my money on a product that I was dying to have.</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> not too heavy as mentioned in some reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium length, heavy hair</li>
            <li> I could never get this thing to work a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not light.  </li>
            <li> My hair got stuck a few times and the curler immediately released my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just got extensions a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> When I travel, I simply put the Curling Secret in my bag &amp; I</li>
            <li> It beeps a few times to let you know it&#x27;s done in seconds.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few few stray hairs get a tug here and</li>
            <li> As for getting hair caught in it, it happend a few times but it immediately beeps to let you know</li>
            <li> This totally dried my shoulder length hair out.</li>
            <li> We unplugged it and removed the hair with tweezers as it was firmly caught.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I read all the instructions, watched a few YouTube videos, and read the reviews before using this curler.</li>
            <li> A few practice curls</li>
            <li> Now I have a clump of hair missing from my head.  </li>
            <li> It happened a few times to me but it doesn&#x27;t get caught and rip it out like</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times since I got it</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and I am taking it back…</li>
            <li> I WAS CURLING GOT STUCK IN THE CURL SECRET IRON AND SIMPLY WOULD NOT COME OUT.</li>
            <li> (I know this because I did it a few times.</li>
            <li> The product is difficult to use, and get&#x27;s hair stuck frequently.</li>
            <li> Plus it is heavy and after trying to get it to curl my hair for about 5 min</li>
            <li> After a few sections I went up to an inch width and not once did it tangle or pull.</li>
            <li> It takes a few times to get the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> Curler pulls hair and curls are of uneven size.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat heavy to be holding.  </li>
            <li> I use my iron for the few wispy curls around my face.  </li>
            <li> She watched a few YouTube videos to learn how to use it.  </li>
            <li> few notes:</li>
            <li> Then the limp wave disappeared after 30 minutes, it was a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Now, I bought mine at Target and part of me wishes I had waited a few weeks and saved $15 since now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 2nd curl secret, but cannot blame anyone</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I experimented with it a few times this week.</li>
            <li> it burns my hair a few times, after that i&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> the few times I tried it.</li>
            <li> Also, if you think this is heavy, you need to work out.</li>
            <li> Another thing about this product is that it is heavy.</li>
            <li> Remove all the fluffy hair around.</li>
            <li> I ended up having to cut it out, and now theres a piece of my hair missing.</li>
            <li> I got it a few months ago....</li>
            <li> I feel fancy with my hair curled everyday now.</li>
            <li> difficult or 12 yr old to us</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend the curl secret for anyone with above the shoulder length hair and/or anyone who has trouble using a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-takes waaaay longer than an iron because you can only curl VERY small sections of hair at a time&lt;br /&gt;-HEAVY!</li>
            <li> my first few tries with the thing were very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Half way through fixing my hair this morning I turned pro!.</li>
            <li> If I had less hair, the sections of hair I cut away would probably be upsetting!</li>
            <li> We use small 1/2&amp;#34; segments of hair at a time or less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve curled my hair probably 6 times in the past month and a half where as before that, I curled my hair maybe once a year.</li>
            <li> I also notice some frizz which I could probably tame if I knew how without destroying the curl.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped and twisted - If I pulled one strand, it pulled the other strands into the unit further!</li>
            <li> All you need is a little time and a little patience, I get spiral curls every time!</li>
            <li> The product delivered was an absolute fake!</li>
            <li> I suck at doing anything to my hair, it is long and thick and will not hold a curl!</li>
            <li> Based on my hair&#x27;s history, I was pretty skeptical about Curl Secret - I just didn&#x27;t think it would work well for me.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair you curl at a time depends on how long and thick your hair is, you must use some common sense.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, not for shorter hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> because it is not easy to get the hang of - it takes some persistence to get the technique</li>
            <li> My hair HAS gotten trapped a few times, usually I can get it out within the minute</li>
            <li> a say about that.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m horrible at doing my own hair, and I have thick black wavy hair that I permanently straightened.</li>
            <li> and my hair is a little past shoulder length.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried for the past 7 years while no success at curls!)</li>
            <li> it does not curl my hair which is a little past shoulders which also got kinda stuck in there, for $100</li>
            <li> I have very thick fairly long hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair that takes forever to curl</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only I hate it because it broke when being new</li>
            <li> Burned my wife&#x27;s hair pretty bad, so we had to return it.  </li>
            <li> which was painful and the curling iron was still hot.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and quite thin.</li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair, thin but lots of it.</li>
            <li> Also, this is very expensive for something that didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*see my curl secret photo for long hair in customer images</li>
            <li> Before I used it, I thought I would have a hard time holding it up while it curled because it is a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous product, I purchased it for my 15 year old granddaughter, she styled her hair with it several times , then it rolled her hair around it and would not let go.  </li>
            <li> , I have very long hair that is very thick (I&#x27;m a redhead).  </li>
            <li> so I just slowly slid it down to release the curls.</li>
            <li> and it does not hold a curl hardly ever without a half can of hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than what a regular curling iron or a curling wand would be.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short since I&#x27;m so bad with taking care of my hair, but I can actually work this and put curls in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> curling my thick crazy hair so much easier.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I find wrong with this curler is, it is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> At least half the time, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; the way I put my hair</li>
            <li> At least half the time, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; the way I put my hair</li>
            <li> My hair got tangled at least half a dozen times during the curling session</li>
            <li> I call this thing my little hair robot!..</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR LONG HAIR!!!!</li>
            <li> It is possible that I have a bad product, but even so, with the small size of sections I need to use, I can work quicker with a regular curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Such an utter waste of time waiting and then be completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> course, your hair will be pulled and you might lose a little hair, but that is NOT because this product sucks.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive, seeing as I read some reviews that hair got stuck and had to be cut out or that it didn&#x27;t work on thick hair.</li>
            <li> Need to use very little hair</li>
            <li> The directions that I could read that were printed on the box were not in detail and were of very little help.</li>
            <li> Even when my hair was about to be caught incorrectly because the strand was a little too thick, the product itself gives you an beeping alert and does NOT curl your hair therefore preventing your hair from tangling itself with the product.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that has delivered the promised results as expected!!!!</li>
            <li> If I am not paying enough attention and improperly feed a section into the Curl Secret, it stops immediately, reverses and prevents any serious damage or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the curls were coming out sloppy and loose anyway.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped anyone whose hair story usually begins with, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s complicated.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No more burns.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it usually takes me about 30 minutes to curl my hair</li>
            <li> Use as it says, small pieces at a time.</li>
            <li> am not gifted in hairstyling.</li>
            <li> No more crimped ends.</li>
            <li> I did get a small section  caught and it took a while to get it out</li>
            <li> It does take some patience and I had to curl small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> My daughter felt like her small barrel curling iron was quicker and easier to use.</li>
            <li> , I usually don&#x27;t, but I had to this time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just take care to use it properly and with small sections so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck, that can be scary.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I have always had problems curling my hair in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and heavy and could never hold a Curl.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I feel like I have gotten the hang of it!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t usually hold well</li>
            <li> /&gt;*the time involved with sectioning out small pieces of hair (it is supposed to be a time saver)&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to use small sections and brush your hair before using it.</li>
            <li> 1/2-1 inch of hair NO MORE than that.</li>
            <li> It may seem like an expensive item to purchase if you&#x27;re not sure if it actually works</li>
            <li> a small amount of hair in at a time.</li>
            <li> Need to do a small amount of hair at one time or it will not curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what to write on this one.</li>
            <li> I am not an amateur when it comes to styling hair either.</li>
            <li> so you do have to take small sections</li>
            <li> Curl small sections and if you get a tangle, turn the iron off and be patient while you detangle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the price is $100 considering that you can buy a wand for $20</li>
            <li> something I don&#x27;t usually receive).</li>
            <li> She tried several times and it eats her hair and difficult to pull out and burns her scalp.</li>
            <li> My biggest piece of advice would be to use SMALL sections of hair.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean just a little.</li>
            <li> The times it has started getting stuck is when I get lazy and don&#x27;t brush out the strand.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would recommend to a friend at this price.</li>
            <li> problem I had with regular curling irons is that the bottom of my hair always got crimped in a weird way</li>
            <li> It does curl longer hair if you take small sections.</li>
            <li> I do take fairly small sections, and YOU HAVE TO MAKE</li>
            <li> Now that is all a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the description of this product.</li>
            <li> Even when doing small strands</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, and no matter how small a strand I put in it, it just beeps.  </li>
            <li> There are a few telltale graphical signs on the box (I knew that box looked off!)</li>
            <li> I have never seen , as esay to use hair curler as this one before, i was never able to curle hair by myself.</li>
            <li> cause you do have to use rather small sections</li>
            <li> cons are you have to do small amounts of hair at a time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and her past her waist hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure why my hair gets stuck</li>
            <li> Even when I do small amounts my hair gets caught</li>
            <li> but also I noticed that I had to do the curl hair strain twice to get the curl (max heat and lenght of holding), even though I sprayed heat protection which usually helps a lot holding</li>
            <li> With the culing wand you usually get a &amp;#34;way</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s heavy!  </li>
            <li> I have thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> small sections in to avoid hair getting stuck.</li>
            <li> what a waste!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it is not going to be a regular tool I use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the past difficulty in curling my hair, I used the highest setting at the longest time.</li>
            <li> My daughter was unable to get the iron to open, it kept spinning and spinning locked to her head.</li>
            <li> to use small pieces and difficult to do the back without help until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so it usually takes forever .</li>
            <li> Kept getting stuck but would usually unwind...</li>
            <li> for the 5 minutes the curl usually lasts.</li>
            <li> do not buy this if you have a lot of hair, you will need to separate your hair in small sections and it will take you ages to get done.  </li>
            <li> You get a curl similar to what you would get with a curling wand without the weird end</li>
            <li> used small amounts of hair each time I curled it...</li>
            <li> and you have to use small sections it took 45 minutes to do my hair all around</li>
            <li> You either have to use extremely small portions of hair (which takes forever) or you risk ripping your hair out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure, but I believe if it was warmer would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest thing that helped me is trying to curl SMALL pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I got</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> also have to mention you have to face this unit with one side always to your head (labeled on unit which side) which can be difficult when curling the back of your head.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a difficult time curling my hair, never quite getting to look the same way it does after leaving the salon.  </li>
            <li> I can never get &amp;#34;nice,&amp;#34; defined curls to stay in my hair because it&#x27;s so thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> Use small section of hair.</li>
            <li> BUT YES, LAZY PEOPLE) who do not bother to follow the instructions as they are written.</li>
            <li> The piece of hair must be no more than inch and correctly inserted inside.</li>
            <li> But if you want tight curls, it can do that, u just have to take very small portions of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I have tried with hear spray and the other things the hear gets stock inside and it very hard to get them out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is fairly long (below the shoulder), so I used the hottest setting, the longest setting, and very small sections of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it tangle on one curl so far, which I&#x27;ll admit was a bad tangle!  </li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but the iron is very heavy.</li>
            <li> It caught my hair and it was a real mess.. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week now, and about 4 times my hair got caught the wrong way in the twirly thing, and i had to fight hard for my hair back.</li>
            <li> make your baby hairs get sucked into the tool with the main section, which pulls them quite a bit in the process (which is slightly painful).</li>
            <li> I mean it sucks up your hair into a little pocket, and then spits out a curl.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and very thick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with my hair getting stuck or tangled inside the tool, so other people who said that may have just been using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the curl I got on the long parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> not sure how any of the people who wrote negative reviews were using this styler to end up getting their hair stuck.</li>
            <li> Let them long locks flow and curl fellas), if you&#x27;re near-bout to cut off a lock of hair because you got her twisted in there</li>
            <li> Use small stands of hair (about 1/2 thick).  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty much idiot proof.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, there was no pain, my hair came out easily</li>
            <li> I read reports that hair was pulled or tangled into the machine, I found that to be near impossible to do.</li>
            <li> ;, impossible to be natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to miss the feed when it&#x27;s in your blind spot, but it&#x27;s not as scary as it sounds.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;d have to try really hard to hurt yourself with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> we had a hard time getting hair out of it.</li>
            <li> It was also hard to hold work with etc.  </li>
            <li> so if you have hard to curl hair, will not work too well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what that other person was talking about being disappointed that their curls last \\&quot;only\\&quot; 2 days - this isn&#x27;t a PERM</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair, I have to use the highest setting that is supposed to give the tightest curl with the Infiniti Pro.</li>
            <li> I did get my hair stuck one time, but it was not that hard to remove it.</li>
            <li> Plus it gets to parts of your hair/head that are hard to reach to curl.</li>
            <li> It takes time and it will get tangled but even then it is not that hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Folks are having a hard time getting this to work, or their hair gets caught up.  </li>
            <li> GAVE IT AWAY,  TO HARD TO HANDLE</li>
            <li> If you have hair that is hard to curl then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Can be hard to get.</li>
            <li> I have rotator cuff issues so hard to hold it up sometimes.</li>
            <li> (I learned this the hard way).</li>
            <li> and you kinda have to pull hard.</li>
            <li> Works on even tough to curl limp hair.</li>
            <li> I figured if I was going to plunk out another $100 for something that wasn&#x27;t going to work with my hard to curl hair type, I was at least going to know what I was getting into.  </li>
            <li> it sucks in the hair and walah</li>
            <li> People have complained about getting their hair stuck.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> BUT the curl lasts three days at least in my hair.....</li>
            <li> , I knew something was wonky, the box looked &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The wonky Amazon one was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do NOT listen to the negative reviews and if you buy it, READ THE DIRECTIONS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hurried and unplugged it, but it was to late.  </li>
            <li> is use your common sense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a ton of negative results and I don&#x27;t understand why.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews stop you from buying this.</li>
            <li> Even in humidity may hair will stay wavy for at least 2 days (haven&#x27;t tried to go beyond that).  </li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars or negative stars if I could.</li>
            <li> star is generous, they should have negative stars.</li>
            <li> The hair that was stuck was a bit tangled and fried from the iron, but at least I didn&#x27;t have to cut it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying don&#x27;t be frightened away by the negative reviews you might read.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let those negative reviews scare you.</li>
            <li> I do have to say it is a bit confusing to use.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks it in and spins it for a set amount of seconds and</li>
            <li> By the time I got home and tested it, Amazon said it was too late for me to return it</li>
            <li> too late to.return</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained about hair getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Please DO NOT believe the negative comments and buy the product, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I never listen to negative comments and tried the product myself.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to do curls in a humid climate because by the time when you reach the last curl you feel exhausted and sweating.</li>
            <li> about the negative feedbacks about tangling your hair?</li>
            <li> My hair is medium length and thick.</li>

            <li> Release the handle and slowly pull it out.</li>
            <li> It sucked my hair in, did the slow beeps</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this product is not for you.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t  use with a  thick strand of hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too thick, nappy, or tangled.</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward at times since you have to use your right hand, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I did it a little sloppy and it beeped at me to redo it</li>
            <li> My hair does not hold curls due to my very thick head of hair, but man, you see what&#x27;s happening!</li>
            <li> Although it did take me some time to do my hair as mine is very thick and there is a lot of it and you have to use a small piece of hair to curl at a time, otherwise it gets tangled inside the chamber and can be hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Well I was a little disappointed with the 12 second curl.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it take both of us to try to use it, it is difficult!  </li>
            <li> I mean everything.</li>
            <li> I mean *</li>
            <li> and i do mean</li>
            <li> I mean my arms were shaking</li>
            <li> You do not drive a car when you are drunk or impaired for any other reason.</li>
            <li> It takes a few strands of hair, before you figure out just how you want to make each curl, loose or tight  Hate the cost, however  the quality of the product justifies the purchase.</li>
            <li> She used a few times not impressed for price :/</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair, shoulder length, and usually use a curling iron, also bought from N.America.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy long.</li>
            <li> But Have To Take Very Small Sections &amp; Still</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical when it comes to curling products since I already have 3 of them in different styles</li>
            <li> When we did get it to work (on very small sections of hair)</li>
            <li> In order to use this she had to pull out very small amount of hair or it would not curl.  </li>
            <li> Even woth very small sections</li>
            <li> then it turns off have to wait until it cools down to use it again not good purchase!!!!:</li>
            <li> So you seriously have to section off</li>
            <li> It is shocking to come home from an event hours later and have my curls intact, especially without use of any styling sprays or products.  </li>
            <li> We all thought it to be a ridiculous tool.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive thru you than at retail stores, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> after I had curled my hair, I still had some serious beachy waves without any mousse or spray.  </li>
            <li> and I did have two serious hair-stuck-in-the-machine-and-burning snarls before I worked out how to avoid this.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> And the curls just looked ridiculous</li>
            <li> This is a lot of money for a less then mediocre curling iron.</li>
            <li> All other fluffy hair, which will come on the way will be tangled and sometimes it is painful.</li>
            <li> On the downside, I must admit, it is a little bit scary when your hair gets tangled</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s a little difficult to get my hair out.</li>
            <li> When (not if) your hair does snag, it can be a little frightening trying to get your hair out before it burns.</li>
            <li> This thing is a little creepy.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I have to admit I was a little skeptical...</li>
            <li> And when it does (when it goes in the chamber wrong, or a little tangled) it immediately realeses my hair, before any damage happens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was horrible my hair got stuck in it the first time I tried using it!</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time getting my hair to take curl (thin</li>
            <li> It was only time before once again, the hair got stuck, and bad.</li>
            <li> caught\\&quot; and give bad reviews because your incompetent at following directions.</li>
            <li> BAD FOR YOUR HAIR, DID NOT EVEN OPEN IT AFTER I READ THE REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too bad they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> She is a preschool teacher by day and a blues singer with her band, No Good Sister, by night</li>
            <li> I was never good at curling my hair and</li>
            <li> All of the poor reviews are because people don&#x27;t use it properly or because they&#x27;re reviewing the wrong effing item (yes, I&#x27;m talking to you, lady who thinks this was the babyliss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and uncomfortable to hold....</li>
            <li> Not good at all on my shoulder length hair..would not recommended.</li>
            <li> Curls are sad and limp.</li>
            <li> cause very scary tangles that are very difficult to remove from the hot iron without breaking off.  </li>
            <li> You do need to careful not to overload it or hold it incorrectly or it will painfully eat up your hair and refuse to release it without very firm tugs.  </li>
            <li> even when I received it I was  afraid to put my hair through a contraption like this curling iron due to the reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> have not experienced any serious entanglements.</li>
            <li> Hate it - takes too  long and is very heavy to hold  </li>
            <li> caught-- DUH!</li>
            <li> Its probably because I&#x27;m frustrated by how long it takes</li>
            <li> AND it is THICK!  </li>
            <li> it was very very hard to get out once its stuck.</li>
            <li> This was very hard to use.</li>
            <li> this is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> it is very hard to use.</li>
            <li> In reality, it&#x27;s not that bad, just need a firm pull on the thing and usually the hair comes out.</li>
            <li> Also, I have carpal tunnel and after about half my head, my wrist starts to go numb.</li>
            <li> I bought this curler as a gift for my daughter who also has tough hair to curl.</li>
            <li> I have a medium length course very thick hair and even with my hair this curler made my hair curl</li>
            <li> She likes the concept, but has very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> my hair is about shoulder length and VERY thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick hair, so I tried it on her this morning for school.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, dry,fuzzy shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> it felt a little awkward to hold but</li>
            <li> I googled and googled and couldn&#x27;t find a review of the Curl Secret of anyone with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I received the Curl Secret as a gift.</li>
            <li> Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and it didn&#x27;t even think about curling my hair.</li>
            <li> It felt broken, like it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be that way.</li>
            <li> bought the Conair Infinit Pro Curl Secret for my daughter.</li>
            <li> this Curl Secret thing.</li>
            <li> and we had worse problems.  </li>
            <li> the Conair Infiniti Pro Curl Secret I bought in this store?</li>
            <li> Was a bit skeptical because of some negative reviews, but for me it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Use the cleaner that came with your curl secret.  </li>
            <li> My hair was released by the Curl Secret with ease.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re in for a real treat when you realize the awful mistake you made with putting in the piece</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments when I curl my hair with the Curl Secret.  </li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to try this product as I had poor results using the Beachwaver</li>
            <li> (problems with tangling, ends burning up, poor curl).</li>
            <li> And the amount of crap in my hair is just gross.</li>
            <li> and I took the photos after using the Curl Secret and then going out for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I order Infiniti pro curl secret by Conair and you sent me some thing else named curl matic automatic curl machine.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I can tell you, after testing it, that the product Infinit Pro by Conair Curl Secret Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> She curled my hair with the curl secret.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair</li>
            <li> kinda heavy and awkward to use, but</li>
            <li> But I will admit, before the Curl Secret</li>
            <li> section before sticking it in the Curl Secret hoping that would help prevent my hair from getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair is shoulder length which makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> Another &#x27;secret&#x27;-</li>
            <li> She said that it was messy dangerous and not curly.  </li>
            <li> My arm gets tired</li>
            <li> Curl Secret has changed all of that.  </li>
            <li> soon as I got my Curl Secret</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t Evan work  was delivered broken</li>
            <li> secret curls my hair and takes away the frizz.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> She also accused me of lying, so I had to shut her up with the video clips we recorded of the process as well as the still images of my hair stuck on their poorly designed</li>
            <li> Not with the curl secret.</li>
            <li> I saw the Conair Curl Secret on a home shopping show and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> gave it a try and used the Curl Secret on the lowest settings.  </li>
            <li> At least it wasn&#x27;t difficult to return it.</li>
            <li> To make it worse, there are no refunds on this product.</li>
            <li> the curl secret was going to move up to her head and burn her.</li>
            <li> my arms were getting tired.  </li>
            <li> I have not personally experienced problems but have heard instances where it had.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy the Curl secret from Amazon..</li>
            <li> but i also wasnt brushing it before putting it in the curl secret.</li>
            <li> Thus began the breakdown of Curl Secret #1.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would buy another Curl Secret in a heartbeat ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the curl secret for over a year.</li>
            <li> but I did end up cutting it out, while silently crying at the time.</li>
            <li> I unplugged the curl secret immediately and basically had to rip her hair out.  </li>
            <li> decreased my hair prep time from over an hour to 25mins.  </li>
            <li> Was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I can always send it back when I hate it.</li>
            <li> and it also falsely advertises that your guaranteed not to get tangled.</li>
            <li> Also, the handle was very difficult to push down for some reason.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to, it will make mean noises at you if you&#x27;re using it wrong, so you just take your hair out and start again.</li>
            <li> I waited to buy this due to some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Any way I tried the curls wouldn&#x27;t last longer than an hour if I didn&#x27;t use a very questionable, not to mention dangerous, amount of hair spray.</li>
            <li> still curly (albeit sloppy bed-head curls).  </li>
            <li> If you are sloppy, then don&#x27;t try it.  </li>
            <li> Did not beautiful curls and pinned my hair in the machine.</li>
            <li> I know that others have complained about their hair getting caught in the device, but I feel like it would be really difficult to get it SO caught that you&#x27;d be forced to resort to cutting it out.</li>
            <li> It feels uncomfortable carrying a heavy curler on one hand, and two hands is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and going to still with old faithful curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing for over $100 spent on this product.</li>
            <li> The tool is a little weighty, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> terrible product as far as results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m eager to curl my hair with this than those boring old curling irons.</li>
            <li> Worse thing is that it is expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this Curl Secret machine and it is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I was randomly walking through Belks and saw the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret on their clearance table (by accident, but I argued and they honored the $47 price)</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about the curl secret by Conair</li>
            <li> This must be the worst purchase experience so far.</li>
            <li> IT DEFINITELY IS HARD ON YOUR HAIR WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE TOOL!!</li>
            <li> If you use this device properly you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not sure how one could tangle their hair so badly..</li>
            <li> Too heavy, very clumsy and NO CURLS!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars because I had curls done around my hair in less than 20 minutes and the idiot proof method the product itself has prevents your hair from being in tangled with beeps.</li>
            <li> I am very, very disappointed that Amazon will not take this product back as if I purchased it at Walmart, Target, etc</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful contraption - tangles up hair and burns it when it gets stuck - sending it back</li>
            <li> it is totally fake</li>
            <li> It will stop rolling the hair and beep to let you know something is wrong and</li>
            <li> noticed that she twisted my hair a bit before she inserted in to the curler</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tell anyone your secret!  </li>
            <li> but she just did it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was Skeptical just like everyone else.</li>
            <li> Its horrible, it got stuck in my hair numerous times (and</li>
            <li> with curl secret it takes me about an hour!</li>
            <li> It IS BECAUSE YOU USED IT WRONG.</li>
            <li> I do not expect salon results and know how difficult my hair can be</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and thought it might pull out chunks of hair when it &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; in the hair.</li>
            <li> Then, I leave the house and two hours later, it looks like a horrible attempt at curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It was a nightmare trying to get the hair out, all the while smelling burning hair and unable to get the hair released.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry, what&#x27;s wrong with you Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> they sometimes just did a weird wave, which I think was because of the way I was holding it.</li>
            <li> As it sucked my hair into the machine I could tell something was wrong, it was not sucking it in evenly.</li>
            <li> Also, if you feel your hair pulling the wrong way in the barrel, the machine WILL stop itself, but you&#x27;ll feel it even before that machine beeps</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped doing that</li>
            <li> but I found it tedious to learn to use.</li>
            <li> and I must&#x27;ve selected the wrong setting because they fell out within 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> he product has come defective, it aspires to the hair inside and burning the hair is horrible, I even think this product is counterfeit, wanted to know what you want so that I will receive my money back?</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say ALL of the bridesmaids want to purchase one.</li>
            <li> That must be fake because my hair turned out floppy with random parts puffed out</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how expensive this is.</li>
            <li> If your hair is getting stuck, then you are holding it the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> Tedious but works well.</li>
            <li> broke and made it useless.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> Difficult to manage it</li>
            <li> This item has proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> WARNING my daughter put her hair in the wrong</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to give it a chance, but alas!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> so sorry I bought this  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always bored with it.  </li>
            <li> difficult to you, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find it that difficult to use...  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced something like this before!</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret is a miracle for my hair!</li>
            <li> If you just release the pressure on the handle and then repress it without releasing the hair, it will roll up further and get horribly snarled in the chamber.</li>
            <li> Expensive bought for my daughter because she couldn&#x27;t figure out what she wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Really wrong.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about this product but decided to take a chance.</li>
            <li> i loveeeeeeeee the curl secret !</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this tool.  </li>
            <li> I should have known something was wrong when the cashier at the store told me &amp;#34;Hold on to your receipt if you need to bring this back&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> watch YouTube videos, if you&#x27;re skeptical.</li>
            <li> but when  i tried it myself almost an hour to make my hair curly, it&#x27;s so difficult.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t blow it out, it looks like a didn&#x27;t comb it and slept on it wrong, but it is neither wavy or curly.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use and quit rolling up the hair.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to get out</li>
            <li> Product was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using the curl secret because I have never found anything that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Uuugh I hate to waste money!</li>
            <li> I hate using curling irons because for me it&#x27;s hard to do, and I&#x27;m always scared of burning myself.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, pulled the hair, awkward.</li>
            <li> Whoever gets their hair caught in it and has to have the product taking apart by their husband with a screw driver as I read in one negative review is an idiot.</li>
            <li> Are you sick &amp; tired of hearing the overused term \\&quot;AMAZING\\&quot;, just like I am?  </li>
            <li> I lost a strand of hair due to this terrible machine!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this curling iron  definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth the insane price.</li>
            <li> I read the directions thoroughly, because let&#x27;s face it - this thing looks a little terrifying and conjures memories of getting my hair wrapped up in a spiral brush as a kid.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid it would burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Then I stumbled across this crazy gadget.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.   </li>
            <li> I started to see smoke while I was trying desperately to pull out my hair from the chamber</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY UNHAPPY.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to give myself beach waves but using a curling wand is dangerous and takes forever.</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> SO WE COULD DESPERATELY GET MY HAIR OUT.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel awkward anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried for an hour to get it out without cutting it but couldnt.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this because of the comments people have made about their hair getting stuck in this device.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too risky and dangerous</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward to use until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid after some reviews</li>
            <li> but it is not that dangerous.</li>
            <li> This was quite painful and frightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;she is crazy about the curlong process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HATE this poorly designed curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo mad</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Weird!</li>
            <li> IT WAS REALLY SCARY &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> , sorry there is nothing they could do - they recommended me to pull out one strand of hair at a time!</li>
            <li> Its a mad rush to reverse and unplug before permanent damage</li>
            <li> Sorry, it does not work for me!</li>
            <li> I also burned my thumb  badly and had to put cold water towels on her head to try not to burn it</li>
            <li> Even after reading all the reviews I was VERY skeptical and thought I would be returning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get any curls.</li>
            <li> I would imaging trying to curl wavy or frizzy hair would be very difficult.</li>
            <li> Very scary sinc</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to curl  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this for my daughter for christmas</li>
            <li> This device is advertised as being impossible to malfunction when pulling hair into the chamber.  </li>
            <li> they argue that this is impossible.</li>
            <li> Because i&#x27;m in China,it&#x27;s impossible for me to return it.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s seriously IMPOSSIBLE to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Impossible to curl with just about anything, excluding overnight foam curlers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawback--it&#x27;s expensive! :(</li>
            <li> bad:</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really bad is</li>
            <li> I too bought this even though some of the bad reviews had me concerned about hair getting stuck.  </li>
            <li> my hair got tangled so bad in it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always been bad with hair tools.</li>
            <li> So bad.</li>
            <li> This is a BAD KNOCK OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> feel bad for the multitude of customers who have burned their hair in this unit.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the unit was bad.  </li>
            <li> and my hair got damaged really bad..</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck in it so bad</li>
            <li> bad.</li>
            <li> Umm....... this was just a bad idea.</li>
            <li> So I paid about $100 to see how bad this product works.</li>
            <li> I read ALL the reviews--good and bad.</li>
            <li> really bad at it....</li>
            <li> before and on her bad days i can even do it for her.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked.</li>
            <li> I used it Christmas eve and my cousin who is a hair dresser was shocked my hair looked so curly.  </li>
            <li> but where I want them to go, leaving me frustrated and with crappy &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated and about to give up on anything resembling effort when it came to the styling of these luscious locks.</li>
            <li> Maybe this \\&quot;trick\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a secret, but as someone who is terrible at doing hair, I thought it was a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Grrrr</li>
            <li> I was frustrated trying to style them.  </li>
            <li> I was so frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t duplicate the look at home.</li>
            <li> , the Curl Secret has this fancy &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; indicator that basically tells you &amp;#34;Hey idiot!</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the simplicity of this tool.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> GO FOR IT, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do curl on my hair so disappointed.</li>
            <li> dollars for any hair thing is crazy!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed because it did NOT curl anything at all.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> She said she was greatly disappointed it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s easy to use and the curls last for days. I don&#x27;t even use spray. My hair always falls out of curls when I use a regular curling iron, but this stays all day.</li>
            <li> I returned it because I did not like the smell when I was doing the curl.  It did curl the hair but I was afraid it would burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work waste of money.  Your hair gets all tangled in it .  Total waste</li>
            <li> The perfect tool to make curls!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Great! First time I can get a curly hair for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am super clumsey and messy. THIS, ladies, is the solution to all your problems :). IT IS AWESOME. Read the instructions to know how to use it and you will have no problem. If you have a problem using it then you are not doing it right.</li>
            <li> works great, curls hold longer</li>
            <li> Wire too short. Not possible to choose which side to turn.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable product.</li>
            <li> Even after reading all the reviews I was VERY skeptical and thought I would be returning. NO WAY could you pry this out of my hands at this point. Took some getting used to and it does take a long time because I have a lot of hair, its thick, and its long. So took prob 45 minutes to do all my hair but it stayed almost perfect for 3 days and by day 5 looked like beachy waves. I have very dry hair so I only wash every 3-5 days. Now when I curl it using this, I can go about 5 days. Miracle! SO happy I bought it and will likely be giving for presents this year.</li>
            <li> very good item . very good seller .</li>
            <li> I really suck at doing my hair.. Never being able to curl my own hair with curl iron but this one is awesome that it does it for you! A few that could be better are; 1) taking more hair - it only takes a small amount of hair and 2) an option to make curl bigger (it&#x27;s my preference since I don&#x27;t want too curly). But I have to say, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Works great just wish you take bigger sections of hair though.</li>
            <li> What voltage of equipament?</li>
            <li> Bought for my gf for xmas.  She still loves it.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly to curl hair that has been somewhat to curl.  My girls love it too because it&#x27;s so easy to use and the effects are very stylish.  Heats up quickly and gives you flexibility for tight or loose curls.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  You need a bit of practice but after my first try I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I love this curling device! I have extremely thick hair and it took a very long time but the results were awesome and I received compliments from total strangers!  On the downside, I must admit, it is a little bit scary when your hair gets tangled so please follow the instructions carefully and only attempt to do very small sections of your hair at a time, trust me, the results are worth it!  A method that worked well for me, but which also took time, was to twist my hair up tightly in each section about 2 inches from the root and using the twisted section to place inside the open device and then clamping it closed. I think that this method allowed the curler to have ample space to evenly wrap the strands of hair and prevented tangles.placing sections that are too thick or having stray pieces of hair that falls outside the boundaries of the curler cause very scary tangles that are very difficult to remove from the hot iron without breaking off.  Also, since my hair is very thick and very long, I left it in the closed iron for about 20 seconds, anything less provided a loose, inconsistent curl.  I can&#x27;t tolerate not washing my hair but I decided to use dry shampoo on my hair the next day so the curls lasted two days without any hairspray or additional product.If you use this device properly you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! I was skeptical but it really does work! Loved it!</li>
            <li> my hair is super thick and won&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> Love the way it curls my hair! Easy to use</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves it. Just have to follow the directions and perfect curls all the time.</li>
            <li> this is poop. don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Awful contraption - tangles up hair and burns it when it gets stuck - sending it back</li>
            <li> Works great on my little girls.  My hair is too long and thick.  I&#x27;m not willing to spend hours curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Curl Magic. It makes a consistantly great shaping curl.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!! I followed the directions carefully but my hair got tangled inside. It was a terrible experience as it was stuck on my head for about an hour. I spent at least half of that time on the phone with Conair as they went step by step to get it unstuck. Nothing worked. Wound up calling a friend who smashed it to pieces with a hammer ( still stuck on my head). A very painful experience. Had to cut my hair about 2 inches from my scalp above my ear. I haven&#x27;t cut my hair other then trimming the ends since 1988 so you can imagine my heartache. Please do not buy this! It should be taken off the market. Conair obviously knows it&#x27;s a problem as they had a protocol in place to try to help when customers called in.</li>
            <li> There are no words to describe how much I love the Pro Curl Secret.  I have shoulder length wavy fine hair. The Pro Curl&lt;br /&gt;Gives my hair added body and beatiful wringlets to beatiful waves. Takes about 15 minutes to curl.  I have not had any problems with getting my hair caught it it. You need to make sure you have a well parted piece of hair when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;The price at Amazon is also fantastic</li>
            <li> Can it be used by someone with one arm? I had cancer when I was younger and had my left arm amputated, that being said there are many products I can&#x27;t use. However, I&#x27;ve wanted this product for so long. I only wish there were more products I was able to use it would be nice to do something with my hair other than letting it simply dry.</li>
            <li> It truly does make perfect shiny curls! love it! it takes long to use because you have to use such thin strands, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It was okay but the curls did not come out natural looking/how I like it.</li>
            <li> I dont know how to curl my hair for crap with curling irons. I always have to use the spongy things that go in your hair. Until this thing. Holy moly I dont really have to do much. Yet it makes me feel like a pro because the curls come out so well. Its pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would take my hair because its naturally really wavy and a little frizzy yet it turned out great.</li>
            <li> I loved it.. Thank you for the excellent quality of the product I want to buy from you again</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret is the first &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; tool I&#x27;ve used that actually lived up to the hype. After carefully reading the reviews (Pros: It&#x27;s life-changing!, Cons: Your hair will be torn out in flaming chunks) I decided to give it try. I have fine, straight hair that falls to around my shoulder blades, and it has been my mother&#x27;s lifetime grievance that it refuses to hold a curl - not even when threatened with copious amounts of hairspray, mousse, or gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have included pictures of the first time I used the Curl Secret. The curls stayed all day with no hairspray or any other product.I love the volume and texture I get with the Curl Secret, and I have received many compliments on my hair since I started using it.I will say that you MUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. The Curl Secret will not abide more than 1inch of hair in the feeder, nor will it accept hair that is not brushed. You WILL experience some tangling with the Curl Secret, but don&#x27;t panic, if you have brushed the hair beforehand it should slide without any issue. For this reason I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this tool for younger girls since they might not handle this type of tangle well.&lt;br /&gt;My overall verdict is to follow the directions and enjoy some miraculous results!</li>
            <li> A huge hit! After giving to one daughter for Christmas, and then her demonstrating/trying it out on other females at the gathering they all wanted one! I would have a great idea for next Christmas but I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t wait that long to get one. Wonderful product that works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing product...works well</li>
            <li> I was kind of nervous at first thinking this thing would pull my hair up into it as it curled, but this thing was amazing. I did my whole head in about 10 minutes with beautiful curls.Never one did the thing pull my hair or pull out strands.  I&#x27;m a busy mom and this thing just gave me style again for the first time in years. very easy to use and makes great curls!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I asked for one for Christmas this year and I read lots of reviews beforehand. I had no trouble figuring it out right away. My hair is medium length and thick. Only slight thing is you must do 1 inch pieces. But worth it. I did feel my hair start to tangle once but I opened the chamber and it dropped my hair immediately.  My curls stayed over 24 hours with no product. I love this. Great for moms on the go!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite purchases of 2014.  However, it is extreeeeeeemely important to follow the instructions.  If you make sure that all of your hair is seated down in the groove of the curler, then you will have perfect curls every time.  When I would get in a hurry or put too much hair in there, then it would birdsnest every time.  Only use if you have the time to do it.  Rushing through is the perfect recipe for a mess!</li>
            <li> happy with the product</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I googled and googled and couldn&#x27;t find a review of the Curl Secret of anyone with my hair type. So I decided to give it a shot myself. This is for anyone who walks into a hair salon with an explanation that typically starts off with &amp;#34;It&#x27;s complicated,&amp;#34; before you even bother to sit in the stylist&#x27;s chair and waste their time and yours. (And your money.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to explain. My hair is long, super thick, and naturally curly.  It&#x27;s GIGANTIC when I go natural. Enormous and difficult to manage on a daily basis.  So I usually wear it straight with a slight curl. I use a Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium set on 40 to straighten it and a Hot Tools curler with a marcel grip to curl. (Yes, it takes forever.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Curl Secret, I laughed to myself and rolled my eyes in contempt. Nice product. If your hair is not like mine. I wanted to give Miracurl a try, but I&#x27;m not dropping $300 plus on something that may or may not work. I received the Curl Secret as a gift. I didn&#x27;t buy it because I figured it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, blah, blah, blah. (I assumed it was your average piece of hair garbage.) Tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m stunned that it worked as well as it did. Could it be hotter and use a few extra seconds for my hair?  Sure. But overall, I was incredibly impressed. And that is extremely rare when it comes to any hair product.  I ABHOR selfies. (Props to those who have mastered the art of selfie.) But no one was around to take before/after photos. So yeah. Curl Secret. I&#x27;m shocked. Pleasantly I might add. Took a while to get the hang of it. But  it may be worth it once I get the process down. Hope this helped anyone whose hair story usually begins with, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s complicated.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So easy to use! Love the curls it puts in my hair! But have a hard time doing the back part of my head!</li>
            <li> was a present for my granddaughter, she loved it</li>
            <li> This is the golden gem of hair tools!! I have fairly long thick hair. Curling my hair used to take about 2 hours and I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the result. This curling iron takes only 45 minutes and looks great. The heat is perfect and can give those tight or big curls. It really is several steps above the rest and totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> The parts that are too high to curl usually end up pretty frizzy and once the curl is made, you obviously can&#x27;t brush it. Still working on a way around this</li>
            <li> My daughters pooled their money and bought this contraption, I didn&#x27;t join in because I wasn&#x27;t going to be involved in spending that much for a hair curler especially when we already have enough hair curling machines to stock the appliance section of a beauty store. Well, they bought it and....I use it just as much as they do. Maybe more. We all have long to medium length hair, on the fine side. I definitely agree with other reviewers who say it takes awhile to get the hang of using this, but once you do it really does work well. If the hair is sectioned up and small sections curled at a time just about anyone can achieve a full head of massive curls. If someone is looking for a more relaxed tousled look, that can be achieved too. Either way it&#x27;s helpful to section off the hair. Hairy that&#x27;s flying around with a lot of static might make this a bit harder to use, so on the days my hair has extra static I try and get that under control with a little bit of water first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite doing most of the work, this curler isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;time saver&amp;#34;. The hair still has to be sectioned off and curled, however because the curler times each curl what this curler does do is take the guess work out of the whole process. This curler also eliminates the &amp;#34;twist and hold&amp;#34; action other curlers require and that alone is a benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some main points:&lt;br /&gt;- This curler can be downright scary the first time using it. It draws the hair into it very quickly - and if someone&#x27;s natural reaction is to hold onto the end of the section of hair being curled, well that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s going to get stuck. So resist that natural reaction and let go of the end of the hair as soon as the curler is clamped onto the hair. Whoosh, the hair is drawn quickly in and curled. No tangles, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;- The curler is clearly labeled as to which side should be facing the head.&lt;br /&gt;- After the hair is drawn in the curler makes spaced apart short, high pitched &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34;while the hair is being curled. Once the curl is done it switches to a series of &amp;#34;beep beep beep beeps&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s the time to release the hair. Be sure to listen to these, the timing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;- IF hair becomes tangled in the curler, unplug it and ease out the tangled hair. Usually this has happened because the section being curled is too wide, or the end of the section of hair was being held onto too tightly when the curler was drawing the hair in.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s fairly heavy, something to consider for anyone who doesn&#x27;t/can&#x27;t hold up a fairly heavy hair curler.&lt;br /&gt;- Because it&#x27;s heavy, and gets hot, and spins, just as with any curling appliance it shouldn&#x27;t be used by young kid. That seems to be obvious, but because this appliance looks so easy to use it might be tempting to hand it over to a young kid to use. Don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: curl the hair.  Each curl is timed perfectly, and it does the work of rolling up the hair and timing the curl. The more we use it the more we like it. I gave it four stars because of the price - this is a pricey item. Even though it does a great job curling hair I&#x27;m still skeptical about the high price. It&#x27;s the kind of product that in a couple years will be still selling well but at half the current price. Then again, at the rate these are being sold they just might keep the price high.</li>
            <li> This works amazing for the curling iron impaired, which I am.  Yes my hair does get stuck in it sometimes but it is really no big deal.  I could never accomplish this on my own with a traditional curling iron.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a super neat product!  I used it for the first time tonight, and of course I got my hair stuck in it, twice.  For long hair, don&#x27;t try to curl more than 1/2 inch at a time!  The curl however is very nice, and using this was almost effortless!</li>
            <li> dont even try.. it does not work at all.. i bought 2 and both dint work.. it is totally fake</li>
            <li> Perfect and easy to do!</li>
            <li> You can thank Ellen Degeneres for my purchase at Target. I saw her do a demo on her show and decided that it was something that I could use. It works just like it&#x27;s supposed to! Tried it on several other women&#x27;s hair and it worked on their type of hair and texture as well. It keeps the curl for a long time. The best was when I tried it on my 14 year old granddaughter who was very skeptical. She has hair down to her lower back and was concerned that her hair would get tangled in the curling iron. I didn&#x27;t put too much hair in and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> my kid love it and use it by herself. very easy to use and ergonomically well designed.</li>
            <li> I have used all three products out there and this one is not too different from the baby bliss or instyler tulip, except with the Conair Infiniti you can only go one direction in curling your hair which is a real downside in comparison to its competition. I have had my hair caught in all three of them and I think its more user error, if you to stick to large of sections in it they will get tangled, and stuck and your hair will burn a bit. I do love the way the curls looks so I did keep going and as you keep doing it you learn the exact amount to put in your hair. I still find it hard to do the back of my hair and get it in right without it getting stuck. As far as price it can be found for the same price as the instyler tulip and I would choose the tulip over this one as you can see your hair in it and it gives you direction options for your curl and you can alternate the directions and the amount of curl you want. The babybliss works just as good as tulip but is much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get your hair stuck a few times with this curlers but relax and try smaller amounts. Defiantly take your time this isn&#x27;t a quick hairstyler!</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  It works!!! No more burns.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Buying one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Like many others I have NEVER been able to curl my hair. I could use an entire bottle of hairspray and the curls would still fall out an hour later! Ugh. I had seen the commercial for the Curl Secret, as well as YouTube videos, and finally I saw a friend use one and that was it. I went to Walmart and bought it! I&#x27;ve only had it since yesterday but I&#x27;ve already curled my hair twice with it. The first time it took about 45 minutes to do my whole head. Doing the left side of my head was a little harder because of the way you need to orient the device. The second time I finally had the hang of it and curled my hair in about 30 minutes! Yes, my hair got tangled a few times but it was always my fault. I either had it too close to my head or put way too much hair into the chamber. The curls I did yesterday lasted ALL night. When I woke up in the morning it was still pretty wavy. I love this! Will recommend to all of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish they would fix would be to add a safety feature to open the barrel and remove hair when it gets stuck. I had a problem when I put a big chunk of hair in and it got stuck. No, I didn&#x27;t have to cut my hair or anything but it took a few minutes to get it all out.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THICK HAIR. I bought this because it usually takes me about 30 minutes to curl my hair and I thought that his would cut that time in half. Instead I got my hair stuck in the barrel every time it went inside. So again, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 5 year old granddaughter....she used it a couple of times and worked great....after that it pulls her hair in and won&#x27;t let go....I am very, very disappointed that Amazon will not take this product back as if I purchased it at Walmart, Target, etc, I would be able to a least get a credit to purchase something else. This is very disappointing for over $100 spent on this product.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old grandaughter received this as a Christmas gift a year or two ago. She used it herself and her hair looked so great I bought one for myself.  You separate a strand of hair, comb through it, then place the part of the strand closest to you head, not the end of the hair, into the slot of the device. The little hot roller inside the machine will roll your hair up into the round part of the device until the whole strand is inside. It then beeps at 3 different intervals so you can take it down at the same beep for consistant curls through out your hair. There are also different levels of heat. The longer you leave your hair in the device the tigher the curl. The sooner you take it down, the looser the curl. You can&#x27;t get impatient and try to put too much hair in at one time. It will stop rolling the hair and beep to let you know something is wrong and your must start that strand again. I have long thick wavy hair and it takes me about 15 min to do my whole head. I use the highest heat, let each strand down after the first beep, let curls cool, then comb out my hair with only my fingers for the &amp;#34;beach wave&amp;#34; look. Or you can leave the hair in for all 3 beeps, don&#x27;t comb or brush, and have long tigher curls. It&#x27;s not really hard but does take some practice with the machine and practice to figure out what gives you the look you want. When I first started using it, I did get my hair tangled up inside the device. If this happens I turn the hair curler off and gently tug on my hair to unroll it out of the device. I have found that the times this has happened it was becaus I wasn&#x27;t being careful, I was trying to rush, I was trying to put too much hair in, or I wasn&#x27;t separating the sections of hair away from the rest of the hair allowing strays to roll up into the curler too. I love this thing and the curls would last 3 -4 days if I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair every other day. Sometimes on day 3, I can put a small amount of dry shampoo around my hairline andjust do a few touch up pieces of hair on the top. I also use a small amount of mousse or whatever I&#x27;ve got on hand to make styles last longer.</li>
            <li> Work fine and do the job.</li>
            <li> Bought this product Saturday, and it was a mistake. I&#x27;ve tried it multiple times with NO results. My hair is thin and it didn&#x27;t even think about curling my hair. There was a limp curl that went flat immediately. I have to return it, and I would not recommend buying this product!!</li>
            <li> this curling iron is awesome!  works awesome and hair doesn&#x27;t stick in it at all!! very easy to use on yourself!</li>
            <li> Instructions aren&#x27;t that great but it seems to work okay. My daughter has very long thick hair though</li>
            <li> I think that I need longer hair.</li>
            <li> Received quickly. Great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this today, along with a similar curling machine that costs double the price.  I was going to compare and return the one I didn&#x27;t care for, or return both if they didn&#x27;t work on my shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;To start, I will say I had short hair that I have just let grow to an above-the-chin bob.  I wanted to try to do something fun with some all-over curls in my hair for some upcoming events this summer, and I have no patience for curlers or curling irons. So I thought I&#x27;d give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 minutes, I had adorable all-over-the-head curls.  Easy, easy, easy.  Pull a 1&amp;#34; wide piece of hair straight out, put it in the machine, press  the handle down, wait for the beeps, and presto!  Gorgeous spirals.  I saw that some other reviewers had a couple of easy-to-fix hair tangling issues, but it didn&#x27;t happen to me.  I believe it&#x27;s because my hair is much shorter.&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly, this worked better than the $200 model and was half the price.  I returned the other and kept this Conair Infiniti pro. I love it. Makes curling your hair non stressful!&lt;br /&gt;I also think it is worth the $$$.  Saves time and very very easy to use. It will make growing my hair in much easier to deal with!</li>
            <li> I have never posted a review but I had to with this product. I got it the day of my holiday party for work and was nervous to use it but it was great . No hair tangles. My hair is thin and does not hold curls for long but with this product I was able to curl my hair and style it without losing any of the curl . I am just upset that now it is $20 cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sooo mad I waited to buy this due to some bad reviews. I just used it. It is idiot proof. And ohhh the curls. This is my new favorite beauty aid. I wish I knew how to add pics here. Buy it!</li>
            <li> only buy this thing if you want to have your hair ripped out.  I read the reviews and bought one anyway- and lost a huge chunk of my hair, I watched it burn off smoking, while I tried to untangle my hair from the wheel.  DO NOT BUY THIS THING.</li>
            <li> Did not like this.... returned it immediately.  Hair gets tangled.</li>
            <li> Works great once you get the hang of it.  If you have thick hair just use smaller sections.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Only used it once since getting it though.</li>
            <li> Absolutely luv this! I recommend you all buy this, girls only. Such beautiful curls! It makes you look like you went to the salon.</li>
            <li> I really love this thing.  I have very fine straight hair that never keeps a curl, and I&#x27;ve spend $$$ (esp. in the 80s) on perms and curling irons and rollers, and I never ever got what this thing can give me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium short in a bob, so the back, especially the lower back hairs are shorter, (three inches maybe?) so it doesn&#x27;t work that great back there, but everywhere else..works great!&lt;br /&gt;It is a little hard to do the back of my head by myself.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just a spaz, but trying to get the correct side facing my head while looking in the mirror and alligning the hair right...I can&#x27;t do it.  But the rest of my head is easy.&lt;br /&gt;I found that if I just want a nice soft wave, I only hold it in my hair until the second beep.  It comes out really nice and with just some hairspray, I&#x27;m good for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Best curler on the market, just be careful not to get your hair tangled in it because its hard to get it out. Use as it says, small pieces at a time.</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Just saw this product at Best Buy for $20 more than it is listed here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Cosmetologist,  so naturally I was skeptical of this device.  My husband bought it for me for Christmas and after reading the instructions several times and triple checking with online videos I felt that I was ready to give it a try.  I put in the appropriate amount of hair and the first few curls were alright.  Then horror struck.  It sucked in a very important layer and it wouldn&#x27;t come out; I had to sit there and watch my hair smoke and burn free!  It was terrifying! I immediately threw my hair up in a bun after assessing the unfixable damage and returned it to the store immediately.  Not only did that happen; it also breaks various prices during Curling.  Who would want that?!  In the past I have not found a single Conair item that has been decent for safe hair use- and I clearly still can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s safe to say that the device should be recalled for faulty safety precautions- it absolutely does not reverse so the hair can release resulting in severe damage.</li>
            <li> GREAT JUST BE CAREFUL HAIR DOES GET CAUGHT BURNS</li>
            <li> My hair got caught really easily and when it gets caught in a hot iron...it burns. Obviously. No good. Also, the handle was very difficult to push down for some reason. It felt broken, like it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be that way. It gets two stars, though, because the few curls that it did produce were gorgeous.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  It does not work and it got stuck in my daughters hair that we had been growing out for locks of love.  We had to cut it out of her hair after trying to take it apart with out success.  WORST PRODUCT EVER!  I cannot believe that this product is still on the market.</li>
            <li> Best hair curler I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!  I can do my hair in 30 minutes and my daughter&#x27;s hair in about 45 minutes (her hair is much thicker than mine). I did get my hair stuck a few times, but I could tell it wasn&#x27;t curling right so I just opened it up and the hair came right out.  My hair stays curled for the whole day and is still wavy the next day (with No Product in it, at all!!!). I have absolutely No Complaints! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this curler!!!!! I tell everyone how amazing it is!  The pic is</li>
            <li> This is the best ever! Read the instructions take it slow the first time you use watch YouTube videos don&#x27;t try to use big pieces of hair small pieces. I always had to go to the salon to have my hair curled now I can so that 50 an just do it myself. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> It tangled slightly on the first 2 tries, then all went smooth. It is very easy to use and the curls are perfect, every time! I was able to curl everything in a short amount of time. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to 3 people! It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I had this in my Amazon cart for Xmas but when I needed to buy it, it wasn&#x27;t available, so I picked up locally.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Conair Infinit Pro Curl Secret for my daughter. Being the good mama that I am, I decided to test it out to make sure it wasn&#x27;t overpriced gimmicky crap. I am beyond pleased. I am impressed!&lt;br /&gt;I am not gifted in hairstyling. At all. My daughter begs me to curl her hair all the time and we have tried a whole bunch of roller styles and they all have left her disappointed. They&#x27;re a pain to sleep in. They&#x27;re annoying to put in. Invariably, one falls out at night and I&#x27;m stuck trying to fix a chunk of pin-straight hair before the bus comes. Don&#x27;t even get me started on curling irons. I just can&#x27;t do them and get any sort of attractive result.&lt;br /&gt;So this Curl Secret thing. I had seen it and similar things (Another popular hairstyling product maker makes one also) advertised. Thought, if it worked, my daughter would love it.&lt;br /&gt;So, I thought - here goes nothin&#x27;. The directions tell you to section off the hair, make sure it&#x27;s not tangled, etc., etc. I&#x27;d seen a video - didn&#x27;t look like rocket science. I couldn&#x27;t really afford to do my hair according to directions lest I be caught by my girls playing with a Christmas gift so, I didn&#x27;t do anything fancy as far as prep and even still, inside of 20 minutes, I have a head full of soft wavy curls my girl is gonna diiiiiiiie for.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;, Conair!&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: A year later and our Curl Secret is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Really good product, reason why my wife bought this product again for a gift to her sister, the product is as described and the quality according to my wife is really good, but the only issue we found this time is that the price was increased in almost 20 dollars.</li>
            <li> Great gift idea for those who don&#x27;t spend on themselves</li>
            <li> Best curling iron!!!! Very happy with it</li>
            <li> This is a horrible device. The first time I tried to use it the iron refused to release my hair. It kept getting tighter and tighter until it finally tore out a big chunk of hair and left me with a big knot on my head from where it was pulling my hair so hard. It burned my head and more of my hair. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS A GIFT FOR SOMEONE YOU HATE</li>
            <li> My  .  Daughter loves it. Seems to be working well</li>
            <li> This curling device was by far better then the more expensive product &#x27;curl freak&#x27;. I borrowed my friends curl freak before and used it as a test run for buying this product and I got to say conair got this one right!! Conair&#x27;s version is lighter so my hands don&#x27;t tire easily and I had little to no problem with getting perfect curls every time. Some of the negative reviews on this product have me baffled because although yes hair can get stuck rarely this device immediately let&#x27;s go for my and I have medium shoulder length, thick hair. I feel that maybe people with longer hair who tried to have this device curl from close to their scalp might have the issue with too much hair being pulled into the device. I would suggest for super long hair only using the device half way, so just from the middle down you have a nice curl.. Especially if your hair is long and thick. Also there is a certain way you have to hold this device with one special side facing your head, otherwise it does not curl at all.. But the words are printed on the device at what side needs to have your head so there shouldn&#x27;t be too many forgetfulness moments. Overall this tool does it&#x27;s job very nicely and again matches it&#x27;s competitor perfectly</li>
            <li> it was for my daughter but all her girl friends are using it and love it</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons/tools and this is by far the greatest!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use - much safer than many on the market!&lt;br /&gt;I am a total klutz and I can get a full head of curl in 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I had a demo from my hair stylist before I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that she twisted my hair a bit before she inserted in to the curler and this seems to prevent some of the jamming that others have experienced.&lt;br /&gt;For tighter curls, I use smaller sections.&lt;br /&gt;Normally for a formal event I will visit the salon - my next one will be DIY with Curl Secret!</li>
            <li> Love the curls! it&#x27;s easy to use, fun and fast!  Yes I would recommend it! I have fine, fussy and curly red hair.</li>
            <li> wow!  I watched 3 demos of this on you tube to see what it was all about and they all seemed great.  I started scouring the internet for one and got a great deal on one around Christmas.  I used it Christmas eve and my cousin who is a hair dresser was shocked my hair looked so curly.  It has several different settings (hi, med, low) and several different time incriments that it holds your hair in.  I separated my hair up into sections with a hair clip.  Did the under side of my hair first.  It was very easy.  The tool is a little weighty, but not too bad.  My hair is a little longer then shoulder length and took about a half hour to do.  I had a harder time in the back.  I went over a bunch of areas a few times to fine tune it.  Yes your hair does get stuck on occasion, but never stuck enough to not be able to get it out, or to damage it.  I woke up Christmas day and still had a full look, just needed to run over it and tune it up.  I also have EasiHair HD hair extensions that have lost their curl and I tried it real quick on one strand and it seemed like it didn&#x27;t want to curl, but I was in a rush and just wanted to see what it would do.  When I am ready to wear my extensions I will take some time to see what I can do with the Curl secret.  This was just so easy and so cool.  I got a lot of compliments, got called Shirley temple a few times.....it gave me great body!!  This thing rocks!!  It does get hot, but it is designed in a way that their is not likely to burn you.  GO FOR IT, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product. It works as advertised. It is a little bulky, and heavy, but can be managed alone, especially for the front of your head.  It&#x27;s a little harder to do on the back; trying to get the hair into the machine, when you can&#x27;t see it well. Would be more fun to do with a friend.  Following the instructions will keep the hair from snagging in the machine.  It takes a little bit for each curl, so don&#x27;t expect to do your whole head in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t tell anyone your secret!  The curls look so natural.  This thing is the bomb!</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. It got stuck in my hair several times despite the no tangle policy and when I didn&#x27;t get stuck it just heated my hair instead of curling</li>
            <li> My grandma purchased this curling iron for me to use at her house.  We tried it this summer and got my bangs stuck in it.  After much effort we were able to get my hair out, but it was burnt.  I came again this week and we had worse problems.  I had curled half of my hair and the curls were nice.  HOWEVER, after I was about 1/2 done a piece of hair got caught.  After trying to get my hair out on my own I asked my grandma to help.  She spent about 15 minutes trying to get my hair out - which was painful and the curling iron was still hot.  We then got out a screwdriver and removed every screw from the device.  That didn&#x27;t help one bit.  Finally we had to crack the curling iron apart . . . THAT DIDN&#x27;T EVEN HELP!  We then cut through the wires and called the neighbor to come help.  After approximately 1 1/2 hours, much pain, and lost time we did finally untangle the mess and got the hair out of the dangerous rod.  We will also be writing to the manufacturer.  They need some way to safely remove hair since it is so easily tangled in this device.</li>
            <li> My wife love it,  she can curl her own hair professionally. Make sure you read the instructions carefully. The first few curls she thought it was gonna pull her hair out but she just did it wrong. It&#x27;s act very simple. She said it&#x27;s the best and easiest curling iron ever</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool product. My only complaint  is that the curls aren&#x27;t  as tight as I would like. The ends often don&#x27;t get  enough curl. That being  said if you put the same strand through a second time, the curl comes out tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: there is a timer that beeps at you when your hair has been in long enough. It does not tangle your hair, curls your hair faster than a typical iron. Gives nice loose curls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: a touch difficult to use alone because you must face The barrel the same way the whole time which makes it a little  tricky (but not impossible) to do both sides of your head. Long,hair may need two cycles through the barrel.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my hair, want to send it back.</li>
            <li> Curls the hair but the hair will get stuck! Great product though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the fuss over this product. If you are seriously inept at doing hair, it might be worth the price. It by no means matches the quality of a high quality curling iron. I received the product and curled most of my hair without getting any stuck. It is easy to use, but at some point your hair will likely get tangled in the chamber. It happened to me twice, but I attribute that to user error. I&#x27;m not sure if I received a defective product, but mine smelled like burning plastic and constantly the red light would start blinking between curls (indicating it is not hot enough). It is also heavy and cumbersome to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue with this product is the curl it creates. It can only accommodate small amounts of hair, and you cannot curl in the opposite direction (important to create dimension and avoid the &amp;#34;triangle head&amp;#34; look). Overall, the product feels cheap and I worry it damages hair. A high quality curling iron and some practice would be a much better investment.</li>
            <li> This tool is awesome! No more crimped ends. Get just the right amount of curl by removing it after two single beeps or leaving it on for the full three beep timer.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Works ok, takes too long if you have a lot of hair. Does not really work like they show on TV</li>
            <li> Got for 12 yr daughter for christmas. Skeptical spending this much but it works great! Well made! Finally something that works as advertised. Beautiful curls! Just takes a little practice to get used to. She loves it :)</li>
            <li> not so great with really long hair.  my hair got tangled more than once. i gave it to my sister with med length hair and she likes it.</li>
            <li> I just was wondering,is new the Conair Infiniti Pro Curl Secret I bought in this store? Because the device have a risk and had a smell like someone had used, does not smell like new since I already bought a new one for a friend and doing the comparison, this seems to be used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but not good for long hair.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from EBay.com! It&#x27;s really cool cause it gives u a perfect curl,and i don&#x27;t even know how to curl my hair with a regular curler. Im happy I bought this curler. Only bad thing I would say it&#x27;s hard to curl back of your head since you can&#x27;t see to put the hair exactly right into it</li>
            <li> have not been able to use it. I tried few times and it does not even look curl at all or similar to all the videos and commercials in TV.&lt;br /&gt;also it trends to burn hair. Don&#x27;t Like it !!</li>
            <li> Now my teen can curl her own hair instead of me standing there for 20-30 min, she does her own hair up in about ten minutes. I was worried she would tangle hair but she read directions and loves it! And so do i.</li>
            <li> Too early for 5 stars. Just got it and used it twice so far.  No hair tangled in it, no difficulty releasing the curl.  I have chin length hair and it seems easy and safe.  I will follow up as I use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing item! I threw out all of my other curling items and strictly use my curler! Literally 10 minutes on hair gives me amazing results!</li>
            <li> I love it! It requires some practice specially having long hair, I was in panic the first time my hair got stock In it but I after I got some practice it was great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had it tangle my hair.  It has always stopped when I used too much hair.  Heats up really fast.  Curls hold well.  Much easier and better than curlers.</li>
            <li> My best friend bought one of these. I used it and fell in love. She showed me the trick too! Twist your hair before placing the hair section in the chamber! It won&#x27;t get caught or pulled like the other reviews state! Trust me. Best product ever! Of course I had to buy one!</li>
            <li> Horrible product!! Won&#x27;t curl hair at all! Returned it.</li>
            <li> If you read the instructions and make sure to wait for the multiple beeps that indicate it&#x27;s done it works great! Was hesitant to buy at first. But did some research and watched done youtube videos and now i couldn&#x27;t be happier. Makes great curls and gives body and volume to hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is fairly long (below the shoulder), so I used the hottest setting, the longest setting, and very small sections of hair.  My hair curls easily and holds curl well.  This product did NOT work for me.  I went down to a 1/4\\&quot; sections of hair and it still would not curl my hair.  It is possible that I have a bad product, but even so, with the small size of sections I need to use, I can work quicker with a regular curling iron.  I could see a person with thinner hair having success with the tool.  It is a great idea, just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> Works good only on really long hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Was good.&lt;br /&gt;Was a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> Does a great job bug please read the booklet. I did get a small section  caught and it took a while to get it out</li>
            <li> Super heavy, hard to hold, and takes a TON of practice.  Unless you like doing your hair regularly, or use a normal curling iron frequently, you won&#x27;t like it enough to use it.</li>
            <li> ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I absolutly love it. Easy to use...tangling and pulling out my hair was not a problem. Suprisingly fast..did my whole head (and I have thick hair down past my shoulder blades) using teeny tiny sections and still only took about a half hour. Curls last for 2 days nicely..3 days if you want to strech it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this product!!!! My hair is wavy and this makes it look perfectly curly.  2 friends bought one after seeing my hair, which I&#x27;m always getting rave reviews now!  Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use-don&#x27;t be afraid-really, you&#x27;d have to try really hard to hurt yourself with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled and use reasonable sections-large sections of hair get caught up.&lt;br /&gt;Getting &amp;#34;caught up&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t the end of the world, you just gently pull, and voila!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product-unfortunatley, I can&#x27;t keep it a Secret!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice. Then it is a perfect companion for the day hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at Target to give it a trial run and will be returning it tomorrow. I don&#x27;t think the heat settings are hot enough for thick hair (unlike my flat iron that goes to 30; which at that level I still have to go over the hair several times).</li>
            <li> Great product. I can curl my daughters hair in less than 10 minutes and the curls last for  2 days.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like it should. It wouldn&#x27;t hold the hair tight enough to curl it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and I have yet to have my hair get caught or tangled.&lt;br /&gt;Makes curling my thick crazy hair so much easier.  :)</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. I have thin fine hair and it is difficult to style. This curl secret is so cool and it makes my hair curly for hours.</li>
            <li> curls last long and very easy to use... i was very happy with this product and bought another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice. But if you follow the instructions works great and the curls last.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling tool! I have really thick, long hair so it took me about an hour and a half to curl my whole head but it was totally worth it. The girls looked amazing and held all day long. If you have long hair, make sure you curl very small sections at a time. I had to redo several curls because I tried curling too thick of a section. The price is perfect for this item. I can&#x27;t imagine a more expensive one being any better.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! It is easy to use and does that thing to my hair that turns me into a movie star. I have always used a curling iron but this thing is the absolute bomb! What&#x27;s really bad is I bought it as a gift for my daughter but I&#x27;m keeping it. I will have to find her something else. I was a little skeptical because I have long thick hair but even when it would tangle up it was easy to remove. Make sure you have your hair brushed and sectioned and there really isn&#x27;t an issue. Just keep it in until it stops beeping then release it; don&#x27;t pull and wahlah awesome hair with body and volume.</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily with just about everything: hot rollers, foam curlers, hot sticks, curling irons, wands, flat iron, etc.  BUT, my hair did not do a thing with this device.  Of course, it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t blink until it was ready either, but it was hot when I used it and I gave it a valiant effort.  End opinion: terrible product as far as results.  But, seemed rather easy to use if it had actually worked.</li>
            <li> hair gets tangled in it way to easy - even using small &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of hair - not impressed</li>
            <li> I love this product! So much easier than a regular curling iron and it takes half the time to do my hair.</li>
            <li> My Infiniti pro just arrived and I was so eager to use it! It legitimately works wonders and it only took 30-40 minutes. Even when my hair got tangled it did not hurt because it quickly releases it. I have long thick hair that is usually hard to curl because it tangles easily but I had absolutely no problems with this product!</li>
            <li> Had difficulty at first while getting used to it.  It is a bit tricky till you get the hang of it.  I wish the curls were looser but overall I love it!</li>
            <li> Infiniti pro by conair curl secret is gifted to my friend. She found it very useful for all her requirements.</li>
            <li> Easy to use awesome curls.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;She said - that it was very easy and simple to use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair slightly past shoulder length. I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my own hair with a curling iron and all other curlers have looked unnatural or haven&#x27;t held. When I saw this at the drug store, I decided to give it a try. Upon looking at a few reviews, I learned that it was difficult for many people to use correctly the first time. I watched a few tutorials/reviews on YouTube before giving it a try. I had no problems and I love the results. It does take some patience and I had to curl small sections at a time. If you try to curl too large of a section, the hair will get caught. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this product and I am very glad I took the risk and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> being African American it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair planning to return it.I hope we would work but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should. I love it. So easy. My husband got this for me and it was one of the best gifts ever,</li>
            <li> We had high hopes. The very first curl got stuck. We had to unplug the curler to keep her hair from burning while we spent 5 minutes untangling it. The next two curls resulted in no curl. The next 2 tangled. My daughters hair is very long.&lt;br /&gt;She said a curling iron is way easier.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> I am pretty much a dyslexic when it comes to curling my hair.  My hands go every which way but where I want them to go, leaving me frustrated and with crappy &amp;#34;curls&amp;#34;. This product changed all that. Within about 20 minutes I can have full, bouncy curls that last even until the next day.  What more could you ask for?!  I was given this as a gift, and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever received!</li>
            <li> I trusted this thing and it&#x27;s a load of barnacles.</li>
            <li> love this thing. have used it multiple times, very easy to use and the results are great. it look me about 45 minutes to curl all of my hair. i have thick, waist length hair so i had to break it into smaller sections. have gotten many compliments. found that if your lightly brush after the curl, you get a soft wavy look that also looks nice.</li>
            <li> This device is advertised as being impossible to malfunction when pulling hair into the chamber.  Not true - mine just pulled a large chunk of hair out by the roots and more is tangled in the chamber.  Since I have thin hair to start with, I really didn&#x27;t need a bald spot.</li>
            <li> I have long,thick hair and this is designed for short, fine hair only. It just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair or my daughter in law whose hair is even longer than mine.</li>
            <li> Love this for my 11 year old. Fast at curling her hair but her hair is so long sometImes I have to do the same section of hair twice.</li>
            <li> I am getting better with it every day</li>
            <li> i,m in love with Infiniti Pro by Conair</li>
            <li> Got it for Christmas and used it for the first time today. Was a bit skeptical because of some negative reviews, but for me it worked like a charm. Took a bit getting used to and once I got the hang of it it was simple to use! I did get my hair tangled once, but it didn&#x27;t get stuck and released it easily. That time I wasn&#x27;t holding it perfectly straight, so I&#x27;m thinking as long as you follow directions completely it won&#x27;t tangle. I love it! Gave me amazing curls without having to worry about burning myself like with a regular curler. If you curl your hair I highly recommend this product! Start with the back of your hair if you&#x27;re worried about it tangling and to get used to it and once you get to the front it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li> I received the item on time but it does not work. When I plug it in it just keeps running and running. I can not use it and I will have to return it. It states that this item was new but it seems as if that is not a true statement. I will be returning this for my money back.</li>
            <li> I was curling my friends hair when all of a sudden *beep* *beep* *beep* so I tried to take her hair out as normal. It got caught and started burning.  I called my mom in and she started screaming.  She then snapped the thing in half in order to try to get my friends haor out of the barrel.  I&#x27;m the end we had to cut it off and now she has hideous bangs.</li>
            <li> Great product ... Great Service!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do curl on my hair so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this it is so cool! But my hair did get stuck in it once I had to cut it out! If it weren&#x27;t for that I would have given it a five star</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it but I think you gotta be kinda careful when using this because your hair might get stuck, it happened the first time she used it and it kinda burned her hair, but I suppose if you&#x27;re careful enough (as her sister was) it&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
            <li> i love it too much i love it and it is fit perfect and so nice and i will order more</li>
            <li> It is very very good. It has well job with hair and  nice style with fast work. I like its .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, returned item</li>
            <li> I used this (first time) on my daughter&#x27;s ponytail and it came out really cute. I&#x27;ve posted a photo. It was really easy and I have absolutely no hair styling skills. I think it would be harder on my own head of course. It got a little stuck a few times, but nothing like the reviewers who were saying they had to cut the hair or break open the curler!  I just pulled it out and started again. if I can use this, anyone can. She was really happy with her curly ponytail!</li>
            <li> I too bought this even though some of the bad reviews had me concerned about hair getting stuck.  My daughter has Down Syndrome and sensory wise hates curling irons.  Her hair is fine and hard to hold a curl unless you put ALOT of product, and then it will last an hour tops. So I went on utube and watched the how to videos . This product is real simple to use and as people have said before, if you do it the right way you will not have problems.  Only use an inch of hair at a time and make sure you are facing the open part of the curler to the head.always brush out each piece to make sure there are no snarls. We used no product and the curls held. My daughter loves the look!  Having said that though I used the high settings and it only came out in a loose ringlet curl.  For a tighter curl I would have to use less than an inch of hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so you just have to play with it until you find the right setting for you. I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the price is a little too high.</li>
            <li> Worked fine the first time, but I don&#x27;t use it anymore. Like many others my hair got caught it in so many times and it burnt some of my hair off!!!! You literally have to brush out every tiny amount of hair to perfection right before putting it in. I have pretty thick hair that reaches past my chest and it takes me 2 hours to curl it using this. My suggestion is to buy a curling wand. They work perfect!</li>
            <li> it is a really nice product for ladies who have as same gorgeous hair as I do. it makes hair curly easy as 1,2,3 and result lasts for a long time. totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky but does make beautiful fuels and is ready to use, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this curling iron and I was so excited to try it out. I was only able to do half of my head when I realized that there were several dead ends coming out. After running my fingers through my hair, fistfuls of hair kept coming out and are still coming out a day later. My hair still smells burned, even after washing it.</li>
            <li> This curler shipped to my house and come to find out the plug is a UK plug and does not work in US plugs</li>
            <li> The protect was exactly what it said it will do, one of the best thing I got, very pleased with my choice . They also shipped it on time . Good thing all over.</li>
            <li> Terrible contraption, which was a surprise to me given the Conair name. Plus, I didn&#x27;t realize I would need to pay the shipping to return it. It cost $12 to ship this thing back. Plus the return shipping instructions were elaborate and not that simple to understand. In order to avoid a similar situation, I will not order anything from Amazon again. In the future I will just purchase items from a store where I can return an item without the cost and hassle of shipping it back.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!! I have very thick, long hair and this curled my hair perfectly!! I went to sleep and woke up and my hair was still curly! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Real deal! Came in sealed in the original packaging in brand spanking new conditions!!!</li>
            <li> ruined my hair! horrible product!</li>
            <li> Very easy to curl the hair. But it has to pay attention on the correct side to use it.</li>
            <li> Loved it, works great, long lasting curls!</li>
            <li> I returned this because I could not figure out how to use it without getting my hair in knots. I thought the concept was good, but there are much easier ways to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I lost a strand of hair due to this terrible machine! I followed the instructions very carefully but my hair stuck inside and I had to cut it! I burned myself trying to remove the hair! I&#x27;m MAD.&lt;br /&gt;I return the item and waiting for the refund. I should ask a refund also for my hair.</li>
            <li> I never write Amazon reviews but I had to on this product. It is fairly easy to use (there&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve but once you figure it out it&#x27;s super easy). I recommend this for anyone who hates the curling iron but wants beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing it demonstrated on TV and figured it would be a great alternative to using product in my hair. I&#x27;ve used it only once, but I absolutely LOVE it! My only complaint is that I wish it could do larger sections of hair, as I have extremely thick hair and it took about an hour and a half to do my entire head. However, the curls stayed in all day/night and only started to lose their curl after I&#x27;d slept on them. I HIGHLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> Good quality,  very easy to use.  At first,  might think that it dont heat enough but seems it have to work a little bit  and  after that its okay...My 21 year daugther is very please.</li>
            <li> wished it worked after having to wait 3 weeks to get it</li>
            <li> I have really healthy, but straight hair. My mom got this for my birthday at my request and it took a while to figure out how to get the best results. I really love the well defined, coiled curls this product provides.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Had a little learning curve on which way to hold to have the barrel closest to head, but the curls last all day!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this new way of curling my hair!  At first, I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I saw in the TV ad but I read the directions again: when the timer goes off, I needed to open the curler all the way before pulling down - it made all the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of holding the curler different ways in the mirror, it&#x27;s simple to use.  I recommend using a comb to create small sections of hair at first and then adding more hair until you figure out how wide the curler can handle - the safety sensor is a bit sensitive (which is good since it prevents tangled messes).  I also found that if I use curling clips right after I make the curl and clip it up to my head while I finish curling the rest of my hair, the curls last longer.  I usually do my makeup while the curls are pinned to let my hair cool into position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and sometimes I have to use larger sections of hair in order to produce any amount of curl.  I have shoulder-length hair but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with a shorter than shoulder-length hair style.  You have to have long enough hair for the curler to feed the hair into the mechanism before it can produce any time of a curl - that&#x27;s where it differs from using a tradition curling iron or curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair and have been curling my hair everyday for as long as I can remember.  This is a fun way to get a different look and I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day since it got it about a month ago.  I get a lot of compliments on the curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler is definitely more expensive than the average curling iron or roller set but it works as advertised and produces a pretty look!</li>
            <li> so much easier than using a curling iron. I have long hair and my curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I still hate myself for this purchase.  I have quite long straight hair &amp; have used many different curling methods.  I saw a YouTube &amp; loved the quick looking tumbling waves that it made.  The long story short, it&#x27;s much more satisfying to watch the commercial than to do at home.  My first attempt terrified me because I thought the curler would never dislodge from my head.  The next four attempts had varying degrees of tangles stuck in the appliance.  The motor would turn itself off, &amp; you could try to reverse but mostly you need to pick out the rat&#x27;s nest one strand at a time. The trick is to put a very small amount of hair (like a third of what they do in the commercial) &amp; put hair strand in as parallel as possible.  The quality of the curl once you get it right is good.  The process is much longer than using a curling iron &amp; it is VERY heavy. After the fifth time I used it, I got hair caught again &amp; the motor gave out.</li>
            <li> Bought for the girlfriend for christmas, and her and her daughter both use it all the time. They love how quick it curls hair, just make sure you dont put it in backwards lol its funny</li>
            <li> This definitely does work. I was Skeptical just like everyone else. YOU NEED TO READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS before using it. I was so excited to try it I had just glanced over the instructions and started trying to use it, well I wasn&#x27;t getting any results and was about to give up until I decided to look at the instructions one last time. I had been holding the iron on my hair until it beeped, I thought the beep meant it was done, Nope! You hold it for 5 beeps if you want more defined curls. I tried one more time, this time hold it for 5 beeps and perfect curl! You also have to make sure your hair is brushed PERFECTLY if its not separated and brushed neat it will eat your hair. My hair came out of it pretty easy but I did panic for a second lol. All in all I think this product is great and does what it claims if you take time to read how to use it correctly. It takes a minute to get used to it but once you do you have perfect curls quickly. I gave 4 stars bc I think 100+ dollars for any hair thing is crazy! Mine was a gift, tooooo much money, but great product :)</li>
            <li> Did not perform as I Expected. Time consuming. My daughter felt like her small barrel curling iron was quicker and easier to use. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some but not for us. Returning product today. So far the return policy on prime seems very easy.</li>
            <li> Hated this product.  NOT AT ALL AS EXPECTED.  First it&#x27;s heavy.  Hair got caught up in it.  Didn&#x27;t curl much at all even on high setting.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Watched u-tube video &amp; read instructions first, didn&#x27;t have any problems using first time. Worked great on my shorter fine hair!!!! I have such a hard time doing anything with my fine hair. So excited! :) Will get better with practice.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! It use to take me 40 minutes to do my hair and now I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes. Only bc I have long hair and very thick! I have been showing friends and family and all love to.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to read the instructions, I usually don&#x27;t, but I had to this time!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my daughter to she has very straight hair and it turn out beautiful, my mom has very thin hair and straight and she has beautiful volume for a couple days. I just love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this curler last summer and have had no issues with it, works like a charm.  You&#x27;ll learn how much hair causes it to get stuck, gently pulling hair out has not been an issue if you go from side to side, doesn&#x27;t burn or break hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add:  As of 11/21/15 - again, this one we use only once every 2 or 3 weeks and it continues to work better than any other curing method my girls have tried.  I would definitely recommend this, it&#x27;s just really good at curling hard to curl hair.  Just use little sections of hair and don&#x27;t freak out if it gets tangled, turn it off, gently wiggle the hair out and start over.  You quickly get a feel for it.</li>
            <li> Fun easy to use great product for curling your hair.  It takes a bit of time to get used to how to hold it, how much hair to put in at one time, etc but once you get that down (be a bit patient with yourself), you&#x27;ll love it.  It can give you a tight curl which you can leave &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; or you can brush that tight curl out and just give you full waves.  It you want a flip or some sort-of &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; curl look then this is not the gadget.  Stick with curlers, hot rollers, curling iron... but, if you want fun wavy curls that add bounce, this is it.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! I almost returned this, because it so intimidated/scared me:) after reading the instructions I decided to try, hoping It wouldn&#x27;t  get hung in my hair or pull my hair out...I was amazed this was soooo easy, and not once did my hair get hung in the curler. I&#x27;m not&lt;br /&gt;mechanically inclined, so believe me that this is simple to use. I have thin straight hair, I set it for low heat and soft curls and that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, and it took me only 10 min&#x27;s at the most to do all my hair, it looks great! Love, love, love this curler!</li>
            <li> It simply does not work.  Three family members with hair ranging from very thick and long to very thin and fine tried it, and nobody&#x27;s hair curled.  I would return it, but it was a gift for my great-granddaughter and I do not have any packaging for it.</li>
            <li> Be very diligent in reading the instructions, and make sure your hair is combed and without tangles, once you get started with this curler and figure it out, you will love it.  It does get super hot, so make sure you use a protective hair product and don&#x27;t leave your hair in the curler for long periods or you will burn it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, think hair to the middle of my back.  Make sure to use small sections of hair,  If it stops winding hair in and beeps, don&#x27;t pull it right out of your hair.  Wait a second and the machine unwinds your hair, and then remove it and start over with a smaller section. If I just curl the bottom 6 inches I can be done in under 10 minutes.  The curls last ALL day.  My hair usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl so this is working out great for me.  I don&#x27;t even have to use hair spray.</li>
            <li> Excelent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But PLEASE Read the instructions because if you using upside down you can lost your hair. I learned the lesson .</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, love, this curling iron! I would not pay the extra $$$ for the Babyliss Miraburl...especially since both irons look identical and come from the same parent company.  The only difference I could find was the alternating curl feature.  In my opinion, that one feature does not justify paying almost forty percent more.  By the way, no offense to Amazon but I found this curler way cheaper at my local drug store and big box store.  Anyway, this iron is awesome...perfect curls every single time as promised.  There is a bit of a learning curve in regards to figuring out the amount of hair you can fit in and trying to maneuver the iron at the back of your head.  But once you figure that out you&#x27;re golden.  So happy I found this device!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and makes beautiful curls.  The only problem I had was that I was holding onto the hair - you need to let go and then it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been only TOO EAGER to write my review since my Curl Secret arrived on Mother&#x27;s Day (thank you, Amazon Prime!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay first - before I made my purchase on Amazon.com I did my research.  I watched numerous YouTube videos and read reviews... so by the time my product arrived, I used it flawlessly on the first go!  It was so fun and easy to use!!  So do your due diligence and take about 10-15 minutes to watch other users work this curling device so you know what you&#x27;re doing.  It&#x27;s funny to watch the folks who didn&#x27;t follow the instructions too, but hey, this will help you know what NOT to do ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use &amp;#34;day two&amp;#34; hair, meaning, don&#x27;t use on freshly washed and dried hair.  That&#x27;ll just add to your morning routine.  For me, working with day two hair means I still have some thermal protector spray and product in from the day before.  I have medium-long hair, colored &amp; highlighted hair, with the thickness fine to medium.  I can curl my entire head in less than 15 minutes.  Sometimes even in 10 minutes.  This product is revolutionary and if you do it right, it will provide you with curls that will have folks in the office asking &amp;#34;how did you get those curls?!&amp;#34; and at the end of the day saying, &amp;#34;Wow!  Your curls lasted all day!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Heat setting.  For my hair type, I vary between the 8 or 10 second mark, always on the high heat setting. I like the looser curls.  Sometimes on my day two dry hair I will lightly spray some thermal protection on my hair and let it try before I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t take more than 1&amp;#34; of hair.  There will be a beep, and the brushless motor won&#x27;t do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  COMB through the hair you want to curl.  Don&#x27;t just grab a half inch of unkempt hair and expect a nice looking smooth curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Use the cleaner that came with your curl secret.  Wait until your curler is cool and then twirl that thing around in the chamber a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Don&#x27;t panic if your hair gets stuck. I had this happen once because I foolishly tried to curl in excess of 1&amp;#34;.  No hair was pulled out and I didn&#x27;t lose any hair. There is a safety feature and thank goodness for that - so if there is a misfeed you&#x27;ll release the clamp and your hair will come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now go have fun curling your hair with a curler that will cut your styling time down in the morning!br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.

            <li> Simply put, I love this thing. I have incredibly straight and curl-resistant hair, and have previously never been able to maintain anything even *resembling* a curl/wave for more than ten minutes. Based on my hair&#x27;s history, I was pretty skeptical about Curl Secret - I just didn&#x27;t think it would work well for me. I was very happy to be proven wrong!    First things first, this tool is very simple to use. I&#x27;m not a professional hair stylist by any means, but I know how to work a straightener and curling iron pretty well. This is much more user-friendly than both of those. I know that others have complained about their hair getting caught in the device, but I feel like it would be really difficult to get it SO caught that you&#x27;d be forced to resort to cutting it out. (For reference, my hair has gotten tangled in it before, but it&#x27;s been really easy to remove). Second, it doesn&#x27;t take an eternity to curl your entire head with this tool. I have fairly long hair, and, while fine, there&#x27;s a lot of it. It takes me about 15 minutes to get the look I want. Third (and most importantly), I absolutely love the results I get with Curl Secret - loose, bouncy curls that actually last all day. All I have to do is use a little hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go.    When all is said and done, I&#x27;d recommend Curl Secret to anyone looking for a quick, effective, and easy-to-use hair tool. It&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the curl I got on the long parts of my hair. My hair goes down to about the bottom of my back and when I used this, only half of the hair came out curled, the rest was still straight. This was when I had it set on the highest heat and the highest timer settings. It worked fine for my shorter pieces of hair (my hair is layered) but definitely unimpressed with it overall. It&#x27;s like, either it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the amount of hair in the chamber to produce a curl or it&#x27;s just not really built to curl long hair. I was very disappointed after reading seemingly great reviews... I plan to return this for a refund.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing.  It&#x27;s the only curl that does not die out of my hair in a few hours.  Actually lasts for days.  Just take care to use it properly and with small sections so it doesn&#x27;t get stuck, that can be scary.</li>
            <li> The best creation ever!</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed in this. I was so exited, it came ups and I opened it I read the ALL the instructions and I used it the first time and 1 out of every 20 curls actually came out curly. And then I didn&#x27;t even jinish before the rotating thing inside wouldn&#x27;t stop rotating! I turned it off, unplugged it, and nothing worked. I let it cool down while it was off and plugged in and when I plugged it back in I didn&#x27;t even turn it on and it wouldn&#x27;t stop rotating. Ugh!! Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Period. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Does not curl like it says. Hair gets caught quite a bit. Might be returning it.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this product cost $89.  Its horrible, it got stuck in my hair numerous times (and yes i had it pointed in the right direction.) My husband bless his heart had to literally disassemble the unit in order to free my hair.  it took about 15 minutes....Being stuck in the machine for such a long period of time, it completely fried my hair.  Worst product EVER!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. Just got it today. She was so excited to use it until her hair got caught in it. we had a hard time getting hair out of it. Fortunately we did not have to cut her hair. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Curler burns and pulls hair out.  Daughter was so excited to get it that she ripped box up.</li>
            <li> This item looks like it would work well when advertised, however it doesn&#x27;t not curl hair the way the advertisement shows.  It just makes it wavy.  I thought it might just be my hair, but I had my daughter try it, and it curled the same way on both our hair.  Just made a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mom for Christmas, I was a little weary about it after reading some of the reviews but decided to buy it anyways because it was what she asked for. This might be an acceptable item if you always have someone else to help you curl your hair, but if you want to style your hair on your own this item is not a good idea. We tried it out right after I gave it to her and it is very difficult to use, if you don&#x27;t get your strip of hair in the exact right place you risk it getting tangled and stuck inside the hair curler. The instructions say there are safety features to prevent this but they obviously don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works and is easy to curl your own hair!  She is a preschool teacher by day and a blues singer with her band, No Good Sister, by night and now her hair is alawys good to go!</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars, but the iron is very heavy. I do cross fit 3X a week, and I have to rest my arms to complete the second 1/2 of my hair because the iron is soo heavy! However, it does the job, my hair has not gotten tangled once. I think the iron is smart, because if you do get lazy and just want to be done by inserting more hair per 12 sec cycle, the wand lets you know that that is too much hair, and it will back track or unwind the hair to let you know! My 12 year old can use it around her face area, but not the back or sides of her head. I think it is worth the price and I recomemend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!!! I followed instructions but it still grabbed my hair &amp; got them stuck in it the very first time I used it. I decided to give it a try &amp; used it again the second time &amp; it was ok but still pulled a few strands of my hair. So I thought maybe because my hair is too fine &amp; too long. Then now I&#x27;m writing this while my bf is trying to pull my hair out of it (this is the 3rd time I&#x27;m using it &amp; won&#x27;t ever touch it again!!) I ended up losing so much hair because we have to cut my hair after half an hr trying to get my hair out! I&#x27;m so frustrated! Back to using the traditional flat iron which works just fine</li>
            <li> I ordered this to curl my hair for my dance show and it worked great! It was very fast to curl all my hair. Very easy and safe to use. I have done a tutorial on this product and unboxing and first impressions check it out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;yFf7aLmS6HQ and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;3w9T0HVKEZ4 for a comparison with other products.</li>
            <li> I bought this to do my hair for a wedding I was going to last week. I got it in 2 days with my Prime shipping and had to option of free returns. After reading the reviews I was excited but skeptical, however I got the real product by Conair and not a knock off despite other reviews. I also did NOT tangle my hair once when curling my entire head of hair. I even had my mom try it with no problem.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super short but maybe it&#x27;s shorter than needed for this product. I let it heat up, followed directions to a t about combing and separating sections. I ended up with some wussy looking beach wave. I&#x27;ve tried this product out a couple different days on totally clean hair, next day clean hair and it&#x27;s all the same. No curls here. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with hair getting stuck in the chamber but my mom did when we tried it on her hair. I am not convinced I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! It is very easy to use and the curl is amazing! I am very pleased and surprised!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so it takes a LOT of product and time to get my hair to do anything. This was an early Christmas gift and I have to say, it&#x27;s the coolest toy anyone has ever given me. As I type, I have the most gorgeous curls! (And I barely used any product in my hair - must be the ceramic). The girls at work have been asking me to leave it in the bathroom so they can spruce up their do&#x27;s at the end of the day before happy hour and dinner dates.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter. Makes beautiful soft curls in her very long hair. Very seldom does it tangle her hair. Good buy.</li>
            <li> First use almost scalped my 12 yr old, daughter. I had to complete destroy it to get it off her head! I think it should be re marketed as a hair remover. It did make one nice curl.</li>
            <li> My husband surprised me with the curl secret after i&#x27;d been not so subtly hinting for a while that I would really like one.  The first couple of times I used it, I was in love.  Although it still took a while to get through all of my hair, the results were really beautiful and truly did hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t give this item any more than a 2 star rating because it burned off pieces of my hair.  I read all the instructions, watched the how-too videos online, etc.  But, when I went to do my own hair, I found it often pulled and tangled up my hair.  I tried to remain calm whenever this happened, but the last time just freaked me out.  It started to pull and tangle my hair, so I let go of the tension to try to unwrap my hair and get it free, but I couldn&#x27;t - it was completely stuck inside of the machine.  I tried a little more forcefully to get my hair free, but it was still tightly wedged.  I unplugged the contraption and yelled for my husband to quickly come help me, because by that point I was already smelling burnt hair (keep in mind this thing is HOT - it had only been around 30 to 45 seconds at this point).  With his help we were able to practically rip my hair free of the darned thing, but not before the damage was done.  The hair in that spot is singed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never be able to bring myself to use the thing again, which is a shame because it does give pretty results (when it works) and was extremely expensive!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!...&lt;br /&gt;It only took me 45 mins to do my friends hair, instead of old curling irons that would have taken 2-3 hours to get the same results..&lt;br /&gt;COULDN&amp;#34;T believe my own eyes!.. but it just does what the video shows... and so long as you don&#x27;t get too much hair.. cause that is true, you get too much and it&#x27;ll get caught, but hair comes out easy and just move on.. :)&lt;br /&gt;but yes well worth the price tag!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend for christmas as a surprise of course. She absolutely loves it! If you have medium length hair and it&#x27;s fine this will give you volume!</li>
            <li> The wifey loves this thing!, she doesn&#x27;t use it all that much but when she does, she is always happy with the results and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair probably just touching the shoulder.  This is a great product although does take some time but great for special occasions or when you have more time to curl your hair.  I have not had any trouble with hair getting tangled in the curler.</li>
            <li> This is extremely useful and gives amazing results</li>
            <li> Love this! My fine hair is pretty straight and never holds curl. I used this and my hair actually held curl all day! The curls loosened by the  end of the day but still looked great!</li>
            <li> Looks so easy on TV, but made a wild nest out of my hair. Tried it several times but no success. Freakish bit&#x27;s of hair sticking out in every direction. Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, I found it much too difficult to use, I prefer a curling iron while my hair is somewhat shorter.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased the Curl Secret.  It is totally amazing.  My hair is very fine and now looks shiny, full and healthy with amazing curls. I keep it at the lower heat setting because my hair is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls hold all day too which was a huge concern that was quickly dismissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was over excited about using it that I did make the mistake and not following the exact instructions that I did tangle my hair a few times.  Nothing major.  My hair was released by the Curl Secret with ease.  Once I did it as instructed, my hair never gets caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Curl Secret!  It is worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Did not work for either me or my hairdresser  I am returning it ASAP;  Good Luck if you decide to order this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to use. And my hair looks gorgeous! The only two cons is it&#x27;s not meant for super long hair (my hair is down to my stomach), it turned off on me when I was 3/4 done from being too hot. Also, I like the beeping concept to alert me when the machine says my hair is tangled and to redo strands--BUT it&#x27;s a little difficult to get my hair out. It gets stuck and it&#x27;s still curling my hair even though its tangled. :/ Other than that it&#x27;s super fun and easy to use. Makes curling my hair FUN and I&#x27;m eager to curl my hair with this than those boring old curling irons.</li>
            <li> I love this!! very simple and easy to use, perfect curls every time, I don&#x27;t use any sprays or mousse to hold the curls and they maintain their shape all day! definitely recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my hear. I have tried with hear spray and the other things the hear gets stock inside and it very hard to get them out. I don&#x27;t like it to me it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy long. Think, &amp;#34;That girl&#x27;s hair must tickle the top of her bum,&amp;#34; long. It is also very thick and straight. I have always had problems curling my hair in the past. I&#x27;ve tried traditional curling irons, wands (which work but they&#x27;re never long enough), hot rollers, soup cans, rag curls, over-night rollers, those rolling sticks things, really, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Any way I tried the curls wouldn&#x27;t last longer than an hour if I didn&#x27;t use a very questionable, not to mention dangerous, amount of hair spray. Even then they usually didn&#x27;t last more than 3 hours - tops. I was so frustrated and about to give up on anything resembling effort when it came to the styling of these luscious locks. Then I stumbled across this crazy gadget.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is high speed, low drag (you know my story but not my swag). You just put a reasonable amount of hair in the snapper and it sucks it right up! Now that&#x27;s what I call a good use of technology. There is nothing more satisfying than hearing those little beeps that mean &amp;#34;Hey, your hair&#x27;s done!,&amp;#34; except maybe a good slice of pizza or my mom&#x27;s pie. Anyway, the only thing I must warn you about is also the best quality of the machine: the vacuum. While this little baby is slurping in your hair it also might get hair that&#x27;s not meant to go into it, causing a chain of profanities to escape our lips which are not at all lady-like. Make sure to clearly part the sections of hair you wish to be heated into curly goodness and that they are tangle free. You&#x27;re in for a real treat when you realize the awful mistake you made with putting in the piece you know may have been too big or had knots in it. Prepare for the fight of your life!.........In reality, it&#x27;s not that bad, just need a firm pull on the thing and usually the hair comes out. All in all, this is a really good product. Fun to use and effective on a very troublesome type of hair. I highly recommend getting this if you think curling hair has to bea big battle. FYI, it doesn&#x27;t have to be.</li>
            <li> I just got mine today and the box was already opened and resealed with scotch tape! That was disappointing.   Ok I have thick coarse hair, I&#x27;m mixed so my hair is very stubborn. I flat iron my hair , so when I used this iron it was completely straightened. I literally have never curled my hair,ever. I have thick hair passed my shoulders and I couldn&#x27;t believe how simple this curling tool was to use! I completed my entire head of hair in 35 minutes. My hair did get caught while I got the hang of what size section of hair to use but it barely hurt and was easy to untangle. I love it, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Takes a few minutes to get used to but once you do its easy. Would highly recommend it. My hair is thick and heavy and could never hold a Curl. My curls lasted four days with no product in it. Everyone at work thought I had it professionally done.</li>
            <li> My niece got this for her Christmas present. i decided to try it since i know how to use professional curling irons since i went to school for it... well as i got to last piece of hair in the front!!! my hair got tangled so bad in it we had to cut it out! i was wondering how many other&#x27;s  out there got a Christmas haircut?</li>
            <li> Bought this product after watching one of those infomercials with my Mom for her for Christmas and I used it on her hair first which is long and thin and usually curls well with hot rollers. Her hair I was worried about it getting stuck b/c of the 24 inches in length but, it did not get stuck at all and curled her hair beautifully. I used it on my 5 year olds hair who has never let me curl her hair and always just wants a pony tail. However, with this Conair curl secret it made curling her hair fun b/c it sucks in the hair and walah a super pretty long curl comes out every time. I have a medium length course very thick hair and even with my hair this curler made my hair curl and it was surprisingly easy to use. Just be sure to only put in about 1/2 inch to 1 inch thickness of hair in it at a time or the safety will not allow the hair to enter the chamber. Very pleased so much that I bought one for myself and my daughter.  Bonus it is super safe with no exposed parts that could burn your hand since the hair is heated from the inner chamber...goodbye curling iron hello infinity pro!!! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> looks nice when its not getting stuck and pulling out your hair iam taking mine back don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas. After reading the reviews, I was very curious and extremely terrified. I have long hair, past the middle of my back, and I have a lot of it. My hair is stick straight and the only curl that ever holds is with a 3-barrel waver. Not anymore! This thing kicks ass and gives me curly locks for two days straight! The first time I used it, my hair didn&#x27;t turn out perfect. But I figured out how to use it the right way and the second time I used it, I had awesome curls. Best part? It only takes about 15 minutes for my whole head. So, I can see how some women are scared of this thing. But if you watch some YouTube videos and you&#x27;re careful with it until you get the hang of it, it&#x27;ll be your new best friend.</li>
            <li> Actually, I returned this item because my granddaughter, for whom it was purchased already had been given the same one and she said it was very good.</li>
            <li> Works well, daughter loves. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Really cool device. However, only curls small small sections of hair. Any bigger and it will tangle in your hair. The reverse spin to release tangled hair works about 60% of the time. Have lost chunks of hair from it getting stuck in the machine and nor accurately spinning the hair back out. I always brush each section of hair before using the device. The hiring gets stuck and won&#x27;t reverse out..so my hair gets burned off. It&#x27;s hard to tell when it will not go right.  Besides that..it&#x27;s a pretty cool device and makes the hair look good.</li>
            <li> Took a few times to figure out the ideal setting for my hair, but curls are very pretty and last a lot longer than my previous curling iron. I have had many compliments on my hair. It says for any length, but my hair is pretty long and I think if you try to curl too much you might have issues. I curl maybe 12&amp;#34; max. When I was trying to curl the whole length sometimes it would get caught in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all...gets one star for turning on when being plugged in</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t curl my hair, and this is literally my magical wand.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife as a Christmas gift.  She absolutely loves this thing.  She tried it on about 5 different family members over our Christmas gathering and it worked great on all but one -she has problems curling her hair anyway, but after trying different methods, she found that keeping it on her hair longer than usual resulted in otherwise normal curls.  The curls stay in place ALL DAY LONG.  Even on a 5 yr. old!</li>
            <li> Hard for teenagers to use alone, does exactly what it is suppose to do.  Love the curls</li>
            <li> I loved it! Works super fine!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and performs very well on my hair.  Curls stay in until I wash out.  But I think I have good hair for this product.  Straight hair that generally wont hold curl probably wont work with this either.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> I love this product; you need to practice with it and make sure you don&#x27;t have too much hair in the device, or it may tangle.  If it does, just take your time and pull the hair out a little at a time.  Make sure to keep the open, circular end at the top, facing the scalp.  I live in Florida, with high humidity, and the curl stays in - I get many compliments.  When you consider the price to have your hair styled, this product pays for itself in a few uses.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and made my hair look great! I had a few problems with it getting stuck when I put too much hair in, but it untangled easily.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to work with and the curls didn&#x27;t come out like the picture on the box even after following the directions. Will continue to try and see if I can get that look.</li>
            <li> bought for the wife and it has cut the curling time in half with a lot better results. i would recommend this  to any woman.</li>
            <li> Wifes red hair to waist, awsome curls, love it! This is a great product a little expensive thou, but worth the curls.</li>
            <li> My hair has never got stuck and it does what it claims to. I have medium length thick hair so my curls did not come out as spiraled as on the box but its still a great effortless curl. very fast and easy!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a granddaughter who likes to curl her&#x27;s and her friends hair. She loves it a lot!</li>
            <li> I was extremely reluctant to try this product especially because of the cost and only did so because of the rave reviews.  My hair is thin and lacks body, all the more reason I thought this curler would never work.  But I must say that I am amazed by the results!  I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but had to if it helps someone that&#x27;s as undecided as I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this about a week ago (used the $20 coupon at Harmons/Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond so paid a total cost of $80) and have used it twice since.  After only one try, I didn&#x27;t hesitate using it again for New Year&#x27;s Eve last night (attending a party with 350 guests).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly, it&#x27;s lightweight and not cumbersome, it&#x27;s easy to use and gets the job done quickly.  I&#x27;ve tried all three size curls and they are all different from the other.  The curls stay at least a couple of days, even the most loose curl which is the 8 second setting.  I&#x27;ve showered with these curls, have washed my car, worked out and they&#x27;re still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a noticeable difference in hair style as I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments, all telling me they prefer me in the curls!  It&#x27;s so simple and quick to use, the extra step in getting out of the house is worth it!  I feel as if I have so much hair now and it has bounce and body.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Okay, first off I love this product. I&#x27;ve never had it get stuck in the machine and for everyone saying it does, you have to read and follow the instructions! I have long hair down to the middle of my back and this works perfectly! Coming from someone who was a big fan of a curling wand, I like this product a lot better. This truly does take a lot less time. With the wand it takes me about 2 hours to do my whole head and with curl secret it takes me about an hour! I think my only down fall on this product is that it makes your hair smell pretty burnt, but most heat products do that.&lt;br /&gt;  With this product you need to absolutely make sure your hair is clean and tangle free! You also need to use 1/2-1 in pieces and if you have bigger it won&#x27;t even suck up the hair. Also the side of the barrel where you can see inside needs to be facing your head. If you follow these rules this product will do wonders!&lt;br /&gt;  I hope this helps everyone!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!  I can do my whole head in less than 15 minutes.  I put some moose in my hair after the shower then let it dry or blow dry. My curls last for days !</li>
            <li> This product works great. My wife loves it and it&#x27;s easy to use. I was skeptical but when it arrived I was able to curl my wife&#x27;s hair easily and the curls last. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product works very well for my hair. I have extremely straight hair, about shoulder length long. Historically, curling irons and curlers do not work for very long, and I end up with no curl within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;When I curl my hair with the Infiniti Pro, my curls are still in place the next morning after I sleep on it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not giving the product a 5 for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The constant beeping is a bit annoying.&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;ve actually used another brand of a similar product (Vida brand) that got a little hotter, had a longer timer, and alternated right &amp; left spin directions. I did not re-purchase the Vida because it malfunctioned on me, and the Infiniti Pro has not done that yet.&lt;br /&gt;3) After extended use in one setting, it seems like the curler will start snagging a little more frequently. I usually just turn it off, let it cool for a few moments, then start up again. It heats back up VERY QUICKLY!&lt;br /&gt;4) When (not if) your hair does snag, it can be a little frightening trying to get your hair out before it burns. Luckily, I&#x27;ve had not catastrophic disasters. You just need to be diligent about the amount of hair you use for each section &amp; how close you are to flyaways or loose hairs from outside the hair section you are curling.</li>
            <li> One word AMAZING!! I have wanted tgis since the first time I had seen it on TV but just could not bring myself to buy it for 119$ well when it went on sale I had to get it and I am just so happy I did!! I have never been able to do curls like this in my hair before, it did catch my hair like 2 times but it beeps, stops and unroll it, I have used it so many times and other then those 2 times I have never had any issues!! This curler is freaking awesome lol LOVE IT AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IT!!</li>
            <li> This curler is perfect for those who want sleek-looking hair. I use this as much as possible, even when I am just at home.</li>
            <li> I have never been adept at curling or styling my own hair.  That being said - the Infiniti Pro is a godsend!  I have tried hot rollers, hot twisty rollers, curling irons, and regular rollers.  My hair is straight and I just have had the hardest time getting it to look good.  In Infiniti Pro is totally simple to use and gives me nice full curls and they are long-lasting too.  I wish I had this long ago - I am very happy with how my hair looks now and thrilled that it takes so little time to get it looking great!</li>
            <li> This was WELL worth the price. Works wonders and is easy to use. The curls hold great and it takes no longer than 30 minutes for me to do my whole head and this is coming from someone whose hair is a little past her shoulders and is not thick but not thin either. The only bad thing about this product is that it&#x27;s a bit heavier than what a regular curling iron or a curling wand would be. I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it though :)</li>
            <li> This is my very first time writing a review on Amazon. I read all the reviews and did a massive amount of online research. I regret reading all the reviews because I became more and more skeptical as I came across more reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no talent whatsoever when it comes to the subject of beauty. I don&#x27;t know how to apply cosmetics, and I also can&#x27;t do my hair. Of course, I have no idea how to curl hair; for me, this product is worth every penny of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, your hair will be pulled and you might lose a little hair, but that is NOT because this product sucks. It IS BECAUSE YOU USED IT WRONG. This product is VERY easy to use, I wish I could buy it for everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are good at curling your hair, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t buy this expensive equipment. But then again, if you have no talent in curling hair like me, then what better item can you find than this???</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 14 year old granddaughter. She has long hair and I though, voila, easy for her to get curls!  Honestly it took some time for her to get the knack of using it. Once mastered, she told me she loves it! (She lives out of state so I really don&#x27;t know if she loves it or not!)</li>
            <li> So easy and perfect curl! Make a perfect curl before this was almost impossible...but now my dreams come true with Conair. I always have a different look!</li>
            <li> It does not work on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Hello all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m from Brazil, but I requested my order to be delivered at Sunsol International Drive Hotel, In Orlando, Florida.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got the product, I tried to use it and it didn&#x27;t work properly, it didn&#x27;t get warm. On the day after this, I tried again, and it worked perfectly, so I felt confortable to bring it to Brazil without writing to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I tried to use it Brazil, the same defect appeared, it didn&#x27;t get warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know what you can do to solve my problem, because I spent 80 hundred dollars for something that is not working. Could you please give me a answer, please?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I feel like I have gotten the hang of it! It really curls your hair well, and the curls stay in through out the day! Way better than the hot rollers I have been using for years. You have to spend some time with it and find a way that works for you. You will probably get your hair caught in it at some point-don&#x27;t freak, just tug slowly and gentle and it will come out. I like it and I am glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 2 daughters. They loved the results. It works very easily and gives nice curls. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Good thing and good price.&lt;br /&gt;My mom like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Even on the highest setting it did not curl my hair.  It was also hard to hold work with etc.  I returned it</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot so if you have hard to curl hair, will not work too well.</li>
            <li> This curls nice, but I have really thick hair and I can only do a quarter inch section of hair at a time. Also, I have carpal tunnel and after about half my head, my wrist starts to go numb.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my own hair so I usually just stick with a flat iron... I have thick hair and curls don&#x27;t usually hold well (and I am not very good at using a standard curling iron in the first place).  This thing really works - it takes a little bit of time since you can&#x27;t that much hair in each time but totally worth it and anyone can do it (by themselves), even me.</li>
            <li> Due to injuries I am unable to hold my arms up for more than a few seconds and this product is easy to use and is the first hair curling system that really works. My hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Have used it several times and when used correctly, it makes beautiful curls without having to guess how long to keep your&lt;br /&gt;hair wrapped.  It has a timer so you won&#x27;t burn your hair.  Also, if the hair is not coiled correctly, it lets you know with a beeping sound. I have used it on myself, my 15 year old daughter (long hair) and her friends.  My daughter has straight hair and usually nothing we do helps her hair hold a curl.  This curl lasted until morning.  Her friends with wavier, curlier hair said it lasted even longer.  Great invention!</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that can become quite frizzy.  I attempted to curl my hair on two separate occasions.  My hair did not curl or make new waves.  I had the iron on the hottest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reasons why I am giving this item a one-star is due to:&lt;br /&gt;*the price,&lt;br /&gt;*the time involved with sectioning out small pieces of hair (it is supposed to be a time saver)&lt;br /&gt;*no curl or wave produced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for a time saving device to style my hair.  I guess it is back to foam rollers at night.</li>
            <li> I wish it would hold more quantity of hair. It takes a little time to learn how to use it, be patient.</li>
            <li> Does not curl hair well! Better off with the wond!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from amazon as I bought it on a whim from another store. I was very skeptical at first regarding this product due to mixed reviews. However, after using it the first time I knew it was a winner. I have very straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to curl. I use it on the tightest curl setting and go over each curl twice due to the fact that you only curl your hair with this for maybe 15 seconds? People have complained about getting their hair stuck. You have to use small sections and brush your hair before using it. It wraps your hair so if its tangled, it makes sense that it will get tangled inside. Once I did manage to get it stuck (tried to use it without combing my hair thoroughly) and it scared me, but instead of freaking out I immediately unplugged the machine then yanked on my hair softly to get it out. Another note I do use hair spray and the curls stay for about two days. I really like the ease and have finally found something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have noticed that it has stopped working on me once or twice. This may be a fluke, however, if it does break I will come back and update this review with Conair&#x27;s response. For the price I paid I do expect this product to last me longer than 6months.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to do each strand of hair this Curler does and awesome job.  I won&#x27;t have to go get my hair done for a party anymore I can do it myself. Just make sure your strands of hair you put in the chamber are not to large or it won&#x27;t take the hair.  Whoever invented this is a genius!</li>
            <li> This gadget is so great, I used when my granddaughter was visiting, she has a mass of thick long hair.  It took about an hour but she had the most glorious curls when it was time to go to bed and we only had to touch up a couple the next morning.  I used it for the first time and I still have waves and some curl, that was 3 days ago.  My hair is long, layer and colored  the middle setting works great.  Thinking about moving those old &#x27;hot curlers&#x27; out.</li>
            <li> I set my hair as instructed and it took my hair into the chamber, beeped and then released half of it. I started to see smoke while I was trying desperately to pull out my hair from the chamber but it wouldn&#x27;t release it.  I pulled the cable from the wall and finally after burning and losing some of my hair, I was able to get it out of the spiral chamber.</li>
            <li> I have the finest hair any hairdresser has ever seen, never been able to keep a curl in for more than an hour with anything else, my whole life, without putting so much hair gel in my hair was hard as a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this curl machine, I don&#x27;t even have to use gel or hair spray and the curls will stay in for DAYS if I don&#x27;t wash my hair; it definitely lasts all day until I wash it.  Takes a really long time to curl whole head, sometimes, I will just curl select pieces on the top, and it looks adorable, and that takes only a few minutes.  Highest setting and highest temperature.  The smaller the section of hair, the tighter the curl.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a bit of time to do the whole head and the curls don&#x27;t last too long on my hair.</li>
            <li> Mommy and daughter both love love love it! So easy to use. Makes doing hair a simple and quick process!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but this product works great on all hair types. I have very long, thick hair and it works great. My daughter has average, shoulder length hair and works great on her too. Easy and quick to use!</li>
            <li> I do not expect salon results and know how difficult my hair can be but this gave me the waves i needed. And, used on &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; hair waves stayed for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  This curler works great!  My hair is long so I was unsure if it would curl without breaking off my hair.  Glad to say it works amazing.</li>
            <li> Really nice this Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret! My girlfriend used it and her hair is beatiful!&lt;br /&gt;This is very practical and It takes just a couple of minutes to do the whole hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this little machine. It makes the most beautiful and neat curls. I already have curly hair. But on the days i dont want to scrunch it, or put mouse, or i dont want any products in my hair PERIOD, I use this. Reason being, is because when it twirls and curls my hair strands, it sort of smoothes them out, and makes them a neater curl, so when my whole head is done, i finger brush my hair, and with my fingers i separate the curls and toussle them. This makes my hair look natural and beautiful, and theres no product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CON: I&#x27;ve used it for a week now, and about 4 times my hair got caught the wrong way in the twirly thing, and i had to fight hard for my hair back. LOL. Its not a perfect machine, but I think its also maybe about being more careful and learning to use it.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, processed hair and I can style it in 20 mins. Curls are perfect every time! I just make one twist in the section I&#x27;m curling to feed it through easier, rarely get hair caught. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I borrowed my friend&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t read directions, it was easy to figure out. You have to use small sections of hair at a time, but it&#x27;s quick and easier than a regular curling iron. I just ordered one myself. All curls are going to be the same size, but if you don&#x27;t mind that this is much more user friendly than other products. And it beeps quickly when it&#x27;s done with the curl.</li>
            <li> Well, after reading many reviews, watching lots of customer demo videos, and much consideration, I bit the bullet and bought this! I&#x27;m 63 and fought naturally wavy/curly hair all my life until 5 years ago, when I started having keratin treatments every 2 months. Finally stick straight hair that dries by itself. But now I find myself wanting some loose curls for special occasions or just a little change, and this thing really delivers. I don&#x27;t find it heavy and It does just what it says. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have a hard time holding it right and getting the hair inserted correctly, but I&#x27;ve always been bad with hair tools. I&#x27;ll probably get the knack of it with enough practice, but even then there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be able to do the back by myself. Still, pretty cool and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck the frist (and only) time that I&#x27;ve used it. I was unable to get my hair out, and almost had to cut it!! There is no way of getting your hair out once stuck!!!!!!!! Very dangerous.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Works great. Makes the prettiest curls with minimum time.  Curls last a couple days. Wonderful product. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. It works great. She is 16 and can use it just fine by herself. Little moment of panic if hair gets stuck for a second, but once you get the hang of it it is a great product.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to this device.  The first time I used it I got a section of my hair stuck in it too (I used it backwards).  I unplugged it, it cooled off quickly, and I was able to turn it around and unwind my hair.  The key is not to panic.  The second time I used it, I was really careful to keep the barrel facing my head and it worked beautifully.  I have very fine blonde hair in long layers (ranging from my chin to the middle of my back).  What I love about this iron is I don&#x27;t have to separate my layers so much to get perfect curls.  It goes very quickly if I use the high setting on medium and 10 seconds.  The curls last 2-3 days.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family!  What a fun product!</li>
            <li> Ok, my hair NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER... like EVER holds curl.  I got this after reading such good reviews on it, finding that there were way more positive reviews than negative.&lt;br /&gt;Best $100 I&#x27;ve ever spent on my hair.  My hair is long and heavy.  This device let&#x27;s me curl my hair easily, and get this... holds the curl all day with NO HAIRSPRAY!!!  Yep.  No spray!  I do put a little spray on the top of my hair just to hold the top like i want it, but the curls, get nothing.  And they really do last all day!&lt;br /&gt;The trick to the Curl Secret is to not put too thick of a section in your hair at once, and after I pick the section I run a brush though it just to make sure it&#x27;s not tangled at all.  If I was to section my hair off this way and use a regular iron, I&#x27;d be there for a good hour.  This takes me 30 minutes or less for my whole head!  I can&#x27;t give this thing enough stars!!!</li>
            <li> This does exactly what its supposed to.  Curling irons dont work on me....I&#x27;ve tried every type.  Hot rollers wont stay in my hair and neither will foam rollers.  This worked perfectly on the first try.  You just need to work on smaller sections to avoid tangling your hair in it.  Lower heat will give you looser curls and higher heat will give you tighter curls.  They hold all day and night long and even into the next morning.  It leaves your hair silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> Attacked my daughter&#x27;s hair. Had to cut it to get it out.</li>
            <li> Just will  not work on my hair..</li>
            <li> I think that if your hair has multiple layers the result may have ben better.  I found this did not hold the curl or make a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Ok. I have long hair below my elbows. It&#x27;s fine hair. So you seriously have to section off 1/2-1 inch of hair NO MORE than that. Also you have to comb through that section even if you brushed your hair you have to make sure their is not lingering strands because your hair will GET STUCK and from experience I had to unplug and literally dig my hair out it was very very hard to get out once its stuck. This happened twice but the closer you use it towards your scalp the more risk you take for it to get stuck. It really does curl and it keeps the curl without any product use.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product last night at Ulta Beauty with a 20% off one item coupon, making it $80+tax.  I have hair that reaches just above my belly button, so I was wary that I would be able to use it.  I did some internet searching, however, and found videos from Conair of very long hair being curled.  So I decided to give it a shot -- after all I could return it easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I have very long hair that is very thick (I&#x27;m a redhead).  I read the directions, watched a few videos, and set to work.  I made sure to use small sections and I used high heat, 12 seconds.  I clipped part of my hair on top of my head and worked in sections. I loved the machine from the first curl!  12 seconds is not very long, so before you know it each curl is done.  It did not take me more than 18 minutes to curl my entire head of hair, using small sections.  I can easily spend 25-30 minutes with other curling irons/wands/etc and not get the same uniform result.  That is the best thing about this -- uniform result!  I did not find that it was bulky or tiring by the time I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the hair tangle a couple times but nothing big.  The machine let go of the hair immediately.  I found that in each time, I had not properly smoothed/combed out that section.  One of the times I think I had too much hair in it.  Regardless, the tangles were very easy to clear.  There is no brush inside the motor, so it&#x27;s not like your hair is catching on internal bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it curl?  Well I was a little disappointed with the 12 second curl.  That is, until I was all done and ready to finish the style.  I waited for the curls to cool, put some smoothing cream in, some hair spray, then hand-tousled my hair.  Woowza!!  I had curl galore!  It was gorgeous.  I then slept on it.  Today, I have gorgeous beach waves and still have some defined curl ringlets. The clip-less interior combined with perfect all-around heating really does make curls last longer (just don&#x27;t touch until they are cool!).  My hair curls well but it doesn&#x27;t always hold well.  It will hold extra body until I wash it, but not much more than that.  For me to have very well defined waves and a few ringlets after sleeping on it is an EXCELLENT result.  I am thrilled.  For 18 minutes styling time (and that was my first time), I feel this is well worth it, because my hair is going to have style and wave until I wash it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also imagine so many uses for this.  For example, creating a simple ponytail with perfect ringlets.  That should be quick, easy, and very pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final FYI:  I was reading through the manual and discovered that this machine has a 5 year warranty.  Awesome!  So save your receipts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive (but I feel it&#x27;s worth it -- try using an Ulta 20% off coupon!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super Quick, Uniform Curls (18 minutes for super long, super thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting Result&lt;br /&gt;Multiple Uses (like curling ponytail strands)&lt;br /&gt;5 Year Warranty&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous Hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do love this product, but please keep in mind I&#x27;ve only used this product ONCE.  But hey, think about what it says that I am giving it rave reviews already!  I will try to update this review as I use the product more.  But if you are on the fence, pick this product up from somewhere that you can easily return it -- then the dilemma is solved :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get any curls. Not sure why people love this product.</li>
            <li> daughter uses this all the time</li>
            <li> I got this for my grown daughter. She loves this product. It does an excellent job of curling her hair and holds the curl.</li>
            <li> This makes really cute, curly hair BUT about once per 10 curls your hair gets completely tangled in it and starts to fry.  You won&#x27;t be able to get your hair out by yourself and will require assistance.  If you are home alone by the time you get yourself untangled you will likely have a bald spot.  Great in theory, needs some bugs worked out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get it if you have short hair or just want to curl your ends, it&#x27;s good if you want to curl a lot of hair very fast and very curly, not for cute little waves curls at the end.</li>
            <li> After seeing a video about it, thought to give it a try, but I was skeptical as it looked too good to be true. I was amaze at the results. I&#x27;m the worst skilled person for beauty purposes and this was just so easy to use with great results! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It may seem like an expensive item to purchase if you&#x27;re not sure if it actually works but it really does. Easy use and it has different settings so you can determine The size of the curl your looking for. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised that this didn&#x27;t work. It didn&#x27;t curl my hair at ALL. I definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this yesterday, Christmas Day, on my straight, long hair. It tangled a bunch of times. Also, the curls didn&#x27;t seem uniform. I fully intended to return the thing. But then, every time I passed a mirror and caught myself, I really loved how my hair looked. The curls really weren&#x27;t uniform, but they looked natural. That &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look that I&#x27;m always trying to achieve - this was it. My mother said it looked messy, but in a good way. I took a nap on the couch and the curls still looked good after. I slept on them last night, they still look good today. So now I think I&#x27;ll end up using it often. It&#x27;s a pretty quick way to get curls and I think, with practice, I will be able to avoid tangling. I would say that this product is best for straight hair. Tangling occurred when I didn&#x27;t have a smooth section. I would imaging trying to curl wavy or frizzy hair would be very difficult.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve with this product.  The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll definitely get your hair stuck in it, despite the fact that the product says \\&quot;guaranteed no tangles.\\&quot;  You need to practice using this tool, and each time you&#x27;ll become better and faster at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had the kind of hair that no matter how much heat, styling, gel, or spray I use, my curls are falling out while I&#x27;m in the car on my way to the event.  I was very skeptical about using the curl secret because I have never found anything that worked for me.  I tried \\&quot;curling\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners that \\&quot;help your hair retain curls or styling better,\\&quot; hot rollers, foam rollers, curling irons, etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to my hair losing its style, I have never really been \\&quot;good\\&quot; at doing hair.  Growing up when girlfriends asked me to do their hair I would groan because I didn&#x27;t even know how to do my own hair.  It&#x27;s no surprise that at nearly 30, I still can&#x27;t do my hair ;-)  Some days, even mastering a pony tail is a struggle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Curl Secret looked so easy to use.  I heard about how it was \\&quot;different\\&quot; because it heats your hair on all sides and retains your style better, so I decided to try it out.  The first time I used it was ok - it took forever, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of volume on top of my head, and boy did I get my hair tangled in it.  You cannot put strands of hair wider than 1/2\\&quot;- maybe 1\\&quot; wide in the tool.  When using this tool against your scalp, the more fanned-out your hair is at the top near your scalp, the more likely the tool is to get stuck and rip your hair out.  I have learned a few tricks to using this tool that seem to make it better and easier for me, and each time I use it I get faster.  I&#x27;m sure that this would be even easier and faster if you had someone to help you out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this tool, I do my hair in \\&quot;tiers.\\&quot;  First I part the lower 1/4 of my hair with a comb and clip the rest to the top my head.  Then I work my way around the half-circle of my neck/lower scalp using about 1/2\\&quot; - 1\\&quot; sections, keeping the sections parted \\&quot;vertically\\&quot; rather than fanned out horizontally (if that makes sense).  Continue curling hair \\&quot;in tiers,\\&quot; using a comb to create the next part and clip the other \\&quot;tiers\\&quot; to the top of the head.  Working though each \\&quot;tier\\&quot; is another system of smaller pins and clips until each \\&quot;tier\\&quot; or \\&quot;level\\&quot; is curled.  Finally, I end with the top of my head, which helps to achieve more volume.  Maybe this \\&quot;trick\\&quot; isn&#x27;t a secret, but as someone who is terrible at doing hair, I thought it was a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure when you open the tool and release your hair that you don&#x27;t \\&quot;drag\\&quot; the iron down your hair.  That is, be sure to open the tool and kind of \\&quot;dump\\&quot; the curl out of the barrel.  This will keep you from using the tool like a straighening iron.  I found the first few times I used this, I was pulling the tool down the curls and straightening them out a bit and losing some curl.  The curl needs a few seconds to set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use any product or sprays to get the curls to stay, which AMAZES ME, because again, I have always been the type to lose my hairstyle before I even get to an event.  It is shocking to come home from an event hours later and have my curls intact, especially without use of any styling sprays or products.  I have even gone to bed and woken up with my hair still curly (albeit sloppy bed-head curls).  I don&#x27;t know what that other person was talking about being disappointed that their curls last \\&quot;only\\&quot; 2 days - this isn&#x27;t a PERM, it&#x27;s a daily styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attached some picture of my hair after using this product because sometimes seeing is believing (assuming Amazon approved and posted the images I shared).  I get tons of compliments when I curl my hair with the Curl Secret.  It&#x27;s no secret that I&#x27;m not very skilled with my hair, so it&#x27;s always awesome to be able to respond, \\&quot;thank you!  Why YES, I DID do my hair myself!\\&quot; :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them as best as I can!ir myself!\\&quot; :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to ask any questions and I will do my best to answer them as best as I can!</li>
            <li> It got tangled in my hair. Very scary sinc it was hot and could have burned my hair. Pulled the plug and my husband helped get my hair loose from the thing.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and the curls were still there the next morning. I love this tool and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I own the Bling Curl Secret purchased from Ulta. My hair is long and fine and has trouble  holding a curl. This machine makes a perfect curl every time and it holds pretty well. Keep in mind that like most things, there is a learning curve. Hair will tangle if it is not combed smooth and if too much hair is fed into the machine. Patience is a virtue and will be tested at first. Don&#x27;t get discouraged though. It&#x27;s totally with every penny.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, on the third strand of hair, it yanked it up into the machine, made a noise and stalled out.  I quickly unplugged it and had to get my daughter and husband to help me get my hair out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone I cared about.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, medium length hair and after reading several positive reviews, I thought I would purchase the Infiniti and give it a shot.  When I got it home, I read the directions, tried it on the high setting and it only curled (and very loosely) the top part of the my hair.  The end strands were basically just &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34;, not the twisty type of curl you see in the ads and on the box.  So just to make sure I was doing it right, I viewed several you-tube videos, including the one that Conair put out.  So I gave it another shot, still the same.  I decided to return it.  $100 bucks is too much to spend on something that does not work, at least for me.  I do not understand how this can curl so well for everyone else but I was not at all happy with it.</li>
            <li> I expected more but in general this curling iron does its job. It takes longer then expected to curl hair and you can&#x27;t put but a small amount of hair in at a time.</li>
            <li> This works great if you have long hair. If your hair is shorter, don&#x27;t bother with the purchase; instead, get a styling wand.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of practice, but I could then regulate the tightness or looseness of the curl and place the curl in the exact location that I wanted it to be.  I could make my hair wavy or curly and do spot areas.</li>
            <li> I cannot make this curl my hair nicely.  It takes forever, and the curl is worse looking than with a regular, inexpensive curling iron.  Regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> ALL THAT IT PROMISED! DOESN&#x27;T TAKE LONG AND DOES GIVE MY HAIR THE FULLNESS IT NEEDS!</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret it was good product easy to use and good price gives hair a beautiful shape</li>
            <li> I tried so many but this was the best I think. I made a mistake by returning it and now I consider buying it again.</li>
            <li> We spent hours trying to get this to work and no results flourished. It may work for some one else.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you the amount of complements that I have received since purchasing this contraption a couple weeks ago. I could never master curling my hair the conventional way so I decided to buy the infiniti pro by conair. After reading extensive reviews on this product I decided to purchase it. The only negative comment that I would make about this product is that my hair was caught in the spinning mechanism a couple times. The positive aspect of this is that there is a unlocking feature that beeps and lets go of the hair automatically. Just make sure to keep it at the recommended 1/2 inch to inch piece of hair and you&#x27;ll be fine. Over filling the compartment is why my hair was caught in the first place. Definitely worth the $100. I have very thick long hair that hangs down to my middle back. It takes me about 30-40 minutes at most to complete my entire head. I would recommend this product to anyone. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This product is amaaaaaaazing! It truly works as advertised! So simple to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> Loooove! This really works if you follow direction correctly!! My waves lasted for days. I don&#x27;t like tight curls, so it&#x27;s perfect. But if you want tight curls, it can do that, u just have to take very small portions of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and quite thin. She had it set in the highest heat and the longest time. It made a very limp and lifeless wave at best. She tried doing it twice on this same setting and it only did a fraction better. This may work for others but not for her. I even tried it and I have short fine hair. Product did not do any better. Product is being returned.</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful.  Need to do a small amount of hair at one time or it will not curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much! Honestly I can say that I was quite scared about using it after some of the reviews saying their hair was getting caught but I have had it almost three weeks and I have curled my hair with this at lease 6 times by now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. It has a feature on it that beeps if you put it in wrong or if there was too much hair so that really helps. I have really thick hair and it&#x27;s about three inches past my shoulders and it takes about 15-20 minutes to do my whole head. It&#x27;s also really easy so it&#x27;s meant for those that find themselves incapable of using any other iron. It&#x27;s important to be patient and don&#x27;t try to rush it, then you won&#x27;t have any problems and it will be surprisingly quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It takes time &amp; practice but it&#x27;s well worth it. The only thing to ever curl my long fine hair &amp; keep the curl. The secret is to dampen ends of hair &amp; use tiny pieces for tight curls.</li>
            <li> Love it. It really does curl faster and I have waist long hair that does not curl easy.  I love the way it wraps the hair for you.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law has long natural curly hair , she used it and loved it, her hair did look great ,my daughter also has long fine hair and loved how quick it was to look great when using the Infiniti Pro .Good product</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. She loves it and so does my daughter. Not that it matters to me, but it seems to be well constructed and it makes them happy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is definitely a little intimidating, but after the very first use, I loved it!  I have long hair and it only takes me about 30 minutes to curl my entire head on the 12 second setting.  I have very straight hair naturally and I don&#x27;t even use product to help this curl my hair.  Best part is that I don&#x27;t wash it and the next day, it looks even better.  I have only had it tangle on one curl so far, which I&#x27;ll admit was a bad tangle!  Other than that, it&#x27;s fun to use and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughters and they&#x27;re very happy with it. It transforms hair I to the most beautiful curls!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after reading the reviews, bought it. I tried it out today on my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine...it&#x27;s awesome!!! Very simple to use, heats up fast! I had no trouble with my hair being tangled in it at all. Curls really fast. My hair is thick and straight, but this curled it nicely. Happy with my purchase!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great curler but I have arthritis in my hands and shoulders and the curler is heavy. I wish I&#x27;d researched it more.</li>
            <li> First time out of the box it was usable.  I fully expected to have to be extremely patient to get the learning curve.  I watched a tutorial on You Tube first, which I think it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are crazy good, very uniform and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to rush by putting too much hair in at once or it can tangle, but it does have the ability to detangle easily.  That is what I was most afraid of with this device, but it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can have curly hair, neato!</li>
            <li> This really works! I was skeptical and thought it might pull out chunks of hair when it &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; in the hair. Not true. It automatically stops if it tangles or pulls at the roots. You can easily get as tight or loose a curl as you want by adjusting the heat setting or time setting.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend so much money on  this, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. I struggle constantly to curl my hair with a curling wand, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one. This product takes ALL the struggle out of curling my hair. There are 3 curl settings which vary the tightness of the curls. The lowest one gives me what I like to call \\&quot;Kate Middleton hair.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not even kidding. My hair looks exactly like hers. The middle setting gives a little tighter curl, but still loose enough. The highest setting gives a tight curl, but I don&#x27;t use it. Perhaps even better than achieving Kate Middleton hair, is how long these curls last. My hair curls easily, but by the end of an 8-10 hour day, my curling wand curls have mostly fallen out (and that&#x27;s with A LOT of hairspray). With this tool, I barely use any hairspray, and my curls last forever! I can even brush the curls out and they still last. I&#x27;ve even slept with my hair curled, and my hair still looks perfect the next day. If you&#x27;re hesitant on buying this, don&#x27;t be!! It&#x27;s well worth the money!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to my review, I have pretty fine hair that falls a little below my shoulders. This tool gives me lots of body, which is something I&#x27;ve always wanted. Also, I feel the need to clarify on how to use this: You can only curl 1/2-1\\&quot; sections of hair at at a time. If you try more than that (or get the tool too close to your scalp) the tool just \\&quot;spits out\\&quot; your hair. I&#x27;ve never had trouble with my hair getting stuck or tangled inside the tool, so other people who said that may have just been using it wrong. Try not to get baby hairs or really really small sections caught in your main section that you&#x27;re curling - I&#x27;ve found that this tends to a) make the tool spit out your hair or b) make your baby hairs get sucked into the tool with the main section, which pulls them quite a bit in the process (which is slightly painful).</li>
            <li> I love this! The curls are much better than a curling iron</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to think when I ordered this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  In all my years of using curling irons, I could never achieve the perfect curl I get with this time and time again.  You can curl your hair rather quickly with it.  I have received many compliments on my hair since using it.  My hair is fine and straight by the way.</li>
            <li> works great on all hair lengths. I recently cut about 5 inches off, and it still curls great! way better results than I&#x27;ve had with a traditional curling iron or curling wand, and the curls last significantly longer than with hot rollers. and you don&#x27;t really have to put too much hair spray on to keep the curls lasting like I have to with the hot rollers. easy to use too! and the anti-tangle feature REALLY works!</li>
            <li> It works great just doesn&#x27;t produce the kind of curl that is really my style :) But other than that its pretty, easy to use and shipped on time and not damaged</li>
            <li> This thing is a little creepy. I mean it sucks up your hair into a little pocket, and then spits out a curl. But it works! And it gets it done quickly. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and my hair goes down to my hips. This take maybe 20 minutes to curl all my hair. It&#x27;s easy to use, and I love that it has an anti tangle feature. If your hair get&#x27;s stuck it stops pulling your hair in. You just open it up, and pull the hair out.</li>
            <li> I have a little longer than shoulder length, layered, very fine, very straight hair ( and lots of it!) I was a bit reluctant to try this product as I had poor results using the Beachwaver (problems with tangling, ends burning up, poor curl). I had no problems at all with this wonderful iron. There is a little learning curve with holding the iron but once you get it, it&#x27;s very easy to use. I like how the ends go in last, less damage that way. I find the curls last longer than hot rollers too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the curl secret. You have to make sure you don&#x27;t put it too close to your head or your hair will get stuck. It happen to me. Don&#x27;t panic if it happens, Just carefully take your hair out. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product. You don&#x27;t have to do anything other than just put a small piece of hair and it does it for you. Don&#x27;t put too much or it will beep. 5 stars I give this product &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly and super easy to use! Curls lasted for days! Would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to all my friends</li>
            <li> It technically will put a slight curl in my hair,  but it doesn&#x27;t come close to what is advertised.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to curl my daughters hair and nothing worked. She has straight, fine hair and whenever I curled it and hair sprayed the heck out of it the curls would fall out within 30 minutes. This is a miracle worker! The curl secret kept perfect curls all night and that&#x27;s with her flipping and running around. It&#x27;s easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li> Product is a waste of time and money, I returned the product never worked as advertised...my girlfriend spend a lot of time working with it to no avail.</li>
            <li> It was awful. You can&#x27;t curl ur hair by yourself! My hair got all tangled and I had to cut my hair to get it out!</li>
            <li> Makes great curls  / waves that stay all day.  It only curls small sections of hair at a time so it takes too long for every day use to be really practical.  But really works exactly as advertised and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair I was able to curl my hair with one practice run you have tro section your hair with something like the end of a teasing comb and the brush that section I also have thick hair I Wolre it diown one night stil curly next day took a body shower put my curls in a hair clip recurled about three pieces and had a whole nother hairstyle  I love it</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, but I have really long hair so even when I put in a little bit it gets stuck, other than that I love the results.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what my daughter was looking for. She has used it non stop since the day she got it.</li>
            <li> I have Extra Long, Thin, Super Straight, baby fine hair, but a lot of it.  I could spend 2 hours curling my hair with a traditional curling iron, and a TON of hair spray, as well as hair gel.  Then, I leave the house and two hours later, it looks like a horrible attempt at curly hair.  SO, I gave up.  This however, is a godsend for people like me!  It still takes almost as long, but i don&#x27;t have to burn my fingers, or spend time wrapping and re-wrapping my hair around the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note:  Be VERY VERY careful not to release the tension on the handle (this will make sense once using it)  I accidentally did, it stated wrapping my hair again. I had two &amp;#34;close-calls&amp;#34; where I thought I was going to have to cut my hair!  But, please don&#x27;t let that deter you.  I am just bringing this up as a word of caution to be VERY careful and follow instructions TO THE T!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this :)  My hair lasted almost all day.  Only difference is if you have hair that does not curl well, set it on the highest heat setting and the timer to make a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; curl, so that when it falls some, it will look like natural, wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I personally DO NOT like this product. Bought it to do my daughters hair. Instructions are easy, however, you can only use small sections of hair.. That makes doing the entire head forever!! The 8, 10, or 12 seconds doesn&#x27;t stop accurately ( curling the hair to release). The curls haven&#x27;t varied to either big, or small. I wanted larger curls.. But I keep getting the same curl. Also, BE CAREFUL of getting your hair stuck. There is NO emergency release.</li>
            <li> I suck at doing anything to my hair, it is long and thick and will not hold a curl! The only time I am able to curl my hair is when I go to a salon and get it done and even then they only stay for a few hours. And the amount of crap in my hair is just gross. So I bought this hoping it would work, I am absolutely amazed that it did! It took me about 30 minutes to do all of my hair and the curls last all day at work and were still perfect all night. I highly recommend this curler, just please make sure you read the directions, and watch youtube videos, it&#x27;s really easy, but just make sure you are doing it right.</li>
            <li> This curling iron broke after the third use! I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. It isn&#x27;t eligible for return and is totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is not as simple to use as they show in the infomercial. I don&#x27;t recommend it at ALL. Maybe if they had a video on step by step instructions I might have a different opinion. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, and she uses it every day. The curls come out nice and last much longer than conventional curlers.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that could NEVER hold a curl.  Now I get beautiful curls every time that last!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 19 yr old daughter.... it&#x27;s awesome!  Quickly and easily curls her hair with a beautiful curvy soft curl.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure what to write on this one. It work great and has multiple settings to customize for your hair. Be careful, there is a little bit of a learning curve. It produced wonderful curls that stay in all day. I am used to it now butiI only place the curls in the back of my long hair. If I used it all over I would look like Shirley Temple. Probably would not buy again. I could achieve the same result with a curling iron and hair spray.</li>
            <li> Since i bought it, i&#x27;ve been using every single week.  Its easy to use alone. I cant live without it!</li>
            <li> very good quality, I recommend to you will want different hair comb, left very happy, thanks. hair is due as</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy from amazon but this is an amazing product. Usually my hand gets tired holding up a regular curling iron, but not with this as it sucks in the hair on its own. It&#x27;s also extremely easy to operate. I only got it friday &amp; have already used it twice without any issue of my hair getting tangled. Follow tne instructions and all will be ok. Just remember to use small bits of hair and make sure and clip away the hair you are not using until you are ready. I didn&#x27;t apply any product just to see how long they will last and surprisingly my curls lasted for the duration of my event.</li>
            <li> I thought that once I, placed my hair into the machine it would give me beautiful and bouncy curls but instead it did nothing. I have been trying g for the past 10 minutes but am getting no curl action. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick to a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> As A Licensed Cosmetologist I Had High Expectations And They Didn&#x27;t Even Come Close To What Was Pictured Or Imaged For This Item. The Idea Is Unique But That&#x27;s It! I Thought It Would Save Time But Have To Take Very Small Sections &amp; Still The Curl Was Barely There &amp; Flat. Maybe Good For A Beginner But It Will Get Caught In Ur Hair!!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair as it is but sometimes i straighten and just want to have the ends curled nicely, this product does just that.  I tried it on my daughters hair which is straight and her hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for her for her birthday. She has long, straight hair. She can use this herself. We read the directions carefully as you have to be sure to align it just so, when you are putting the hair inside of the tube.  She can do it by herself now. The curls are not uber tight -- they make \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; spirals. If she were take more time and do smaller sections, she could (most likely) get tigher curls. However, it is enjoyable for her to do it herself. Also, it helps that she puts some hair styling (curl) product on her hair while it is wet THEN when it dries she uses the Infiniti. Very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Very good product easy to use I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really works, now I have flawless curls. It&#x27;s amazing, really good product. Every woman who wants curls shoud buy it.</li>
            <li> it rolled up my daughters hair and did not release it when done, you have to leave the iron plugged in to try and get the hair out, but it keeps burning the hair, so after the smell of burnt hair in the house and her crying in pain by trying to free the hair we just cut off the piece of hair, the day before graduation,</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to curl hair with this. Each section of hair has to be held until the iron is done beeping and you can&#x27;t put too much in at one time. Hair got stuck numerous times. I am not an amateur when it comes to styling hair either. I tried it on my sister&#x27;s hair and it almost got burned because I couldn&#x27;t get it unstuck. I would rather use a regular iron. I read all the instructions and I know i was using it correctly. Worse thing is that it is expensive and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to return it even though it had only been two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good i really love it easy to use zero problems .&lt;br /&gt;It works perfectly ..&lt;br /&gt;FYI it depends on your hair is it curly wavy or strait</li>
            <li> I needed my hair styled for an upcoming event.&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair, so unless I spent three hours curling it with a standard curling iron,&lt;br /&gt;I would have to go to a hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a T.V. commercial for the Infiniti Pro by Conair.&lt;br /&gt;The commercial made it looked effortless to create perfect curls in just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Given my other options, I decided it would be less time and money to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was incredibly easy to use.  I just placed a section of my hair through the guide, closed the handle and waited for the beep. (If there was a problem, like too much hair, it beeped an alert and stopped the motor, so I didn’t need to worry about my hair being ripped out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one-third of the time it would take me with a standard iron, I was done. I had salon quality curls. This was one of my best purchases, ever!</li>
            <li> Did not curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this Curl Secret machine and it is a fake one. The original is 77W, this fake is 55W (it takes more time to be hot). When is hot it smells plastic melted. I&#x27;m not crazy enough to put my hair in this machine, I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;In the picture on the left is the original machine and on the right is the fake!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, when I do will post.  Looks great for now.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I was kind of scared because of some reviews, but mine works pretty well and my hair is holding the curls for a long time.</li>
            <li> Still did not figure out how to use this and I am a gadgets person. Grrrr</li>
            <li> Perfect curls, easy to use, take max 15 min, if you follow instructions you should not have any problems with it. Buy from reputable company as there are fakes out there!</li>
            <li> Trust me, It is not an easy tool to use on your hair! It doesnt really work as the way it is expected to, even if your hair is super silky and no tangles!! I do not recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> okay, so after reading reviews for a few months, i decided to finally get this and try it out. it&#x27;s on the pricer end of curling irons. but i love curling my hair. BE WARNED: using this iron does have a learning curve. my first few tries with the thing were very disappointing. my curls were not coming out, they barely resembled any type of curl. until i realized that after the 8-12 second beep/hold you have to let go of the handle and let the curl drop out without touching the edges of the iron, rather than pulling the curl from the device as you would with a curling iron. as soon as i mastered that slight detail, my curls came out picture perfect! it&#x27;s totally worth the purchase. the settings really do let you create loose to tight curls. i was a bit skeptical at first (thinking i might need to hold the hair in longer than the 12 seconds) for a tighter one, but if you do it correctly it will produce a cute tight curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is medium shoulder length and the iron worked like magic!! make sure you practice with it a few times before using it for a big night out. :)</li>
            <li> I love it love it oh my god love it.</li>
            <li> We love this. It is quick and easy. Be careful getting it too close to your head, it gets very hot. My daughter and I both use it almost daily. Great on all lengths of hair. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do so well for super long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I haven&#x27;t had much use for it since I got it. It isn&#x27;t suitable for thick hair cuz then it takes FOREVER to curl your whole head of hair since it only works for a very tiny portion of hair for it to work. I wish I can return it but it&#x27;s too late.</li>
            <li> Everything ok. Good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this product that&#x27;s why I bought it.  When I got it, I tried curling my hair but did not get the good result. The curls were just semi.</li>
            <li> I loving my Infiniti Pro! *-* You can buy it without problems! It&#x27;s the same thing that the other brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but so far I think it works well. If my hair gets caught it automatically stops rolling. Gave me nice curls on my very long fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT hold a curl this iron if truly amazing love it so much I bought a second on to have just in case&lt;br /&gt;My hair is extremely thick  so you do have to take small sections BUT the curl lasts three days at least in my hair.....totally recommend it!!,,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different ways to curl my hair. I&#x27;m still using the conventional curly to get the wavy look. Does not get hot enough for curls to really curl. Not a good investment for Long hair.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible curling iron. It is so easy! I have enjoyed using it on my clients and is well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This thing  gets my hair stuck everytime.....</li>
            <li> Horrible and scary!! Hair got stuck in the barrel and burned.  It was a nightmare trying to get the hair out, all the while smelling burning hair and unable to get the hair released.  Very traumatic.  There needs to be an emergency release button but there is not.</li>
            <li> I had some reservations about this curling iron but I&#x27;m so glad I got it. I started playing with it as soon as it arrived.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  Within 15 minutes all my hair was perfectly curled.  It took a little practice but I got the hang of it so fast and my hair looked great even though it was dirty and messy from being in a very messy bun all day at work.  I combed it out and curled away, the results were AMAZING!!!!  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I SUCK at doing hair. So bad. Before yesterday my hair styles included stick straight, messy bun, and natural waves. I have never been able to curl my hair. I have tried hot rollers, curling irons, curl wands, over night techniques, you name it. This worked so well on my hair! For my first time I used the highest setting out of fear that my curls would fall out by the end of the night if I used the lower settings. They turned out SO pretty, though a little more curly than I like, next time I will use the middle setting. Not only did they stay all night, but my hair was still perfectly curled the next day! I&#x27;m not going to say this is the easiest or fastest way to curl your hair, because its not. However, if your hair has problems holding a curl or if you are just terrible at using curling irons, buy this NOW. As for my hair getting tangled, it happened twice during my first use. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, there was no pain, my hair came out easily and I just brushed out the strand and did it again. I learned pretty fast that if you put more than what you can fit inside the little hook then it&#x27;s going to get stuck. This thing is pretty heavy, so be prepared for that. I was worried about doing the back of my head with this, but it wasn&#x27;t hard at all. Overall this is probably my favorite hair purchase ever. I&#x27;m so so so happy with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item elsewhere. I am NOT Amazon verified.... all my other reviews aread  on purchases I def made here on Amazon. I love Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly despise this item. It no way is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; or wonderful and the directions are idiotic. I have a high level of intelligence. I tried this  item and then came back here, fully expecting to hear similar stories... but no-- apparently I am the idiot who doesn&#x27;t follow directions, otherwise I would be delighted and buying this for half my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Conair: made in China. Cheap parts, cheap labor &#x3D; cheap product. Conair has ALWAYS sucked.  It is way too hot and the motor sounds like it had a problem the first time I attempted to use it. The heat is way too hot. For the person who said &#x27;go ahead and leave your hair in the chamber longer is a MORON. You&#x27;ll burn your hair off. The missing automatic release feature is just proof that it&#x27;s cheap. All the beeping in the world won&#x27;t prevent you from burning your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is super picky about how you hold it, how you put the hair in and how the hair is presented.  Not only do you have to comb, de-tangle and smooth out every tress -- but you will have to probably do it at least twice more for every other curl made. People on here say that you are a moron if you don&#x27;t follow those directions... well I followed them and my hair still got stuck despite being detangled, smooth, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1/2 -1&amp;#34; guideline of how much hair you have to put in the &#x27;chamber&#x27; is serious. You can&#x27;t put more in. Say each section takes the average time of 10 seconds to heat and you have 30 seconds per side, 30 sections on the back &#x3D; 90 sections. (remember this is 1/2 - 1&amp;#34; sections-- so this is actually the best case scenario) Apply some simple math and you&#x27;ve got 30min. Which doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot, but remember, you have to spend an appropriate amount of time combing, detangling (or risk being the moron who can&#x27;t follow directions) section your hair off into at least three large sections, THEN you need to pull each section out, comb, de-tangle, suck it in and THEN wait the 10 seconds, then take it out, move it over, comb, de-tangle, suck it in, and THEN wait the 10 seconds. So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item, it took me over 50 minutes to do a half-assed job that I ended up putting in a messy bun. At least half the time, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; the way I put my hair in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about anyone else -- but if you are over 30 like me, you don&#x27;t a) don&#x27;t care that much about ONE hair style -- and b) your arms are going to get tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it was possible to give a negative star rating I would.o can&#x27;t follow directions) section your hair off into at least three large sections, THEN you need to pull each section out, comb, de-tangle, suck it in and THEN wait the 10 seconds, then take it out, move it over, comb, de-tangle, suck it in, and THEN wait the 10 seconds. So in my case, apparently I am the &amp;#34;idiot&amp;#34; here who doesn&#x27;t like this item, it took me over 50 minutes to do a half-assed job that I ended up putting in a messy bun.

            <li> IT WAS RETURNED!  FOR SHORT HAIR IS NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Just received this tonight for my birthday! Talk about AMAZING curls! This model is the brushless version. I can see how someone could possibly get their hair caught, but not very easily with this one. You could also release very quickly if it was to feel off. It&#x27;s so simple and easy to use. My hair does not hold curls due to my very thick head of hair, but man, you see what&#x27;s happening! That&#x27;s also with NO hair spray!</li>
            <li> It works really well.  Curled my hair perfectly and curled my daughter&#x27;s hair... well most of it!  It broke half way through... SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes cute curls.</li>
            <li> This is a BAD KNOCK OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own and use the ACTUAL Conair Infinity Pro Curl Secret. I love it, it&#x27;s genius, it operates perfectly every time! I bought my unit at BED BATH &amp; BEYOND about a year ago (about $120 retail, and with their 20% off coupon it was just under $96 ish). My niece wanted one so I popped online and found one on AMAZON. When it arrived (AMAZON PRIME), I knew something was wonky, the box looked &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. Upon comparison to my original there were several significant differences. The wonky Amazon one was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIGHTER IN WEIGHT&lt;br /&gt;FELT LESS SUBSTANTIAL&lt;br /&gt;DARKER COLOR&lt;br /&gt;THE WARNINGS / MARKINGS ON THE UNIT WERE DIFFERENT&lt;br /&gt;IT &amp;#34;SOUNDED&amp;#34; DIFFERENT WHEN SQUEEZING THE HANDLE&lt;br /&gt;THE AMAZON UNIT HAS A VISIBLY DIFFERENT MECHANISM THAT APPEARS IN THE &amp;#34;ROLL&amp;#34; INLET WHEN IN THE SQUEEZED POSITION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND....the CONAIR LOGO is SOLID, (no fade lines on the &amp;#34;air&amp;#34;). I called Conair to ask if they EVER manufacture anything with a SOLID LOGO - they said absolutely NOT. I packed it right up for return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for the multitude of customers who have burned their hair in this unit. It would give me a lifelong negative association to the CONAIR brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RETURN IT, RETURN IT NOW.</li>
            <li> This tool does to my hair what the Chi flat iron does to my hair, only it makes it curly instead of flat; but the point is that it is quick &amp; easy and my hair cuticle is flattened making it look lush and shiny. I have somewhat coarse wavy/curly hair and this makes the frizz go away and my curls look normal - not a frizz fest. This is actually faster than a flat iron for me because my hair really fights being straight, but seems to love to curl. I can do my whole head of tons of hair in half the time of any other iron - flat or otherwise. Plus, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with tangling and I have long hair (about 2-3 inches below my brastrap).&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; it doesn&#x27;t curl it well at all.  I think it might work better it I had shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought this today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. After reading all reviews I knew to read instructions instead of figuring it out on my own. It is so easy and works perfectly. I love this!!! My hair had never looked better. It works great and is very easy to use. Well worth the money. However, I would not pay what Amazon has it listed for. I bought this at walmart for $99. It took me 4 walmarts to find it because it was sold out but I finally found it in stock. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good and easy to use</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about dropping a hundred bucks on a hair styling tool of all things, but I&#x27;m really glad I did! I watched a couple of YouTubers try it out and decided it was worth an investment. I am the woman with the pink hair in the product images; my hair is product-free in the images and I took the photos after using the Curl Secret and then going out for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think preference will vary from person to person with this product. I can absolutely see why some people who try this out still prefer more traditional curling tools. If you have trouble getting your curls to look right? Try this if you&#x27;ve been thinking about getting it. It does all the work for you and takes roughly the same amount of time as a curling iron. It&#x27;s not super speedy or magical, but it&#x27;s a really good tool! It&#x27;s especially good for people who can&#x27;t get the hang of clipless curling irons and are sick of dents being left by the traditional irons that have clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I was asked by friends when I told them about it, answered:&lt;br /&gt;-- Yes, it&#x27;s easy! Case in point: I had my completely hair clueless husband do the back of my hair for me the other day and he did just fine!&lt;br /&gt;-- Yes, it works! I get great curls and they REALLY last, even without product (this will range based on hair type, most likely.)&lt;br /&gt;-- No, it does not eat/trap your hair while it&#x27;s curling! The &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; is very loose and, unless you manage to severely tangle yourself in it, it lets go just like that as soon as you release the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;-- Yes, you CAN get your hair stuck in it if you put too much in or partially miss the feed when inserting your hair. No, it is not hard to get it back out, and no, it is not hard to get your hair correctly fed through.&lt;br /&gt;-- No, it does not damage hair (no more than any other heating tool does, anyway.) My hair feels just as soft as before using it and there is no &amp;#34;crispiness.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-- Yes, it works on long hair, though it works best on hair that&#x27;s above shoulder length to just past the shoulders in length. If your hair is halfway down your back this may only be good for curls that start partway up instead of near the root. If that&#x27;s what you prefer, awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid your hair getting stuck*:&lt;br /&gt;-- Read the instructions. No brainer, I know!&lt;br /&gt;-- Make sure your hair is tangle free before using.&lt;br /&gt;-- Do not try to feed too much hair into it. 1.5&amp;#34;-1&amp;#34; is about as much as it can take.&lt;br /&gt;-- Mind the feed (stay to the middle.)&lt;br /&gt;-- Don&#x27;t hold it backwards! The open side (with the exposed end of the barrel and text on the plastic) should be the side facing your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sometimes it just happens, especially when you&#x27;re doing the back of your head yourself! It&#x27;s not hard to miss the feed when it&#x27;s in your blind spot, but it&#x27;s not as scary as it sounds. Don&#x27;t panic; don&#x27;t yank or tug. Remember: A few extra seconds of heat while you get your hair out isn&#x27;t going to burn it off. Untangling it usually takes less time than it takes for properly fed hair to curl, but rough treatment may tear your hair out or get you legitimately stuck. The feed will push your hair out a bit so you can release pressure on the clamp and pull it out, holding by the roots with your fingers and wiggling gently as you go. 9/10 that&#x27;s all it takes.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! Make perfect curls Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I have been through so many hair curlers growing up and the curls never lasted longer then 1 hour. I&#x27;ve had long hair down to my waist to shoulder length hair. I changed to the heated hair curlers that you leave in for about an hour or so but it so time consuming not only do u have the time to put the curlers in you have that time you need to wait and leave it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair curler is AWESOME! You need to make sure you don&#x27;t put more then 1/2 inch of hair into the product to get some really good curls. I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair (little past my shoulders) and my daughters (her hair goes past her waist, very long) and for both hair types I have the same conclusion for how much hair you should put in to curl. Also there is a note on the curler that tells you which side should face your head so you don&#x27;t put your hair in the wrong way and get a pull from your scalp, I&#x27;m sure that would really hurt. You must make sure there are not tangles in your hair so there is no pull. The timer will beep when you should release. Now, heres the thing......I found that you need to do it twice on the same strand or else you will end up with more of a wave then an actual curve. Now this may be different for others depending on your hair type. Our hair type is just really straight, this may be the reason for needing to do it twice on the same strand. I tried to just leave it in the curler longer then the beep but that does not work. It really needs to be ran through twice. Now some may thing thats a lot of work but these curls last a really long time. My daughter and I have very thick straight hard to style hair and the curls lasted till the next day with NO product in our hair!!! Its well worth it in my opinion!!! What I love about this curler is you don&#x27;t need to worry about bumping it because it will not burn out. The only area that you need to be careful of is the side that faces the head. The actual hot curler faces your head so just make sure you dont have it touch your skin and you will be fine. Another thing I love about this product is while the hair is in the curler you or the person you are curling can move and not worry about pull! The hair will simply come out and unravel off the curler a bit, which is great if you are trying to curl a child&#x27;s hair! I did try to use it on low but you will not get much of a curl with a low setting so if you do want some really nice curls you need to have it on high. Its really not that complicated to use its very easy to catch on.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the curl I get from this curling iron.  The only drawback is the occasional tangle.  Once you learn how to use it, this doesn&#x27;t happen often.  Curl small sections and if you get a tangle, turn the iron off and be patient while you detangle.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to do.  Product got to me quickly.</li>
            <li> This hair tool did not create good curl on either of my daughters or myself. It grabbed onto one daughter&#x27;s hair and didn&#x27;t want to let go. We all thought it to be a ridiculous tool.</li>
            <li> This product makes beautiful curls but is also is very hard on your hair. I recommend brushing or combing through the piece of hair right before you put it in the tool so it most likely won&#x27;t get tangled up in it. IT DEFINITELY IS HARD ON YOUR HAIR WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE TOOL!! The process of pulling out the tangled hair from the tool not only burns the hair, but it breaks it. Personally, I don&#x27;t plan on curling my hair every day (probably once every other week) so this is perfect for me, but if you are going to use it every day, it seems more damaging than your every day curling iron.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to buythis product, I was a little scared it would not work but it does. I wash my hair then I brush the roots and let it dry, after that I used this curler at the ends and voila perfct wave  hair. I love it, I am saving alot of money and time. DONT WAIT LIKE I DID  JUST GET IT.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and with this I have a different look, it&#x27;s fantastic. I recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry, what&#x27;s wrong with you Amazon. I order Infiniti pro curl secret by Conair and you sent me some thing else named curl matic automatic curl machine. The one I order was model no CD203 and the one I got is CPCM1.  Mine was dark plum and this one is silver. I definitely will return it. it&#x27;s a kind of fraud that show something on market and send something else. It was a gift for my sister and Amazon destroyed my surprise.</li>
            <li> This is a great little machine that really leaves you with beautiful amazing curls.  You do need to careful not to overload it or hold it incorrectly or it will painfully eat up your hair and refuse to release it without very firm tugs.  Still it&#x27;s a great curler, just be careful also it does take a while to do your whole head, but once it&#x27;s done, they do last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use curlers before until I came across Infiniti Prof Curl Secret. I have magic perm hair (straight perm) and was still able to get perfect hair without drying my hair further more. The description is pretty accurate as well as some of the positive reviews of the product. This is fool proof, hassle free and best part is that you don&#x27;t have to use product to hold it. Buy it and have fun this summer with your curlers!</li>
            <li> I apologize in advance for the lengthy review..... I was on a trip in Dallas Tx, had forgot my hair styling products and tools, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  Before I purchased it, I read reviews and have to say I was scared to death after reading the reviews of hair getting caught and/or having to cut/pry hair off/out of device. I decided to try it anyways and started with a section of hair that would not be as noticeable if it did get caught. Thankfully I had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product.  The curls lasted all night and the following day. The curls did not dry, damage or frizz my hair. What I loved about this curling iron is the curls always come out the same and were consistently beautiful curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use the Instyler curling iron if I wear my hair straight and want a little boost (the curls don&#x27;t last otherwise) or Caruso steam curlers if I want curls in my hair which last 1-2 days and works beautifully with no damage (this is not always convenient carrying around rollers in a bag when traveling.) I have very fine, thick, hard to curl hair that easily tangles because it is so fine. My hair length is past the middle of my back almost to my waist. I have heavy high-lights on my hair, so I only curl my hair on occasions because of the time it takes to roll my hair and to prevent additional damage to my hair from curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have hard to curl hair, I have to use the highest setting that is supposed to give the tightest curl with the Infiniti Pro. The curls I get are loose, full body curls, like you see in magazines. It is very important to use the small sections as recommended.  If you get too much hair in the iron, it will beep at you and won&#x27;t take your hair. I find the best result with my hair, to start the curls about 2-3&amp;#34; from my head because of the length. It is also important to get the best results to have clean hair with no or very little product and comb out all tangles.  Since getting the InfinitiPro I have numerous people complimenting me on my hair and recommending I keep it curled. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps someone else who is scared to purchase this product.  It is quite intimidating with the cost and the thought of having to cut your hair.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> The product was deliveried very fast and it is working fine!&lt;br /&gt;Just perfect!! I loved it and will tell others to buy!</li>
            <li> It takes me about a half hour to do all my hair.  You have to use pretty small sections.  But works pretty slick</li>
            <li> it takes some time to get used to, and takes practice to make your hair look right, but I believe I will get great results from it.</li>
            <li> Got this because reviews were good......It&#x27;s a horrible product......hair gets caught in rotary base and burns!  Returned immediately.....Not something I would recommend for any type of hair....</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item.  Defective and you&#x27;ll ruin your hair.&lt;br /&gt;This unit should not allowed to be sold.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2S5WH0O20YK59]]After reading the many reviews of this product, it still sounded too good to be true, but I at least had to try it because I am SO inept about how to get spiral curls to stay in my long hair. The darn thing worked so well that I was inspired to take a video to document how easy, fast, and great it worked! Seeing is believing. From start to finish on my first try, my whole head of long hair took about 20-30 minutes to curl. Not bad! And I got compliments all night. Definitely my best gift from Santa this year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using the Curl Secret for almost a year, my original impressions still hold true. Still love it and it&#x27;s gotten easier to use. I get more compliments on my hair than I ever have--literally have strangers stop me and ask me how I did my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> For anyone saying they got their hair stuck, they obviously did not follow directions. I did my whole head (I have a lot of shoulder length hair) within 20 minutes and tight spiral curls. It&#x27;s amazing. Do NOT listen to the negative reviews and if you buy it, READ THE DIRECTIONS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. AMAZING</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair. I read online that this is perfect for people with thick hair; thus I bought this. I was so excited when I got it that I opened it immediately and read the directions and started curling away. The first three curls were beautiful. I went to grab the next section of my hair and boom it pulled the hair in but wouldn&#x27;t let my hair come out. I had two options: cut my hair (which I am growing to donate to locks of love) or break the machine into millions of pieces to get my hair out. I didn&#x27;t cut my hair... so I broke the machine into many pieces to find that the guard that is between the motor and the heater part was not such a good guard. My hair was literally wrapped around the motor. I have decided to return the curl secret with hopefully a full refund. I have photo evidence of why happened in case they argue that this is impossible. I bought a wand for $20 and although it takes a little longer, I will keep using the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great item. I just think that you need to not have thick, long hair. Make sure you do your research on the product and see if similar products are available cheaper. I am not sure why the price is $100 considering that you can buy a wand for $20 and it does the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes of trying to curl my 12 yr old&#x27;s hair with this tool that barely made the hair curly on the highest setting, she fainted. 911 was called and a trip to the emergency revealed this was a case of &amp;#34;hair grooming syncope.&amp;#34;  This has never happened to her with traditional curling irons, straighteners or crimpers.  Her pediatrician advised us to never use this again. Even though she didn&#x27;t feel the heat of the appliance on her head, the high heat traveled down to her hair and affected the nerve endings, causing her brain to shut down. Thankfully my daughter is ok now, but we are returning the tool.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair and I always felt like with the curling iron my curls were too loose and faded quickly. This make lovely uniform curls and they stay for more then 24 hours. It hard to do the back though. You have to be very careful not to take to much hair and hold the tool level. Take your time to practice on the front of your hair. Don&#x27;t freak out if it starts to tangle. Release before it tries to suck in your hair a second time and tightens and gently pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It takes a bit of time to do your hair with it since you can only part small section at a time. But when you get done, you&#x27;ll be happy with the results! I took this to work and showed my coworkers and did their hair. They loved it! It&#x27;s expensive but hopefully it will prove to be a good investment.</li>
            <li> 3 different adults tried this product on 4 different girls with different texrtures of hair.  None of us achieved an acceptable curl.  Perhaps the unit was bad.  It sucked the hair in and wound it but it didnt have much power.  Also, it did get hot but not nearly as hot as a standard curling iron.</li>
            <li> DIDNT DO WELL WITH SHOULDER HAIR, NOT ENOUGH TO GO INTO THE CURL ROD. THE CURLER ITS SELF IS BIG AN BULKY. RETURNED IT</li>
            <li> i already have a curly hair but every once in a while you would like a nice curl rather than a natural messed up one lol. anyway, i tried it last night and it was amazing. i slept and woke up and the curls were the same!!! amazing product and saves SO MUCH TIME when doing your hair!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I admit it. I did my research and read a lot of reviews. This kept coming up as one of the top models. So I decided to try it out. It was $60 cheaper than the one that someone recommended to me. You can see the results in the photo :) My daughters hair is very long and thick. It took me about an hour to do her hair. The curls are very tight and smooth. No frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of the features that were important to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 heat settings&lt;br /&gt;3 timer settings (depending on whether you want tight curls, loose curls, or a wave)&lt;br /&gt;Indicator light which lets you know when the unit is ready&lt;br /&gt;Indicator beep which lets you know when the timer is done and when you need to release the curl from the unit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a curling iron. This is much faster and easier! If you&#x27;re thinking about it, I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Awesome. My hair is to my waist and it works even for that length. Easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy how this curls your hair in a snap, without having to twist the iron around sections yourself. What a relief. However, my hair is pretty damaged right now, so my curls are not retaining as well as the should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do need a hair trim (makes a HUGE difference in curl retention) and a few egg-yolk masks (for protein filler) at home, as well as my usual intense moisturizing masks, to bring my hair up tp grade. I&#x27;ve been slacking, being busy at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this thing still did an execellent job with curl formulation. To get tighter curls, however, you DO have to use smaller sections. And if your hair is damaged like mine, be sure to massage in a few egg yolks for 15 minutes  (an incredibly effective and less expensive protein-filler mask), condition, and rinse, a few times a week, to get your hair in better condition, as well as moisturizing mask, and trims (to hold curl).&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you paste in this link, you will see the \\&quot;Southern Belle\\&quot; effect I ended up with for a few hairstyles... I had to tone down the jewelry  to avoid it. LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product. Do be careful not to overload with too wide of a section. Stick to 1/2 inch, or your hair will get caught.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I have permed my hair straight and now if I want curls I can use this. It&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s easy and it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser, and I like it!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
            <li> Did not work at all! Barely made a wave in my hair... my straightener works better at curling. The only thing positive was it was sent and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler. It does a great job, once you get the hang of it. Be sure to follow the directions and curl your hair when it&#x27;s clean and dry. My first time I used it, my hair got caught and I had to unplug it and literally pull my hair out. I didn&#x27;t have to use any product on my hair. The curls held up very well, and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens and expected it to be something that I would try once and never use. I have fine hair and my hair has never held curl all that well. I don&#x27;t know what it is about this thing. My hair holds curl and it looks freaking awesome. I love this thing and best of all it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have the correct length of hair but I have shorter layers so to use this I have to pull the shorter layers back into a half pony and just curl the longer hair. It works nice, no tangles at all. I read reports that hair was pulled or tangled into the machine, I found that to be near impossible to do. The machine just doesn&#x27;t allow it if you are using it correctly, the machine beeps and won&#x27;t curl hair if its not inserted correctly. Unfortunely while I can give this a positive review I am returning it, with my layers I doubt I would use it enough to justify the cost. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the proper length or longer layers.</li>
            <li> Awful. Jammed no matter how much I practiced or how much time I took to feed the hair in correctly. Just awful.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, slightly frizzy, medium to long hair. I always used flat iron but never managed to get nice curls with a curling iron. Every time I tried, it took too long, I burned myself, the curls never looked good, and were gone in minutes. I was curious about this product for a long time, and was hesitant to buy it because it sounded too good to be true. After weeks of reading mixed reviews I decided to give it a try. Wish I had not waited this long. So easy to use, a child can do it. It is just as fast and easy as the commercials show. The curls look amazing and last for days. I did get my hair stuck one time, but it was not that hard to remove it. I learned that, as long as you do small sections at a time, and comb your hair well before hand, it is the easiest thing (and even fun) to do. I used it on my friends with different types of hair and works great. Only recommend using some mousse before drying your hair to make sure the curls stay. Genius!</li>
            <li> my wife love it very much and she said its the best invention and she will not go to saloons again.....she said its easy and give excellent results in an easy way without frustration in no time.</li>
            <li> This product did not curl my hair at all when it worked. But I tried it several times trying to give it a chance. But it ate my hair and it got stuck inside of it. Once I almost thought I would have to cut it out, but it realized my hair in a knot. If it didn&#x27;t get my hair caught, it realized the hair completely straight. Terrible product. Do not listen to the positive reviews.  There&#x27;s no way they are real. I would tell everyone to not risk damaging their hair on this.</li>
            <li> This is for a Christmas gift. It is less expensive thru you than at retail stores, so that&#x27;s a plus. Hope the person getting it likes it.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, hard to curl hair but the Infiniti pro curler worked miracles for my hair!  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long to curl!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it (and I&#x27;m hair challenged) it works terrifically.  I have great body and have gotten many compliments on my hair (something I don&#x27;t usually receive).</li>
            <li> I was recommended to by this  product buy a friend who saw a professional hair stylist use it for a wedding event.&lt;br /&gt;She insisted that the results were great and that I should give it a try..&lt;br /&gt; I am very skeptical when it comes to curling products since I already have 3 of them in different styles.. I dont use them at all since they do nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt; I have fine  hair and not too much of it. I have been trying to curl my hair for years with regular curling irons. Even with spraying hair spray before and after, my hair would NOT hold the curls more than half a day... if that.......&lt;br /&gt; Ladies , this is the 3rd day and my hair STILL looks voluminous AND curly! WITHOUT ANY SETTING SPRAY! Unbelievable!!! This has to be the BEST beauty product I have bought for the past 10 years....&lt;br /&gt;  If you have fine hair give this a try. Please follow the instructions. Thats a must.&lt;br /&gt; Takes me about 20-30 min to do my whole head.but what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The barrel inside that is of  good quality  and the whole timer /settings procedure.. these 2 do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen you tube tutorials and read some reviews that state the product does not work. I have seen how it was used and I can tell why it did not work: strands of hair bigger than 1- 1.1/2 inches, holding the strand at an angle that does not permit easy insertion of the hair inside the barrel AND letting go of the strand of hair TOO quick ( if its a long strand).&lt;br /&gt; If you practice a bit AND pay a bit of attention you will get GREAT results. Every time! ( Im praying that this will never break!!)&lt;br /&gt;Make sure the strands of hair are combed throughout and the hair is clean AND dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only a little con.. ( lol).&lt;br /&gt;My hand gets a little bit tired from holding it at a certain angle for every strand... BUT I will take that any day and have nice curled hair for  3 days in a row...&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;PS: I use both max settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the most important thing : do not let go of the strand right away ( if its a longer stand)..imagine a straight line from the insertion point to the end of the strand. and hold the strand in this straight line for a lil bit until the barrel gets it all in... Its easy as that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!:)</li>
            <li> I love the curls that I get from this!  It is very user friendly but you must read the instructions first.</li>
            <li> The hair got stuck in the wand. It would not release my hair. Burned my scalp. Not happy with it. Very very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Tried this numerous times on my teen.  Not only does it take both of us to try to use it, it is difficult!  It pulls hair too easily and is really hard to get tangled hair out.  When we did get it to work (on very small sections of hair) the curls were nice however it would take forever to do an entire head of hair.  Beware - look for a different product as this one isn&#x27;t worth the price!</li>
            <li> The curl is exactly as described and soft. I will recommend this product to a family member and friends.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I sent the Conair curl secret back I read about it and thought it would curl short hair. It  is not for short hail! You can&#x27;t load short hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curler after reading all reviews. I have wavy extensions down to my rear and this curler worked great. It did get caught once, but that was on my second attempt to curl a strand of hair.  The amount of hair you curl at a time depends on how long and thick your hair is, you must use some common sense. I combed my DRY hair and curled about 1/2&amp;#34; at a time, holding my hair &amp;#34;loosely&amp;#34; as the machine pulled it in so that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled w/other strands causing it to get caught inside the curler.  I am really impressed w/this curler, I did my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair with no problem, her hair is down to her waist. I would definitely recommend it and might buy my mom one, if she is good. :)</li>
            <li> Awesome! At first I was hesitant, because it looked like it might be hard to use or tangle my hair...BUT it&#x27;s actually easier to use than a curling iron. Also, the curls come out perfectly and hold their curl for 24 hours, even after sleeping on my hair! I am 51, and have used a curling iron most of my life, and a flat iron since 2008. I am happy to say that although my hair is often kind of frizzy (and yes, colored from medium brown to blonde!), I have not had to use a flat iron before using this product. I use product to protect from damage prior to drying my hair and using styling products, of course. I am so impressed and over the moon about how CUTE my curly, soft hair is now! And it was SO easy to use, no danger of hurting your hair (it beeps at you if you do it wrong or have tangled  hair), as it gently wraps your hair around the barrel, w/o pulling. Plus it gets to parts of your hair/head that are hard to reach to curl. I have a fair amount of hair, medium length, and it took me about 15 min to do my whole head! Pretty cool! I&#x27;m all about doing the &amp;#34;girly thing,&amp;#34; as long as it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time! And this is FAST! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This should be marketed to those with long hair only.  I have chin length hair and find that the result is not as ilustrated on the ads.</li>
            <li> Good product, my wife is happy and uses it very frequently. She used it for her and our daughter. Well designed, must follow instructions.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to post with no stars so 1 star it is.  I&#x27;ve always respected amazon.com until now - I ordered this hair curler that my wife wanted for Mother&#x27;s day and what was sent contained an order sticker which said infinity pro by conair curler - new, however, the product shipped was a USED Miracurl knockoff, (used enough to wear paint off the handle) which came complete with beat up re - taped box and a good amount of somebody&#x27;s black hair tangled up inside it!!!  Are you kidding me?!?!  Gross!!!  I bought this through amazon.com but I guess the vendor was Bunche Park Deals, who I can&#x27;t find any information on with an online search. Amazon customer service did issue a return label and is in the process of a refund, but was not apologetic, or seem to be at all phased or care about the mistake. Ok, that&#x27;s all for now.  If the owner of the handful of black hair would like it back, please contact Amazon returns or Bunche Park Deals (if you can find them!)</li>
            <li> In love, and I would buy again. I tried that babyliss pro miracurl, and before I buy that one I decided to try this Infiniti Pro, and as I didn&#x27;t see any difference between both products I picked the cheaper one.</li>
            <li> gave it to wife for birthday and she won&#x27;t use it. She tried several times and it eats her hair and difficult to pull out and burns her scalp. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I returned it.  It caught my hair and it was a real mess.. .</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and it is difficult if not some times impossible to curl and this amazing product actually produces wonderful curls and waves on my hair that will stay all day without any hair spray if I wish and with hair spray it is beautiful and perfectly curled. Not only that, but it takes a fraction of the time I used to have to take to curl my hair. Thank you Conair for creating this awesome curling iron (if that is what you can call it).</li>
            <li> Purchased this when I saw it in the store, at bed bath and beyond, after seeing a brief video presentation. I used it on my hair a few times and then also tried it on my friend&#x27;s hair and it worked very well. Much better than using the wand where you can burn your hand or neck. Here is a video I did about this product.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Just used for the first time today. I highly recommend going on youtube and watching some instructional videos before using. I did that, and I had absolutely NO problems with my hair getting tangled. I got great curls - much better than if I would have used a curling iron. I have shoulder length hair and it took around 30 minutes. My biggest piece of advice would be to use SMALL sections of hair. The curl turns out so much better with smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Did my daughters very long straight hair and it came out beautifully. She had brushed her hair really well beforehand and it paid off because the curls were so neat and identical we left it as is and the curls looked really shiny. I then did my own, didn&#x27;t bother to brush it, just ran my fingers through it to get the more prominent tangles out,  I barely knew what I was doing because doing your own hair in a mirror wasn&#x27;t as easy as doing someone else&#x27;s hair. It came out looking very tousled (due to not brushing hair). I guess if it goes in messy it, it&#x27;s going to come out messy, at least the overall look was consistent. Considering I&#x27;ve never been able to master using regular curling irons, I give this a 5 since I managed to get the whole head done without burning myself, and it looked good enough (the wavy, messy, just got out of bed look) to go straight out!!!  Best results are achieved if someone else is doing it for you in my opinion but then again I might improve with practice. Just wish it was a bit lighter but I suppose with repeated use the forearm muscles won&#x27;t be so tired!!!</li>
            <li> Very usefull and the product is very soft. Its easy to use it. The shop sent before the time. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I can tell you, after testing it, that the product Infinit Pro by Conair Curl Secret Works as advertised. I just want to mention here that I ordered two Infinti Pro and I got two completely different products. Thanks to Amazon return service I was able to get a refund.</li>
            <li> My hair does not curl well with a curling iron. However one day when I went to a friend of mines house. She curled my hair with the curl secret. It might take a while because you can not put in thick chunks to get curled at a time. I loved it so much that I bough one myself this one is one of the cheapest ones and it is worth the money.  If your hair does not do well and gets stuck you can easily pull it out and it will come out. My friends hair is thick so it took longer but, I loved it and both of our hair turned out beautiful. So if you need a curling iron get this one!</li>
            <li> After the first few curls with this I was thinking to myself, &amp;#34;Well that was a waste of money.&amp;#34; I never use such small amounts of hair when I use a regular curling iron and thought I would spend twice as much time getting ready and end up looking like a poodle. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I love love love this thing! This is why:&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair. The type of hair that no matter what, after about 3 hours will look basically straight, especially in humid weather. I don&#x27;t even bother curling my hair if it&#x27;s raining outside! The day I bought this I curled my hair went to bed that night and when I woke up the next morning it was still curled. And I don&#x27;t mean just a little. It dang near looked like it did right after I curled it! I took a shower and did it again. It looked like it was going to rain all day, but I went out and mowed the yard for about 4 hours. It was still curled! Not quite perfectly, but I was IMPRESSED!! I have never had that!! Usually my hair looks like some wierd straight puffy mess. Then my son comes in with his friends and asks my why I&#x27;m all dressed up. I said &amp;#34;What are you talking about?&amp;#34; He said &amp;#34;You got your hair all fixed up or something&amp;#34; ok, he&#x27;s 19. See my point?? :) Don&#x27;t wait another second.... Buy this already!!!</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself and one for a gift.  I liked it so much I purchased another one and gave it to my daughter-in-law for her birthday.  We both really love it.  I have hard to curl, very fine straight hair and this curls my hair and it lasts for a long time.  Recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Its works really well. I would like it better if it rotated so I could make right curls and left curls.</li>
            <li> Tried many expensive curlers before giving this on a try. Such a waste of my time. This curler is better than the $150 one I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also curls my perfectly straight uncurling hair and it stays all day!!! Amazing. Oh yeah, my hair is to my butt... Very long. 😊❤️👍</li>
            <li> My says it works.  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries but it works! Coming from a woman who can&#x27;t use a curling iron this machine is a miracle. It weighs a little bit more than my straightener but not more than my blow dryer. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can only curl about 1-inch section strands at a time, I have a lot of hair so it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> This little thing is pretty cool. It works. The only thing is that it&#x27;s just a little heavy. When you have a lot of hair to curl it gets a bit heavy. Not like a ton of bricks heavy, just a bit heavy. Otherwise it is really great. And if you can get someone else to do your hair, even better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter.  She has long thick hair.  The second time she used this her hair got stuck.  By the time I was able to get her hair out it was fried from the heat and broke off.  She did not have too big a piece in it either.  It is supposed to have a safety feature but obviously did not or did not work.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have used traditional curling irons in the past, but none ever like this. I have a little longer than shoulder length hair and had absolutely no problems with the product. You need to use about 1 in pieces like the instructions say and they need to be brushed through. It&#x27;s really easy after the first few times. This product works extremely well and curls my hair from the root to the tips perfectly. The only thing I would say is that the product is a little bit heavy and my arm was getting a little tired after doing my entire head, but other than that I love this curling iron and it was well worth the cost. It works much better than the cheap traditional curling irons and I would definitely invest in this product. Overall I love it and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My 14yo niece got her hair stuck in this curler on her first attempt at using it.  It was about 3 inches away from her scalp and there was no way to release her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if she read the instructions or not - I care that she had this bulky curler stuck to her head and no way to release it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to remove her hair from the machine, we jammed a screwdriver into the curling wheel to turn it in the reverse direction.  The curler was damaged in the process and will be returned.</li>
            <li> This was Xmas present for my daughter. She now has curly, wavy shoulder length hair instead of pin straight thanks to this great product! She loves it!!</li>
            <li> Just got this for Christmas. I did my first practice run the other day, with hubby standing by in case I got tangled. I have a shoulder length bob, fine hair but a lot of it. I did a better job on the left side of my head (I&#x27;m right handed) than on the left or back. I only had it beep at me once for putting in too much hair. On the shorter hair in back, it still curled but you have to be careful to hold it in position because if your arm starts to sag, the hair will slip right out. The curls turned out really well on the left side, on the right they sometimes just did a weird wave, which I think was because of the way I was holding it. It will take practice to get both sides the same. However, the curls lasted all day and my husband was amazed at how different I looked. LOL! No tangles or mishaps. I&#x27;m planning to practice a few more times before I try it on a work day.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves me more now that I made her morning routine easier. How awesome is that? The seller sent my gift quickly and with no issues. The product itself takes some getting used to, but my wife still says she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars all the way!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do well on my shoulder length hair. But I used it on my niece and her hair was beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I got it for Christmas!  There is nothing I don&#x27;t like about it!  I have a lot of fine, naturally wavy, long hair already.  My sister who has poker straight hair also used it, and the curls lasted the whole day!  My curls lasted throughout the next day...even with sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;This tool is easy to use, and the time it takes is as long as it would be to straighten one&#x27;s hair.  Even if I put it in a quick pony tail, I can make a couple of curls, and I&#x27;m ready to go.  And, if you don&#x27;t want it very curly, you can create a lot of waves!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I loved the shape of curls produced by this tool, however, my hair frequently got stuck, even when used as directed.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for naturally straight and damage-free hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money and time. Frequently catches, knots and pulls your hair in to the rotating automatic barrel. Broke a little more than 30 days after purchase and have yet to get through to customer service......other than that....it&#x27;s great! :/</li>
            <li> I returned this product ..I was very dissatisfied with the curling mechanism .. If you put more than a quarter inch of hair in ...all your hair gets caught in the motor&lt;br /&gt;That was quite alarming ..</li>
            <li> I love this but gave it only three stars as girls across the country will be loosing chunks of hair with it!  If you are neat and organized when you are fixing hair then you should have no problem. If you are sloppy, then don&#x27;t try it.  Do not hold it close to the head as it will grab surrounding hair and get stuck.  There is no release other than pulling, tugging and praying to god that you can get  it out before you hair burns off.  Works well if you are not sloppy and grab the hair at least 1 1/2 inches away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> I am a tomboy who does not like to fuss with my hair.  For the first time in my life I have beautiful wavy locks that did not require hours of wearing rollers or struggling to curl my hair with a curling iron.  It takes me about 5 minutes to do my hair and for the first time in my life I feel like a hot woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think every woman should have access to this wonderful product!  We need to set up a foundation to make sure this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> This works amazing and I have told so many people how much I love this amazing product! I would definitely suggest you buying this. The only one thing is that if you have a lot of hair it may take some time because you can not use very big pieces or it will get stuck. If it gets stuck its no biggie it automatically releases !!! Such an awesome product. If you are considering you have nothing left to consider its AWESOME</li>
            <li> The product is what it said it will be but I have alot of hair so it doesn&#x27;t worked on me. When I tried it I ended up with like a 50 curls so I looked funny</li>
            <li> A hair dresser friend told me she heard this product was really awesome. She suggested I buy it &amp; said the next time she did my cut &amp; color we would try it out. I got the product &amp; read the instructions, it sounded easy enough so I decided to try it on my own. Big Mistake !! As it sucked my hair into the machine I could tell something was wrong, it was not sucking it in evenly. Once it stopped it would not release my hair. The is no way to make it release your hair. My boyfriend &amp; I both got blisters on our fingers trying to find a way to open it &amp; release my hair before it burned it off. We immediately unplugged it to stop the heating element. We went on youtube &amp; found others had the same issue. My boyfriend finally used a screwdriver to force it to unroll my hair. I will never use it again, I wish I could return it</li>
            <li> Once you learn the right way to use it, it does exactly what it promises. Great product at the right price.</li>
            <li> It is useful!I like it.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Curler is revolutionary. So simple and easy, you only have to hold it while it does all the work for you. It gives me full, voluminous bouncy curls that hold all day long, even through treacherous weather. For  $100 you couldn&#x27;t ask for more. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> great product makes curling your hair so easy breezy</li>
            <li> Birthday present for my granddaughter, she was ecstatic.  It was a joy to give her so much pleasure. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter whose hair is 26 inches long and thick. It does curl hair and is easy to use but does not work well on hair this long. By the time I got the last of her hair curled, the first part had already went straight. Would probably work fine on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and was very easy to use but did not perform as written on my or my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It only requires a couple &#x27;takes&#x27; when working the curler to get the hang of it and I did not get my hair tangled once, but my 14 year old daughter did a couple times.  There is a safety mechanism on the curler that stops it as soon as it senses a tangle - that worked every time.  The concept is great but when we used it on the hottest setting and kept in the curler for the max time, the hair still came out with barely a bend in it so we sent it back.  Someone else may have better luck if they have thin hair that curls easy.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair to curl  and when it does curl it falls out fast  The very first try with the Infiniti Pro Curl was a Big Success  I have colored hair that falls 4 inches below my shoulders and I was very impressed with the curls and how well they lasted. I used med heat and med curl and I just love the results. It took me about 20 minutes to curl my entire head. I would definitely recommend this product. If you read and follow the directions it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Arrived within the time stated, the device is great, works great! It&#x27;s perfect! Recommend to anyone who wants beautiful hair and curly.</li>
            <li> Watch out!  It did not stop as expected and tore my wives hair!  Beware of this when you purchase! Good luck!</li>
            <li> My daughter 13 wanted this and she loves it.  I no longer have to curl&lt;br /&gt;her hair she can do it herself</li>
            <li> My hair is the type that you have to use hairspray, mousse, and gel to get it to curl. I was curious about this iron. I do admit that on all my hair except for the bottom, it curls wonderfully. The downfall, no matter how little bot of hair you put in, it snags too easily. There were a few times it snagged and caught my hair so tightly that I had to yank it out. I almost had to cut my hair to get it unsnagged. I learned with this iron that the amount of each section for the most part can be usual so it doesn&#x27;t snag, but sometimes that doesn&#x27;t even matter. I saw a commercial for a different version of the iron by a differ company and I wish I saw that before buying this. The other iron guaranteed it wouldn&#x27;t snag your hair and have it caught to the point of almost needing to cut it out.</li>
            <li> Looked a a lot cooler than it actually is- works like it supposed to-- but a lot of work to use</li>
            <li> easy to use....and it is amazing!!! make sure your hair is clean, dry and tangle free and away you go. it&#x27;s actually fun to curl my hair again and not a long tedious chore!! my hubby loves it too...bonus!!</li>
            <li> I really like the Infiniti Pro.! The curls come out so pretty. The only negative comment I have is you can only curl a small amount of hair, I only use it to curl the front of my hair and finish it with the a wane curly for the back,  because it takes an hour to do the whole head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  She likes the concept, but has very thick hair.  In order to use this she had to pull out very small amount of hair or it would not curl.  First time she used it, it took her over an hour to do.  If you have thin hair i think it would work fine, but not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair, with an ugly kind of light kinky frizz.  I had been blow drying my hair straight for years, which is a process.  If I use a curling iron, the curls don&#x27;t stay in for more than a couple hours, even if I use half a can of hairspray.  And if there&#x27;s any humidy, forget about it.  I bought this at WalMart, figuring it wasn&#x27;t going to work and I was going to have to take it back.  It ended up being the best $100 I&#x27;ve ever spent on a hair product.&lt;br /&gt; I have found that in order for the curl to stay in my hair, I have to do very small sections of hair, so it takes me an hour to curl my whole head.  But the curls actually stay in for days, until the next time I wash my hair.  I have gone 5 days and the curl was still in.  I do have to touch up a few curls everyday (some come out depending on how I sleep and I have one small section of hair that just won&#x27;t hold a curl overnight), but it only takes me 10 minutes to touch up.  It has saved me so much time getting ready in the morning.  And I love my hair curly!  I get so many compliments on it all the time.  I have curl and body in my hair and even in some humidity, my curls stay in and don&#x27;t frizz!  On the day the do my whole head, I use the high heat setting and the 12 second timer (which is the longest) so I get the tightest curl and it will last.  For touch ups, I use low heat and the 10 second timer so I don&#x27;t over fry my hair.  Using this for 2 months I haven&#x27;t really noticed my hair being any more damaged than normal. Also, I do prep with a shampoo, conditioner and hair products for curly hair.  When I haven&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t curl as well or stay in as long.  May just be my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Warning, your hair will get stuck from time to time.  Only once in the almost 2 months I have been using it did my hair get really stuck that I panicked a little. All the other times, you get to know the sound and release the handle and your hair comes out.  What I have found you need to do in order to prevent this is use a fine tooth comb to comb out each strand before you curl it.  I do that and spray it with a heat protectant spray each time I curl.  The times it has started getting stuck is when I get lazy and don&#x27;t brush out the strand.  There are tons of You Tube videos out there.  Take a look and you will find someone with your hair type that is using it so you can get an idea.  I highly recommend this and love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  My wife loves it.  It curls her hair just like it is advertised to do.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Works great and my precious wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments about how good my hair looks after using this. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Best curl ever! I have one and love it!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 12 year old and she can do only the front of her hair. It works, but cumbersome to work and takes a long time,  I am not sure if I would recommend to a friend at this price.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is incredible easy to handle it. Just be carefull because it can hold hair inside the chamber.</li>
            <li> Great tool. Curls hair very nice.</li>
            <li> I think a curling iron better</li>
            <li> A few minutes after turning this on it started to smell like burning plastic. Did not even attempt to use it. Quickly returned! And I think one of the words on it was misspelled! Assuming its a replica!</li>
            <li> Very nice machine ... I love it .. I love it ... I love</li>
            <li> A little heavier than I realized.  Tricky to use left handed, but gives beautul curls.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on here, and some were negative, but most were positive so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had with regular curling irons is that the bottom of my hair always got crimped in a weird way, I burned myself a lot, and it took so long to get it all curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you follow the directions with facing the barrel towards your head, make sure your hair isn&#x27;t tangled, and don&#x27;t put too much hair in the machine it will work great. My hair is on the fine side and straight but curls pretty easily, so I followed the directions and it worked great. I only use the highest heat and number setting because i figured the curls will relax after some time. I sectioned off my hair and sprayed with hairspray after I was done with each section. I curled my hair in the morning and for the most part it lasted through the night, with some curls loosening only a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it takes less time to curl my hair and each curl comes out awesome if done right. Also, if you feel your hair pulling the wrong way in the barrel, the machine WILL stop itself, but you&#x27;ll feel it even before that machine beeps and once you loosen your grip on the curler you should be able to get your hair out no problem. I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair looks so good even looks good the next day takes a good 30 to 40 minutes but I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments i&#x27;ve only used it twice but I&#x27;m definitely going to use in a bunch did get my hair stuck one time had to get help from my hubby just got a screwdriver slid it under my hair and pulled it right out not sure would&#x27;ve been easy without him and off I was out to finish it i&#x27;m writing this product  &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for me and loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter, too. I cannot say enough good things about this incredible product!!! I have naturally wavy/sometimes curly hair, that is very long with layers and THICK. Why would I need this? Because my hair is unevenly waved/curled. Parts of it are curlier than others. This tool helps even out my hair and yet still allows it to look totally natural! The first time I used it, I used the highest and longest settings. I did find out that was too much; it gave my long hair too much of a Shirley Temple look. After that I used the lowest and shortest settings and it works great. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even wait for ALL of the beeps at the end before I let it out of the device. I can let my hair do its natural thing and then just touch it up in a few spots; it takes just a few minutes. Incredible! My daughter&#x27;s hair is more straight and finer than mine, but she loves it, too. She said she can curl her whole head in about 10-15 minutes, and the curls last, even though her hair is naturally straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the biggest skeptic when it comes to new products like this, and I CANNOT believe how well and easily this works! Try it!!</li>
            <li> Hannah has straight hair and a sensitive head.  It does just like it advertises!  Love the curls and use it myself! :O)</li>
            <li> mom likes it, she used for Christmas and i thought it looked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no complaints from her yet... and she complains a lot, so thats saying something.</li>
            <li> I read some of the initial reviews and decided to buy it. I was extremely disappointed because it did NOT curl anything at all. So I sent it back for a refund. I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this product.</li>
            <li> It curls mid length hair best. It does curl longer hair if you take small sections. More time consuming than I thought.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how to work this thing. I don&#x27;t think that it was worth the price.A typical case of the product not matching the ads. It does not work as well as they show on T.V.</li>
            <li> It is ok...kinda heavy and awkward to use, but with practice you can and the results are nice. The curls are nice. If I were to rate the curls it would be 4 stars but the item is heavy and you have to use little pieces of hair so it takes longer and so you can see how heavy it can get on your arm/hand.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this for Christmas - I absolutely love it!  My hair is a couple of inches past my shoulders, not thick but not thin, not coarse but not fine, and I keep it permed so that I can just &amp;#34;scrunch &amp; go&amp;#34; when I want to wear it down, but most days I just put it up in a messy pony/bun type of thing because I&#x27;m usually wearing workout clothes.  I&#x27;ve decided that I don&#x27;t want to go with the &amp;#34;scrunch &amp; go&amp;#34; look anymore - so when I do want to wear it down, this curler helps to smooth out the frizziness and is allowing my hair to grow out gracefully, sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler works great on my hair type.  Once I got past the &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34;, it now takes me 10-15 minutes to do my whole head, using the 12-second setting.  I put the top section of my hair up in a clippy, and do the bottom part first.  I do take fairly small sections, and YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT SIDE OF THE CURLER FACING YOUR HEAD!  Otherwise it&#x27;s going to tangle your hair in the curler - been there, done that.  But when it starts to tangle, you can feel it, and if you let go right away you can avoid the tangle.  You also have to let go of the end of your hair at the same time you close the handle, otherwise it&#x27;s going to tangle.  So, there is definitely a learning curve, and if you&#x27;re &amp;#34;directionally challenged&amp;#34;, this may not be the curler for you.  My curls last all day, my hair feels very soft (not crispy or over-heated).... in short, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I do not normally leave negative comments but for me this product was not worth the shipping. It does not curl at all. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did great on my medium length hair, just don&#x27;t put in too much at a time. It&#x27;s very quick and the curl stays beautiful with out alot of product.  On my daughter hair however had a a problem getting stuck a few times.. but she has extreamly long, (to her butt hair) so I just had to make sure to brush each piece and not put in to much at a time due to the length.  But she loves the look too.</li>
            <li> I got this roughly a month and a half ago. At first I loved it!!!!! It gave me perfect curls and I was able to do my whole head of hair in under ten minutes. Unfortunately, it stopped doing that about a month and a half in, now the curls come out limp, bent, and crimped. I have no idea why it is doing this and I&#x27;m really disappointed cause I loved this product at first.</li>
            <li> This product did NOT curl. I read all the directions prior to using. It also has a very short cord making it super hard to use when moving around your head to curl hair. I would give it a zero. Simply stated it did not work as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tina McKinley</li>
            <li> I have extensions and the curls fell out of my extensions almost instantly but my natural hair stayed curly. Loved the way it&#x27;s curled my natural hair though</li>
            <li> Following the success of the 1997 movie of the same name, featuring a long-haired Nicholas Cage, many of us were delighted by the introduction of the Conair line of styling tools, which allowed do-it-yourselfers to achieve Hollywood-quality hair in our own homes. I get a pretty good Colm Meaney-look out of this item.</li>
            <li> Everything the commercial says it is and more! I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I just got this curler today and cannot believe how wonderful it is. I&#x27;m African American with long hair. I was a little skeptical but that changed very quickly. Because I have so much hair, it took me an hour to put spirals in. The curls are still holding, shiny, and not frizzy. I read some of the other reviews and the reason why it&#x27;s frizzy is because you didn&#x27;t wait for the final four beeps before removing it from your hair. If done properly, your hair will be left absolutely gorgeous. The maker of Curl Secret is my best friend!</li>
            <li> This really work, is very very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;And make beautiful curls hair, in ten minutes without any effort</li>
            <li> Overall it actually does what it says, it curls your hair in nice ringlet curls and are even and uniform each time. I like this product, but you need squeaky clean hair in order to get the curls you want. It tells you to use this on clean hair which I do, but I have to use it right after I blow dry my hair in the morning. If I use this later on in the day after my hair gets a little oily than this does not produce any curls, just waves even on the highest setting. I like this product overall.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot thru Amazon and just don&#x27;t have the time anymore to write product reviews on every single item i purchase. On this one though I just really want to let it be known how awesome this hair styler is. I have naturaly wavy hair, but parts of it are straighter so I have always used different curling tools to create an even look. But I will admit, before the Curl Secret it was always more of a drag than anything else and I often opted for a pin up do instead for time reasons. Also the results were almost never just the way I wanted it to look: natural and even. Now that is all a thing of the past. In just a few minutes and with total ease I create the perfect look, and I am actually enjoying it because it is so easy. After experimenting a bit with the different heat settings and how much hair to put in at a time etc. I got the hang of it very quickly. It is truly easy to use, but it also creates the most beautiful and natural looking curls and waves. Also a great feature: the beep lets you know when it&#x27;s set so no more overheating hair. I have gotten countless comments since I use the Curl Secret. Mostly people thought I just came from a high class salon. It is a bit more pricey than most devices but I really think it is well worth the money. I love it so much that I am considering getting a second one, just in case. Well done Conair, I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Love this curler!  I don&#x27;t like getting up early, so I love that it takes ten minutes to curl my whole head!  I haven&#x27;t had tangling issues and there&#x27;s a safety on the curler anyway. It is heavy.</li>
            <li> I got the Curl Secret today and was so excited to try it out! I was a little apprehensive, seeing as I read some reviews that hair got stuck and had to be cut out or that it didn&#x27;t work on thick hair. For the record, I have normal hair(and lots of it!) halfway down my back. I read all of the instructions first, which I highly recommend. It has to heat settings and 3 different timer settings. When curling my hair with a curling iron I crank it way up, but I only used the low heat setting and it curled just fine. It will only take around 1/2&amp;#34; of hair at a time and I brushed each 1/2&amp;#34; section before sticking it in the Curl Secret hoping that would help prevent my hair from getting stuck. I was SUPER excited when perfect curls fell right out! You have to make sure you keep it closed and it will start beeping, but don&#x27;t open it until you hear the 4 quick beeps in a row. It was a little awkward at times since you have to use your right hand, but not too bad. It makes a loud beeping sound if you put in too much hair or if it starts to get caught. I&#x27;m not sure how anyone got their hair caught enough to have to cut it out, but my hair caught in it a few times and it stopped spinning and my hair came out easily, no scissors required to free it! I had to go over a few pieces twice because the curl looked a little weird, but I think it just takes more practice to get it the first time. Overall, I LOVE this! I was never good at curling my hair and the curl always fell right away, but this has lasted all night. Just remember...READ THE DIRECTIONS FIRST!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have short hair a bit shorter than shoulder length. The curling iron doesn&#x27;t leave a tight hold in my hair. I believe it is because it is too short and it is wanting more to hold on to for a tighter curl. I am growing my hair out so I can try it again. I&#x27;m looking for a tight curl that I can finger through and loosen.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is great at holding curl, so that is not the issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the description of this product. My hair doesn&#x27;t come out as curly as the description says it will when set to a certain setting. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair like mine, nothing curls it easily and curls do not stay long- this did not work well.  Plus my hair is shoulder length which makes it worse.  You have to use such a small amount of hair to get a curl, it would take forever to do my hair.  If one has course hair and some natural curl, it may work well.  A lot of money to be sitting around the house not being used.</li>
            <li> My curls don&#x27;t spend time enought. When i finish my hair, i haver to begin again because the curls i did in the begining has gone.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair and I thought I would try this product to make tighter curls. Not only are the curls beautiful, they stay in for days,plus this product is so easy to use..I would recommend this to every woman who wants to put a little sass in her hair!  Mary Lou Johnson</li>
            <li> It fulfills my need. It will save my time to make my hair done that I could not do it before.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me as a Christmas present.  I talked about it so much and so she bought it for me.  I was really excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair but enough, it is long and in layers.  The curls do not hold on tight although I put it on the highest setting.  I literally can only take an inch or less at a time which takes extremely long when you have long hair.  Not to mention that at times it may get stuck or it will pull.  It works well on my shorter sections but not the long ones.  I&#x27;m a little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use! My hair never held curl and with this it lasts all day! I love it.</li>
            <li> The Curler is easy to use. I would like for the curls to be a little more tighter. I am not using it as much has I thought I&lt;br /&gt;would. Good for those going to work that like a polish look.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;perfect curl&amp;#34; does, in fact, create &amp;#34;the perfect curl&amp;#34;!  You don&#x27;t have to be in the hair business to work this baby, it&#x27;s pretty idiot-proof, albeit, your hair can get caught in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawback--it&#x27;s expensive! :(</li>
            <li> I got it a couple weeks ago for my birthday and I LOVE it!!! I am terrible at curling my hair with a curling iron and I can do all my hair in about 15 minutes with this.  I have gotten it stuck a couple times but have just flipped it off and unwound it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promised. I was so excited to get this for myself I also bought one for my sister. My hair is long enough to curl with hot sticks but not too long that this would be a pain. So i take a shower and let my hair dry naturally. Then I tried this out with much patience. I had to repeat the same small section 5x and then it wasn&#x27;t much curl at all. Not worth the trouble! I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour or more curling my hair when I can use hot sticks and have curly hair in 5 min. My hair is color treated and baby fine.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair. I followed the directions exactly and used small sections of hair at a time. It barely left a curl even on the highest heat and time settings. My hair was frizzy afterwards. Very disappointed. It might work better for someone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this petrified and intrigued, I had read bad reviews, but loved the idea. I had my hair stylist on standby for when I ripped out chunks of my hair- like reviewers promised.&lt;br /&gt;I believe in Conair Infinity Pro products (LOVELOVELOVE my Spin Brush), so I blew $100 on a chance. AND I LOVE THIS MACHINE. I read the directions! Weird! I have thick, colored/damaged hair mid-length down my back, I did my entire head in 30 minutes, first time, and my hair was not pulled once. It&#x27;s not hard, girls! Keep the control buttons towards your head. And for those saying that larger sections were rejected- try try again. Don&#x27;t put it so close to your head, I tried the same thing again and most of the time it worked, if not I moved it 3mm from the roots and blam, it worked. Another &#x27;secret&#x27;- just because it beeps that it&#x27;s not accepting the strand; it&#x27;s still in the chamber, it&#x27;s still curling. Wait a few seconds, it curls, whether it likes it or not... My hair looks great! It&#x27;s actually ridiculous! It&#x27;s curled, it feels healthy and soft. It&#x27;s been over an hour since I did it and it looks exactly the same, no hair spray. Honestly, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it, it&#x27;s intimidating, but it&#x27;s really a fun and awesome experience! My hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about it. The curl won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The Curl Secret does deliver nice curls but I found it tedious to learn to use. My hair got tangled at least half a dozen times during the curling session and I must&#x27;ve selected the wrong setting because they fell out within 2 hrs. I will need to buy stronger hairspray. For the time it would take me to perfectly feed it hair, I would&#x27;ve been done with curlers! I personally prefer using a curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;I will become an expert at this but as excited as I was to receive the Curl Secret, I have yet to pick it up since the first try!</li>
            <li> This is a heavy curler but if your anything like me and have a hard time getting perfect curls this a must</li>
            <li> Best and easiest curler ever!!! I Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> In my experience of the product he really good and deserves 5 ​​stars</li>
            <li> My daughters and daughters-in-law love it, find it easy to use, and it does a great job. Excellent product - Great.</li>
            <li> Bought for my 11 year old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it.  She is getting into that grow up stage and looks lovely with curls.</li>
            <li> I watched several tutorials and tried several times, but I was never able to achieve real curls.  I would save your money, this thing just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love it! It works really well. I could never curl my own hair but now I can with this curling iron!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and I spent most of my time pulling my hair out of it.  AWFUL!  Beware, not made for very long hair, it jams up and you have to literally pull your tangled hair out of it.  I thought I was going to have to cut my hair out.</li>
            <li> Sold me a defective, counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> This is a very dangerous product, I purchased it for my 15 year old granddaughter, she styled her hair with it several times , then it rolled her hair around it and would not let go.  I had to tear this thing up with a screw driver and pliers to get her hair out.  I also burned my thumb  badly and had to put cold water towels on her head to try not to burn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a terrible experience for both of us, her with it burning part of her hair off and burning my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Horrible! Expensive and it doesn&#x27;t work! Uuugh I hate to waste money!</li>
            <li> very good product and delivered just in time</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone.  It is also fun to watch your hair get pulls into the chamber .....then ,,,poof,,,perfect curls!</li>
            <li> Best $100 I ever spent. I use this item almost every day.  At least five of my friends have purchased their own once they saw my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it just looked too cool to pass up. I have very thick fairly long hair so I figured if it didn&#x27;t work I would simply return it. That was not the case at all though....after one time using it im hooked! It takes me 45 to straighten my thick hair....I curled my whole head perfectly in about 30 min....normal curling my whole head would take 2 hours. My hair didnt get caught even being long....only one time it didnt spin my hair up right so it automatically stops so it doesnt hurt you. ... overral awesome! Plus if u dont like it amazon is awesome with returns.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this thing is actually worth the money. It IS very high priced, but it works. It can be a little bit hard to do the back of your hair by yourself, but not impossible. Very easy for someone to assist with as well.</li>
            <li> What else can I say, it does exactly what it says. I have rag-rolled my daughter&#x27;s hair many times and we get great, twisty curls. But that takes nearly an hour, sleeping on it overnight, taking them out the next morning, and dealing with a little frizz. I&#x27;ve tried different curling irons and can&#x27;t get any sort of curl that looks good, much less stays for any length of time. These curls (best with some product in the hair first) are twisty, soft, and beautiful. The biggest plus, We got through her entire head (I did it in two sections, top and bottom, about 10 curls each section) in about 15 minutes. I have a feeling I will be doing this a lot over the next few years...</li>
            <li> I give this item only a one star. The reasoning is I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this item.  Some said &amp;#34;DON&#x27;T buy it it tangles your hair and then burns it.  Well I kept reading and more of the reviews sounded ok.  well I am here  to tell you DON&#x27;T do it.  I did everything by the instructions, and It wound up my hair so tight that I could not get it out.  IT SAID IN THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT IT WOULD REVERSE,  BUT THATS NOT TRUE.  I hurried and unplugged it, but it was to late.  It burnt and tore out a chunk of hair about 1 1/12 wide and my hair is about 18 inches long.  I cannot believe that they can sell something so potentially damaging to peoples hair.  I cannot believe that some people gave this a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; rating.  Beware on this purchase..</li>
            <li> so I have tried and tried to get this thing to work, I&#x27;ve tried it on 5 different people including my own and I get maybe 1 curl out of 10 strands of hair.  I have read about this and have watched youtube videos and I still can not get it to work...i am unsure if maybe I got a defective one, or that these just suck in general...i am going to give it one more try hoping I can see some improvement if not, I will be sending this 100 piece of crap back!!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I have to admit I was a little skeptical... But I was surprised that it really works! It was weird at first to get the hang of it, but even on the first try it produced that perfect curl! It did tangle my hair a few times, but all I needed to do was release the handle and I can easily pull the hair free with no issue. My hair is very long, down to lower back, and it had no problem taking the hair in. I would suggest those who have frizzy hair like myself to run a flat iron over the hair to get it nice and straight, and it makes it easier to separate sections of hair. I have read some find the product too heavy, but I had no problem holding it. Took me only 15-20 minutes to curl all my hair. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who is never realy happy with my hair. I see cute styles on others and can never get my hair to look as good. I impulsively bought this out of desperation and LOVE it. No issues with tangling once you learn to get the hair in the groove properly. It is a bit heaven but I figure it is a good work out for my arm muscles. I feel like the price is a lot of a curling iron but I also look at all the money I have spent on perms over the last few years. It is a quick easy way for me to do up my hair and the end result looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> Really a waste of my money. I really wish I had not ordered it cause now I have to pay to return it..  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> Wonderful and easy to use.  I purchased this for my 9 and 10 yr old granddaughters  who can use it without help.</li>
            <li> If you use the high heat setting, the curls stay in until you wash your hair again. SHE LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dreaded curling my own hair for special occasions with the round iron...but not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro doesn&#x27;t waste any of my time and gets the job done in less than 10 minutes. It heats up real fast and has 3 different sets so you can control how thick or thin you want your curls to turn out.&lt;br /&gt;The time is set automatically allowing 3 paused beeps so that each strand of hair gets the same exact time of heat and then beeps 3 times (fast) when it is complete...then you can release and VOILA!!!&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was hesitant due to the high price but it is DEFINITELY worth it!</li>
            <li> Love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret.  Works wonderfully. Would recommend this product.  Works for very good for long straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product! My hair is already curly, but it makes the curls controlled and uniform. However, you have to take care you are not taking too much hair into it, because the machine can &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; you hair or burn it.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would indicate this to a friend. Actually, my friend tested mine yesterday and loved it too. She just ordered one for her!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant but now that i have figured out how to use it the curls are fab!!! And the best part is they dont fall, i would recommend de-frizzing your hair for better results</li>
            <li> Amazing !!! Perfect product, Perfect curls, I am totally addicted to it Now! Truly recomend it! Very safe too! ★♡♡</li>
            <li> I really wasted my money on a product that I was dying to have. My hair is just too short for this so make sure you have lengthy hair for this product.</li>
            <li> The best ever:)))))))))</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack. Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely what I wanted.I saw some video reviews on YouTube before ordering, one said ir was great and the other wasn&#x27;t able to get the handlg of it.I still felt like going with the good review and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros.&lt;br /&gt;- its so simple to use&lt;br /&gt;-its not too heavy as mentioned in some reviews.&lt;br /&gt;- I have medium length, heavy hair and I was able to get beautiful curls in about 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- my curls stayed perfect throughout the dinner and even till the next day after a whole nights sleep ( i did use hair spray though)&lt;br /&gt;- you dont have to worry about burning your fingers ( I almost did every time I use a regular rod)&lt;br /&gt;-you&#x27;ll have a big smile on your face when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.&lt;br /&gt;- it did mess up 3 times,but you&#x27;ll know instantly...it&#x27;ll make a different sound while curling.So I just stopped and pulled out my hair and tried again.Perfect curl.&lt;br /&gt;- 90% of the curls were flawless, 10% are included in the cons.&lt;br /&gt;-the whole sucking in and the sound of the machine might seem scary...but relax...something gorgeous will come out :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Take about 1 inch of hair,not vertically or horizontally but preferably in a bunch.brush them well and then put them on the machine.you&#x27;re set...use hairsray once you&#x27;re done :)</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. A must-buy for people that normally can&#x27;t curl hair!</li>
            <li> The best thing since sliced bread... seriously.</li>
            <li> Lousy I am currently trying to send it back.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea n got this. It works magic and ur job gets so easy and done much faster.. And I think I over used it and my hair got damaged really bad.. I still love it and got my sister the same thing as gift, but now I am a bit more careful while I use it..</li>
            <li> Have problems its heats up then it turns off have to wait until it cools down to use it again not good purchase!!!!: (</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but have been getting Keratin treatments for five years for smoothing, frizz free hair. However, I hate my hair bone straight and love love love soft, gorgeous &amp;#34;Victoria Secret&amp;#34; curls which I can only seem to get when I go to the salon for a blow out. I have every curling iron and flat iron known to man in my bathroom but my curls have never been perfect and my curling irons seems to do so much damage to the ends especially. I saw the Infomercial on the Infiniti Pro and I got excited but thought &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need this! Stay away!&amp;#34; but I crumbled and bought it. The first time I tried it I was scared to death to be honest - afraid my hair would get sucked in and never come undone but it worked perfectly, as demonstrated in their videos, and the results were the most amazing frizz free curls I have ever had! I&#x27;m addicted now and often curl my hair just before bedtime so that in the morning I have beautiful curls as I&#x27;m rushing out the door for work. BUT, beware. I tried it on my best friend&#x27;s 9 year old daughter and I didn&#x27;t properly brush her curls first and her long hair got STUCK! We were all so scared and it took us about 10 minutes to get her hair out safely (after I of course quickly unplugged the machine) so be careful and make sure you follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Love this by infiniti! Works fabulous and doesn&#x27;t take long to get your curls!</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  Have to take small pieces of hair and make sure you use it properly.  If so, the results are great!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife 9 months ago.  It still works.  She uses it regularly.  Her hair looks nice when she does.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I got mine for my 16th birthday and I love it. I was nervous at first because their are a lot of different products like this with different names. I have always been into make-up and hair and had a wand curler then when I saw this I knew I had to have it. I love it. The first time I used it, it was so easy. I curled my hair and my friends hair (who have long thick hair). It worked perfectly on both of ours. You can also play around with the type of curls you want  your hair too have. It is so easy that my boyfriend has even learned to use it. Granted, I have to pick out the strands of hair all I have to say is use your common sense. If you have doubts about that piece of hair getting tangled or not then maybe make it a bit thinner. Even when doing small strands the curls are cute a fast. I really love it and it has become the best product I own. I use it all the time for everything. You really dont have to be skilled to use it. It takes time and it will get tangled but even then it is not that hard to get out. Just do yourself or someone else a favor and get this. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it but says 4 stars for the reason of it catches her hair and rips it out..</li>
            <li> Tried it several times. Hardly put any curl in my hair and jammed most times no matter how little hair I worked on. Packing it up and sending it back.</li>
            <li> IT states that you cannot get your hair stuck in it but thats a lie. My hair got stuck in it so bad I almost had to cut it off. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Very nice and practical. I would recomend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very bad for curly hair... Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t has any problem!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy uncontrollable hair. I either have to straighten it or role it.  I like this item. The curls turned out very nice! With the time settings (12, 10 or 8 seconds) I can have anything from tight curls to wavy hair.  The only trouble I had was due to split ends. It pulled my hair nicely into the unit, but my split ends get pulled a little harder, but it wasn&#x27;t painful. I like the unit and would recommend it. I gave 4 stars because it pulls my split ends.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friend&#x27;s--she has no idea how to curl hair with a normal curling iron. After I was done showing her how to achieve the exact same look as this product with a $15 curling iron in 10 minutes versus 15-20 that this one takes, she was bummed she spent this much money. And I was honestly not impressed--and I look for any excuse to buy a product that makes great curls. The problem is this device is one-dimensional. It can&#x27;t really achieve the versatility of curls that the 1/2 - 1 inch barrel curling irons can. My recommendation is to save $80-100 and watch some youtube videos on how to make these simple curls with a curling iron. After two or three tries, you&#x27;ll be doing it with a cheap curling iron in under 15 minutes. And it will look better--you&#x27;ll have more control over your hair and timing. Meh, conair. Meh.</li>
            <li> I call this thing my little hair robot!..im in love, i have long thick crazy hair..and within 15-20 it gets all my hair looking beautiful!..and i love love love that the curls stay till the next day , and when you go to touch up the curl the next day it looks even more amazing!</li>
            <li> Works well. I like it</li>
            <li> Gave as a birthday present to my daughter, and it pulled her hair and did not curl. Would like to return for a refund. DId not meet expectations as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is Very easy to use, you don&#x27;t need practice, everyone can use And have a beautiful hair! Very good</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic, and my wife absolutely loves it! She can now do all her own curling in half the time the traditional curler takes. Be mindful that large locks of hair don&#x27;t work well in the auto-feed mechanism. Make sure the locks are small enough that the device can pull and wrap effectively.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and this curler is amazing!! I have never had such strong beautiful curls that seriously lasted for days. I highly recommend this product. Take your time and follow the directions and it will work for you as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this item AT ALL...made my hair dry and lifeless looking and the price is ridiculously high for it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curler! Best Investment EVER!! I get so much compliments when I curl my hair, some people even ask if I just came from a saloon! And it stays till I wash my hair! The curls are soft and bouncy! so happy with this purchase! a little expensive but totally worth it. I am giving this as a christman gift to my best friend! She loved her curls when I did it on her hair!</li>
            <li> Love it, the curls last for days.  The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls.  Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li> This was my last resort. Curling irons just did not work. Blow dryers caused frizz. This styler makes nice curls without the frizz. My hair is smooth once I am finished. I have a lot of thick hair, and it does take some time and effort to obtain the results I want. With this hair curler I don&#x27;t have to pay a lot of $ or make an appointment or drive somewhere, I just style my hair in the privacy of my own home. As long as you comb out the lock you are putting into the curler and have it facing the correct direction, this works.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my niece after she tried my daughters.  She just loves it.  She is a teenager and is really into styling her hair and this has been a great tool and a time saver as well.  As with most teenaged, she sleeps till the last minute so she needs something quick and easy.  Would recommend to anyone with long hair and wants natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is just not ideal for fine heair...but i gave it several attempts, but my hair got tangled and burned each time.</li>
            <li> I could never get this thing to work a waste of my money. I was really looking forward to it but was highly disappopinted</li>
            <li> I used this about 3 times and then it quit.  It makes me angry that I spent so much on it and now it doesn&#x27;t work.  I followed the instructions, and no matter how small a strand I put in it, it just beeps.  The warranty requires me to fork over money to ship it back to them AND send them a check for shipping to send me a new one, which will probably fail as well.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro is so easy to use and fast to finish a wonderful hair style. I followed the steps that the instructions told me and made a perfect curly hair. I also used it on my friends hair, and it worked out very nice. I love this instrument!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this curling iron to me, saying that her hair never holds a curl except when using this iron. I was really excited to order it but what I received instead was the MiraCurl Nano Titanium by BaByliss Pro. At first I thought this was a cheap knock off because the box looked really shabby and awkward. Then I did some research and found out that BaByliss Pro is the higher end professional use line done by the same company by Conair. I thought I had scored a more expensive item at the less expensive price, but then I did some MORE research and found out that the version I had was a fake. There are a few telltale graphical signs on the box (I knew that box looked off!) as well as on the device itself. Amazon processed a return label for me and helped me re-order the Infiniti Pro from a different seller, but I ended up canceling that order because I&#x27;m so annoyed with the whole process. I may do more research on the authentic MiraCurl and end up ordering that in the future.</li>
            <li> This item pulled my wife&#x27;s hair. If I could rate this zero I would.she would not recommend this to a friend.  She said that it was messy dangerous and not curly.  She liked nothing about this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend read the instructions, and when she tried to use this for the first time, it pulled and twisted her hair and would not release.  We had to unplug it to keep it from continuing to pull her hair in.  Even with the unit completely switched off, the motor would run while plugged in.  Ended up having to physically break this in order to free her hair.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very good.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well on soft young girl hair</li>
            <li> I hate this curling iron.  Bottom line - there is no emergency release button.  It sucked in my daughters hair, wrapped it around the inside barrel and then jammed.  There was noting we could do to get her hair out of this thing.  It would not release the hair, it didn&#x27;t beep nothing.  We tried unplugging it and still the inside roller held onto her hair.  We had no choice but to cut her hair from the curling iron.  She had a huge hunk of hair only 2 inches long from her scalp.  I HATE this poorly designed curling iron.  Conair received an email from me and I&#x27;m awaiting a response.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick and coarse hair and this made it really easy for her naturally curly hair to turn into pretty waves.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the outcome of this product. I love it. It does everything it shows and says it did.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to get hair tangled in it unless your hair is perfectly straight. It was more time consuming to use instead of just a curling iron</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I guess it&#x27;s because my hair is kind of wavy, and the product make my hair goes the other way, so my hair gets kinky when I use it.</li>
            <li> Actually 1 star is too high the item was defective and does not work at all. I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at curling small sections of your hair.  It takes too long though.  If I put more than two inches of my thin shoulder length hair in then it will either get caught in the chamber or not do a great job. Also, I found that it&#x27;s not a good idea to go over the same area more than once as it just burns the hair with little curl.  I&#x27;m not the only one that had this problem. A friend of mine used it and she freaked out when her hair got stuck.  The key is not to panic but to try and remain calm and GENTLY untangle your hair out of it. That is much easier said than done when your hair is smoking and tangled up.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was suuuuper excited to try the Curl Secret! My hair has never held a curl for more than an hour or two, and now, it will literally hold curls for days! My hair is very fine, so the low setting works best for me. I started off with the high setting, but it started burning my hair. And as everyone else states, stay calm if your hair gets stuck! Release the handle and slowly pull it out. And the easiest way to prevent tangling is to brush out the section before placing in the iron, and keep the sections to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Hair got caught in it several times.  Ended up throwing it away because I didn&#x27;t want to tell anyone it was worth using. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Might work better on someone with long hair. But shoulder length didn&#x27;t do much. Really just easier to curl with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair got stuck in in first attempt. Had to break the thing apart to save her hair. Horrible product!!!</li>
            <li> THE WORST PRODUCT I EVER TRIED. &#x3D;( EXTREMELY UNHAPPY. IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK AND MY HAIR GOT STUCKED. IT WAS REALLY SCARY &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This product is really good! I couldnt make curls so perfect as this product does. Safe if you know how to use it correctly (if the hair gets stuck for any reason, just keep opening and closing and the hair comes out). I have long hair and Im done in 5-8 minutes! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>
            <li> It is the only curling iron that actually curls my hair.  I have zero hair / nail skills and always had to pay someone to do it for me.  The only thing you have to be careful of is keeping within the 1/2 inch width of hair that you put in the curling iron.  More than that and it will tangle.  I have long (middle of my back), fine hair; I usually have to set the curling iron about halfway down the shaft to avoid tangling as well.  The automatic detangler doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> It got tangled in my hair very easily.. Even woth very small sections and then It broke so easily!!!</li>
            <li> he product has come defective, it aspires to the hair inside and burning the hair is horrible, I even think this product is counterfeit, wanted to know what you want so that I will receive my money back? sucks !!!!!</li>
            <li> loved it! so easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. This is the best hair curler I ever had. The delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li> If I could give this curler 10 stars I would!  I have never in my life gotten such amazing curls as I do with this product.  As the other reviews say, it does take some practice, but once you get the hang of it, your hair is curled in no time.  I get so many compliments when I curl my hair with the Pro Curler, even from people that I don&#x27;t even know.  My hair is fine and always seems limp, even when I use hot rollers.  I have no hand/eye coordination so a wand never worked for me, and I never got the results that I do with this.  The curls last forever as well.  My sister was skeptical but once she tried it, she decided to go out to buy her own.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This tool is a godsend.  I&#x27;ve only touched my flat iron once, since purchasing this item.  I&#x27;ve also put this puppy through the ringer.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my hair after having it up the night before where my hair had air dried from a wet up do with plenty of product to give that natural curly look.  It stood up to the test and even produced better results with the presence of the previous product.  Surprised as even the instructional booklet explained that clean hair works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a ton of negative results and I don&#x27;t understand why.  Folks are having a hard time getting this to work, or their hair gets caught up.  If this happens to you... you&#x27;re doing it wrong.  I have extremely long thick hair and even with product have yet to get caught.  There are mechanisms built into this item that help prevent situations in which it will &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; your hair.  Follow the instructions provided on how to insert/remove hair and there won&#x27;t be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed with how long the curls hold.  I&#x27;ve never had even half the success with a curling iron that I have with the Curl Secret.  Plus... it is diverse in what kind of curls it provides.  Less hair &#x3D; tight curls and more hair &#x3D; a slightly curly to wavy look.  Try this out.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> If used correctly this thing is amazing!! I had my hair done by a professional for my sisters wedding and she used this on all of our hair. Our hair was done at 9am and the wedding wasn&#x27;t until 4. The curls lasted all day, they were full and bouncy with no frizz. Needless to say ALL of the bridesmaids want to purchase one. The wedding photographer even asked about our hair and said that she will be purchasing one. The curls are amazing and so uniform. I highly suggest it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use after a few initial terrifying seconds. End result comes out perfect and works faster than a curling iron if you don&#x27;t have to them or skill.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to purchase this curler after reading such rave reviews!  I waited patiently, with plans to curl my hair the very day I received it.  It came a day early, which was awesome, and I immediately opened it to try it out.  I read the instructions, followed them, and everything worked exactly as said except for one major problem:  NO CURLS!!  It sucked my hair in, did the slow beeps and then the quicker consecutive beeping, I released, and my hair was NOT curly.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one or what.  I tried different settings, hoping for even a tiny bit of curl.... nothing.  I tried it out several times, and did not experience the tangling or hair getting stuck that others have mentioned, but still no curls.  Since that is the entire purpose of the devise, I will be returning this item and I have to give it one star.  I have never had problems with my hair curling with any other curling irons (including many Conair ones), so it can&#x27;t be my hair.  I have never given anything a one star rating before, but it had ONE job, and that was to CURL my hair, which it did not do even a little.</li>
            <li> I read the review….and said it will not happen to me.  The product never work correctly and often would tangle my hair.  It NEVER curl it worth a damn.  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FOR A PENNY!</li>
            <li> I bought the curling iron for my daughter for Christmas. She had seen one that a friend of hers was using and wanted one. She loves it !</li>
            <li> I have hair products up the wazoo. Every time a new product comes out I run out and try it. When this product first came out I didn&#x27;t run out and try it because I JUST KNEW it wouldn&#x27;t work. I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair so I like to straighten it and put just a little bit of wave in it. I was at the store and spotted the Infiniti Pro and decided to buy it because, what the heck I had a coupon and the store has super easy returns, and I just knew that I would return in the next day. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. Ladies I was amazed at how easy it was to use, how not tired my arms felt and how un-singed my fingers were. I have a wand and I would use the little glove to protect myself and I would always end up burning myself anyway. The only way to burn yourself with this thing is if you stick your finger in the dang chamber. Small sections is KEY. If you do it right you&#x27;ll get the hang of it and it will take you less time than if you try to shove a bunch of hair in there thinking it will give you faster results. No dice. Follow the instructions, trust them, and practice makes perfect. :)</li>
            <li> I saw this on t.v. and wondered if it worked.  It made my BONE straight, limp hair and made it bouncy and curly.  I now can have sexy beach waves or tight spirals in 30min or less.  It was easy to use, just make sure not to try to curl too much hair at once.  We&#x27;ll worth the money</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight so I like curl.  This curler did nothing for me. I would not recommend it if you have very straight hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter. She said she was greatly disappointed it. She didn&#x27;t think it was worth the  amount of money it cost.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair but tends to fuzz by the end of the day. Tried a lot of different curling irons but this one worked great, takes time to learn how to use it, glad my hair is somewhat thick as it did pull some out during the &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; process but right off the bat I was able to curl my fuzzy hair into curl&#x27;s within about 15 minutes! Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Personally, I love this product.  I have incredibly thick, coarse hair which is just above my shoulders.  When blow dried it is typically wavy with some frizz.  For years a flat iron (babyliss) has been my salvation.  I have tried curling my hair for years, but I am hopeless when it comes to curling irons so when I stumbled across the Babyliss version of this product I was instantly intrigued and began reading about it and watching youtube video demonstrations.  I was randomly walking through Belks and saw the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret on their clearance table (by accident, but I argued and they honored the $47 price) so I picked it up.  I have been so happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now had the product about a month, and I have had no troubles with it.  I assume people who are getting their hair stuck are not reading the instructions that clearly state to section your hair into 1/2 inch sections and hold the product with a specific side towards your head.  By accident I have put too much hair in and it beeps at me, informing me that it won&#x27;t accept the allotted hair.  The whole process takes me about 15 min, the same time I would spend with a flat iron, ironing in sections, and the curl holds for me about 3 days, when I am due for my next wash.  My hair holds a style very well, so I assume it could go longer if I dared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am deducting a star is because the curls only go in one direction.  Some of the more elite versions of this product have choice of curl directions and alternating directions, which I would like.  I also notice some frizz which I could probably tame if I knew how without destroying the curl.</li>
            <li> I have never seen , as esay to use hair curler as this one before, i was never able to curle hair by myself. Now I can seriously say that this one is one of must haves for women, you may not have  as perfect hairstyle as you can get from proffesional but you can have everyday beautiful natural looking curles. Curles don&#x27;t last very long,but that&#x27;s better that I used to have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews stop you from buying this. I have medium to long hair, thin but lots of it. Naturally wavy (not pretty wavy) and very frizzy. I love it. I used it for the 1st time this morning, Like another review I read, once you lean how to hold it, it got easier. I did just fine on one side, but when I would try to curl the opposite side, I was having difficulty trying to figure out how to hold it. I was making it a lot more difficult than it was. Half way through fixing my hair this morning I turned pro!. 6 hours later  my curl are still intact. I wanted lose long curls so after curling all my hair, I ran my fingers through it several times. I also used it on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this curler.  Works perfectly for her although I am drafted to curl her hair as I can get to the back of her hair more easily than she can.  It is very, very easy to use.  I can&#x27;t comment on long term durability but for now it works great.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to learn the tool but once you get the hang of it its fantastic! Love using it on my hair, and love it even more for my 3 year old! She has fine hair down to her bum and it took about 20 minutes to curl her hair while she sat and played with my iphone. No worries about hurting or burning her and she was so excited to see her princess curls. For me the curls last through the night and fall out by morning with hairspray. Without hairspray they last a few hours before they start falling. It takes about 30 minutes to curl mine. (hair a few inches below my shoulders and super thick)</li>
            <li> It burned my hair.  It pulled my hair and I was in pain.  I lost a bunch of my hair with it.</li>
            <li> First time this was used was on my granddaughters hair. Even though we followed all the instructions properly, it tangled in her hair. Also, this is very expensive for something that didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I am the least talented person k know when it comes to styling my hair.  It is fine, but I have a lot of it and it doesn&#x27;t typically hold a curl if my life depended on it.  I saw a commercial for this and decided to try it out. I was initially pretty nervous; I&#x27;ve gotten into some doozies with other styling tools and something that sucks your hair into a machine could have been dangerous for me. It works wonderfully!! It is very easy to use, and while I have gotten my hair stuck I open the chamber as soon as I feel it pulling. My hair will hold these curls all day long!  The only thing I&#x27;d like to see is the ability to have different sized chambers for different curls. The heat and time settings are nice but don&#x27;t give me a huge range of curl types.</li>
            <li> Got for my wife she is not a big fan of this. It could be her hair but she never uses  it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool.  Even in humidity may hair will stay wavy for at least 2 days (haven&#x27;t tried to go beyond that).  It&#x27;s much easier to use than a regular curling iron.  No crimped ends!  All the curls are the same direction.  The timer makes it even easier to make sure all your curls are uniform.</li>
            <li> Work fine, it is really good.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and it&#x27;s very easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish it cost less but amazon had the best price I found anywhere.  I love this and so does my 5 year old with long hair who doesn&#x27;t really let me do her hair- so score!  It takes some practice but I have gotten better with every use.  It can get hung up if you don&#x27;t do it just right but untangles easy and you can redo that piece instantly.  My arm gets tired cause you do have to use rather small sections and it&#x27;s not light.  But I love it and would tell anyone interested to go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> OMG. This is the only machine that keeps my fine hair curled WITHOUT any product in my hair. Like everyone said, read the directions or put the curler down.</li>
            <li> This is an updated review. I&#x27;ve had 2 of these so far. The first one stopped working within a few uses, so I called con-air and they sent me a replacement. This new one has worked a while (a few months) and I LOVE this thing. I have been wanting to give myself beach waves but using a curling wand is dangerous and takes forever. This thing practically does it all for you. It&#x27;s quick and easy and makes my hair look awesome. I want to give it more stars, but this second one stopped working again. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I might look at other brands and replace it with something similar because the idea of this is just super and I love wearing my hair like this, but I can&#x27;t keep buying these if they keep breaking.</li>
            <li> I would give this zero stars or negative stars if I could. This was a good concept in theory, and honestly I was really excited about it. When it came it was a HUGE disappointment! First of all, most of the times when I tried it, my hair got stuck and I had to yank it out. Once, my hair was stuck for a good 10 minutes and I was working strand by strand to get it untangled. Second of all, when this product actually did work(Which wasn&#x27;t very often) the &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; that it was supposed to produced didn&#x27;t look any thing like a curl. I thought that it would turn out as good as in the video. That must be fake because my hair turned out floppy with random parts puffed out and sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t even do anything to my hair at all. I can&#x27;t believe how expensive this is. Huge waste of money. I strongly encourage you NOT to by this. Potential buyers beware it will literally pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> a little hard to use at first. But once you get used to it, it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been doing hair forever and NEVER have I had to chop off my hair because this machine grabs it and will not let go and then it burns the hair!  Threw it away!  Had to cut off my hair to get it off!</li>
            <li> I LOVED EVERY THING ABOUT THIS TOOL. IT WORKS WONDERFUL. EVERY FEMALE OF AGE SHOULD PURCHASE ONE. LIFE W/MY HAIR IS GREAT.BEFORE THIS TOOL, AFTER WASHING MY HAIR IT TOOK 3HRS 30MINS TO STYLE MY HAIR. NOW,IT ONLY TAKES 1 1/2 HRS TO WASH AND STYLE MY HAIR. THELONGEST LENGTH OF MY HAIR IS 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK ! I WOULDNT BUY</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and it does not hold a curl hardly ever without a half can of hairspray.  I was reluctant to buy this and feared my hair being caught in it and needing cut off.  I am so glad I went ahead and bought it.  Not only was it super easy to use but the curls lasted for 2 days.  The best past was it only took 20 minutes to do my hair instead of close to an hour and the curls were soft and flowing because I used next to no hair spray.</li>
            <li> I get my hair chemically straightened, so I had pretty much relinquished the ability of my hair ever being able to have it hold a curl (since I opted out of the curly-haired life) though every once in awhile for a special occasion, I wished that I would be able to do something to it.  I have tried regular curling irons and a lot of hairspray but a few hours in and it just looked like I forgot to run a brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Curl Secret has changed all of that.  Not only does it put a curl in my hair that holds, it doesn&#x27;t require any hairspray.  Day 2 after I had curled my hair, I still had some serious beachy waves without any mousse or spray.  Also, its beeping mechanism tells you exactly when a curl is done and the hair never comes out too hot.  (When I used the curling iron, after I released my hair it was scalding.  I can only imagine the damage I did to my hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cons are you have to do small amounts of hair at a time (I have a lot of hair and its long so it takes awhile) and if you don&#x27;t line it up with your hair properly, it gets stuck pretty easily.  Once you get the hang of it, it seems to be less of a problem though.</li>
            <li> Actually it didn&#x27;t fulfil mu expectation as the voltage is not dual which restrict it&#x27;s uses only for the country with 120 v 😔</li>
            <li> This thing actually curls!  I have very fine hair and the curl held.  I hadan easier time with this than with my curling iron.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I loved this product! Now my hair has amazing curls! ;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Cris Porto</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, not for shorter hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Hair seems  to get &amp;#34; stuck&amp;#34; sort of scared me, but was able to get hair out. It gets very hot . The demo is misleading.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and her past her waist hair. She loves this thing. Curls without cursing that last longer than the other curling irons. It even tells you how long to hold a strand of hair in its grasp. She thinks it was worth the money,but then again, her mother bought it. Juss say&#x27;n.</li>
            <li> es verdaderamente impresionante como funciona</li>
            <li> I have watched the infomercials about the Curl Secret for months and was so excited to find it on Amazon.  Works great and my curls look phenomenal. :)</li>
            <li> love this product! I have very thick hair and it worked like a charm. I actually did my hair the evening before and was able to wear it the next day and only had to touch up a few of the ones around my face. I only twice had to stop and it gave the alarm that I had in to much hair and it released it and everything was good! Regular curling irons take forever and there are never enough rollers in a hot roller set for all of my hair... this took me only about a half hour and my hair is a little past shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and followed them.  I was doing the curling in sections.  It got stuck in my hair; if I had not unplugged it, I believe it would have pulled my hair out of my scalp.  My husband and I managed to get it far enough away from my scalp to cut it out, but we both burned our fingers doing so.  I can&#x27;t imagine having a product like this without an emergency release.  Thank goodness the 8 inch section of hair my husband doesn&#x27;t show because it was on a underneath layer.  Pony tails are problematic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star is generous, they should have negative stars.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, probably medium thickness.  It took me several tries but by the third time, I had it down.  It takes a while because you have to do hair in 1 in or less sections but each time I do it, I get faster.  I recommend this for those that are hair styling challenged such as myself.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about trying this, but I did and it is amazing.  It is very easy to use and creats the most beautiful curls you&#x27;ve ever seen, with no effort!  If your hair is getting stuck, then you are holding it the wrong way.  A few times I have grabbed too much hair at one time, and it beeped at me and reversed my hair back out.  All I had to do was release my grip to open it, and my hair came right out.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Works nicely when it doesn&#x27;t keep my hair. Not sure why my hair gets stuck and I have to pull it out... Also burns hair.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly easy to use and makes a soft curl. It takes some time as the amount of hair you can put into each curl is fairly small but still worth the effort. It&#x27;s a nifty hair tool!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this because of all the good reviews.  I have long straight baby fine hair that never holds a curl.  I started curling my hair and I was loving the curls.  My hair got stuck a few times and the curler immediately released my hair.  About halfway through curling my hair, my hair got stuck!!!  The curler would not release my hair!! I immediately unplugged it and tried to untangle my hair and get it out.  I even tried taking it apart by unscrewing it.  I was upset and seriously was ready to cut my hair!  Finally after about 45 minutes I was able to untangle my hair!!!  The hair that was stuck was a bit tangled and fried from the iron, but at least I didn&#x27;t have to cut it.  I immediately packaged it up and returned it!!  Definitely not worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck in the barrel and I had to yank the curler off my hair breaking off my hair! Terrible...NOBODY needs curls that bad!</li>
            <li> This is a product that has delivered the promised results as expected!!!! This product was also reviewed on WNEP-16 news and Kurt Aaron proved its worth!</li>
            <li> Brilliant.  Once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27; t work. I expected the same results as I saw on tv, but got nothing close. In fact, it didn&#x27;t even resemble a curl. I followed directions to the letter.  My hair is medium texture, curly, blown smooth. I returned it for a refund but was out the postage. Would give it zero stars because it gives zero results.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair which my whole life never really curled using a curling iron. I have had some luck with electric rollers. My hair lacks body;so I colored it to help with it but up until now I have never had a curling iron that added this much curl. This is like a miracle for my hair. I was very very hesitant to buy it and even when I received it I was  afraid to put my hair through a contraption like this curling iron due to the reviews I had read. I read the directions carefully, also I went and watched a youtube video of someone using it. This is the fastest way for me to get beautiful curls and waves. I totally love it I had no trouble with tangling in the machine. I feel beautiful .</li>
            <li> This product truly needs to be recalled. My daughters hair got stuck the first time, bad. I went and read reviews and realized others were having the same problem. I followed the pointers given, fresh trimmed hair, hold wand properly, smaller sections. It was only time before once again, the hair got stuck, and bad. We really wanted to keep the machine for its great curls but decided it just was not worth the hair getting stuck, etc. Nice Curls though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic curl. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying don&#x27;t be frightened away by the negative reviews you might read. I always search reviews of products before I make purchases, especially ones that have higher price tags. At first I was worried after reading peoples horror stories of needing to cut off their hair because it got stuck in this styler. I still really liked the concept of this styler and took a chance. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! I couldn&#x27;t use a curling iron to save my life. Even when I did manage a curl or two with a regular curling iron the curl would fall out within two hours.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got my Curl Secret I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. Like many of the positive reviews I reiterate &amp;#34;read the instructions&amp;#34;. Be sure to have the styler facing your head in the right direction, only use 1/2&amp;#34; - 1&amp;#34; sections of hair, and make sure your hair is tangle and product free. At first I struggled finding a comfortable way to hold the styler. It is a bit awkward until you get used to it. Put your section of hair in, squeeze, it twirls your hair in, wait for the beeps, release, and you come out with a truly amazing curl.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how any of the people who wrote negative reviews were using this styler to end up getting their hair stuck. If you try to put too much hair in the styler beeps and will not pull your hair in. Pretty simple there.&lt;br /&gt;Aside from how easy this is to use I absolutely love how long the curls stay in. I curled my hair and after a ten hour work shift it was still as curly as right after I did it. Plus, the next day they relaxed a bit more and gave a softer look. I have done nothing but rant about this product any chance I get. Don&#x27;t let those negative reviews scare you. Buy it!!</li>
            <li> It worked extremely good the first few times then it kinda didn&#x27;t work as well the other times . Need to use very little hair</li>
            <li> This works better than you think it would. Very easy.</li>
            <li> Works well. Able to curl and style easily!</li>
            <li> Love it!  The curls stay very well and it doesn&#x27;t shorten your hair like when you use a curling iron.. I was hesitate to spend this amount on another hair tool but with three girls it will get used. great buy</li>
            <li> I tought it was 110W and it is 220W and it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool. Works on even tough to curl limp hair. Very easy to get used to. Just let go of the hair it has to fall or it can&#x27;t be sucked in.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Tedious but works well.</li>
            <li> I just got extensions a few weeks ago and I quickly became aggravated with the amount of time it took to curl my hair with a curling iron then it would fall out soon after putting all that time and effort into it&lt;br /&gt;So I looked into getting another tool that was much more effective at applying curls to my hair I was definitely skeptical about the curl secret by Conair but I tried it and I was greatly impressed it is so easy and fun to use and it quickly curls your hair&lt;br /&gt;At first I was not using it correctly but after letting it&#x27;s completely warm up and letting the tool pull the hair in all the way it worked incredibly well</li>
            <li> Fastest and simplest way  to get Curls</li>
            <li> I was the ULTIMATE skeptic!  I have wasted, yes wasted, thousands of dollars on hair products, hot curlers, curling irons, flat irons, elixir&#x27;s, potions, etc.  I have been looking at this little gem for quite awhile.  My hot rollers finally bit the dust so I headed down to the nearest drugstore to replace them and there, like the Xmas tree in &amp;#34;Whooville&amp;#34;, was a display, lit up and featuring this incredible product.  Well, I don&#x27;t need a brick.......I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At first it looked like a weapon but as I read the instructions &amp; calmly tried it out, it became my friend.  In fact the Pro Curl is one of my closet friends.  He has replaced my &amp;#34;HUGE&amp;#34; hot roller&#x27;s set. My curling irons &amp; sponge rollers.  When I travel, I simply put the Curling Secret in my bag &amp; I a ready to go.  One of the MAJOR things I love about Curl Secret is that..I wear extensions. (To use this product on your extensions, they MUST be human hair, not synthetic!) I was frustrated trying to style them.  Well here came the Pro Curl to the rescue.  My hair looks great, my extensions are beautiful &amp; I feel like a million.  Thanks Conair!*</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. I was sold by the reviews and feel like I need to post one to affirm that this really is a great product! I love to do the small curls underneath, the medium curls on my side hair, then the largest curls on the top of my head. The look that this creates is a very beautiful mess of curls. I love that it lasts with or without product, like hair spray. I love this curler and it was worth it! Also, my hair has gotten caught just a couple times- just open up the clamp, it comes out. No need to freak out or &amp;#34;wait til your husband&#x27;s home to use it&amp;#34; or anything. Soooooo easy. Very fast. I have thin hair, can do it all in 15 minutes easily. I love the three sizes of curls it can give.</li>
            <li> I love this invention, and so fast! done in seconds</li>
            <li> Was a great product until my hair got stuck ( I am a professional and know how to use this) over time my hair built up and it gives you a little item to wind the hair out. But it stops working and over heats. So mine over heated and did not spin.&lt;br /&gt;Best item I thought and was extremely thrilled and got many people .. Friends clients ect to run out and purchase but it seems to get loose inside the device and stop working . I spent a ton of money on a few of these and of course unreturnable</li>
            <li> Even when I do small amounts my hair gets caught</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a problem with this item.  There is a short circuit into the cord power.  I want to know what can I do for fixing this matter.  I added a pic for explanation where is the problem.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Believe it or not it actually curled my hair!</li>
            <li> Umm....... this was just a bad idea. not only did it just eat my hair up. If you have a lot of hair... this product is not for you.  If you have thick hair, this product is not for you.  Amazon has a great return policy and once i got my lock of hair out of it I returned it.  It also completely fried my hair crispy (the part that was in the curler).. I guess I will just have to stick to the curling iron.. there are no short cuts in life apparently.  This also didn&#x27;t curl my hair... more like crazy weird curls.</li>
            <li> very easy to use and won&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> use it every other day, doesn&#x27;t damage hair as much as the other curlers. My hair looks natural and receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! my hair is about shoulder length and VERY thick and wavy. using a regular curling iron or a curling wand it takes about an hour to do all my hair. i was able to curl all my hair in about 20 min on the first try with the Infiniti Pro, and all my curls turned out great! its very simple to use once you get the hang of it, and is pretty much idiot proof. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old daughter and it is a hit!  She has had it for about a month now and uses it all the time. Very easy to use and the curls last all day.  Her hair did get caught a few times, but too much hair was put into it.</li>
            <li> The curls last all day even when used on very straight, hard to curl hair!</li>
            <li> This is only good for hair that are long, waist level or longer.  My hair length touches my bra strap and it didn&#x27;t do any curls for me but just soft wavy tips.</li>
            <li> OMG! This is the BEST invention ever! I have ZERO experience using a curling iron and always wanted to be able to do so when I felt like dolling up,. However, when I tried doing it, I always manage to burn my hair or the curls comes out looking like Shirley Temple curls. Not my style. But with this FANTASTIC machine, I can have tight curls, wavy curls, and medium loose curls. I AM SO in LOVE with this! I wish they would make a product for 3&amp;#34; barrel size so I can make BIG curls too! :D THANK YOU, Conair, for such an AMAZING product! Now I don&#x27;t have to pay salon to curl my hair. :D</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! I bought this and after 6 uses and never letting it fall the cheap plastic gear on it broke and this is really upseting because the product is anything but cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Not only I hate it because it broke when being new but also I noticed that I had to do the curl hair strain twice to get the curl (max heat and lenght of holding), even though I sprayed heat protection which usually helps a lot holding the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, it doesnt last long, it takes forever styling your hair, poor quality.... just go with the remington ceramic curling stick (the pink one) and you&#x27;ll spend a lot less and get the beautiful hair style you want as you can control how long to keep your hair on the stick, you can put a lot more hair on it versus the thin hair strains that this curling machine allows you to and it will be a lot quicker (20 mins) and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Good product . Though it is more ringlets than curls</li>
            <li> Love it! If I can use this successfully (and I was able to), anyone can! Be sure to use small pieces or your hair will get stuck.</li>
            <li> Was broken but was very easy to return and get money back</li>
            <li> A family member got this for Christmas.  I have naturally curly hair but had to try it out.  We did the 12 setting on me.  I absolutely loved it.  I will be purchasing this next week.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. It does different tightness of curls and it is very fast compared to traditional curling irons. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> You know when you see those infomercials and everything they say seem too easy to be true? I have to admit that in this case it is. The Curl Secret works amazing, never tangles my hair (that is very fine, easy to tangle). And when it does (when it goes in the chamber wrong, or a little tangled) it immediately realeses my hair, before any damage happens.&lt;br /&gt;The curl secret also has a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; result, that I&#x27;ve never got with any other curler. With the culing wand you usually get a &amp;#34;way too perfect curl&amp;#34;, impossible to be natural. And if you use the Curl Secret in the &amp;#34;8sec + low heat&amp;#34; set up you get loose, natural curls. Kind of a Gisele Bunchen hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!  Shipped fast!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair curler I&#x27;ve found to date!!!  I&#x27;ve tried everything on earth to try and speed up the process of curling my hair from rollers, curling irons, etc.  There are two setting depending on how tight the curl is you are looking for.  It beeps a few times to let you know it&#x27;s done in seconds.  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve written on a product, although before buying just about anything I always read the reviews.  I&#x27;m so happy I figured it&#x27;s well worth sharing that you will not regret the $99 spent.  I even found a great sale at Christmas and bought 3 for friends and my mother.  I can&#x27;t wait to hear how happy they are too :)  Way to go Conair!!!</li>
            <li> Great product love it</li>
            <li> I am not only &amp;#34;lazy&amp;#34; when it comes to taking the time to style my hair but I also have limited dexterity in my right side. I am always looking for a quick and easy way to give my hair some style. My hair is fine but I have a lot of it. It&#x27;s pretty short; length is between my ears and shoulders and it&#x27;s got a funky wave if left to air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Infiniti Pro Curl is the best tool I have found thus far and I have tried many. It is easy, quick and takes the frustration out of curling my short, fine locks - even in the back. The curls come out silky smooth, makes my hair look healthy, and -- I never thought I&#x27;s ever say this -- but the curls last all day. Got to love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any serious entanglements. I have had a few few stray hairs get a tug here and there but it is caused from improperly feeding my hair into the unit. If I am not paying enough attention and improperly feed a section into the Curl Secret, it stops immediately, reverses and prevents any serious damage or pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly. I do not have to worry about burning my fingers or scalp. And since all I have to do with my other hand is hold a section of hair, my weaker side does not tire nor do I experience the frustration of the inability to handle, twist, turn, clip or whatever with my other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely submit reviews but I had to share my thoughts given past experience with other products. This will not disappoint, especially if you struggle with any physical impairments. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas, we tried it once and trashed it! Even in the smallest sections of hair, it does not curl, and your hair gets caught in the curler!</li>
            <li> This is truly a unique curling device. Works great. Takes longer if you have long hair, but I love the turn out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this thing! I have recently let my hair grow out and I can flat iron and straighten it like a pro but when it comes to curling it, I&#x27;m clueless!! This thing is definitely idiot proof. I tried the first time on dirty hair and did 3 sections making bigger curls and last night, I curled it on clean hair and used 4 sections making more, smaller curls. Everyone is amazed. This is super easy to use. As for getting hair caught in it, it happend a few times but it immediately beeps to let you know so I just slowly slid it down to release the curls. It was because the sections of hair I grabbed were too big. I purchased mine at Target (to make for an easy return) because I was SO sure I would be returning it but it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Perfect choice!! Arrived on time and simply loved the product! I recommend to all woman to have one! It worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new hair gadget and this one has been different than most. If you have long hair you will really see a lot of curl and bounce. However my curl and bounce days are over and my poker straight hair only reaches the top of my shoulders. However it still worked but I will need more time playing with it to get a half way decent hairstyle. I highly suggest it for different looks especially for women or girls with long hair.</li>
            <li> I still have not used it enough to see anything different than expected, but it works really well in the highest temperature. The curls are nice and hair does not get stuck if used according to instructions, despite what some people say.</li>
            <li> Just like advertised!  Love it!  Highly recommend.  It is very easy to use.  The curls hold and look great.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> So cool and works awesome</li>
            <li> Wow, this product is awesome. I have naturally wavy hair, but it was never wavy enough to go without curling my hair into some sort of style. A regular curling iron flattens my natural waves. This curling magic wand gives me natural curls that make me look like I have a spiral perm. It is soooooo easy to use! I have a LOT of hair, and it is colored/bleached/fragile, so I have to be careful with each little section that I place in the iron. I don&#x27;t like it if my hair gets ratted and stuck in the machine, so I comb each section first. The other trick I learned is do not try to control the hair that is swirling up into the iron. It you put any pressure on the hair, it does not feed into the drum correctly. So just comb the little section, loosely hold it out, and let go when it starts feeding into the drum. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works great on daughter that has thicker hair, other daughter (whom i actually purchased for) has straight thinner hair, doesn&#x27;t curl hair, even on highest and longest setting.  Feel like it doesn&#x27;t wind her hair tight enough for it to curl.  So if you have same type hair, might want to think about purchasing</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to use, one you get the hang of it.  Takes some practice.  I love that the bulk of the heating elements are encased.  Lowering the danger to my daughters.  TIP: make sure hair is brushed out well, and in small sections.  The unit does stop when it senses a tangle, but it&#x27;s not perfect, so better to make sure hair is property prepared.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would do :)&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriends hair is long enough to reach her butt and she has no tangling issues or anything of the like. Great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Once upon time, I had spiral curls.  I had them for a very long time too &amp; after medications seemingly led to my hair changing, I sought out all sorts of hair curling implements.  I saw this in various stores &amp; wanted to see if it was as great as it claimed to be &amp; boy; what a bummer!  The best way I can explain the curls it gives for those with long hair is akin to that which you get after a day on the beach after the wind whips your hair dry.  It most definitely works best on shorter hair but for those of us with long locks; save your money &amp; seek out another device.  I cannot believe that some folks paid over $100 for this because it&#x27;s NOT worth it.  Nice try Conair, but no!</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t Evan work  was delivered broken</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but apparently I just do not have the skills to work this bad boy.  The first time I tried I thought I would have to cut my hair out as it was so stuck.  The next time I attempted to use it I made sure my husband was home in case we had another mishap, which were again plentiful.  While I did finally get the hang of it doing the front of my head, in order to do the back by &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; I had many stuck panic moments and hair ripping.  As an aside, my hair is fine and straight and this was able to make my hair wavy, but did not hold the curl for more than a few hours, even with hairspray.  I&#x27;ll keep it for special occasions, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you have prior curling experience or lots of time to learn it.</li>
            <li> It is a Christmas gift so I don&#x27;t know how good it woks!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting nearly 6 months to write this review, I wanted to make sure I knew everything about this product first! PROS: this thing works awesome on my naturally curly (frizzy curls) hair. I normally straight iron but the curl secret curls my hair and takes away the frizz. I highly recommend watching youtube videos prior to using the curler. Different settings will give you different types of curls, you need to spend some time playing around with the options.  It took me a week to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; setting. My favorite thing about this product is how I don&#x27;t burn my fingers or ears like I always did with a traditional curling iron! It takes me 20 minutes to curl my whole head of long thick hair-not bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: your hair will get snagged in this thing at some point and it does hurt a bit. DON&#x27;T panic! I have been able to successfully release my hair without burning it off everytime. Use smaller sections of brushed out hair. The only other complaint is that it&#x27;s difficult to do the back of my head, I have to bring the sections to the sides where I can see in the mirror and for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it with my left hand :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth the price fir someone who can&#x27;t use a traditional curling iron.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. There were no directions in the box. The only directions were printed on the box and most of those were covered up by silver tape. The box arrived very beat up. The directions that I could read that were printed on the box were not in detail and were of very little help. Even going online to Conair I was not able to find any detailed instructions. I used the curler very cautiously and was not thrilled with the results. I will probably have to keep experimenting to get the right combination of heat and timing before I get results I&#x27;m happy with...lets hope I have some hair left by then! .</li>
            <li> NOT as easy as it looks and your hair will not turn out perfectly curled.</li>
            <li> i ordered this because every one was talking about it , I got it on the estimated time and it&#x60;s working perfectly .</li>
            <li> My client bought this product after reading the reviews.  We both tried it out and loved it! I&#x27;ve officially ordered my own. Never have had a problem with it pulling my hair or hers. I have never been able to curl my hair that good because I have thick hair. This curler is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used! You have to see it to believe it!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to but makes your curls look nice</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this thing. Some times it&#x27;s hard for her to do parts of her hair on her own and I&#x27;ll have to help her and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT !!  I originally purchased a different brand but a plastic part that operates the curling mechanism broke and made it useless. I loved the simplicity of the curling machine and tried a different brand - Conair. I absolutely love it !! In fact, I purchased two - one for our winter home in Arizona and one for our permanent home in Alaska.</li>
            <li> Burned my wife&#x27;s hair pretty bad, so we had to return it.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair. For prom, my hair came out before I even left the salon. I was worried about spending so much on this if it wasn&#x27;t going to work but thank god I did. My hair finally curls! And it stays in till I wash it. I love it. Money well spent!! I love it! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this but I LOVE it!!! I used the 8 seconds on Hi and I got perfect curls that lasted all day. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this, now it only takes me 15 minutes to curl all my hair. I have shoulder length, medium thickness hair. I recommend this product to anyone who curls there hair. My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to curl the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this \\&quot;Curling\\&quot; iron.  It makes the most beautiful curls and it&#x27;s so easy!  Your hair disappears into it, it beeps &amp; you release a perfect curl.  You must follow the directions.  Use 1/2\\&quot;-1\\&quot; sections and brush or comb each section before curling.  I didn&#x27;t do this and it wouldn&#x27;t take my hair and, if it did, it got caught.  Don&#x27;t panic if your hair gets caught. Just release it and pull it out.  My hair is about half way down my back; so, longer hair might be hard to get loose. Before I used it, I thought I would have a hard time holding it up while it curled because it is a little heavy.  But, it is so fast and this was not a problem.  It is timely.  It took about 30 minutes to curl all my hair.  But, it was worth it.  I have never had such pretty curls. My hair was even fuller when I separated the curls with my fingers.</li>
            <li> too time consuming to use, heavy and not that easy to use.  I sent it back as I received similar results with a 3/4 curling iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING!! It curls my hair and holds the curl for a couple days! When a regular curling iron never could hold it longer then a couple hours. It&#x27;s also fast and easy, I have thin hair so it only takes me 25 mins to curl my hair. An HR if it&#x27;s thick, I did my sisters. But I love it I love It I love it I&#x27;m glad I got it :)</li>
            <li> This works great!  It takes awhile to do all your hair, but worth it.  It looks like you just came from the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Cheaper product, poorer results</li>
            <li> Works good! Do your self and dont Wanna GO to Hair shop!!</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how great my hair looks!  Easy to use. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this curler so much! I was really nervous about getting it because usually you see these great things on TV and its a waste. But not this product! I have never been able to curl my hair on my own and with this I am able to and it does not take to long! Love love love!</li>
            <li> This works GREAT!!!  One of the best &#x27;as seen on TV...&#x27;  things I&#x27;ve ever gotten - worked much better than expected!!  LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it. According to her it&#x27;s easy to use. All you have to do it section out the hair &amp; put it in place &amp; the curling iron does the rest.</li>
            <li> broke after about a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at understanding curling irons so this is just perfect!</li>
            <li> Works great, but you must follow directions when it tells you to only curl small sections at a time or hair can get tangled inside curler.  I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because of the mixed reviews. My husband ended up getting it for my birthday. After trying it out I have to say I&#x27;m surprised by some of the things I have read in reviews. If you read the directions you will not have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to use. I am terrible at hair and I can finish my hair with this in 10 mins. It&#x27;s much easier than a traditional curling iron or wand. It does not pull your hair or get caught. If you try to put too much hair in at one time it just beeps at you and won&#x27;t pull the hair into the chamber. It has a lot of options which is nice but I only really wanted to use the looser curl seating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the curl does not last as long as my curling wand. I just starting using hair spray and this resolved the issue. Also I have long thick hair so using the lower heat setting for looser waves is the issue not the actual machine. It is expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it not having to struggle with the curling wand anymore. I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s long term quality as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks. It is a little heavy but not unreasonably so. It only curls in one direction. I believe the babybliss one curls in both directions but it also costs a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with this curling contraption.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  If you can&#x27;t curl your hair the old fashion way like me this works out great instead.  Almost 20bucks cheaper then buying in stores. Also shipping was so fast ordered on a Thursday got it on tuesday. Very happy</li>
            <li> Good curls, but curls only go only one way.  There is no option to curl left or right.</li>
            <li> best invention ever! love it</li>
            <li> Really easy to use. Awsome. Order came faster than i thoght. A good investment.&lt;br /&gt;It s really fast to use even in a day of work.</li>
            <li> This works!  Curls...no problem.  Still expirimenting with it, but recommend this to anyone who wants to save time curling their hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.  Sent it back for a refund. Still waiting for that.</li>
            <li> I hate to do this but I thought this was just awful.  I have long and thick hair.  You can only put a very small, and I&#x27;m talking small amount of hair into the chamber for it to give your hair any sort of curl.  I was thoroughly disappointed.  So it&#x27;s going back!  I would suggest if you have thick, long hair you reconsider purchasing this product.  The concept is great but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it!</li>
            <li> The Conair Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is a great product to order if you do not want to spend much time curling your hair. My hair is thin, medium to long length and only takes about 5 minutes to do my hair when I am rushing. It definitly saves time in the morning! Just be careful using this product since once in awhile the hair likes to get stuck in the product. You only have to pull a little in order to get the hair out of the compartment it is in. Other than that, it is a great product to use!</li>
            <li> The curls dont last too long. You probably need to use a spray. Product is very good though</li>
            <li> Amazing way to keep my hair in a huge style!</li>
            <li> it works well, easy and fun, great curls instantly….</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic curler. It makes beautiful curls. I Love it and am so glad I bought it. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This totally dried my shoulder length hair out. Even though I tried to do it according to the directions, it kept tangling. A Fun concept...but not for me.</li>
            <li> I was marginally happy with the job this tool did on my hair- until it broke. Now I&#x27;m out a hundred bucks and am rather displeased.&lt;br /&gt;I think as long as you don&#x27;t have more than medium thick hair, maybe it would be better. Also- same rules apply to humidity. The curls or waves come right out.&lt;br /&gt;I really didn&#x27;t find it worth the money even before it broke.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  I have tried everything on the market to curl my hair. I mean everything. Nothing has been as successful as the pro curl. I have tried the one with the brush, the shells, the sponges,  you name it I got it. The pro curl gives me a perfect long lasting curl every time. A little bit of a learning curve but nothing horrendous.  Follow the directions and you will have a perfect long lasting curl. I can&#x27;t say enough about this thing. I have never been able to hold a curl and in most cases even get a curl. Don&#x27;t know why it works but I never question a miracle.</li>
            <li> works great in the front but how in the WORLD am I supposed to do the back of my hair??? Really hard to do on the back since I cant see how to put the hair in.</li>
            <li> Gets stuck real easy in your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. When I head all these women say this thing causes your hair to tangle and what not. Also the stories on the 1 star reviews on here of women having to cut there hair cause it got stuck in the thing. I told my wife about them and she still wanted me to buy it. So I did and she has been using the heck out of it and her hair has not once got stuck. My wife gives it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several automatic curling irons on the market and I have to say this one really works!  As long as the hair is combed out smooth and not too much at once, tangles are not an issue.  It does stop automatically when pressure is released on handle. It&#x27;s easy to get the hang of it. Curls are long lasting.</li>
            <li> Quit working after 1 use!!!!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to manage it but it really do what the curls as promised.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife as a birthday gift. She is always wanting to do something with her hair, but she isn&#x27;t gifted in the hair styling department. She absolutely loves the fact that it does the curling for you, and the curls turn out great. She recommends it to people all the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and as soon as she received she used it and loving it. You just need to make sure the amount of hair you take every time to curl if you take in more quantity it will get stuck but if you take enough that requires it works like charm.</li>
            <li> did not curl hair even close to what it claims to do</li>
            <li> This product works great...Never had anything like it...Use smaller pieces for a better curl</li>
            <li> I loved it! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This thing suuuuuuucks. Hair consistently gets caught and doesn&#x27;t hold a bit of curl longer than maybe 20 minutes. Biggest waste of my $$ I&#x27;ve ever spent</li>
            <li> So far I am having trouble curling my hair, I don&#x27;t think the problem is just that I need to play with it a little more.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, as per usual, you have to ignore the one and two star reviews on here. All of the poor reviews are because people don&#x27;t use it properly or because they&#x27;re reviewing the wrong effing item (yes, I&#x27;m talking to you, lady who thinks this was the babyliss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my whole life, I&#x27;ve told people my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl. This item has proved me wrong. It does hold curl now for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish I could get bigger curls. Because it only curls 1\\&quot; sections, you have to be careful or you&#x27;ll get Shirley temple ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this really is an amazing product for girls who can&#x27;t get curls otherwise.</li>
            <li> Give yourself some time to get used to it but when you do - it really is easy even if you&#x27;re one of those people who generally have trouble curling their hair.  I&#x27;m really happy with this product and I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> This product is good, and the concept is great. However it does take a longer time than a traditional curling iron, since you have to use smaller sections of hair at a time. Occasionally hair gets stuck. It warns you with a beep if hair is tangled. However *** WARNING my daughter put her hair in the wrong way- there is  a printed direction for which side should face head- and her hair burned inside. We unplugged it and removed the hair with tweezers as it was firmly caught. No real harm done, but you really have to be careful to use with correct side facing head. Not good for younger clientele! A bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Caught my hair on third use,  had to cut hair to get it out.  sent item back</li>
            <li> The Conair Curl Secret was easy to use and the results were well worth the effort. It gets easier with continued use. Love the tool and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would love this product, but being able to have something to make curling fun and easier it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was very much looking forward to this curling iron, even though Conair styling tools were disappointments in the past. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a chance, but alas! I did not work at all on my thick hair. I mean *nothing* :( I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s hair with the same result - nothing. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> It really works! My daughter and I read all the instructions, watched a few YouTube videos, and read the reviews before using this curler. That definitely helped a lot. It took about an hour and a half to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair (it&#x27;s really long and thick), but it was so easy.  Once I got the hang of it, I was able to move a little faster. I only got her hair tangled once or twice, but it came out easily with no damage. I used a little hair product to help the curls set better. The curler is a little heavy, and it seems to have been designed to be used in the left hand (maybe for those curling their own hair).  However, I was able to turn it upside down and use it with my right hand with no problem. I will never use a regular curling iron on my daughter&#x27;s hair again. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Due to the strict positioning of this product to &amp;#34;correctly&amp;#34; pull the hair thru the coil, it is built completely opposite of what is innate for a lefty. I really wanted to like it, and did love the results after much fumbling, dropping, &amp; accidental hitting-of-myself due to not being designed for the left-handed user... It took entirely too long to get set-up to use.  In fact, I could&#x27;ve curled my entire head with a traditional curling iron in the time it took to curl 1 section with the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret.  (For a right-hander to understand this, please use this product with one hand tied behind your back, it&#x27;s pretty much the equivalent). Incredibly frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning asap!  Conair, please make a Lefty version, we have discretionary incomes too.</li>
            <li> Great product!  and easy to use....</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro Curl Secret is wonderful.  A few practice curls and we were ready to go.  It is easy, just go slow and the curle look great!</li>
            <li> Got this for my 14 yr old neice for Xmas and she says it&#x27;s great and her and her friends all have used it, just wish I tried it out too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad and that&#x27;s a good thing since I gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> My 15 yr old LOVES this. Does a GREAT job creating  beautiful curls. No risk of burning hair.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly please with this product. It is light weight and very easy to use. I have long thick hair, and I followed the instructions which provided excellent results. I sectioned my hair in about 1/2 inch sections, which takes time and patience if you have a lot of hair. The Pro Curl gently pulls my hair into the unit and beeps a few times, then beeps again to let me know it&#x27;s finished. It is a great product that produces amazing curls.</li>
            <li> Good price for product. My 12 year old can use it with ease so &amp;#34;two thumbs up&amp;#34; . Very fast shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this product! So easy! So perfect!</li>
            <li> You have got to be kidding me!  I followed the instructions word-for-word and STILL my hair got stuck in this contraption! I even watched youtube videos to make sure to use it correctly.  I successfully did a few curls and then on the fourth one.....Agh!  I called the Conair help line and was on hold forever with this thing stuck to my head and it&#x27;s heavy!  It hurt like hell! I could not get this thing to open or even budge.  Finally I just cut my hair out of this thing!  Now I have a clump of hair missing from my head.  Bright idea Conair!  You just lost a customer....</li>
            <li> GAVE IT AWAY,  TO HARD TO HANDLE</li>
            <li> The product is similar to what I use on my hair just didn&#x27;t work out for the type of hair I have thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> The product is very dangerous. I purchased it at Kohl&#x27;s because I had a discount on top of the existing sale they were running on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first use, there was a really bad plastic odor, but most hot hair tools do that so I didn&#x27;t pay much mind to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first curl came out okay. The second not so much. Every curl after that seemed to be extremely loose and fell right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then all of a sudden I hear &amp;#34;beep beep beep beep&amp;#34;. I tried to retract my hair only to find that it&#x27;s stuck... stuck on the inside chamber of the hot turning wheel. I panicked! I immediately unplugged it hoping my hair wouldn&#x27;t burn off, and luckily it didnt, but I still couldn&#x27;t get my hair out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance and sister actually had to break the entire device open with a pair of pliers, and after 45 minutes, there was my hair, in a ball, wrapped around the chamber. It still wouldn&#x27;t come off so we had to rip my hair out just to be free from the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I contacted Conair only to be placed on the phone with a rotten representative who continuously said it was my fault and that I didn&#x27;t follow directions. I actually did follow the directions... to a T. She also accused me of lying, so I had to shut her up with the video clips we recorded of the process as well as the still images of my hair stuck on their poorly designed product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go over all the words we exchanged, but they ended up refunding me the hard earned money I spent and sending me a new tool, which I refuse to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ I would not advise anyone to use this product as it is highly unpredictable and can get you stuck in a situation like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✔ You&#x27;re better off with your average curling iron anyway, especially time wise.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 3 stars because of the one tiny flaw it has. Your hair gets stuck in it and there&#x27;s nothing to do except pull it out and damage your hair. My hairs really frizzy because of this now. Other than that it truely does make the perfect curl and it&#x27;s very easy to use and takes less time to use compared to a regular curling iron or wand.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  It works as advertised but you must follow the directions exactly as printed. Be careful with the amount of hair you place in the curler especially while curling hair in the back.  The curls are very long lasting and they seem to shine.  I would definitely recommend this curler to a friend.</li>
            <li> Ok so I absolutely love this curler! The price is way better than others I&#x27;ve seen and also as for the \\&quot;ripping your hair out\\&quot; in my opinion you need to be stupid to let that happen because you can automatically feel the tug, which makes you automatically stop. It happened a few times to me but it doesn&#x27;t get caught and rip it out like other reviewers are saying. The only way I see that happening is if you feel the tug and you don&#x27;t let go and let the curler keep twisting your hair.... Then yes you will have a problem. Like I said though its easy to correct if you pay attention to what your doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my curls... I have a lot of hair but its somewhat fine hair... my hair is pretty smooth, naturally wavy. normal curlers cant hold my hair but with this miracle they are the best I&#x27;ve seen. I don&#x27;t even need hair spray! My hair usually falls flat within a hour... Not with the curl secret. ;-) its been 4 hours now and my hair still looks fantastic. Oh the joy not having to use hair spray! I can actually enjoy the feeling of curls instead of having hard hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously ladies its worth the money! Don&#x27;t be afraid if the machine, it&#x27;s all in the way you place your hair in the machine and don&#x27;t use large strips if your hair. It&#x27;s easy to figure out. I did in 5 minutes.... TRY IT! :)</li>
            <li> If I could rate it a zero I would. It states your hair can&#x27;t get stuck/caught in it &amp;#34;tangle-free curls&amp;#34; and my hair got caught in the motor, and I had break the entire device open just to get my hair out of the curling chamber. It was wrapped around the fin inside the casing - no way to get unstuck unless breaking the product. I followed the directions exactly and used small sections of 1/2&amp;#34; hair at a time. My hair is middle of my back long and fine. My hair got stuck and I tried for 45 minutes to get my hair out. I called their customer service to ask for help, she put me on hold - meanwhile I&#x27;m holding onto the curling iron with the other hand to avoid it pulling my hair - she said she talked to the manager and he doesn&#x27;t know how to help me, sorry there is nothing they could do - they recommended me to pull out one strand of hair at a time! It was wrapped and twisted - If I pulled one strand, it pulled the other strands into the unit further! What a rip off! I told them I&#x27;m going to break the device open if I have to, so tell me how do I get my hair out - they said I don&#x27;t know. I told them I&#x27;m not cutting my long hair. Sure enough breaking the product allowed me to get my hair out. I was not going to try to drive to a salon to get help with it dangling in my face and I should have had to go to all this trouble in the first place!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. It&#x27;s a little bit heavy to hold but you get an entire head of curls so quickly that overall it&#x27;s no problem. I get compliments every time I use it and I love that I don&#x27;t have to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  Curls last more than a day for me.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does what it says it will do.  I use it on tight setting (12 seconds, Hi temperature).</li>
            <li> I saw the Conair Curl Secret on a home shopping show and decided to give it a try.  I have long, fine, straight, dark hair.  To get volume, it is cut into long layers. As a very busy mom,  I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of time to fool around with my hair.  I will occasionally use an Instyler and a hot brush/dryer.  Those work relatively well but I was intrigued by the curls that this product could create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a try and used the Curl Secret on the lowest settings.  It created perfect corkscrew curls all over my head.  Not good.  I looked like a Latina Little Bo Peep and if I were on a elementary school dance team, that would have been perfect.  I brushed those curls out and I had major volume.  Terrific, magazine-type volume.  Minutes later, my hair separated into perfect Little Bo Peep corkscrew curls again.  For the first time in my life, my hair held a curl but I didn&#x27;t want it!  I had places to go, so it was like Groundhog Day, brush-volume then perfect Bo Peep curls sprang back.  And on a rainy day, no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day - exactly the same thing.  Look ladies, I have a pretty good sense of humor so I figured that this thing really does work and I would try a different technique the next time I use it.  The third day, I washed my hair and curled the bottom sections of my long hair and held it only for three beeps instead of the four (it beeps to let you know that your hair is ready).  Perfection. The curls are large and loose (similar to Kate Middleton).  I have nice volume with hair that looks like a woman.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the thing can snag your hair.  Read the instructions carefully and only use small sections.  I like the product and plan on keeping it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair now.  Easy to use and gives me the curls I never had.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good produto for those that is not faniliar to the regular curling, because it&#x27;s very easy to manage, but if you are good on the regular one,I think it&#x27;s not for you, because it takes more time &#x27; cause you gotta wait until rhe &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; to release the hair...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my opinion</li>
            <li> Okay - here&#x27;s the deal...the product does what it says it will do, BUT...  1) The first thing I noticed is that it is by no means light weight. Hold it with two hands so you don&#x27;t end up straining your wrist.  2) Practice, because it does take some getting used to - especially reaching the back.  3) I think it could have come with clearer instructions. It was much more helpful for me to watch a demo on YouTube.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling device I have ever used. I would recommended that all girls get one or your really missing out on something great:)</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is quick and easy and makes beautiful curls! I havent had any trouble using it, and I&#x27;m no good at using regular curling irons so this is a great tool for me!</li>
            <li> This product is HORRIBLE!!! A good chunk of my hair got stuck and had to be cut. Absolutely mortifying. Conair needs to add some sort of safety feature to this item. I followed the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> takes longer to curl my hair than the instructions. but all in all it works like I expected it would.</li>
            <li> Maybe you need to read the instructions before you \\&quot;get your hair caught\\&quot; and give bad reviews because your incompetent at following directions. Obviously if you read the directions then you wouldn&#x27;t be putting this product down and you wouldn&#x27;t have had to chop your hair off. Learn to read and follow instructions. Weren&#x27;t you taught that when you were a toddler?</li>
            <li> My daughter had only one item on her Christmas list this year, and this was the item. She loves it!</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and restrict your sections of hair to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, this curling iron provides amazing, professional-looking results. The curls are perfect in shape, dimension, and texture. It exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It bears repeating that you absolutely MUST MUST MUST limit your sections to 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;. The other reviewers are correct when they state that you also must re-comb each strand before allowing it to go into the roller, even after you&#x27;ve brushed your hair several times. If you have thick hair like me, this process is time consuming and grueling, but I&#x27;m not going to fault the curling iron simply because I&#x27;m lazy. The curling iron does its job, and the output is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: my hair type is thick and naturally wavy, so I can&#x27;t speak to other hair types using this curling iron. Also, I am not a professional.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this hair curler, as it seemed perfect for my needs.  I was horribly disappointed!  Though it heated up, it did not curl my hair at all!  A friend of mine, who is a hairdresser, tried it too, and had no success.  At least it wasn&#x27;t difficult to return it.</li>
            <li> The best for curls. It takes time if you have a lot of hair but excellents results</li>
            <li> I have long,  very thick bone-straight hair, and I love this curler.  My hair did get stuck a few times, but once I got the hang of it and took smaller pieces it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;  The key with long hair is that they have to be smaller sections, but it is worth it.  The curls last all day and are so beautiful.  Here is a picture where I did one side http://imgur.com/dLP45uY and left the other side for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Once the curls cooled you can brush them and they bounce right back, all day which is huge for me.  It does take a while to do my whole head so it won&#x27;t be an everyday thing.  The curler is a little heavy, but it is fun to use so it makes up for it ;)</li>
            <li> I love my Conair curl secret. It&#x27;s so easy to curl my own hair and other peoples hair and it looks quiet professional. An I don&#x27;t burn myself on it like I have with other curling wands</li>
            <li> To all those who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, etc... make sure you are doing it properly. I messed it up the first time I used it and was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t curl my long hair -but then I realized I was doing it wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I didn&#x27;t realize it had to beep 5 times. I was releasing on the first beep and nothing was really curling. Make sure you hold it til you hear the multiple beeps in a row.&lt;br /&gt;-Take small sections in to avoid hair getting stuck. As long as the hair is a small enough section, theres no reason it should get stuck. I am practicing with this because it did get stuck once or twice and I had to pull it out. That&#x27;s really the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this actually works like in the commercial!! My hair is crazy thick, and this makes curling it so simple, although it still takes a bit of time, but that in no way is the fault of this amazing invention!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect hair curler as posted by others and easy to use as shown on youtube&lt;br /&gt;But does not come in 220 v</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be much easier.  I went over the same area 3x and it still didn&#x27;t curl my hair.  I did it with my curling iron and it was just fine.  Total waste of money!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;They made me give it a rating so 1 star because it turns on.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing ! However , you do need to be patient. I have used it on myself (my hair is quite long) and it works great. Just remember to read instructions--clean your hair throughly (brush..etc.) and make sure your hair is dry. Hair also needs to be in 1 inch sections when inserting into the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this on my mother--her hair is about shoulder length and it gave her the cutest little curls--almost like flips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all depends on your hair length. At first the product does seem intimidating but I love it !</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it got caught in it. I do not recommend this for hair longer than shoulder. I wanted it because it looked convenient and it is not. Also the curl I got was wavy at best. I recommend a wand for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was outstanding though, as usual thank you amazon for returning this with no issues.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my sister, But She never said She was happy with it or not.. but I think if she was Happy She would have told me,, because she asked me for it for her birthday..</li>
            <li> Eats hair. I was very careful to follow instructions and it does not matter how much hair you put into it because it gets stuck anyway. I had to cut the hair off to get it out of my hair!!! Don&#x27;t buy it, you will be sorry. To make it worse, there are no refunds on this product. So I paid about $100 to see how bad this product works.</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday - have been really putting off getting it based on the price.  But I caved and splurged.  Greatest device ever.  I have shorter hair - right at my shoulders and it looks so pretty.  I do have to say it is a bit confusing to use.  I still don&#x27;t have it completely down on how to do the back of my head.  Using the mirror, trying to remember which side needs to be against the head, etc.  But I&#x27;ll get after practice.</li>
            <li> It leaves nice curls, but I had to use less hair, 12 seconds and high heat. So it takes longer to be ready. If I am in a hurry, I&#x27;d rather use regular curling iron. If I have 40 minutes, I use it and the curls are really nice!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking my daughter and I would be able to get SOME curl.  We tried the curler on my hair, my daughters hair and her friend to have a good opinion because we all have different hair types and got nadda, like some of the other reviews our hair got tangled and if there was a curl, the bend did not warrant being called a curl or even a bend taking back for a refund</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have super straight hair and it usually can&#x27;t hold a curl, but this product gives such a nice ringlet curl that stays in even overnight.  I have used it a few times since I got it and it is super fun and easy.  I wanted to get the Miracurl like my friend had but I am honestly amazed by the product.</li>
            <li> I frequently curl my hair, around 6 times a month, using either a flat iron or one of my curling irons. After my friend trying this product and loving it, i decided why not give it a try. Well, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all and i followed the instructions to a tee. plan on returning, what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is if your hair gets caught to the point you have to CUT IT, you ARE NOT using this correctly!! It clearly states to use small strands, like 1 inch width, NO MORE! The more you try to shove in this thing, the more chance you have of getting your hair caught-- DUH! Even with a straightener though, you have to use small strands to get best results. My hair is a little more than shoulder length and it takes around 20 minutes to do but looks adorable!</li>
            <li> This really works well - curls your head within minutes - easy to do on my daughter - have yet to try on myself :)</li>
            <li> Hate it - takes too  long and is very heavy to hold  so sorry I bought this  would return if I could</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my hair...what a waste!</li>
            <li> I have a mix of Spanish and Indian hair.. so it crazy curly and straight in some points.  AND it is THICK!  I don&#x27;t know how people are complaining that they are getting tangled all the time and how it hurts them.  I have used this for 14 days straight now and I have only gotten the tangle beep 2 times.  It takes all of my hair in with no problem.. I can get my face curls and strategically placed ones around my face done in about 15 minutes.  LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> My 11 year old can work this, supervised, and ends up with beautiful curls. We have yet to get any hair stuck. The curler states right on it which side should go toward your head so the hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> I love this curler. Wish it cost less, but it works well and is easy to use to create new hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls everytime!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Works well, easy to use and holds the curl for even thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and the curler allowed such a small amount of hair to be curled each time it took FOREVER. Way too much work for limited results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this new hair product! I have long thick hair and it created beautiful long lasting curls...tangled a bit but it has an automatic reverse that helped to release the hair no big deal...love it</li>
            <li> My mom swears by this thing and loves it.  I need to use a lot of hair product and I feel like it takes forever because I have very thickl/long hair.  I&#x27;ve ripped out whole pieces of my hair in this thing, and it is literally quite scary...like it is eating my hair.  I guess if you have shorter or thinner hair (like my mom) this would be great.  Unfortunately for me, it is not going to be a regular tool I use.</li>
            <li> It works great! Love it</li>
            <li> bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday. It does what it says it will do. however it is definitely a two person job when you start to do the back of the head. I&#x27;m going to be helping her do her hair for years to come.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, though it is a little on the heavy side. I&#x27;m using it on permed hair. The perm didn&#x27;t take too well in the front, so it needs a little touch up.  I had used a tapered curling iron before and struggled to get the perfect curl and not burn my fingers.  With the Infiniti Pro Curl Secret all I do is put in a strip of hair and presto, I have the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> I got mine at Goodwill today for $ 2.99 it appeared it be brand new and in package still. I&#x27;ve only tried it on hair that had hairspray in it and already had curls. My hair got stuck a few times but overall seems like it will be great! The key seems to be not holding it to close to my scalp and doing small portions of hair. I&#x27;ve been very curious about this product but would never spend $ 100 on a curling iron. Shocked that I found it today for such a dirt cheap price! I&#x27;m very excited to use it over and over again so that I get the hang of it. It seems a little trickey but I&#x27;m sure practice will make perfect!</li>
            <li> Not for every hair type. I have 5 daughters and 2 of them can use this and it works wonderfully on their hair. If you have hair that is hard to curl then this is not for you. If you have hair that tends to have some natural wave or curl this works but stick straight it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my daughter who is 12. She feels comfortable using it and I feel comfortable letting her use it. I think the price is a bit much for what it is but its this price everywhere you shop.</li>
            <li> a little high priced, but was a gift and they receiver like it</li>
            <li> Love this curler. Have had no problems with it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it really reduces the frizz. I do not like the color though.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine let me use hers and I feel in love.  Now my daughter loves to use it.  Simple and I don&#x27;t have to worry about her burNing her hand.</li>
            <li> Hair kept getting tangled</li>
            <li> I was given this ad a gift since I love having curly hair but just can&#x27;t curl my hair myself. The first two curls turned out great, although it hurt to pull the device out (I have a tough scalp so that is saying something), then I tried a third curl, again with a little bit off hair, this time however I could get it to release my hair. After pulling for a good ten minutes it finally came away from my head taking a bug chunk of hair and scalp with it, my head was bleeding and I was in lots of pain for the rest of the day. I would never recommend this product to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> This curler is awesome glad I found it really makes super neat curls with ease!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite hair tool! Takes some practice to operate but very easy to create the best &amp; longest-lasting curls. My hair is on longer side of shoulder length and my daughter&#x27;s is almost to her waist. Both get gorgeous perfect curly hair. Yes, hair did get caught in chamber a couple times but came out without much effort due to auto reverse sensor motor. The section that stuck was perfectly fine as this device will not heat your hair for longer than 12 seconds. The day after style is just as beautiful with soft waves &amp; curls.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and I am taking it back… It just made my hair kink.. no curls at all….</li>
            <li> Being an Asian descendant with straight long hair I would never think it would be possible to have curls without going to a Beauty salon. This Conair curl works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Not sure why so many reviews talk about hair getting caught...I have had no problems at all. I will say I didn&#x27;t realize how long to hold the thing shut on the timer and was just letting go on the first beep. At first I thought that the timer was broken because it beeped right away on each setting.  The directions weren&#x27;t clear about waiting for four consecutive beeps. I figured it out when I watched a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; video on the Conair website.  So glad I took a chance--LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, beautiful curls. I ordered it with the ONE product and that really helps my hair look smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have long stick straight hair.  I&#x27;m always bored with it.  Braid it twist it blow it etcetera.  This product creates beautiful springy curls with virtually very little effort.  Now, I haven&#x27;t done my whole head because I am a mom and have no desire to spend an hour doing my hair.  I have used it with an updo or partial updo to create beautifully long springy curls very easily.  You just face it towards you, it is very clearly labeled and squeeze and voila.  Your hair must be dry, brushed and tangle-free before you begin.  If you can follow simple directions you will enjoy this product.  It is definitely for longer hair.</li>
            <li> My mother and I bought this curling iron because we thought it was awesome and a much easier way to curl your hair. We followed all the instructions and made sure the right part was facing our head every time we curled a strand of air. HOWEVER, when my mother was curling her hair this morning, she ran downstairs with it STUCK in her hair! Thankfully my father and I were able to somehow, miraculously, get her hair out but it took forever. We were just about to have to cut her strand of hair off, when he got it loose. The manufacturers of this product brag about how there are &amp;#34;built in features&amp;#34; to make sure your hair &amp;#34;never gets stuck&amp;#34; which is obviously a complete lie. We followed the instructions word for word, and her hair still got stuck. If there are these &amp;#34;awesome features&amp;#34; built in, this shouldn&#x27;t have happened. DO NOT BUY THIS CURLING IRON unless you plan to cut off a strand of your hair every time you try to use it. The benefits don&#x27;t outweigh the risks. DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curler!  It is easy to do and very easy to pick up on... With the curler, My 11 year old can now curl her own hair.</li>
            <li> VERY DISSAPOINTED. ON CHRISTMAS DAY I WAS TRYING TO CURL MY HAIR AND THE STRAND OF HAIR I WAS CURLING GOT STUCK IN THE CURL SECRET IRON AND SIMPLY WOULD NOT COME OUT. I HAD TO CUT OUT 7 INCHES OF MY HAIR. ON CHRISTMAS DAY. WE EVEN TRIED TO GET A SCREWDRIVER TO TAKE THE PIECE OF S*** APART SO WE COULD DESPERATELY GET MY HAIR OUT. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS, IT DOES NOT WORK. THERE ARE MUCH BETTER IRONS THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN. LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING, BUT THIS IS NO JOKE. DO NOT BUY THIS WHATEVER YOU DO.</li>
            <li> It changed my life!! I have thick straight &amp;#34;Cher&amp;#34; hair and it is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret is fantastic!  I have long, rather thick hair and found the Curl Secret easy to use - and the curl lasts days and days!  I&#x27;ve tried it on various heat settings - high when I do a &#x27;complete&#x27; curl, low when I do end curls - works great either way.  I read where some people have a problem with hair getting tangled in the unit and I&#x27;m thinking they may have tried to curl too much hair at a time.  I&#x27;ve not had a tangle problem, however when I&#x27;ve tried to curl too much hair it will stop pulling the hair in and I just load it again with less hair.  I love the timer - beep - because all the curls turn out the same. I would most definitely recommend this product to anyone, although not sure how it would work - or even if it would work -  on short hair.  My hair looks as good (and sometimes better) as when I go to the salon!!</li>
            <li> The curls are not as shown on tv ....it like the it but better curls with curling iron</li>
            <li> Did not curl my extra fine hair.  Sent it back.  Sorry, I had hoped for better results.</li>
            <li> difficult to you, according to my wife.</li>
            <li> so easy to use my 3 year old granddaughter helped me do my hair i truly love this item best price is right here on amazon.com</li>
            <li> Does what it suppose to do</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so easy!! I cannot curl hair today save my life but I get pretty loose curls with this!! It&#x27;s not heavy like most people are saying. And it really never get a chance to tangle your hair. Because once it notices a problem it stops. Great buy! You should try it</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works great!</li>
            <li> Somehow the curls didn&#x27;t turn out to be as nice as the pictures looks.</li>
            <li> I would only get results if took ten strands of hair at a time.. not good for people with a lot of hair</li>
            <li> It dosen&#x27;t work.I read the instruction thoroughly and tried all method,but couldn&#x27;t make work normally.Because i&#x27;m in China,it&#x27;s impossible for me to return it.This must be the worst purchase experience so far.</li>
            <li> This item did not work as stated. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Really works!  Just use small sections and read the directions first.</li>
            <li> This is so neat! This will save me so much time curling my long hair! As long as you read the directions, and use it properly, you will never have a problem with tangling! Just keep in mind that the longer your hair, the less the chamber can handle at a time. This is going to be so much fun to use and now I can curl my hair more often!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this curler but in the end I am happy I did. It provides even curls and your hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it. The only thing I find wrong with this curler is, it is a bit heavy and you tend to need to rest your arm on occasion</li>
            <li> Works great with thin hair, which I have. I have gotten my hair pulled in it before but usually because I try to put too much in it. I curl my whole hair with this in 5 min</li>
            <li> great ,but hard to do the back of your head. Have to have some one to help,thats me any way</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d curl my hair like it did. Even with above shoulder length hair, it still could curl! The only downfall is that it&#x27;s pretty bulky, but it&#x27;s nothing to complain about since it works! I recommended this to my sisters and would recommend it to anyone else that is looking for something to curl their hair in under 20-25min. (depending on your length, thickness and the type of curls your going for it may take a bit longer)</li>
            <li> While it worked, it was great. But one month later it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I read so many of the reviews that made it sound like my hair would be sucked up and claimed by this curler. I had visions of having to cut off my hair at the root to release it. I still decided to take a chance on it. I have long hair that is difficult to curl and doesn&#x27;t hold curl very well, especially in humid weather. I can curl my hair when getting dressed, and by the time I get downstairs, it&#x27;s straight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the past difficulty in curling my hair, I used the highest setting at the longest time. First of all, it beeped and flashed if I put too much hair in it. As a first-time user, it didn&#x27;t get my hair stuck in it at all. When it beeped and flashed there was a problem, I released it and my hair came out without a problem. After the first use, I think I need to turn down the settings. It definitely made a lot of curl, and the curl didn&#x27;t fall out even after brushing. There was too much curl and fluffiness for my liking. The next day after sleeping on it, I still had enough wave in my hair that I didn&#x27;t have to curl it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some learning to do as to how to use this curler, but I think it will work for me. It&#x27;s just a matter of experimenting with the amount of curl I want and how close to my head that I want it. Since I wash my hair every other day, I am impressed that the curl lasts for the second day. To- date, I haven&#x27;t had any other curling method that would last even one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have now used this curler about 4 times, and have gotten better with it. So far, I haven&#x27;t had my hair get stuck in it even once. The trick is to keep strand of hair to 1-2 inches at the widest point, and to make sure it all fits in the channel of the curler. The first time I used the curler, I had it set to the high heat setting with the longest curl setting because my hair is usually difficult to curl and doesn&#x27;t hold curl. I also started the curl within 3 inches of my head. Doing it this way, the style was much too \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; for my liking. The second time, I used the low heat setting with the longest curl cycle, and started the curl 4-5 inches from my head. I also held the curler closed for a few seconds past the 3 beeps for done. Doing it this way, the style was great - not bushy, but perfect curls. Using other curling methods, my hair was usually straight the next day after sleeping on it. After using this curler, there was still a lot of body and plenty of waves when I brushed it out. I didn&#x27;t have to curl it again or pull it back like I have done in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I would highly recommend this curler for anyone with long, hard to curl hair. Follow the directions that come with the curler, and you won&#x27;t have any problems with it.\\&quot;bushy\\&quot; for my liking.

            <li> Only curls small portions of hair, and dosnt stay for long at all</li>
            <li> This product was super exciting to me. I got it on a Christmas sell and I&#x27;m glad I did. The curls weren&#x27;t as smooth and I hoped for but I&#x27;m pretty sure that was my own fault. It worked just as it claimed and was very easy to use. I did manage to get my hair &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; once but it was because of my own misuse and after a very light pull it cut off and I got my hair out with ease. I have long thick hair down to the top of my butt.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and when she used it her hair got stuck. We&#x27;ll we tried it later with my help and it happened again. After that she was just to scared to try anymore . And it wasn&#x27;t curling her hair the way it was advertised..</li>
            <li> Love this, but my hair still won&#x27;t hold a curl ;)</li>
            <li> My daughter was unable to get the iron to open, it kept spinning and spinning locked to her head. We finally got it open, our house spelled of burnt hair, she lost a huge strand of hair but it could of been so much worse. I was scared the curl secret was going to move up to her head and burn her. If you try this, DO NO TRY It alone. I am so happy I was  within ear shot when she started screaming.</li>
            <li> I give this to someone for Christmas and the love it.  The curls stay in and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Unsatisfied with product  pulls your hair  may work on short hair not recommended for long hair  curl does not stay in</li>
            <li> I have straight, straight, straight hair that is also quite fine..  I have tried everything to get some curl and volume - rollers, that expensive bombshell curling iron, regular curling irons, hot rollers, etc.  This is the first thing that actually WORKS in that the curl doesn&#x27;t completely drop out of my hair after a couple of hours but mellows into beautiful curls &amp; waves that last all day with just a bit of hairspray.. Everyone at work complimented me on my wavy hair - a first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it that difficult to use...  I watched a YouTube video, read the instructions carefully, and then gave it a try.  You really have to work on very SMALL sections of hair - I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it being caught in the machine. Also, unclamp the handles and let the curl just &amp;#34;drop&amp;#34; out of the machine and let it cool...don&#x27;t try to pull it out or stretch it.  Afterwards, finger-comb, spray and voila!  This machine is a miracle to me - the first time I have finally had the kind of hair I always wanted!</li>
            <li> This really works. I have thick hair and can&#x27;t believe how well it works. Very simple to operate. Easy directions.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product tangled my hair in the channel and was stuck to the point i had to cut my hair from the root. I should have listened to all the reviews. Im looking to return this crappy product! I have never experienced something like this before! STICK TO CURLING IRONS!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my hair  even when I put it on high</li>
            <li> BAD FOR YOUR HAIR, DID NOT EVEN OPEN IT AFTER I READ THE REVIEWS. DAUGHTER WORKS IN HAIR SALON AND SHE TOLD ME TO NOT EVEN OPEN IT</li>
            <li> Ever since I heard about the Conair curl secret and watched video reviews and read many written reviews about it I was really excited to try it out myself! According to the commercial about the product you just put a bit of hair into the heated chamber and it sucks it in and spins it for a set amount of seconds and then out comes a perfect curl. It is pretty pricey as it sells for around $99.99 retail price but I found a good deal online for it and so I decided to try it out myself. I was very happy with how quickly and easily I was able to figure it out. Although it did take me some time to do my hair as mine is very thick and there is a lot of it and you have to use a small piece of hair to curl at a time, otherwise it gets tangled inside the chamber and can be hard to get out. (I know this because I did it a few times. Lol) Overall I was very impressed with the results!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and works! I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say how old I am, but let&#x27;s just say I should have learned LONG ago how to curl my hair and it&#x27;s never happened. A friend went to a stylist (in London, England, which instantly makes it cooler) and they used this product on her. Not only have I bought one, but I tell all my friends as well. It looks a little intimidating, but it beeps and releases before your hair gets stuck and was very easy to use with a quick read of the instructions.</li>
            <li> Funciona perfeitamente... Os cachos ficam perfeitos.</li>
            <li> The curl starts out tight but the end looks like it ran out if heat to hold the curl. Tried multiple times on different settings.</li>
            <li> this product works amazingly!</li>
            <li> I have no styling skills. I have tried many curling irons before and really did not like the results. But this product really works! It is easy to use and produces a really nice spiral curl. I was worried about my hair getting tangled inside but if your hair begins to tangle, the product stops pulling the hair in and once you open it, the hair comes right out. This is much easier to use than a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product is defective and should be taken off of the market.  It pulled my hair in the curling mechanism all the way up to my scalp and pulled a big chunk of hair out. Even after I released the handle, it still kept pulling my hair further into my scalp and then would not release the hair.  I have never seen a more defective product and should be banned.</li>
            <li> Cheaper elsewhere. Not worth the insane price.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this curler!  I ordered for my teenage daughters for Christmas and they LOVE IT!  I have very long hair, my daughter wanted to curl my hair, it took her maybe 15 minutes to do my whole head.  They curls stayed even after sleeping!  I love this!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!!!  This product lives up to its promise.  Learned how to use it in minutes.  Works GREAT!!!!  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The best hair curler ever.  I curl before bed (which takes minimal effort and time) and in the morning, &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; through with my fingers for a professional-looking all day curl.  No hairspray required and curl will last at least three days with minimal maintenance (just re-comb with fingers as needed.)  I have long thick hair which requires me to curl about 30-40 strands.  It was such a chore with all the other curlers I have tried.  It&#x27;s a breeze with this and the result is better than any other.  Buy this - you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift on my birthday November 26, 2013. I didn&#x27;t actually use this product until November 23, 2014 - I was THAT intimidated by this product. Almost an entire year went by before I could summon the courage to use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says that you have to use clean hair in it and I didn&#x27;t. I used this on second day hair and it worked amazing. You definitely want to use small sections of hair for this as well. I have very thick and frizzy hair, so this took me quite a while to do a full head of curls, but the outcome was pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Whatever setting you use, when it does its final set of beeps, open the device and then pull the device down. You get perfect ringlet curls every time. Don&#x27;t open the device while simultaneously pulling down. The curls come out wonky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much and your hair gets stuck, just open it up and it releases your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lock it in with some hairspray and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Really Works, Love this.  My hair was is  shoulder length little shorter brushed it well used small sections.  No tangles, great curls lasted through a night sleep.  This is the only product I have ever used, that worked and did it well.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It works really well. I tried on my mother in law and my daughter and myself. It works well on three different type of hair. I am going to buy another set for my mom. I am disappointed to see the price goes up from 75 to 99 in 3 days! What is going on? I will buy another set when the price goes down again.</li>
            <li> My hair is incredibly stubborn and hates to hold a curl. The Curl Secret is a miracle for my hair! I use the high heat setting for 12 seconds, and my thick, heavy hair will hold a curl for 3 days with no products other than a little bit of hairspray. The only time it ever tangles is if I get a bit too much hair in a section, or the hair is wildly different lengths due to layers. Make sure that your hair is tangle free, and that you take small sections, and it should work well for you. I absolutely LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> yep, this is something one might want to try. working this out on your own in front of the mirror takes some time in the beginning. also, with long hair, it is very advisable to take very small strains of hair only. never work a same strain a second time, i looks like you never washed your hair. all over: very satisfied and after a couple of trials i know how to work it on my own. no worries if you work it on the head of your friend. again: small strains only and you get very nice results. curls may hold up to the next day depending on your hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it out yesterday, very easy to use, make sure you have heat protection product on ur hair tho (you dont wanna fry ur hair lol), This will take quite sometimes to finish ur whole hair since it only takes a bit of hair at a time, it will stop if ur hair gets tangle or you put in too much at once.</li>
            <li> I got it on time. It Works well. Very good</li>
            <li> This lets me produce gorgeous bouncy, smooth hair from very thick, coarse, wavy/frizzy long hair.  There is a learning curve - the machine must be the right way around and hair must be tangle free. If you have layers,  twist the sections with different length layers before inserting the hair into the groove, and then untwist it once the hair is deep in the groove - this prevents tangling and warning beeps. If you try to insert too much hair at once, it won&#x27;t wind up. MOST IMPORTANT: If the warning beeps sound, STOP at once and completely release the hair. If you just release the pressure on the handle and then repress it without releasing the hair, it will roll up further and get horribly snarled in the chamber. If this does happens - turn off the heat at once before starting the get the hair out - it may take a while and you want to do everything to reduce your hair burning.  Once you master the technique, it works perfectly. Every time. I have very thick, coarse, long wavy hair and masses of hairs - about 6 times as many as a normal person, my hairdresser says. Think 1.5 inch diameter ponytail. It takes me 50 minutes to straighten my hair to an acceptable level with irons or three batches of Big Curl hot rollers to curl it (and then the ends don&#x27;t curl because there is too much hair). Too. Much. Hair. I had given up.  Then I found this! LOVE Curl Secret because it doesn&#x27;t have just 12 rollers, or let me try to curl too much hair at once. It makes sure that only a reasonable amount of hair is being curled at a time, so every curl is prefect, and  I can just keep going until all my hair is curled. No more waiting for rollers to cool in my hair before reheating them for the next batch. And no more failed curling attempts with a heated tong, because I got impatient and started trying to curl way too much hair at once just to get it finished.  It takes me about 50 minutes to curl all of my hair, but I do it in batches. I take a break whenever I want/need to. I use thelowest setting, let it cool completely and then brush it well with a brush and I am left with gorgeous loose, bouncy SMOOTH big waves. Very Hollywood old style.  It lasts until my next head wash (3-4 days). If i  just brush the top and finger brush the rest, my hair stays in more ringlet type curls which I don&#x27;t prefer but which suit my daughter well. I really really love it.  I took one star off because it is not easy to get the hang of - it takes some persistence to get the technique right and I did have two serious hair-stuck-in-the-machine-and-burning snarls before I worked out how to avoid this. If I had less hair, the sections of hair I cut away would probably be upsetting! As it is, you&#x27;d never notice it in my hair so no worries there for me. I am converted! If you have unruly, wild hair - give this a try and watch it tame your hair into beautiful bouncy waves.</li>
            <li> I love it! Curling my whole head of hair in 1/2 hour is amazing. I have stick straight hair which normally won&#x27;t keep a curl unless I spray my hair to death with hairspray but these curls stay intact about 85% with just a light spray of hairspray. I LOVE that it beeps to let me know when it&#x27;s done, I don&#x27;t even have to think about what I&#x27;m doing. It&#x27;s a little top heavy which I had to get used to but it&#x27;s easy to use and figure out.</li>
            <li> Have seen this &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; on tv, looked at it online for 3 mos.--it is pricey! Finally I took he plunge, forked over the money--$117.00 with taxes, and brought it home, full of excitement and expectation. I have shoulder length straight as a stick hair cut in about 3 layers. I knew the layers might be a problem but figured I could eventually manage it.  Read the directions several times and had them down pat. Long story short--I have NEVER gotten the beautiful to a fault curl after 3 wks. of practicing, working, sweating, cursing and begging. I read ALL the reviews--good and bad. But with great sadness I must admit I have been taken. The last time was the NO NO Pro to the tune of $265.00 and it did not work either! Alas I am taking this &amp;#34;no curling&amp;#34; piece of hot metal back and to say I am disappointed is a true understatement. Please BEWARE the none curling hair rod!! Save your money and do it yourself the old hard way. Hope this has helped some of you make your decision to keep your money!!</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. The product is difficult to use, and get&#x27;s hair stuck frequently. The curls came out uneven, and fell out quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought it to use at a upscale family wedding, 3 of us in the wedding tried it, did not curl as advertised, could not use it and now it is too late to send it back......so much for that...waste of money girls.</li>
            <li> Stop working a month after I purchased it!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I was looking forward to the easy curls like they show on television. It did nothing but pull part of my hair out from the roots and I had already thinning hair. Since this device said it took tiny bits of hair at a time, I was thinking it would give me curls and body. The device came the same day I was leaving for vacation. By the time I got home and tested it, Amazon said it was too late for me to return it so  I was left with no curls and had spent $100.00 for something I could not use.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, returning.</li>
            <li> Great curls!!! Easy to use</li>
            <li> We got this for my daughters (one has pin straight hair and the other has a natural wave) as a Christmas present and now that we have used it several times I wanted to leave my review....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit was fast to heat up and fairly easy for me to use on my daughters but I don&#x27;t see them being able to do it themselves.  The device has to held a certain way in order to allow the hair to be pulled in properly and you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t trying to curl too much hair at one time.  I like the built in timer and different heat settings it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my daughter with the natural wave/curl to her hair, the Curl Secret worked great and I didn&#x27;t use any styling products either!!  I curled her hair in the morning and when she got home from school her curls were still in great condition....they even looked good the next morning after sleeping on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter with the pin straight hair is a different story....We had used other curling wands and irons that didn&#x27;t create the pretty curls she was looking for but the Curl secret did!  However, her curls didn&#x27;t last the entire day as she had hoped but I do not think this is the device&#x27;s fault.  My daughter&#x27;s hair just wants to be straight!  To get her curls to last an entire school day, I have to use the Curl Secret on the highest setting with the timer set to the longest time (plus I tend to leave the hair in for an extra couple of seconds)...plus, we had to use several styling products including a bunch of hair spray with made her curls seem a little &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; instead of bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I liked the device and if I had long hair still I&#x27;d be using it on myself!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and does a wonderful job !</li>
            <li> Thick curly hair for myself and two daughters 10 &amp; 13 and this is perfect to style the front &amp; crown when you want to have a finished look or am touch up that is not frizzy. And it&#x27;s great to do the entire head when u have more time! I saw a friend&#x27;s  and then a friend saw mine we all love them! Easy way to wear your hair down and look professional. I love it!!! 😍</li>
            <li> I am not a stylist by any stretch of the imagination.  My hair is very short since I&#x27;m so bad with taking care of my hair, but I can actually work this and put curls in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She&#x27;s nine and nothing makes her happy...but she was HAPPY!  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with other curling irons and this tool was worth the money. It made it easy to use and amazing curls.</li>
            <li> Expensive bought for my daughter because she couldn&#x27;t figure out what she wanted for Christmas. She used a few times not impressed for price :/</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair that never stays curled. I bought this curler as a gift for my daughter who also has tough hair to curl. Unlike myself, she has no curling iron experience.  However, she and I both found this curler easy to use. The curls last much longer that curls you get from other high temperature curling irons.  It takes a few strands of hair, before you figure out just how you want to make each curl, loose or tight  Hate the cost, however  the quality of the product justifies the purchase. I have paid more money for high temperature curling irons that curls last half the time of this curler.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER, I repeat, NEVER been able to get a curl in my hair. I got a perm when I was a kid and the ish fell out! Anyways, I bought this at Target just in case I needed a QUICK AND EASY return (smell what I&#x27;m stepping in, Amazon?), and I have to say I am amazed. I read the directions thoroughly, because let&#x27;s face it - this thing looks a little terrifying and conjures memories of getting my hair wrapped up in a spiral brush as a kid. Small brushed pieces, 1-inch, face towards the head, yadda yadda, some beeping, stay calm...VIOLA - magic curls. I actually plugged this beautiful baby in at my desk at work, and used a pocket mirror to test it out, I couldn&#x27;t stand the wait! I also tested a piece of my boss&#x27; hair for good measure. She is purchasing one tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;1- Don&#x27;t panic when it keeps winding after all your hair is sucked in. It&#x27;s just a formality. Stay calm and wait for the beeps.&lt;br /&gt;2- Don&#x27;t panic when your hair goes in and gets caught. Notice I said when, not if. This IS going to happen. It&#x27;s part of the dance, go with it, release the handle and gently untangle. Try again.&lt;br /&gt;3- The timer is a guideline, test the waters, and hold longer if need be. The curler doesn&#x27;t release until you let the handle go.&lt;br /&gt;4- MY GOD FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. Ladies (and Gents, no discrimination here. Let them long locks flow and curl fellas), if you&#x27;re near-bout to cut off a lock of hair because you got her twisted in there so deep Channel 11 news is runnin a special on you...you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Really wrong. This thing is idiot-proof, trust me. I&#x27;m an idiot, card-carrying member since &#x27;78.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this for my daughter for christmas so I went online and read some reviews and watched some you tube videos on the product and saw mostly positives so I ordered and am I happy!! This thing is awesome!! Once u get the hang of using it u can have ur entire head pf hair curled in no time! I&#x27;ve used it more than she has!! Highly recommend!! Another thing id like to add is that my hair does not hold curl well, its very straight but the curls from using this thing lasted all day! I couldn&#x27;t get over it! I HIGHLY recommend this Curler!!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walmart yesterday. I have a little longer than shoulder length hair with layers. It was recently cut and my stylist curled it with a standard iron. I was so frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t duplicate the look at home. Seriously, this curler is amazing! I don&#x27;t really see how other reviewers got it stuck in their hair. I did my entire head today and it looks awesome! You do have to use half to one inch sections but if you try to put in too much it beeps and releases. I&#x27;m not saying it couldn&#x27;t happen but it worked great for me!! Love, love, love!!!!</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about this product but decided to take a chance. I was worried it would eat my hair like some of the reviewers have said, so I was super careful when I first tried it out. I have very thick long hair that takes forever to curl and then the curls fall out really fast. The first time I curled my hair it felt a little awkward to hold but it curled perfectly and fast and the curls held overnight and into the next day. I made sure to keep the sections small and brush through them which is key with this curler. The second time I curled my hair I got better and faster and it didn&#x27;t feel awkward anymore. There was a couple times I did it a little sloppy and it beeped at me to redo it but definitely didn&#x27;t eat my hair it just let it go. I think its worth the money and I love it but you do for sure need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I now live with a movie star due to this machine. My wife has long hair which is now perfectly curled &amp;#34;movie star&amp;#34;  long hair. This little machine just pulls the hair in and curls it. Then it pushes it out. You would think that is a recipe for disaster, but no its easy to use and makes perfect curls fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we have gotten 4 of these from various sources. We got three of this type and one Babyliss Nano. All are good - the Babyliss has more features. Why so many? Friends beg for them and my wife gives the curler to them. Can be hard to get.</li>
            <li> I really love this curling iron and its everything that i was hoping for, very easy to use your hair don&#x27;t get tangled in it and the curls hold very well. I love love love it that&#x27;s why am giving it 5stars. I highly recommend it and it worth the money</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t anything work like it does on the commercial.  I used the hottest setting with most time and barely got a curl.  Plus it is heavy and after trying to get it to curl my hair for about 5 min my arms were getting tired.  Save your money because this item is a dud.</li>
            <li> Because the instructions were not clear. It was a heavy item and just not very easy to use. Pulled hair and did not release hair easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to curl my hair myself &amp; when others have curled it for me, the curls don&#x27;t last long because I have such fine hair.  With the Curl Secret, not only can I curl it myself but the curls last even overnight!  It takes a little getting used to but once you get it down, it&#x27;s awesome.  I didn&#x27;t give it five starts because of it&#x27;s weight.  I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s from the motor in it so necessary but does get heavy.  I have a little longer then shoulder length hair &amp; it takes me about 30 minutes from start to finish.  Oh, &amp; I don&#x27;t even need to use hair spray to keep the curls in!  It&#x27;s turly amazing &amp; worth the price!!</li>
            <li> This curler is a little too picky.  If your not careful it rips your hair out!  I have learned it will only curl a small amount of hair properly or keeps winding one way or the other until you&#x27;ve got a mess and have to start over.  It is tricky to use at first, takes a lot of time and practice to get the perfect curl.  Don&#x27;t  expect the right curl the first or second time.  It does hold a curl to the next morning but humidity does loosen pit fast.</li>
            <li> Love this. Tween daughter recd as a Christmas gift and it works very well. We watched a YouTube video beforehand which helped answer our questions. It takes about 25- min to do my daughters hair; shoulder length thick hair. We use small 1/2&amp;#34; segments of hair at a time or less. Very fun!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived we took it out of the box and used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I was worried about her hair getting tangled in the iron so at first I was using super small sections of hair. After a few sections I went up to an inch width and not once did it tangle or pull. It does produce beautiful curls, though patience is a must because it can be time consuming for long hair like my daughter. So far this is the best tool I&#x27;ve ever used to curl hair. Perfect for creating beautiful curls, just follow each and every step in the instructions. And if for some reason your hair is harder to keep curl then use a styling product or spritz curl booster. I&#x27;m absolutely love the Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it puts a different type of curl in my hair than my regular irons do. I have very long, medium thick, fine hair. First, if your hair gets stuck, open and close the curler until it lets it go. No need to pull hair out. Second, if you twist the strand that you are going to curl at the top, it will eliminate random hairs getting in and tangling it all up. I only gave this product a 4 because, although I love the type of curls, they do not say very long. This is a problem when it take 3 times longer to do my hair this way. I do like it and I would recommend it though, only using the tricks that I mentioned because before I figured those out, I was ready to throw the thing away! lol</li>
            <li> This product produces very nice curls, but have in mind that you need to first brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend that you first read the instructions in order not to have any problems or hair damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will demand some time and effort - specially if you are alone and have to grab hair on the back of your head - so be patient to take not too much hair at the same time (or the Conair Curl will stop working) and do not use in the highest temperature if you have damaged thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the purchase, but not for daily use, definetly only for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Such a fast quick gadget.  It takes a few times to get the technique down.&lt;br /&gt;Need to use small pieces and difficult to do the back without help until you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine thin hair so it holds a curl better than a curling iron.  My hair flattens within an hour normally.  This stays much longer.  I have friends that have this and their hair holds for days because they have thicker, more voluminous hair.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a really fun product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly.  Happy with product overall.</li>
            <li> Takes a very long time to do long hair. Curler pulls hair and curls are of uneven size. I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> This thing works like the commercials.  The best part is that somehow the curls last all day vs. traditional curling iron.  I have straight Asian hair and usually by the end of the day, you can&#x27;t tell I curled anything but with Curl Secret, it looks almost as strong as it did in the morning.  However there are many negatives for a beginner.  It is ultra sensitive in how you put the hair in it. You cannot take a huge or even a large chunk of hair or it gets tangled and it is like heck to get out.  You must have very smooth hair to work well.  Anyone with dry, kinky hair, I cannot imagine would do well for the same reason.  As you notice the commercials and even the youtube vids show ppl with healthy smooth hair.  It is also hard to do the back of your head on your own.  It is somewhat heavy to be holding.  Not a time saver.  I find I only use it if I know I have at least 30 mins free.  I use my iron for the few wispy curls around my face.  The Curl secret is too strong for that so no doing it halfway and taking off.  I have had it for 6 month and only used it twice and I curl my long hair at least 3 times a week.  I love the result but it is daunting to use and takes forever doing one inch at a time.  Instead I use it for special occasions.  Ironically I still recommend this product, just not for the inexperienced.</li>
            <li> OMG is is the best product  . My hair is long and very staringht and i never could do a curl in my hair but with this product iam full of woolly  (lol) . I recommend 100 % . If you want a product that really works must buy this . I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Love it - It works well, going to order another one in the future!  Came exactly when I was told it would</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally have something that would give me the curls I&#x27;ve always longed for. What a let down. I have stick straight hair, and it curls with the right iron, but this would not curl the ends of my hair. It only curled my hair near the scalp, then the ends would still be straight. It&#x27;s kind of heavy, so it&#x27;s really hard to try and do the back of your head yourself. If your hair curls easily, and you have someone else to do it for you, it would probably work great. Just not for me, but everyone&#x27;s different. So give it a try, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, send it back. I did.</li>
            <li> This works great - no damage to hair - works on all hair types.  Becareful though to use as directed.  I have not personally experienced problems but have heard instances where it had.</li>
            <li> If someone said this is hard to use, I am sure that she used in a wrong way. At the first time, I can&#x27;t use it well. And it always bibi. But after a few times trying, I finally know that how to use it appropriately. And it is a great product!</li>
            <li> coolest invention ever! i&#x27;ve always wanted spiral curls and could never get them right. this works amazing well, is super simple and for the first time ever, i didn&#x27;t even have to use any hair products. the next day i woke up and it still looked great. highly highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, and I won&#x27;t get burned on the hand. Love it!</li>
            <li> Estou extremamente decepcionada! O aparelho com 7 meses de uso e não funciona mais. Não Índico.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely disappointed ! The device with 7 months of use and no longer works. Not Indian .</li>
            <li> This is a very good product</li>
            <li> This thing it truly revolutionary. It works just like it does in the commercials. I have really gross hair, it&#x27;s frizzy, it&#x27;s not quite straight and it&#x27;s not quite wavy. It&#x27;s just a wild frizzball mess. Anyway, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well. I have a really great hot tools curling iron, but the effect lasts 20 mins unless I blast it with hairspray and then it ends up being crunchy all day, and even then it doesnt hold very well. The curl secret can create perfect tight curls with less effort that will hold for hours without hairspray. Also, my hair never gets stuck it in. There is a safety feature that releases the hair if you put in too much. I honestly cannot believe anyone wouldn&#x27;t give this five stars. It&#x27;s a miracle product. And believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. Easy to use. My wife love it. No problems at all</li>
            <li> first off when I received it already had hair caught in it. Secondly it didn&#x27;t work at all pulling my hair in I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s why it had hair in it already</li>
            <li> My wife love it. Arrived on time and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Super easy and perfect curls!</li>
            <li> I give it zero. I&#x27;ve used it plenty of times and I just had to cut a peic r of my hair out because it got caught and I tried for an hour to get it out without cutting it but couldnt. I am looking for corporates contact information.</li>
            <li> Not worth it I bought this at ultra and this is horrible I went and bought a better one on amazon for 60.00 this one destroyed my hair when I took small sections.</li>
            <li> Took some getting used to... spent a lot of time looking like i had dread locks, or practicing the art of removing my hair from the darn thing BUT! I have learned to use it and LOOOOOOVE IT!</li>
            <li> did not work as expected.. sent back.</li>
            <li> Our granddaughter loved it. In fact, her cousin was interested in getting one for herself. Our granddaughter&#x27;s very curly hair was turned into soft flowing curls. Excellent value</li>
            <li> Love it.  Curls my hair great!</li>
            <li> Works great. Regular curling irons don&#x27;t seem to keep my hair curled.&lt;br /&gt;I have really long, wavy hair. Not super thick hair, but not thin either.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it before a wedding. I should have practiced before the wedding. Don&#x27;t try to be good at using this the first time. Try to practice using it before you have some important thing to go to. Takes some practice to figure out how much hair you can do at once, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But otherwise, I love the product. Once you know what&#x27;s going on, its super easy and you can get your hair done quickly, even with really long hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;(My hair length is right between the middle of my back and butt)&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair got a little stuck, but it wasn&#x27;t too terribly hard to get it back out. No damage done.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve curled my hair probably 6 times in the past month and a half where as before that, I curled my hair maybe once a year. It&#x27;s that easy and quick!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  The curl stays longer in her hair than a regular curling iron.  Mom scores on this one!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great fast way for beach waves. Be carful not to use to much hair, or it gets tangled.</li>
            <li> This was very hard to use.</li>
            <li> well first off im a beginner at curling hair , i never curl my hair because honestly i suck at it .. lol !! i have thick wavy hair so it usually takes forever . but this product changed all that , it took me 10 minutes to do my whole head !! its easy , my hair hasnt gotten tangled at all . i loveeeeeeeee the curl secret !</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my two granddaughters.  They both have long hair and wear it straight as does every other tween.  But now and then, I&#x27;m sure they will use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy the Curl secret from Amazon.. I bought from Khols.. with Khols cash and other coupons, so I didnt pay but $40 bucks for it.. I almost didnt buy it, because of the terrible reviews about the hair getting tangled, either having to be cut our machine disassembled to remove the hair..  Ok first off.. Either I have a newer model or others did not use it correctly by reading the directions first..  The machine has a built in damage control.. If your hair starts to tangle the machine automatically beeps and stops.. Releasing the handle the hair releases.. Second.. You can feel it start to tangle so just release the lever and it stops.. Not sure how one could tangle their hair so badly.. follow the directions it wont happen.. Third...You have to use smaller portions of your hair than you would a regular curling iron..So may take you just a bit longer than a regular iron.. But let me say..the curls are amazing.. Long spiral curls.. it has adjustment numbers for tighter curls or looser..  I get compliments on my hair all the time.. It is a great iron.. 6 other curling irons I have.. none of which come close to the curls this one gives...  I highly recommend.. just be smart and read the directions first on how to use it.. It is at first a little awkward..but you get the hang of it pretty quickly.. If done properly you will not get tangled..</li>
            <li> Its pretty cool. I don&#x27;t really use this thing very much, but it does to an awesome job. Thank you on the expediency of this order!</li>
            <li> Awful! Bought it for my daughter who has long hair.  (little pass shoulder length) Kept getting stuck but would usually unwind...the final straw when it did not unwind and kept her hair in the roll burning it...I had to rip the hair out strand by strand. Its going back!</li>
            <li> awesome! my daughter has the thickest hair in the world and it never holds curl! ( I&#x27;m a licensed stylist) so i know all the tricks!&lt;br /&gt;Worked great and her hair was still curly the next morning and it took about 16 minutes to curl all her hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had true using curling irons and rollers. I have had the best result with this product. It is extremely easy to use and gives great results. It has three different time setting and has different heat settings. Most of you are probably lyrics worried by it pulling your hair out. If you follow the instructions, this will not happen. Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much hair, face it th e correct way and make sure your hair is brushed well. The curls hold up very well. I used it to curl my hair for my recent wedding. Everyone e loved it</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job of curling hair.  My 9 year old daughter can do it herself without any assistance.  Takes a while though, and doesn&#x27;t last overnight.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I want it to do and the price is pretty hefty.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old daughter early for xmas ..she begged me for it ,but when she first tried it her hair got all stuck in this and she wanted to return it ...too late to.return so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend  loved it</li>
            <li> Horrible! The product delivered was an absolute fake! The plug - two prong plug didn&#x27;t even work - one prong was larger than the other and couldn&#x27;t even be used! Such an utter waste of time waiting and then be completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars because it is priced higher than most retailers.  This product appears to be the same device I purchased on Amazon by a different manufacturer and paid almost twice as much.  I purchased the Babyliss Micro curler Nano and paid $190.  Ulta is selling this same Conair curler for $100.00.  I am surprised Amazon is so much higher they are usually more competitive on price.  My daughter is purchasing this device, I will update my review after we try to compare how the curling works, heat damage, sturdiness etc.</li>
            <li> This is a split review.  I bought this from Walmart yesterday.  My daughter has very thick hair, so I tried it on her this morning for school.  The curls came out PERFECT.  Just beautiful.  Then I used it on my hair today, with less than optimal results.  My hair is in a bob hairstyle.  I thought since it was shorter hair, the curl would be even better.  But it wasn&#x27;t.  I ended up with some lifeless waves that are almost gone now 2 hours later.  I even turned it up to high and 12 seconds.  I&#x27;m going to get the Babyliss one now, because I like the idea of alternating curls plus the higher max temperature.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck.  Oh, my hair got stuck 3 times.  I felt it kind of knot up as it started to be sucked into the machine, but it instantly released, as smoothly as it comes out with a good curl.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro Curler works just as advertised, and the curls last all day. The only drawback is that the curling slot for the hair is extremely slim, so you can only curl a small section of hair at a time. I have thick hair, so this makes the process time consuming, but the results make it worth the time. Patience &#x3D; Perfect Curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynda&lt;br /&gt;New Jersey</li>
            <li> Easy to use. But it is one function different to baby bliss one. You cannot choose the direction of the hair curling. It&#x27;s fixed as alternate direction.&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that, all other is fine and good.</li>
            <li> When used correctly it will give you beautiful curls! Make sure you read the directions. I also watched a how to video. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> was hesitant at first but this product delivers!</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR LONG HAIR!!!! Since he curl is so small and my hair is about hip-length, I can only put small amounts of hair in and it takes forever! I have super straight hair so I thought it&#x27;d be useful, but the machine tangles my hair a lot and I have to fight it to pull my hair out! I loved the product when my hair was shorter, but it&#x27;s been such a hassle to use lately. Even with shorter hair, if you have any bit of out of place hair, this thing WILL tangle it, be careful! I do not think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I hate using curling irons because for me it&#x27;s hard to do, and I&#x27;m always scared of burning myself. This tool does the work for you AND you don&#x27;t get burned. Also, my hair holds the curl better with this tool than it ever has with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was not a believer until my mom ordered this. It&#x27;s now mine!! I have very long, fine, smooth hair that looks nice curled...for the 5 minutes the curl usually lasts. I used this (yes it takes some getting used to) and my hair took to it instantly. It took about 30 minutes total and lasted the entire day! I was in and out of doors in warm weather and my hair looked great. My boyfriend said it was his favorite look, called it my wild hair! It&#x27;s not messy but looks professionally done and voluminous, not ringlets. I even tried just doing a few accent pieces instead of my whole head, when I was in a hurry, and it still looked great and held. I didn&#x27;t even use much hairspray or any other products. Some reviewers complained about hair getting stuck. Admittedly my hair is smooth so that may help but it only got stuck twice and if you just open the tool completely it usually falls out easily or with only a gentle tug. It&#x27;s no different than an old school bristled curling iron in that respect. If you have trouble with your hair holding curl or want a more modern and professional looking curl, this tool is definitely worth the cost...and this is coming from a major cheapskate!</li>
            <li> This products works beautifully!!!  I just used it to curl my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s very long, thick hair and it was fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Curls never stayed in my hair until i bought this thing.  It&#x27;s definitely a learning curve to it. I&#x27;m still learning but i love it.  If you hear the slow 5 beats you did it right. If you hear 5 rapid beats then you messed up and you have to wrestle with the thing to get your hair out.  If you mess up either you put the hair in wrong or you grabbed too much hair</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it it does what it says it is sapose to do she used it it makes really good curls</li>
            <li> Great Tool for my gal !  She loves it !&lt;br /&gt;and it really works and curl holds for a while !</li>
            <li> NOT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH TONS OF HAIR.    do not buy this if you have a lot of hair, you will need to separate your hair in small sections and it will take you ages to get done.  the curling barrel is teeny tiny and can handle only small strands.  if you have a lot of hair, like i do, you will look like a poodle/lion mix by the time you finish and run your fingers through your curls.  i did not like this product at all. it takes me less time to curl with a curling iron.  plus the curls look less shirley temple like (i used the lowest heat setting for the lowest heating time).  the pic i enclosed is of the last (5th layer from the bottom) section of curled hair.  my hair was so big i had to tie it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking there would be no way it works but gave it a chance based on other positive reviews. It makes nice curls and does not tangle as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in it. When I got a tangle, I just quickly unplugged and untangled without trouble. I have very thick hair that curls pretty easily. If gave me a nice shaped curl. You get a curl similar to what you would get with a curling wand without the weird end and the burns on your fingers.</li>
            <li> This Curler did not work as advertised on TV. When used on different types of hair, it was not as effective as advertised. Also, the beeper that tells you that your hair is finished curling, was not consistent. It would be at different times and different intervals.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long long hair, that never hold a curl - this thing works without hairspray even. It does take some getting used to, it will make mean noises at you if you&#x27;re using it wrong, so you just take your hair out and start again. To do my entire head it takes about 45 minutes, but I have a lot of hair - great for doing just a few curls, too</li>
            <li> My hair was way too thick for this.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try this because of the comments people have made about their hair getting stuck in this device.  I purchased it and waited for several days before finally giving it a try.  Wow.  I&#x27;ve used it several times with fantastic results and have yet to get my hair tangled in this thing.  If you brush out your hair before inserting it into the &amp;#34;chamber&amp;#34; you shouldn&#x27;t have any problem.  All you have to do is wait for the beeps to let you know when it is finished curling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used small amounts of hair each time I curled it... probably around 1/2 inch.  I think the less hair you feed into it, the better the results.  If a section wasn&#x27;t curled as much as I wanted, I&#x27;d let it cool and go back and feed it through again.  It came out perfectly.  Once finished and combed through (finger combing),  you get amazing curls that last!  This does work best on freshly washed/dried hair.  I also cut back on my conditioner so that it&#x27;s not weighed down.  My hair type is straight, medium thickness and generally does not hold curl at all.  Seriously.  I&#x27;ve had great results with this...  Don&#x27;t be afraid to give this a try!</li>
            <li> I thought about returning this curling iron. It takes a long time to do your hair because you have to use such small pieces of hair. It works the best with super straight hair not curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I sent it back.  It didn&#x27;t measure up to it&#x27;s marketing PR, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Device is simple to use. Seems to curle hair much better on finer thinner hair such as my mullet. My wife&#x27;s hair, whose is thick and full seems to curls just nicely. However my fine business in the front party in the rear is a real treat!</li>
            <li> Are you sick &amp; tired of hearing the overused term \\&quot;AMAZING\\&quot;, just like I am?  Well get ready to hear it again because this little gem of a product is exactly that... A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I stumbled across this product while leafing through a Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond catalog.  A product that could actually produce curls in my straight, lifeless hair?  Yeah, right.  I decided to check out the reviews and couldn&#x27;t believe the rave reviews this product was getting.  THAT DAY after work I went out and purchased one (didn&#x27;t want to wait for it to be shipped).    People are right when they say it&#x27;s idiot-proof!  It&#x27;s SO easy to use!  If you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t like spending time reading through instructions, just make sure you hold it properly and put the part that says \\&quot;This side faces head\\&quot; towards your head before putting your hair in.  Use small stands of hair (about 1/2 thick).  If you try to load too thick a strand, it will beep 3 times right off the bat to let you know it&#x27;s overloaded.  Choose your heat setting and how tight a curl you want and get ready to be wowed!    It&#x27;s been two hours since I curled my hair and I&#x27;m sitting here at work sitting pretty with LOTS of curls!  For what it cost, this product is well worth what I spent since it actually does what it claims.  No more fumbling around with hot rollers ever again!  Thank you, Conair!</li>
            <li> The curler is very easy to operate and it is very fast. However, the curls don&#x27;t last long at all!! The first time they were great and lasted for some time but ever since then they last two hours at most! Although I would like to say that when my hair is curled it looks amazing!! It&#x27;s just too bad they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I never take time to write reviews but I felt like I had to do this service for those who want curly hair.  I have long thick wavy hair.  I have to either straighten it or curl it so it looks good.  I did not believe for a second that this product would work.  But I thought I would shell out the money and give it a try, and if it didn;t work I would return it.  Wel....I will be keeping this forever.  I washed my hair one night, then used the Curl Secret and my curls turned out perfect. Not how the ends are frizzy with a regular curling iron but smooth Shirley Temple curls.  I went to bed that night and when I woke up the curls looked exactly as they did the night before.  I was totally amazed.  I only have to wash my hair and curl it once a week now because the curls are bouncy and I have a ton of volume.  So, my point is.... if you want beautiful curls...Spend the money on this tool.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!  BTW...I always thought that company&#x27;s pay people to write good reviews.  I am here to tell you, as an averge consumer that this is a must have beauty tool!!</li>
            <li> I like this Conair curl cause it makes nice curls. it is easy to store in my cupboards. love it!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get it to work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, perfect  curles! Just amazing and unbelievable, beautiful and shiny curles, delivered in time. Thanks!</li>
            <li> VERY UPSET!This Contraption is a NIGHTMARE!! I had to cut a huge chunk of my long blonde hair after it got stuck in this thing! Please save your hair and Don&#x27;t buy this! I couldn&#x27;t even take the thing apart to save my hair. And even with the tiniest screw driver I couldn&#x27;t even take this thing apart! I had NO option but to cut my hair from almost the root because this thing sucked my hair almost to my scalp. I am horrified that this thing is even for sale it is UNSAFE!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that the manufacture would be the best in that I had purchased from them before &amp;that item has lasted many yrs, but in the case of this product it just didn&#x27;t work as well as the one my sister bought &amp; let me borrow (Curl Genius, by Blisspro) I&#x27;ve returned this one&amp; purchased the other.</li>
            <li> My wife found the perfect product; spoke that no woman should miss this product in your beauty kit and to arrange for parties and casual events, The money is excellent;</li>
            <li> Awesome! I have straight hair and never holds a curl for long. This is an AMAZING tool! Easy to use and the curl holds all day long. The curls can be tight or looser depending on the setting you choose. I am very happy with Curl Secret .</li>
            <li> It does curl you hair but your hair must be somewhat smoothed prior to the use or there is still some areas near your scalp that will be frizzy.  It is definitely easy to use as long as you follow the directions and does not tangle your hair if used properly.  For long hair it will curl a fair length but you cannot have a totally curled head.  Right after curling a length it has to cool for a bit so the curl can set.  I have been using some of the same products I use when I straighten my hair with this curler.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to use a curling iron to curl my hair without messing it up somehow. I LOVE CURL SECRET!!</li>
            <li> I  sent it to my best friend in Spain and I was so impressed that it only took a week to arrived! It is a great product and I really recommended. I have one myself.</li>
            <li> I am predicting a recall. My hair falls to just above the middle of my back. I sectioned my hair according to the instructions but about 1 of every 5 sections of hair would end up completely tangled inside the unit. There isn&#x27;t a cancel or release button to get your hair out of the curler if this happens so panic quickly ensues. You have to yank your hair out of the curler (and yes, hair also gets yanked out of your head) as quickly as you can since it can burn your hair while its stuck in there. Even when my hair didn&#x27;t get stuck, the curler would sound the &amp;#34;malfunction&amp;#34; beep and I would have to try curling that section of hair again... hoping that the curler wouldn&#x27;t eat my hair. Luckily, I was able to pull my hair out of the machine when it got stuck.... apparently some reviewers had to cut their hair out. I was so excited about the product because the first few curls looked great but it&#x27;s just too risky and dangerous so I have to return it. Insert grumpy face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairdresser and saw this and immediately wanted to try it! I was skeptical wouldn&#x27;t work like the higher priced ones I&#x27;ve seen on the market. To start, I loved the color. Every time I use it I find it better and better! Not only is it easier than a regular iron, it creates a buzz in the salon!!!!! It&#x27;s light weight and foolproof. It will let you know if the hair is not placed in the chamber properly! I rarely use it on shorter hair, mostly on long! It does say to use with clean hair but I like the results better if I used a dry hairspray before curling the hair.</li>
            <li> It is a really good curler but you can not have and tangles I was watching beauty break and I saw lilly using this and so I decided to buy it but it your is like a perm (not being racial) your hair may get fries and with my hair that is semi curly I got my hair stuck and I did have to cut off a piece but dont hesitate on it,it was my fault I had many tangles in my hair and my hair is long. If your hair is long dont start at the root start in the middle of the section and you have to use small sections it took 45 minutes to do my hair all around I would say its a pretty good product</li>
            <li> I have thick hair with lots of volume. I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, curling wands, French braiding, scrunching with gels and curling hair sprays. Nothing worked!! I was skeptical to try this product but figured I would try it and return it if it didn&#x27;t work. BEST $100 INVESTED!!! I love this item, it curls so amazingly and is super easy to use. For the best results be sure to read the instructions and you just might find the perfect answer to curls!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter and it almost destroyed her hair! It got stuck and couldnt get it to release. Very scary!</li>
            <li> Do Not use this product. It is Christmas morning and we just spent an hour trying to untangle my daughters hair from this device. Ultimately we had to break it and open it up as the hair was stuck so far in that it was cut it off or break the curler.</li>
            <li> It took my 14 and 16 year old daughters 2 hours to do each other hair.  It has good results but you will need to have patients and time to work with it.</li>
            <li> I adore this curler.  It makes my hair look so much fuller and with the Babyliss curl Prep I can curl my hair with the Infiniti Pro, sleep on it and it is still curly the next day and the next.  I have never spent this much on a hair curler, but this one is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She has long blonde hair and the comercials showed it making long ringlets. It barely made a kink in her hair. We followed the instuctions and let it heat as long as it said, then had it grab the hair where the instuctions told us to. NOTHING! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift for my 23 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  She does her hair in no time and she has great curls that last all day.  I would definitely recommend it.  Actually thinking about buying myself one.  It is worth the money.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but definitely not worth $99!! I think I&#x27;d recommend buying a good set of rollers or curling iron!</li>
            <li> I love it. I have titanium fused wrists and other hand joints, so the curler is the best. Not sure if this is typical or if something has happened, but it has seemed to become much louder when it runs now. (5 uses in) Hope it&#x27;s okay. Besides the increase in noise, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying this on day I skip washing my hair and I couldn&#x27;t get a bend never mind a curl.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three because i am hoping it will work better tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This is the first product ever that made me love having curls! I was scared to try it at first, but the product is amazing. Everyone compliments my hair, and you don&#x27;t know how many people have asked me to do their hair with this product!</li>
            <li> Had a bit of a mix up and didn&#x27;t get product for 2 weeks but once we got it It is Great.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this tool.  I am not one to do my own hair, would just wear it straight or in a ponytail, but this has changed my ways.  It is incredibly easy to use and makes amazing curls! If I hairspray after using they easily last 2 days. I have hair shorter than my shoulders and can do my hair in less than 20 minutes with this.  I have not had any issues getting it tangled, but I am careful to keep the correct side to my head (it tells you which side) and not put in too big of sections.  I have received many compliments on the curls this produces.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, I got it from Walgreens, but the price and features are the same everywhere. I should have known something was wrong when the cashier at the store told me &amp;#34;Hold on to your receipt if you need to bring this back&amp;#34;. I thought it was odd at the time, and now I assume she&#x27;s probably seen a few returns on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets hot quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Curls are not bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;Curls end up more like waves.&lt;br /&gt;Curls are completely gone from my hair after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, the cons make this thing worthless.</li>
            <li> It can take a few minutes to complete, as only small portions of hair can be tsken at a time, but beautiful loose curls are created. My daughter has lots of thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> It did not work for my hair so I decided to give to my daughter in law to try.  She loves it.  She has hair that is fine but she has a lot of it.  It is also all the same length.  It took her about three times to get used to it.  Once she did, she has not had a problem.  The curl holds even when she sleeps on it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my 16 year old daughter, she did her entire head of hair in 10 minutes. Beautiful ringlets. My hair is to my waist and she did mine in the same amount of time. Does not tangle. Very cool product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 13 year old for christmas.  I had her open it early so we can do our hair for xmas eve.  Well it was awesome.  She did her hair as well as mine.  The curls lasted 2 days and were beautiful.  Probably last longer, but i shower daily.  We both have fine hair but lots of it.  If you use it properly per the instructions (brush hair and use small amount) it wont get stuck..We had a packed bathroom xmas eve of girls trying it.  so much fun.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, very easy to use and gives professional results in very short time and leaves the hair looking great</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, pulled the hair, awkward. Some friends also tried it with the same results. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it, the curls last for days. The only downside it takes practice in the beggining to get used to it and achieve the perfect curls. Make sure when you put the hair into the curler, the hair is perpendicular to the machine and not straight down.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron down from the color to how big it is. I like that it&#x27;s very easy to follow and that if you do the directions step by step you will be fine. I have done it three times to my hair it&#x27;s only got caught because of my own fault. I also like that there are tons of directions that say what to do even on the iron</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for her Birthday.  She watched a few YouTube videos to learn how to use it.  On the third curl she came running out of the bathroom screaming that the thing ate her hair.  It did.  I grabbed it (HOT !!! ... don&#x27;t grab it)  and tried to free her hair.  After a few minutes, I got her loose.  Hair was crispy ...  It seemed to work on shorter hair, but NOT on longer hair.</li>
            <li> Finally...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product is here....&lt;br /&gt;Time saving.&lt;br /&gt;Safe.&lt;br /&gt;Good looking.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;Green on energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have cheaper versions and make women happy :)</li>
            <li> This curling iron is really THE BEST. I&#x27;m inept when it comes to using traditional curling irons or the curling wands. (I&#x27;ve tried for the past 7 years while no success at curls!) I saw this gem and got it for Christmas. It works fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes: I have really thick hair and is to my lower back. Because of both of these I have to use tiny sections of hair in the curling iron. Make sure you brush your hair really well, and if it gets stuck, make sure to brush it again, otherwise it WILL get caught in the barrel. Learned that mistake first hand because I had to cut my hair from it getting so fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this wonderful product lets even a dummy like me (when it comes to hair, at least) be able to have the most beautiful curls I ever had. You will love this curler! It&#x27;s so simple, because you close it, let it work its magic, and then open it up and let the curls fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would suggest is to make a model with removable barrels so you can switch out the sizes and have some big, and some smaller curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Easy to use and only takes minutes</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.  I would say 50% of the time it would wrap up my hair strand and nearly rip the hair out of my head.  You either have to use extremely small portions of hair (which takes forever) or you risk ripping your hair out.  And if your hair is longer than shoulder length it struggles with that as well.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I used my few times and so far no complains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure, but I believe if it was warmer would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I can do curly waves without much hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product and good vendor as well</li>
            <li> I was captivated by this product on the commercials. I mean, how could you not be, right? And while normally I wouldn&#x27;t spent $100 on a curling iron because it looked cool on a commercial, this was an exception. The idea is amazing. I had been burning myself with my curling wand all the time and the curls were coming out sloppy and loose anyway. To be fair, the Curl Secret takes a little bit of practice. I always used to curl my hair as a solution to second-day hair, and the Curl Secret works much better with freshly washed/dried hair. Your hair definitely has to be straight/non-tangled so I&#x27;d recommend brushing it right before putting it in the curl-chamber. The biggest thing that helped me is trying to curl SMALL pieces. That seems totally obvious, but really, the smaller you make the curls, the better they come out and the better they stay. For me, the 12-second timer on high with small pieces makes perfect ringlets. I love that there&#x27;s no more flinging around my curling wand trying to wrap my long hair around it. There&#x27;s also no more guessing how long you&#x27;ve been sitting there waiting for it to curl (so no burning your hair off like in that viral Youtube video). I also love that you can put the curl chamber right up to the side of your head, so you don&#x27;t have curls starting awkwardly a few inches down your hair. And it&#x27;s seriously IMPOSSIBLE to burn yourself. I thought that the Curl Secret would be a great way to make curls quickly and easily. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t make really fast curls out of second-day hair like I originally wanted. But Curl Secret makes AMAZING curls easily and they stay without buckets of hair spray.  They look great, they stay great, and they&#x27;re easy to do. I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> I never read instructions but would recommend it with this item as it is something none of us has seen before.  It works great, just as described.  I have baby fine hard to curl hair and it curls wonderfully. It is a bit awkward to use until you get used to it.  Practice a couple of times before you are using it to go out or anything.  Dream come true for me to be able to actually do something different with my hair and have it hold up</li>
            <li> Amazing! Loved it easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t fall down easy, its stays the sane till the end of the day</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this curler today however it&#x27;s nothing more than an expensive piece of junk and its going back!  I followed the instructions - I&#x27;m not sure what I got but I do know it&#x27;s not a curl .... Then the limp wave disappeared after 30 minutes, it was a waste of time.  It&#x27;s heavy and uncomfortable to hold....</li>
            <li> While the apparatus does make curls, what one does not  know is that you have to use such a small amount of hair that it takes forever to do it.  I like convenience, not work. It was 99 bucks thrown away!!!</li>
            <li> It quit working as good as it did when I first got it.  In the beginning it was great . I didnt use it every day just a couple times. Haven&#x27;t even used it 15 times and doesn&#x27;t curl like it did at first . I&lt;br /&gt;Used it in clean straight hair. But didn&#x27;t last long for the price</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this thing but was surprisingly impressed. It works great and as long as you follow the instruction your hair won&#x27;t be caught in it. Use small sections and it will easily come out if it does get caught. Not the end of the world.very nice results.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Super easy to use, beautiful curls, no burns, and totally awesome for rookies like! I would recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, wavey, frizzy hair. This product smoothed the friz and gave me a perfect curl. Got many compliments. Only warning is make sure you take smaller pieces it will start to tangle if hair isnt combed and if you try to curl huge pieces, but my hair has never got stuck in here.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work too good to my hair and i waited 30-40 minutes before it get hot. I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and recommend it .</li>
            <li> First two curls came out great, then the third partition, it swallowed up by hair and just frizzed it up and left it all tangled. Returned it within a week of owning it.</li>
            <li> did not work correctly</li>
            <li> Too difficult to use.  Hair kept getting caught in it.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas, she is not as pleased with it as she imagined.</li>
            <li> Adult supervision DEFINITELY. ...</li>
            <li> did not work for me, i have a curly short hair, and thought this one is a safe and quick way to get nice curls, but it&#x27;s too big and wide for my hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a curling iron.  I have waist length hair, and if you don&#x27;t hold this perfectly perpendicular to your hair it jams.  And sometimes it HURTS to pull out the jam.  Total wast of my money.  Sounded like a good invention, but isn&#x27;t worth the frustration.</li>
            <li> This Curling tool is AMAZING, i can curl my hair in 20 minutes and I have a lotttt and LONG hair!, hairspray before using and your curls will last all night long!</li>
            <li> I went to have a 8 week hair cut. My hairdresser asked me what I did in the back and sides but not top of my hair. I told her that I had used this 3 times to put curl in my hair. She cut of 3 inches due to excessive damage and I had been using product correctly. It&#x27;s a shame cause it does work.</li>
            <li> Best 100 dollars I ever spent! I was nervous about using it because you see so many cheap products on the market but this was so easy to use the curls lasted all day and night and they came out perfectly!  And I didn&#x27;t even have any problems with my hair getting tangled or stuck in it. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it&#x27;s !!! Work great !!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS THING! I bought this for my girls for Christmas figuring I might get to use it too. Well they are terrified of it and I can&#x27;t stop using it! It makes perfect beautiful curls that last and last literally for days. I can curl it after washing and drying or even a day later.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hair is dry or the curls won&#x27;t stay. You can spray your hair with whatever and it still works great. Once you get over your initial &amp;#34;OMG this is going to eat my hair!&amp;#34; You will love it. Take your time, get a not too thick section of hair and make sure you are holding it straight on the hair which isn&#x27;t always easy to do as you look in the mirror but just a little bit of practice goes a long way. Honestly I don&#x27;t know what I did before this.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the first time I used it I went out and someone said Wow, I love your hair, you look 10 years younger!. I&#x27;m not kidding!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well and fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; my hair, has auto stop features, and works amazingly! I can&#x27;t use a curling iron, I&#x27;m just not that talented, and this is very easy!</li>
            <li> It is amazing!!! You gonna curl your hair easily!! My hair didn&#x27;t get stuck inside the machine once! I was afraid after some reviews but it is not that dangerous.</li>
            <li> Terrible! I gave it as a gift and it got caught in the girls hair.  I wish she returned it but someone had to break it to get her hair out.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I Purchased this From walmart last night (couldnt wait to use it so i didnt order it) and i got home and actually tried it on unwashed hair. worked perfectly. I took a shower let my hair air dry then the next morning used this again, Yes my Hair got tangled but came out effortlessly it didnt even pull all 8 times i got it stuck but i also wasnt brushing it before putting it in the curl secret. if you brush each strand before putting it in and watch the fly aways you will not get your hair stuck. I was very up in the air about shelling out 100.00 for this but it was the best 100.00 i ever spent! it took me 25 min max to curl my entire head (fine hair down to the middle of my back) I would reccomend this product as long as you READ THE DIRECTIONS please i was scared to death when i seen the reviews but im glad i didnt listen by far the best product i have EVER used. I would give it 10 stars if i could! I now have 10 friends who are purchasing this product after seeing a pic of my hair and i have had so many people tell me today my hair looks beautiful! Would Reccomend to anyone!</li>
            <li> i was a little weirded out by this when i got it and was sorta afraid to use it but turns out i absolutely love the curl secret, i am one who cannot curl my hair or anything at all really so this was super easy to do and really fast!</li>
            <li> Bought this for our teenage daughter. She uses it regularly and her hair comes out great. Nice product.Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Some ppl are lucky and have great hair: long, easy, straight. I&#x27;ve watched the videos. It looks easy. But my hair does&#x27;t work for this odd tool. You have little control, the curls are weird, it doesn&#x27;t go high enough to root, and worse of all my hair kept getting caught. No thanks. I&#x27;ll go back to tried-and-true curling irons or rollers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair very well even when its clean!!</li>
            <li> Ok, I have been going back and forth on this for months now. I&#x27;m the type who buys every type of hair tool imaginable, uses them for a couple weeks, typically with major frustration, then they land in a vast wasteland in the back of my closet never to be heard from again.    This here invention is greater than sliced bread. It&#x27;s even better than chunky peanut butter. Heck, I&#x27;ll go as far as to say it&#x27;s better than Reese&#x27;s peanut  butter cups (which for me is saying a lot).    I read every review. I searched YouTube for demo videos. I figured if I was going to plunk out another $100 for something that wasn&#x27;t going to work with my hard to curl hair type, I was at least going to know what I was getting into.  I have very long, very fine and extremely hard to hold a curl hair. But this handy dandy tool has changed all that. As long as you follow the instructions, you will not be dis-satisfied. [...]  this video is a pretty decent demo, it&#x27;s what made me change my mind.    Now, I bought mine at Target and part of me wishes I had waited a few weeks and saved $15 since now Amazon has lowered their price, but to me it&#x27;s all good. I had three more weeks of fabulous hair.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to learn how to use this new type of hair styler (reading the instructions, watching a couple of YouTube videos, reading though some Amazon reviews), but once I got it, bam! Gentle waves every day, just the look I was hoping for.  I can leave the house with loose curls, sprayed curls, or sleek brushed waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I gave this a try, and spent an hour or so learning how to use this - it is saving me so much time, AND giving me better results  than I I thought possible. A motorized styler - who&#x27;d&#x27;ve thought?</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. I&#x27;m sure she would recommend it to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does but this is why i give the 3 star review, i have long fine hair and i had minimal snags when using this but and i do mean but, this unit is heavy, to try and do the back of  your own hair while waiting for this to curl is a bit strenuous, and by strenuous I mean my arms were shaking and i only got the bottom half of my hair done.  I will stick with my hot curlers as these are much easier to use.  If they can manage to make a more user friendly lighter unit this would rock, but until then, if you purchase this, prepare for a killer arm workout. also have to mention you have to face this unit with one side always to your head (labeled on unit which side) which can be difficult when curling the back of your head.  Save your money and get a good quality hot curler set instead, trust me.</li>
            <li> I really like this tool. It does take a certain touch to use it correctly. The results are beautiful. Just as described. I look forward to getting better at it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> After seeing youtube videos I saw how easy it was... Make sure you use dry hair with no products in it... I get compliments on it and when I tell people it&#x27;s this product they are amazed.  Mind you I am not one to blow dry my hair I always let it dry naturally  Make sure you com through your hair well no knots! And use small pieces otherwise it will get jammed be patient</li>
            <li> My favorite curls come from this iron, only wish it took bigger areas of hair at one time. Takes a long time to curl an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it for but not for very long. She felt like it was going to tangle her hair every time she used it so she quit.</li>
            <li> To be completely HONEST, I couldn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because of a major hair catastrophe.  I&#x27;m now on my 2nd curl secret, but cannot blame anyone but myself.&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the curl secret so I could do my own hair for my bridal photos.  I excitedly, and hurriedly, read the instructions on how to use the product and began right away.&lt;br /&gt;See, the Curl Secret has this fancy &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; indicator that basically tells you &amp;#34;Hey idiot! You&#x27;ve got too much hair in there - take it out!!!&amp;#34;  What happens when you choose not to is your hair gets tangled. IN THE MACHINE.  And let me tell you this ... it gets tangled to the point where it takes one person to hold it, and the other person to go at it with a screwdriver.  Thus began the breakdown of Curl Secret #1.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily my hair is not over processed, and despite 15 minutes in a tangled machine, my hair survived.  But, I can only blame myself.  I urge you - DON&#x27;T try to stuff too much hair in the machine.  If the machine tells you it&#x27;s too much, it&#x27;s too much!&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I was happy enough with the product, despite the obvious user error, I bought a second one.&lt;br /&gt;It is FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to hold a curl .... until the Curl Secret.  I can have loose waves or tight curls, and they legitimately last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another Curl Secret in a heartbeat .... but hopefully I don&#x27;t have to because of another &amp;#34;user error.&amp;#34;  If this issue could be eliminated, I&#x27;d gladly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mom for Christmas, and her hair used to be naturally super curly but now has straightened out to a wave. It really is super cool and it&#x27;s great, and well designed, but the only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5th star is that sometimes the curls fall out a bit, and it does take a bit long. The product itself, however, is great, and very adjustable to what you want. Oh! And if you get your hair caught, 96.8% of the time, it is really easy to get out. Don&#x27;t be scared away by that, as long as just don&#x27;t just let it linger in the chamber, it is totally fine. The times you do, it is normally just a couple hair stuck in, so just pull it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Could not be happier with this purchase. So much easier than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It doesnt curl like a babyliss, is more for a Gisele Bundchen hair looking</li>
            <li> This does not work like they say if does. It was a total waste of my money. The curls are nothing like what you see on the advertisement.</li>
            <li> While the concept &amp; design of this curler is incredible, its actual performance varies dramatically on different hair types.  We tried it on three different people &amp; on two people it did not curl at all.  On the third (mine) it curled VERY WELL, but the biggest disappointment about this product is that in order to get a good curl you have to insert a tiny amount of hair &amp; it would easily take an hour to curl all of my fine but thick hair.  So, the first &amp; last time I used it, I curled only the surface locks.  I am hoping for a v2 that will accommodate more hair - a quantity more similar to what a curling iron or electric hairsetter would accommodate.  Unfortunately, I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Wow I  love it the best curler I ever purchased. I don&#x27;t even regret paying that much ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had stick straight hair since birth. Impossible to curl with just about anything, excluding overnight foam curlers. But this curls my hair perfectly. All you need is a little time and a little patience, I get spiral curls every time! Don&#x27;t worry when it jams (it will, trust me) just open it, untangle your hair and try again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product. I could never ever get perfect curls before, but this thing works magic!!!! so worth the money to me!!!! only downfall is it takes me for ever since I have such thick hair, but other then that this this is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Very fun takes some time to learn how to use it but once you get it it is fun to use with great results</li>
            <li> I used this about 3 times and it worked really good, except I had to wait for it to warm up again half way through doing my hair.  However, after using it the 4th time, all it does is make a clicking sound when plugged in, I have tried what I could and it still won&#x27;t work.  My children were really looking forward to using this for their dance performance and couldn&#x27;t because it stopped working.</li>
            <li> This replaced my curling rod and curling iron! I had a bachelorette party recently, where the girls made me demo this for the whole group! Everyone loves it! I have snagged my hair in it twice, and both times I panicked! The first time I inplugged it thinking it would stop it from burning, instead it kept my hair from being able to come out. Second time, I left it plugged in and just pulled on my hair until it came free. Neither time did it burn my hair!! And I still love it and continue to use it. Best hair accessory I have ever had!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good - takes patients</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase ive ever made it got here in 2 days I was very surprised at the great quality</li>
            <li> Does not work, could not return</li>
            <li> I know it seems like such a good idea, unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work with my hair what so ever. All it did was made it hot</li>
            <li> I have not figured out how to get it t curl the other way yet and it does take some time to learn how to do it.</li>
            <li> Junk. It takes forever to curl your hair (I have medium length hair) my hair kept getting stuck in it. And the curls just looked ridiculous</li>
            <li> The product does what is says it does, but is time consuming. It only allows small sections of hair to be done at one time, so you have to be patient. It has a little more weight than I expected so your arms can tire if you are not used to holding your arms up for periods of time.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a difficult time curling my hair, never quite getting to look the same way it does after leaving the salon.  This took care of that problem easily.  It&#x27;s quick to heat up, easy to use and so far seems durable.  It may seem like a lot to pay for a curling iron but as long as it lasts, very much worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter.  She loves it!  And the best part, she can do it by herself!  It is very easy to learn to use and works very well.  I would recommend this for any long haired girl.</li>
            <li> My wife simply loved and she is using too much.Since she saw on advertising she wished and the equipment ios excellent.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, but it seemed to tangle every strand. It was pulling my hair out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few days ago. I experimented with it a few times this week. I read the instructions thoroughly and even Googled online videos to see how to use this product. It worked great a few times and then it ATE MY HAIR! There was no release when it sucked my hair up into it. I pulled &amp; pulled and it would not budge. I immediately unplugged the unit and found my husband. He tried loosening some screws which did absolutely NOTHING! We were almost to the point of smashing the device with a hammer when I was able to hold the unit at a certain angle and then he was able to pry up on a piece with a screwdriver and I was able to get my hair out. Of course when I ran my hand over my now burnt hair huge clumps were left in my hand. I think they should have to install some sort of safety lever that you can press to open the unit where your hair is. This was quite painful and frightening. I am in my 30&#x27;s and cannot imagine giving this to anyone I know let alone a teen-aged daughter. When we called the 1-800-3-Conair number the customer service department seemed very flippant about our complaint and told us if we felt we needed to further vent our frustrations to send an email. This is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> I, like many others, read the reviews of this scary-looking contraption that promises beautiful curls and yes, I was scared. But the other positive reviews made me give it a shot and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the curls in my hair!  I&#x27;m completely competent with a curling iron, but it takes soooo long, when you have thick, long-ish hair like mine.  And this did it for me, on the first try, in 20 minutes!!  My co-workers raved about my hair and I&#x27;m already hooked, on day two of using this product, as I write this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your hair can and will get stuck, but it is very easy to get out.  Open and close (not all the way close, just quick movements of the handle) the handle of the device until it losens the hair. It&#x27;s really that simple. No need to break the device or call 911.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And watch YouTube videos, if you&#x27;re skeptical. You&#x27;ll see how easy it is to do. If you like curls of any kind, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It curls your hair as it claims. But my hair did get sucked into it even after following the instructions. Literally had to cut it out with scissors. And it does take time to curl all your hair, would say about 30 mins for shoulder length hair. If you have the time and patience then go for it. It&#x27;s not for busy bees..</li>
            <li> It was horrible my hair got stuck in it the first time I tried using it! I would not recommend buying this not worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I&#x27;ve been wanting one for a long time but couldn&#x27;t see spending $100 at the store. Great price and great product. Curl normally falls out of my hair pretty quick but with this my curl was still there the next day. It&#x27;s easy and even if the hair does get stuck it&#x27;s easy to get out. And it&#x27;s pretty much idiot proof. If you put too much hair in it it won&#x27;t work, if there&#x27;s a knot in the hair it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It does not work!! :(</li>
            <li> Loved it! Did not beautiful curls and pinned my hair in the machine. The device warns and stops when there is a problem with the amount of hair being sucked. Loved it, it was my best purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought two of them, seems really cool.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Delivered on time, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> Great and Easy to use!</li>
            <li> makes perfect curls every time!!  I had many compliments and ladies wanting to know what I used!</li>
            <li> it dose not work at all , I will be sending it back</li>
            <li> This product really curls my long straight hair, and the curls last.  It is laborious and time consuming to curl all my hair in very small segments, but the end result for an event is pretty amazing. As long as the segment of hair is small enough and smooth, I had no problem with it, but it just stopped working 2 days after the 90 day warranty was out of date.  I have only used it 4 times.</li>
            <li> i have straight hair. so i think after i read all the helpful reviews from amazon&#x27;s customers, i would like to try it. then i ended up, i have no idea how to use this curler correctly. from the video clips they have in the little windows, it looks so easy to use it. but when  i tried it myself almost an hour to make my hair curly, it&#x27;s so difficult. i believe it&#x27;s supposed to have the exactly certain portion of your hair before you snap it in the curler, so it will work great. this is what happened to my hair. sometimes the hair just went through the curler, it&#x27;s still straight. it&#x27;s stuck in the curler many times when i forgot by putting too much hair together in a big bunch, then the curler can&#x27;t work, it stops in the middle half way curling. it burns my hair a few times, after that i&#x27;m done. at least i did curl my hair, i mean it came out nice, and curly for 2 or 3 times. and yes, it looks very..very nice. but i think it&#x27;s better if you have somebody use this tool for you. i love the way it came out, but i can&#x27;t do it myself.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this. If you follow the inductions, it works perfectly and does not damage your hair. You have to make sure the barrel opening is always facing your head to avoid tangling. And make sure your hair is brushed and don&#x27;t overload the machine. My hair is very fine and is a frizzy mess unless I straighten it. Even starting with it frizzy but brushed, it curls my hair great. I&#x27;m not good at styling my own hair. This makes it stress free and flawless, so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom and she loved it. The idea is really nice and is exactly the way it is showed. She didn&#x27;t tried yet but looks good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the curl secret for over a year. While it does an excellent job of achieving a certain type of curl, it doesn&#x27;t  necessarily  replace a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&lt;br /&gt;-achieves a consist curl on both sides or your head&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use once you get the hang of it (great for anyone who struggles with using an iron)&lt;br /&gt;-the absolute best part of the this iron is that hair is heated on BOTH sides so curls LAST LONG! Sometimes days with minor touch ups!&lt;br /&gt;-multiple heat settings allows a variety of curl coil (tight or loose)&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for above the shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&lt;br /&gt;-really only makes one type of curl, either loose of tight depending on how long you hold it (vs. an iron where you can alternate direction, thickness etc)&lt;br /&gt;-takes waaaay longer than an iron because you can only curl VERY small sections of hair at a time&lt;br /&gt;-HEAVY! If you have a lot of hair be prepared for an arm workout!&lt;br /&gt;-tangles hair. No matter how many times I have curled my hair over the year, I ALWAYS tangle (at least one piece of) my hair.  Its probably because I&#x27;m frustrated by how long it takes so I take sections that are too wide into the machine.&lt;br /&gt;-tangles (getting hair stuck in machine) hurts a lot! Its one of those OW!!! \\&quot;Get this thing off my hair!\\&quot; moments. Its a mad rush to reverse and unplug before permanent damage happens.&lt;br /&gt;-the longer the hair, the more likely it tangles&lt;br /&gt;-price. You can get the same look with a curling iron for much less money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend the curl secret for anyone with above the shoulder length hair and/or anyone who has trouble using a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*see my curl secret photo for long hair in customer images</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical about this product. I tried it out and it curled my hair! I have very straight hair and it curled it, and I usually am never able to curl my hair. However after the first few tries, my hair got stuck, I tried everything to get it out, ended up having to get the strands out one at a time and when that didn&#x27;t work I had to cut some of my hair out! I was lucky and didn&#x27;t burn my hair but I did end up cutting it out, while silently crying at the time. I am sure this product works well for some but beware that you may find yourself doing exactly what I had to do.</li>
            <li> this is very hard to use. Hair gets caught then burns!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, and she is overjoyed with it.  It used to take her almost 2 hours to curl all of her hair, and now she can do it in about 30 minutes.  Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> my hair holds no curls. I have never been able to curl my hair. I swear this thing is magic. perfect curls every time that hold and stay in your hair perfectly. I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> works great. we love it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very frizzy, wavy hair, but I have to wear it back in a ponytail or straighten it every single day because I can&#x27;t let it air dry...it&#x27;s the biggest fro ever if I do. I can never get &amp;#34;nice,&amp;#34; defined curls to stay in my hair because it&#x27;s so thick and heavy. I just bought this curler from Rite Aid thinking I would probably be returning it in a day, but It&#x27;s great! I really, really love it. It does have a learning curve, but the learning curve is, like, one trial run long. You get the hang of it really quickly. I&#x27;m still messing with the settings to find out how to do looser curls, but the two times I&#x27;ve used it so far, I&#x27;ve been really happy with the results. Once your whole head is curled, you can leave the curls defined and spritz them with hairspray or  you can run your fingers through it to break up the curls, but that makes it a little messy and morning hair-ish. Still looks good though...just have decide which style fits your mood for the day.</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes the prettiest curls ever, always get so many compliments. Just be sure and FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!, if you try to jam to much hair in it, it can tangle, so patience and it will be gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  So does HER daughter.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hold curls in my hair, my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight, but it isn&#x27;t curly. I think with more practice and maybe product I will grow to love this!  UPDATE: I tried using my curl pro again this morning and was amazed! I don&#x27;t know what I did differently this time, but only had my hair get tangled once and the curls came out SO much better... I plan on curling my hair much more often. I have hair down to the middle of my back and it took me a little over 20 minutes to get it done.. Pretty pleased!!!</li>

            <li> exactly as I expected. since I only have one usable arm, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this curler!  It is absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used yet!  It&#x27;s not nearly as hard as it may appear.  Seriously this is worth the effort!  Curls last forever and they are so stinkin&#x27; cute!!  Big Bang for the buck!  Buy it on A,axon for best price!  Molly in Oregon</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it my hair got all tangle  up.</li>
            <li> wife is happy so I am happy</li>
            <li> Very quick and easy way to make curly hair.</li>
            <li> I truly love it and it curls my hair very nicely.  What I love the most is that the curls hold up to 3 days and they look nicer as the days go by.  A must get item</li>
            <li> I am usually a low maintenance kinda girl, so I hate spending a lot of time getting ready, but I do like looking good. I decided to research videos on this product, and over all they were very positive. So, I thought: &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll try it!&amp;#34;. It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth the money. It make beautiful curls or waves without spending a ton of time. There is a bit of a learning curve when using it, but once you get it down your great. I definitely recommend the Infiniti Pro by Conair Curl Secret.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. Doesn&#x27;t curl the way it states ! Too big and bulky to use easily. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and creates curls that last until my hair is washed. My hair is naturally somewhere between straight and frizzy. If I don&#x27;t blow it out, it looks like a didn&#x27;t comb it and slept on it wrong, but it is neither wavy or curly. I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair forever and love beachy waves and curls, but can&#x27;t seem to get me hair to hold a curl with a curling iron. This thing works great. I can&#x27;t complain about a thing. I ordered on ulta with a 20% off promo code -- bonus! It was worth the $79.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It&#x27;s awesome. It looks great. Easy to do. Doesn&#x27;t take 5 minutes like the video tends to imply, but when you want to take the time to make the extra effort to look amazing, this certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife in December as a holiday gift and she is in love with how well it does her hair. Proud to  recommend it to anybody since it made my wife so happy.</li>
            <li> I am sending this back. Doesn&#x27;t work on my staight shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t even get hot!! Returning and getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with it. It can tangle your hair. It is also kind of scary when it sucks your hair into it.</li>
            <li> Love it! A salon finish!</li>
            <li> little heavier than I thought. I have rotator cuff issues so hard to hold it up sometimes.</li>
            <li> Gave to my daughters law for a gift. It was difficult to use and quit rolling up the hair. Returned.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that is kinda frizzy unless straightened with a straightener (wow that was a lot of the same word) and medium thickness. This curler worked on my hair. I had curls all night that didn&#x27;t fall out. I will say that I did get my hair stuck in the curler twice (probably due to my error) and freaked out and yanked it out thinking it was going to catch on fire. It was difficult to get out and I panicked a little but I think the heat turns off when it senses a problem because my hair never burned or smelled of burning or saw any steam coming out. I love this product though because I FINALLY can have curls that I have wanted for 24 years! I just hope the product lasts a long time. It is pretty pricey but I don&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> The process required to curl hair is not what you see on the commercials. The commercial implies that the hair curls as it is pulled through the device. Not so, each section of hair you curl has to be held inside the device for 8 to 12 seconds (depending on how tight of a curl you want. Thus, it takes a long time to curl a full head of hair. While it did a nice job with the curl, it did jam on me a few times - which also slowed things down. It can be fussy regarding orientation. If it isn&#x27;t held exactly perpendicular then jamming is possible. For the money, I am not sure it is worth it for someone like me with thick hair. A traditional curling iron (which cost a lot less) takes about the same amount of time with less &amp;#34;mechanical&amp;#34; issues.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to use and yes you hair does get stuck now and then but don&#x27;t panic it&#x27;s easy to get out. Curls stay the whole night.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!! Natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to return this product, because it was smelling burned above normal when it was turned on. I was ucomfortable to use it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described. Fantastic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Nice curls. Once you get the hang of it to work, it is very simple..</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!!! Great seller!!!!</li>
            <li> Really good product! A++</li>
            <li> Horrible doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> I have super straight Asian hair and have had trouble keeping a curl for longer than 10minutes, haha. I bought this to try it out, and I&#x27;m super happy with how easy it is to use. My hair is down to a little above my shoulders (I have fine hair, and a LOT of it), and even though the back hair is only a few inches long, it can still create a nice wavy look to match the longer curls in the front and sides. It gives me that pin-up model style and I love it. My hair HAS gotten trapped a few times, usually I can get it out within the minute but it can and will damage your hair, so make sure you follow the pictures on how to position the curler, and don&#x27;t overload it with hair (small sections of a time only). It takes me about 20-30 minutes to completely curl all my hair, and that&#x27;s me being semi-cautious but also semi-impatient. Use hair clips to section off hair and start with the under hairs first.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as well as advertised</li>
            <li> Purchased this on a recent trip to Canada as it was much cheaper than the Babyliss version available in Europe, and I didn&#x27;t want to splash out on that without knowing it worked.&lt;br /&gt;Have now used this twice and have been impressed with the results. I have VERY thick hair, shoulder length, and usually use a curling iron, also bought from N.America. I would say this gives a looser curl than the iron, as with the iron you can heat the hair for longer if you wish. I also found it a little tricky to do the right side of my head, remembering to keep the correct side of the curler close to the head, and did get an achy arm after a while - but that&#x27;s the same for the iron.&lt;br /&gt;I like the pro curler as it is generally easier to use than the curling iron and, for me, the curls held a long time. I used it first the day before catching a long overnight flight and my hair still looked good after arriving and then after a cat nap! It seems to prefer width to depth, i.e. divide hair into layers which do not go too far down the head. I found this could be avoided by not starting too close to the scalp. Also no burnt fingers with the pro curler!&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my circling iron as it does wonderfully tight curls, with staying power, but for ease of use, will use this first I think. Hope that helps someone!</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use. Avoid using big sections of hair to prevent tangling. Good seller, good overall experience.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest tool I have ever used on my hair! I watched the ads for a while before ordering one...waiting...thinking...no way could it be that easy. HA! It really is! I was shocked at the simplicity of this tool. I am really all thumbs when it comes to styling my hair...really bad at it....but this just made me go from eh stylist...to WOW! Follow the directions the first time...and make sure to comb through each section before you put it in the tool and your hair will come out perfectly. Love, love, love this tool!</li>
            <li> Time consuming but works well.</li>
            <li> I love this curler! I have very thick, dry,fuzzy shoulder length hair. I tried all the settings and the best for me is the highest, which is 5 beeps. I wash it every other day to keep it from getting too dry.  I also have layered hair.  I find the curls look exactly like the infomercial, spiral and soft. It&#x27;s a curl I have not been able to get with a regular curling iron. On the top layers of my hair I do smaller pieces. But I get that beachy wave look I wanted. On the second day, it is not as curly, but still has tons of volume and I can fluff it with my fingers after brushing to get it just right.  If I try to get too much hair in it stops itself, but there is no tugging or pain.  Once or twice I&#x27;ve had a few years get pulled on, or snagged, but no more than I would have with a regular barrel iron.  It DOES take 20-25 minutes to do my hair but that&#x27;s fine. I just do some side steps so I can get my fitbit steps in for the day. Exercise and good looking hair. WIN-WIN!</li>
            <li> This really works!  And works well.  It holds curls better than standard curling iron and easy.  Yes sometimes you do have your hair get stuck ( but I find this only happens when I attempt to put to much hair in it) and if it does get stuck, you just simply back out.  I have not lost 1 single strand so far.  Worth the price!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!!JUST BE CAREFUL YOUR HAIR DOES&#x27;NT GET CAUGHT IN IT.....</li>
            <li> it is very hard to use. it almost ate my hair!</li>
            <li> I liked it, is very practical.</li>
            <li> Too heavy, very clumsy and NO CURLS!!!</li>
            <li> Is horrible! I returned this item because it fried my hair and would not release my hair from it I had to rip it out of my hair!</li>
            <li> Love , love, love!!!! Perfect curl everytime!!! Its quick and the curl lasts all day</li>
            <li> Not good at all on my shoulder length hair..would not recommended. Product was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This Conair Curl was much better than I expected.  It took a few tries to figure out how to position the head of the tool, but was pretty easy after a few tries. The only negative is I wish you could place more hair into the barrel to make bigger waves, but none the less I love how it makes my hair turn out. It even lasts through a night of sleeping.</li>
            <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
            <li> my wife love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she is crazy about the curlong process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she recommends.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair product! It works best with straight soft hair (well brushed) and it can be finicky when I try to curl too much hair at one time, but all in all I love the curl and though I don&#x27;t understand why, the curl stays all day long! Side note: I cannot put any hair product in my hair prior to curling. When I do, it does not work as well.</li>
            <li> Been wanting this for a very long time!&lt;br /&gt;My hair got caught a few times but overall I love this product! Glad I got and gave me long lasting curls without using hair spray! 😊</li>
            <li> No, I don&#x27;t like it my curls only lasted a few hours.  I had to use my wond to recurl my hair. So I will be getting a return label to send back!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and it still got caught in the machine. It is easy to use and nice to not have to worry about burning yourself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy to get started this was!  I watched 1 you tube video and then went to town!  It is so easy and fast!  I highly recommend this curler!</li>
            <li> My hair is about medium length (middle of my back) and this did nothing to curl it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curler.  I have ALWAYS struggled with normal curlers and never had the patience to curl my hair.  This tool is so easy to use and I love the three settings that it has. I have very thin, shoulder-length hair and I love how it curls.  I guess it feels heavier than other tools, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It definitely takes some getting used to, especially on the right side of my head, but it&#x27;s great! I actually don&#x27;t feel frustrated when using Curl Secret, which is the most important thing for me.  I&#x27;ve also used it on some girlfriend&#x27;s and it does SUCH a beautiful job.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Only buy this if you have tons of patience, time, and don&#x27;t mind getting hot and tired from trying to curl your hair! Be prepared to spend a long, hot time trying to curl your whole head. Also, good luck feeding more than a few hairs in at a time- if you put more than a few hairs in, it will beep, and stop working. I could not finish curling my whole head the few times I tried it. Then, the curls fell out soon afterward anyway. Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> This product is a Counterfeit!&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT buy!&lt;br /&gt;Verified by Conair.</li>
            <li> worth every penny !!!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and makes the most beautiful loose curls.  I always do my own hair when going to an affair.  Who needs a stylist!</li>
            <li> so easy to use and adjust with great results</li>
            <li> Great product and was just as good as advertised. Can&#x27;t  use with a  thick strand of hair.</li>
            <li> In love for this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in august 2014 and it is not working anymore. It is really disgusting to see the quality of this product. i tried to contact the seller but never receive a proper support.</li>
            <li> People complain way too much. That&#x27;s all Ima say about that.&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m horrible at doing my own hair, and I have thick black wavy hair that I permanently straightened. I just tried it and I did not get my hair stuck in there. There&#x27;s actually a wedge where I place my hair against and as long as I put a not-too-large section of my hair against it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems. And twist the section of hair lightly so it&#x27;s one neat section to feed into the curler. I&#x27;ve yet to explore the higher settings, but I opted for the lowest and ended up with neat looking loose waves. I like it! I also love the fact I simply can&#x27;t get burned. I guess that goes for all curlers like this? This is my first, I just love that fact though, after having to use straighteners before and burning my ear or hand. Anyway, it seems quite fast as well, whereas some Youtube videos showed other brands that you held for a long while. Also, if you think this is heavy, you need to work out. I don&#x27;t have the monetary luxury of trying out different curlers, and this was a gift to me, and it does what it needs to do, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Con: yes hair gets caught but if you keep it still and just practice it works verry well. Sometimes it makes a frizzy knot like bunch of hair at the root of a curl but it you work with proportions it lessons as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro. Supper quick and works on any type of hair! I love it and another thing...it don&#x27;t get hot or smoke. And it beeps when it&#x27;s done! :)</li>
            <li> My niece did not like it.  (She is 19 years old.)  She and a girlfriend tried to use it, and both were disappointed that it did not curl well.</li>
            <li> Worst Curling Tool EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my 10 year old daughter, she has really straight hair and rarely holds curls.. thought I would try something other than a traditional curling iron....  we read the instructions and followed them EXACTLY...  but first try it caught her hair in it and jammed into the motor.  It says it has a safety feature on it to release the hair if this ever happens- but it is just not true.. it just kept sucking it up and tangling it more while continuing to heat her hair.  I was nervous that I would have to cut her hair off....  I unplugged the curl secret immediately and basically had to rip her hair out.  We were both fortunate it didn&#x27;t end worse then it did.. but very traumatic for both of us.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair it does work. Very disappointed and going to still with old faithful curling iron.</li>
            <li> Perfect curls every time!!! There is a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, there&#x27;s nothing to it!</li>
            <li> This thing is cool!  However, you have to take the time to read the directions before use.  I have yet to get my hair caught but I have had trouble getting the curler to take my hair in the  back and  the back crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are awesome and last for a couple of days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stop working in ONE MONTH and I can&#x27;t return it now! I&#x27;ll never buy it from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It works just like the ads said. The item is impressive. I am purchasing a second one just to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Does not work for my thick hair, it can only take a few strands of my hair and If I continued to use this, it will take me forever to get my hair done! Another thing about this product is that it is heavy. It feels uncomfortable carrying a heavy curler on one hand, and two hands is inconvenient. Sorry, it does not work for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! She was scared that it would knot/ tangle her hair, and it doesn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> My wife has two new shoulders and this lets her curl her hair once again, when she counldn&#x27;t before and on her bad days i can even do it for her.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it!</li>
            <li> As advertised, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Broke after one week makes a loud noise and ate my daughters hair, took me forever to untangle it,  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Took it Ecuador as a gift, the lady I gave it to loved it.</li>
            <li> This thing actually works!!  decreased my hair prep time from over an hour to 25mins.  Great product, I&#x27;ll recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this item, I was very excited to receive it. I think the concept is great however, it DOES and WILL get stuck in your hair!&lt;br /&gt;Best thing to do is not panic and unplug it immediately (I learned this the hard way). My hair actually burned a little trying to free it, I had a burn smell for about 4 days!  Also, if you have long/thick hair this will not work well!!! I even cut my hair up to my shoulders to try to get this thing to work better for me before I returned it but it was not enough of a difference. I was very patient and found that if I wanted this to work it would literally take about 2 hours to curl all of my hair! I sent it back and was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work better for me. It really needs some kind of safety release switch for when your hair gets stuck! I went back to my good old fashioned curling iron.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the product. Tangled my hair several times shredding those strands.</li>
            <li> This is not for curly Or wavy hair.  Your hair gets stuck in it.  When I  got my hair released the curling iron broke.</li>
            <li> As the husband of the girl who received this as a Xmas gift I am very impressed with how amazing beautiful her hair is after using it. I know she says its a time consuming process, but when no other curling iron has held the curls in her hair we both love it</li>
            <li> First try tangled my hair and got stuck in barrel. I had to unplug it so it stopped burning my hair!</li>
            <li> did not hold a curl on my hair and you could only curl small strips of hair at a time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this item!  Easy to use and the results are stunning!  The curls stay in all day and are even there after sleeping on them!  My hair has NEVER held curls unless I used tons of hair spray and even then, they&#x27;d fall out.  My hair is midway down my back and still very easy to curl when I divide my head up into sections. The curls just stay there!  No spray or other hair products.  They&#x27;re so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can do this then YOU can do it!  Simple, easy and the results are fabulous! I love it and will never be without one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a photo so you can see what I did on my FIRST try!</li>
            <li> Amazing- easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Tips- keep upright. Use small section of hair. Watch youtube videos of how to first: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;W710j0mHqn0&lt;br /&gt;Then when I got it, I had no problems.</li>
            <li> This is really cool!! It makes perfect curls, and they last forever with no spray at all. I have used when my hair was short, above my shoulder, like a long bob, and it works too!! Its much easier and faster than a curling iron or a flat iron!</li>
            <li> Great! Love the curls. It&#x27;s hard to do the back on your own.</li>
            <li> this is easy to use and it really works! I have shoulder length hair and works with no fuss. As I used, I put less effort to carefully place hair and curls still came out nicely (about 90% of the time).</li>
            <li> Does not curl synthetic hair, just burns it.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad. I just wish it could take more hair in. If you put to much hair it gets stuck and you kinda have to pull hard. The middle part melted a little so I had to return it. I have a lot of hair so it didn&#x27;t work for me. But if you don It have a lot of hair it worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Whoever gets their hair caught in it and has to have the product taking apart by their husband with a screw driver as I read in one negative review is an idiot. This device which I just used did amazing curls. Even when my hair was about to be caught incorrectly because the strand was a little too thick, the product itself gives you an beeping alert and does NOT curl your hair therefore preventing your hair from tangling itself with the product.  Pleases read the instructions, reading the instructions goes along way on how to properly use this product and prevent any accidents involving your hair. READ!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve given this product 5 stars because I had curls done around my hair in less than 20 minutes and the idiot proof method the product itself has prevents your hair from being in tangled with beeps. Please DO NOT believe the negative comments and buy the product, you won&#x27;t regret. I never listen to negative comments and tried the product myself. Never believe what you read until you try it yourself. Happy curling............ :)</li>
            <li> This thing is Super Awesome and can&#x27;t believe the price I totally scored.. Don&#x27;t let other reviews scare you I think that&#x27;s just OPERATOR problems so so easy to use. 3 settings one for tight curls one for med curls and one for a looser curl.. You tube all the different styles you can create.. Love this product &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Really really loved this. It&#x27;s the easiest thing to use</li>
            <li> I have used the curling iron three times and it stuck in my hair all three times. I need to return it. My daughter used hers in my hair worked like a charm. This one is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> not easy to use , and the curls not so much , not like the curling iron result</li>
            <li> First thing first: I leave feedbacks very rare. This tool really deserves it. In a humid climate we still want to be beautiful. I find it difficult to do curls in a humid climate because by the time when you reach the last curl you feel exhausted and sweating. I prefer to straighten my hair but not with this tool. This tool made me look like a super model. The hair became so gorgeous that I want to go out right now and show it out. But I will do it tomorrow cause I am 100% sure that the curls will last by tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, you can make several styles with this curls not only 3 styles which are described by Conair: tight, medium and light curls. If you start at the middle of your head, you can get natural waves, like if you would be using a regular hair straightener. These curls are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;What about the negative feedbacks about tangling your hair? It does tangle the hair, I cannot deny it. BUT, IT DOES ONLY FOR THOSE LAZY PEOPLE(NO OFFENCE BUT YES, LAZY PEOPLE) who do not bother to follow the instructions as they are written. This is a machine. You do not drive a car when you are drunk or impaired for any other reason. Unless the car is driving by itself. What will happen if you drive the car being impaired? It will crash, right?&lt;br /&gt;What will happen if you put a wrinkled dollar into ATM machine? It will be returned to you... Right!&lt;br /&gt;Same here! The piece of hair must be no more than inch and correctly inserted inside. Remove all the fluffy hair around. What I mean by fluffy is that because this is just an engineered machine, it recognizes only straight and brushed hair inside as the correct one. All other fluffy hair, which will come on the way will be tangled and sometimes it is painful. I got that twice but I know it is my fault. I wanted to experiment and see what will happen if I do it wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, do not be lazy, if you want your hair to look gorgeous and last for two days, take a piece of hair no thicker than 1 inch and brush it well. Oh, well, it probably will take longer with brushing... But the results will be there.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I give it four stars for this tool?&lt;br /&gt;It must have a pouch, which will keep this tool inside and protect from falls. The door of the tool, which is on the top looks very delicate to me and hope it does not break. I am sure it will break when it falls down. So in order for me to prevent that, I will the tool with its head first inside the sock. It holds it tight. I think you should do the same when you are finished. I know it does sound ridiculous but at least until they manufacture a pouch for this tool.&lt;br /&gt;But it and enjoy it!ell. Oh, well, it probably will take longer with brushing...

            <li> It was exact what I was look for</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my long hair at all. Curls are sad and limp. Maybe better for someone with shorter, layered hair.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter, perfectly straight hair and a lot of patience, this curler might work for you.  Otherwise (for the vast majority of people) I recommend avoiding this curler completely.  After my hair got caught in the curler, there was no way to get it to release and it ended up pulling out several hairs.  I returned the Pro Curl and will go back to my &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; curler instead.</li>
            <li> What is the voltage for the product 120 or 220v</li>
            <li> Does not work on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to work and the vendor would not let me return it, because I used it, so it just sitting in the draw.</li>
            <li> It simply did not work, at all!</li>
            <li> My hair got stuck. And i know, people say to be patient a wait and be gentle. I even carefully read the instructions before i used this with my hair. It suddenly stopped working, and not making any beeps. My hair was stuck in there for at least twenty minutes, and it was really hot and burning my skin, and hair. I ended up having to cut it out, and now theres a piece of my hair missing. I suggest you just buy a wand, and do this stuff yourself! If your still tempted to get one, you can have mine for free, along with my scissors that i used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS and it&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Not easy for travelling because it is only 110V. Asia is 220V so you would need a transformer for this.&lt;br /&gt;Output-wise, it is OK but curls do not hold up much longer than i wish to probably because my hair is quite thick and naturally straight.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! is all I can say about this!! I have a really hard time getting my hair to take curl (thin, stick straight, lifeless) I decided to try this as one last chance for curls!! It was so easy to use, &amp; the curls held wonderfully!!! As someone else mentioned if you follow the directions it works wonderfully. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I loved this product used it alot but after getting my hair trapped in it and it burned my scalp and hair I called customer service and they could only recommend I call 911 after an hour of trying to dismantle it we had to break it apart very tramatic and a $100.00 loss</li>
            <li> I am hair impaired. I can barely use my flat iron. Curling iron?  Forget it. So I was skeptical. But I figured, hey, why not? I can always send it back when I hate it. Guess what? I love this thing. I literally did my hair in my office bathroom in 15 minutes. It looks amazing. And if I can figure out how to use this, anyone can.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair.  Hairdressers always tell me they have  never seen such thick hair, and it It&#x27;s dry, somewhat frizzy and can be bushy.  This worked great on it and the curls hold for a long time.  It does take a long time for me to use this because of the amount of hair I have but I only need a touch up over the next couple of days.</li>
            <li> The girls in the family all love this product</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how well this works.  The curls last - it is so worth the cost (which I was very hesitant about).  Don&#x27;t worry about your hair getting tangled.  It really will not keep going if it is tangled.  It&#x27;s just a great tool!  I rarely even leave reviews, but this works!</li>
            <li> Did not like this.  Hair got caught in it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Works great and hold curl all day.</li>
            <li> Love this! I bought this as an xmas gift for my daughter. She loved it. I tried it out and now I want to buy one for myself. Very easy to use. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this machine, I&#x27;ve bought it at Amazon I tried it on my fine hair and it really gives you a beautiful shiny curl. You can do different types of curls too. I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Not too shabby! but takes abit of getting used to</li>
            <li> i did exactly as the instructions states to have clean hair,a thin piece of hair, and to comb it out. After following directions and demonstrating to my friend how it works,my hair got stuck and it burned 6&amp;#34; of my hair off and I have very thick healthy hair and luckily its 28&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t notice the gap. It has no type of safety feature for immediate cool down and it also falsely advertises that your guaranteed not to get tangled. I was super excited when my fiancé bought this for me and was let down after my hair got stuck. I think it would work better on short hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you,,,,, My 2 daughters really like them!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. it does not curl my hair which is a little past shoulders which also got kinda stuck in there, for $100 I want the best most tightest curl i can get... This is a lot of money for a less then mediocre curling iron. Returning it .</li>
            <li> i like it soo much!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She has long, fine, but very thick hair. The amount of hair you can put into this thing is a lot smaller than you would put in rollers, but the curls are beautiful with no weird bends or crimps. It&#x27;s easy to use on her long hair and the curl is consistent all the way to the end of her hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. So easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it I really liked it, it curled nicely. It&#x27;s top heavy though so don&#x27;t put it anywhere it can slip! I didn&#x27;t use it often because I tend to curl my hair when it&#x27;s not perfectly tangle free (it won&#x27;t work with hair that&#x27;s too thick, nappy, or tangled. Brush thoroughly each section). Then it got more touchy. I had to section my hair into smaller and smaller pieces, which defeated the look I was going for. If you want to spend at least twice as long and get at least four times as frustrated doing your hair, this is great for you! For me... I&#x27;ll stick with my $30 barrel curler.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this curling iron  definitely not worth the money</li>
            <li> Conair is the best iron curl product I have ever used. It is so easy to curl with it. But be alert every time you use it because you will definitely stick your hair in it.</li>
            <li> Works fantastically but make sure you have medium length to long hair. I have short hair and I can&#x27;t curl all the sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to use. But I really like the curls.  :)</li>
            <li> I love the soft curls that I can create with my curl pro.</li>
            <li> Easy , does what it&#x27;s purpose is.</li>
            <li> While this does take as long as regular curling iron..the curls are perfect everytime..with a regular curling iron I could never get both sides of my hair to come out the same but with this I don&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE this machine! I got it a few months ago....did my hair once and liked it but felt like it took so long I wouldn&#x27;t want to do it very often. Then I happened to read an article about putting your hair in a ponytail on your head and curling the ends of your hair. So, I tried it and now I have NO problem doing my hair every morning. Takes about 5 minutes to just curl the ends in the ponytail and then I let them down and I am ready to go. I would definitely suggest this to my friends.....I feel fancy with my hair curled everyday now. Everyone should feel fancy ;)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. There is a learning curve to using it, but the results are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> purchased for my daughter - she loves it - says it does the job with making curls</li>
            <li> Very nice curls, does what it says it does. Comb small pieces of hair, make sure no tangles, glides hair into the chamber and beeps when  the curl is ready and you release the handle and out comes a perfect curl. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I read and read reviews about this and stewed over whether I to buy it.  I finally caved thinking I would more than likely return it.  I saw a lot of reviews that said &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never been good at doing my hair . . . etc.&amp;#34; and was in the same boat.  Never have I been one to do my hair and when I would try and curl it with a curling iron it would never turn out.  I tried this and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I read the instructions and it&#x27;s incredibly simple.  Believe me, if I can do it, anyone can!  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So easy to use!! And even if you do get your hair suck (I do every now and again) it slides right out!</li>
            <li> Difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> difficult or 12 yr old to us</li>
            <li> My hair is so straight that by the time I&#x27;m done curling it with a traditional curling iron, it&#x27;s already flat again! But with this my hair comes out in perfect curls every time and actually stays all day, even through the night and my bed head. It&#x27;s my secret weapon for sure</li>
