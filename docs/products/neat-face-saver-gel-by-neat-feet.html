    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Is it perfect?</li>
            <li>On the hottest day my makeup will remain flawless if I put this on under it.</li>
            <li>very happy I purchased!!</li>
            <li>I totally love this product!!!.......</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - Neat Face Saver works great as a Deodorant.</li>
            <li>OK at best rest of the time.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price.</li>
            <li>This is a very worthwhile products to have for anyone who has hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li>So, the first day or two after using the Sweat-Block, &amp; the Face Saver every morning, tends to be my best days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I can still see beads of sweat on my face even before I leave the bathroom in warm weather.</li>
            <li>I work in retail, the store is kept on the warm side, that and</li>
            <li>A co-worker once compared it to condensation on a can or bottle after bringing it out of the refrigerator into a warm room lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>3B Face Saver has been helpful, but it&#x27;s far from perfect.</li>
            <li>The transaction was very smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is great and it really works I have tried loads</li>
            <li>Be sure you apply it throughout the places you know you sweat out of.</li>
            <li>I think it even makes my skin look a bit brighter and more youthful.</li>
            <li>And then I&#x27;d sweat more.</li>
            <li>WILL say that the combination of Sweat-Block &amp; Face Saver provides the most benefit.</li>
            <li>I have been waiting many years for my skin to become \\&quot;dry\\</li>
            <li>I look good all evening with this hot flames</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I&#x27;m buying one for my sister!!!</li>
            <li>The solid deodorant stayed on better than this watery gel, but when it got very warm, that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I wore the Neat 3B Face Saver Gel for my wedding weekend - July, hot, humid - and it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>Face Saver has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>it certainly does what it promises.....:)  </li>
            <li>/face.&lt;br /&gt;*I would not be able to use this more than 1nce daily without screwing up my complexion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I applied too much, which meant that when I applied makeup over the top it felt too tacky.  </li>
            <li>I did not touch up my makeup during my 10-hour working day, and was very pleased with how fresh it still looked by the time I got back home.  </li>
            <li>I will say that it goes on rather smoothly, &amp; dries quickly without much visible trace on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and long lasting--one application lasts me a whole day.</li>
            <li>but it was worth trying.</li>
            <li>Wash underams with Anti-bacterial (unscented) soap versus fun stuff like</li>
            <li>I just do a light application after my normal routine in the morning.</li>
            <li>now use Face Saver every time I want to wear make-up for more than a few hours - so every day for work, for sure.  </li>
            <li>what hot flashes a must buy ;)</li>
            <li>I got this because the dance floor is so crowded and hot</li>
            <li>My job requires me to be outside most of the time.</li>
            <li>Maybe ok for daily use, but not duing the summer in NY.</li>
            <li>I felt so much more natural and confident because I wasn&#x27;t constantly checking my upper lip or blotting my forehead.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply too much or else you&#x27;ll end up with streaks.</li>
            <li>Much of the time, I&#x27;d be talking to people I&#x27;d never met &amp; answering questions.</li>
            <li>For those that complain that it leaves a residue; you&#x27;re using too much.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any real issues with blocked/clogged pores or acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the 3B Facesaver 5 times now and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing to curb or stop my sweating.</li>
            <li>I live in the hot and humid south and no matter how well you apply makeup</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, this was embarrassing, as my job has me dealing with the public, and it was difficult to put my best foot forward.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I admit my expectations or hopes for this product may have been a bit high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with greasy/oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with facial sweating since my young teens, to the point that I pretty much gave up on wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>Pretty much using it as a makeup primer now - not getting any special help by using it, acts the same as any other makeup primer.</li>
            <li>So I got a new underarm deodorant and tried that.</li>
            <li>the fast pace of a busy, busy store gets my thermostat climbing.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the ingredients are exactly the same as my underarm deodorant.  </li>
            <li>when I know I&#x27;ll be hot in public!  </li>
            <li>You never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week now and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***A word of warning***&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is the body&#x27;s natural way of cooling itself through evaporation.</li>
            <li>So it didn&#x27;t matter how professional I was, or how much I knew, if I was a hot, sweaty mess &amp; looked like I was about to die, it didn&#x27;t inspire confidence.</li>
            <li>I am a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman but instead of having dry skin, mine is very oily!</li>
            <li>In the summer, just a short time in the sun under even light exertion would cause a fountain of sweat from my forehead &amp; down my nose.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this facial antiperspirant ..</li>
            <li>I think it might be comedogenic if applied in a sufficient quantity, but it does even help reduce sweating even if just a small portion is applied lightly.</li>
            <li>Not much help when it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>My results may be atypical, it could very well work for someone in different conditions.</li>
            <li>Used as directed two days in a row under optimum conditions and it failed in a very short period of time each day.  </li>
            <li>When I do need to reapply, I&#x27;ll use a facial cleansing cloth (brand name omitted) to take the remaining old product off before reapplying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to report that the gel hasn&#x27;t worked effectively for me</li>
            <li>The hardest part is staying cool enough to let my face dry from the cleansing, without starting to sweat again, since Face Saver must be applied to dry</li>
            <li>First of all I may have a weird body chemistry because literally I have tried every deodorant under the sun and none of them work except for Certain Dri (which burns my flesh, causes hyper pigmentation and intense itching).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, social anxiety is no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mainly hoped to get some relief for my sweaty face in warmish weather - really not much help for that.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, once the sweating started, my self-consciousness &amp; anxiety about it only made it worse:</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try this or any other product to decrease facial sweating, just be aware of this potential consequence.</li>
            <li>I am a DEVOTED user of DermaDoctor Mede-Tate Facial Wipes which cost $48/30 day supply (these wipes are an extremely effective product that has allowed me to wear make-up again!) and use this product IN ADDITION to the expensive wipes to combat \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; along my hairline, on my upper lip, and chin.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re going to try this or any other product to decrease facial sweating, just be aware of this potential consequence.</li>
            <li> I am a DEVOTED user of DermaDoctor Mede-Tate Facial Wipes which cost $48/30 day supply (these wipes are an extremely effective product that has allowed me to wear make-up again!) and use this product IN ADDITION to the expensive wipes to combat \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; along my hairline, on my upper lip, and chin.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s where my expectations were a little high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started sweating in places I&#x27;ve never sweat before; my back (lower back especially, I can feel it trickle down occasionally), feet, legs, palms.</li>
            <li> No major</li>
            <li> If I had been going out in the evening I could have carefully blotted the T-zone area with a soft tissue and maybe brushed on a little powder, but I would not have had to remove the makeup and start from scratch again, as I have had to do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it more awkward to wipe my face or to just let it run?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I generally waited until the product dried and then rubbed away the powdery film, which is maybe why it didn&#x27;t work, but there&#x27;s no way I was going to go through my day with white powder on my face to stop sweating.</li>
            <li> Also, this gel lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried sitting in front of the fan for 10 min to let it dry.  </li>
            <li> These areas have been relatively dry since beginning to use this additional product.</li>
            <li> I put the gel on my forehead, let it dry</li>
            <li> so I waited until the Face Saver gel was completely dry before applying my foundation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay in my opinion, &amp; I&#x27;d much rather do that since they&#x27;re places that aren&#x27;t typically visible.</li>
            <li> It does not cause acne, and only requires a dab of additional moisturizer to combat the \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; effect typical of other facial antiperspirant products.</li>
            <li> If you squeeze it, too much comes out and if you&#x27;re like me you won&#x27;t want to waste it, so you end up with a thick layer on your face, which is what you definitely don&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I constantly sweat, literally dripping down my face sweat, but since I have started using neat feat face antiperspirant it has stopped!</li>
            <li> I only sweat on my face and scalp and was praying this product would work, but it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now you can proceed funk-free and with minimal underarm perpsiration.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a little freaky to not sweat at all), but I&#x27;ll definitely use it up for outdoor events like other people&#x27;s wedding and days</li>
            <li> : Allow about half an hour for the gel to dry after you have applied Face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any residue as other&#x27;s have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I suffer from excessive facial perspiration (it pours off of my face which eliminated make-up from my routine, sweat drips from my nose, chin, lips and is embarrassing beyond words).</li>
            <li> With the amount I use, one tube can easily last for 4 months, if not more.</li>
            <li> Usually by 10:00, I need a second coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I was hoping for more, &amp; therefore slightly disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a sweaty guy in any area other than my face/head.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t sweat all these other places at once, mind you.</li>
            <li> I even had droplets of sweat forming &amp; running down my forearms at one point.</li>
            <li> Without it, the makeup would be a&amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; mess.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t squeeze the tube, just let a little bit ooze out.  </li>
            <li> I had a little bit of oiliness on the T-zone (forehead/nose/chin)</li>
            <li> Now to be fair, I knew my problem was bad, &amp; I was desperate for a solution.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> However, I tried it again the next day and this time, after washing my face and toning with witch-hazel, I applied quite a thin layer of</li>
            <li> /&gt;*However, a few dabs after cleansing, or before going out usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll work if you sweat in anxious situations.</li>
            <li> I do suffer from excessive perspiration or \\&quot;cranial-facial</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why; they know I&#x27;m sweating,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works, I can&#x27;t believe that it actually works. I&#x27;ve not had any residue as other&#x27;s have mentioned. Just use a dab under OR over makeup and it works well. Is it perfect? No but dang close!</li>
            <li> This product is great and it really works I have tried loads but this is fab I look good all evening with this hot flames what hot flashes a must buy ;)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more I feel I can say except that this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a difference between sweating caused by temperature vs. anxiety, but this was used to treat my temperature-induced sweating. Maybe it&#x27;ll work if you sweat in anxious situations. It also leaves a powdery residue on your face, which can be unsightly. I generally waited until the product dried and then rubbed away the powdery film, which is maybe why it didn&#x27;t work, but there&#x27;s no way I was going to go through my day with white powder on my face to stop sweating. I&#x27;m disappointed in the product and would not recommend it to treat excessive facial sweating.</li>
            <li> I think it might be comedogenic if applied in a sufficient quantity, but it does even help reduce sweating even if just a small portion is applied lightly.</li>
            <li> My face was sweating in 5 minutes!  I tried just using a thin layer, I tried a thicker layer.  I tried sitting in front of the fan for 10 min to let it dry.  This product didn&#x27;t work at all for me, no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> Works for about 3 hours in the places you apply it. Be sure you apply it throughout the places you know you sweat out of. Don&#x27;t apply too much or else you&#x27;ll end up with streaks.</li>
            <li> I got this because the dance floor is so crowded and hot and my makeup is gone in no time.  But this didn&#x27;t work at all.  I noticed that the ingredients are exactly the same as my underarm deodorant.  So I got a new underarm deodorant and tried that. The solid deodorant stayed on better than this watery gel, but when it got very warm, that didn&#x27;t work either. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this. Try regular deodorant as it has the same ingredients and lasts longer. This gel disappears in under 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Tried this product on numerous occasions and it did NOT reduce sweating on my face as compared to using nothing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Used as directed two days in a row under optimum conditions and it failed in a very short period of time each day.  Did NOT perform as advertised.  Will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Not much help when it&#x27;s hot. OK at best rest of the time. Mainly hoped to get some relief for my sweaty face in warmish weather - really not much help for that.  In fact, I can still see beads of sweat on my face even before I leave the bathroom in warm weather. A bit sticky feeling, even under makeup.  Pretty much using it as a makeup primer now - not getting any special help by using it, acts the same as any other makeup primer.</li>
            <li> The transaction was very smooth. I work in retail, the store is kept on the warm side, that and the fast pace of a busy, busy store gets my thermostat climbing.  I&#x27;m sorry to report that the gel hasn&#x27;t worked effectively for me but it was worth trying. My results may be atypical, it could very well work for someone in different conditions.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. On the hottest day my makeup will remain flawless if I put this on under it. Without it, the makeup would be a&amp;#34;muddy&amp;#34; mess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I suffer from excessive facial perspiration (it pours off of my face which eliminated make-up from my routine, sweat drips from my nose, chin, lips and is embarrassing beyond words). I am a DEVOTED user of DermaDoctor Mede-Tate Facial Wipes which cost $48/30 day supply (these wipes are an extremely effective product that has allowed me to wear make-up again!) and use this product IN ADDITION to the expensive wipes to combat \\&quot;trouble spots\\&quot; along my hairline, on my upper lip, and chin. These areas have been relatively dry since beginning to use this additional product. It does not cause acne, and only requires a dab of additional moisturizer to combat the \\&quot;flaky\\&quot; effect typical of other facial antiperspirant products. Also, this gel lasts for a long time. With the amount I use, one tube can easily last for 4 months, if not more. Good product, good price. I recommend it for anyone with similar symptom/condition.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product!!!.......it certainly does what it promises.....:)  I would highly recommend this facial antiperspirant ..very happy I purchased!!</li>
            <li> Review from a 22 y/o male&#x27;s perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Literally stops sweat on your Forehead/face.&lt;br /&gt;*I would not be able to use this more than 1nce daily without screwing up my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;*However, a few dabs after cleansing, or before going out usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> I wore the Neat 3B Face Saver Gel for my wedding weekend - July, hot, humid - and it was amazing.  It actually worked so well that the following day, it took a couple of rounds in the steam room at the spa to get my face to sweat again!  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day (it&#x27;s a little freaky to not sweat at all), but I&#x27;ll definitely use it up for outdoor events like other people&#x27;s wedding and days when I know I&#x27;ll be hot in public!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a week now and it has made a huge difference. I&#x27;ve had problems with facial sweating since my young teens, to the point that I pretty much gave up on wearing makeup. It would just start to melt off and get streaky so what was the point? Face Saver has made a huge difference. I&#x27;ve worn it while doing housework, attending a party, and while my in-laws were visiting. I felt so much more natural and confident because I wasn&#x27;t constantly checking my upper lip or blotting my forehead. I think it even makes my skin look a bit brighter and more youthful. This is a very worthwhile products to have for anyone who has hyperhidrosis. It&#x27;s very effective and long lasting--one application lasts me a whole day.This gets a thumbs-up from me!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I admit my expectations or hopes for this product may have been a bit high. I do suffer from excessive perspiration or \\&quot;cranial-facial hyperhydrosis\\&quot;. Mine is brought on by warmth or sudden increases in temperature. My job requires me to be outside most of the time. In the summer, just a short time in the sun under even light exertion would cause a fountain of sweat from my forehead &amp; down my nose. In the winter, after being outside in to cold, walking into even a climate controlled room (68-73*F) would cause the waterworks to start. A co-worker once compared it to condensation on a can or bottle after bringing it out of the refrigerator into a warm room lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this was embarrassing, as my job has me dealing with the public, and it was difficult to put my best foot forward. Much of the time, I&#x27;d be talking to people I&#x27;d never met &amp; answering questions. You never get a 2nd chance to make a first impression. So it didn&#x27;t matter how professional I was, or how much I knew, if I was a hot, sweaty mess &amp; looked like I was about to die, it didn&#x27;t inspire confidence. On top of that, once the sweating started, my self-consciousness &amp; anxiety about it only made it worse: \\&quot;am I sweating? Can they see me sweating? Is it more awkward to wipe my face or to just let it run?\\&quot;. And then I&#x27;d sweat more. I carry paper towels from the men&#x27;s room in my pocket CONSTANTLY. For whatever reason though, I hate wiping off my sweaty mug in front of people. I&#x27;m not sure why; they know I&#x27;m sweating, I know I&#x27;m sweating, why not just deal with it? I&#x27;m telling you, social anxiety is no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s where this product comes in. Now to be fair, I knew my problem was bad, &amp; I was desperate for a solution. So I also ordered Sweat-Block (which I&#x27;ll cover in a separate review). Didn&#x27;t want to pin all my hopes &amp; dreams to one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neat 3B Face Saver has been helpful, but it&#x27;s far from perfect. I will say that it goes on rather smoothly, &amp; dries quickly without much visible trace on the skin. For those that complain that it leaves a residue; you&#x27;re using too much. I just do a light application after my normal routine in the morning. I usually put it on before I walk out the door. It dries in the car &amp; by the time I get to work, I can put on moisturizer or sunblock. No major issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t last. Maybe that&#x27;s where my expectations were a little high. I take it with me to work &amp; usually have to apply it again AT LEAST once. Now, it says it lasts \\&quot;for hours\\&quot;. But that&#x27;s not real specific. I start work at 6:30am. Usually by 10:00, I need a second coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any real issues with blocked/clogged pores or acne. When I do need to reapply, I&#x27;ll use a facial cleansing cloth (brand name omitted) to take the remaining old product off before reapplying. Pretty simple. The hardest part is staying cool enough to let my face dry from the cleansing, without starting to sweat again, since Face Saver must be applied to dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL say that the combination of Sweat-Block &amp; Face Saver provides the most benefit. For those unfamiliar with Sweat-Block, it&#x27;s applied in the evening, before bed. But it&#x27;s not made to be used every day. So, the first day or two after using the Sweat-Block, &amp; the Face Saver every morning, tends to be my best days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this product lived up to it&#x27;s claims. I think I was hoping for more, &amp; therefore slightly disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I was looking for. But that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault. You can&#x27;t go buy apples &amp; then be upset when you get them home because they&#x27;re not oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***A word of warning***&lt;br /&gt;Sweating is the body&#x27;s natural way of cooling itself through evaporation. It&#x27;s a necessary evil, not just a hassle. I&#x27;ve never been a sweaty guy in any area other than my face/head. That changed when I started using these products. Preventing the sweat from coming out on yourface simply creates a dam; it&#x27;s still got to go SOMEWHERE. I&#x27;ve started sweating in places I&#x27;ve never sweat before; my back (lower back especially, I can feel it trickle down occasionally), feet, legs, palms. I even had droplets of sweat forming &amp; running down my forearms at one point. Now I don&#x27;t sweat all these other places at once, mind you. These are just the various locations it&#x27;s popped up at different times. It&#x27;s a small price to pay in my opinion, &amp; I&#x27;d much rather do that since they&#x27;re places that aren&#x27;t typically visible. If you&#x27;re going to try this or any other product to decrease facial sweating, just be aware of this potential consequence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3B Facesaver 5 times now and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing to curb or stop my sweating. I only sweat on my face and scalp and was praying this product would work, but it was a waste of money for me. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll find a product that works.</li>
            <li> First of all I may have a weird body chemistry because literally I have tried every deodorant under the sun and none of them work except for Certain Dri (which burns my flesh, causes hyper pigmentation and intense itching).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scented deodorants cause funk. So what&#x27;s a girl to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Invest in Magnesium (oil) Spray and use a night underams (as a deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;2. Use Neat Face Saver Gel in the mornings as regular daytime deodorant&lt;br /&gt;3. Wash underams with Anti-bacterial (unscented) soap versus fun stuff like Dove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you can proceed funk-free and with minimal underarm perpsiration. Until I read the reviews - it never occurred to me that this gel was actually supposed to be used facially. It looked serious, was unscented and I&#x27;d never tried it before - so I bought it. Anyway, while my facial skin is oily I wouldn&#x27;t use this product for that (not because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - Neat Face Saver works great as a Deodorant.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver! I constantly sweat, literally dripping down my face sweat, but since I have started using neat feat face antiperspirant it has stopped! I totally recommend this product. It does not feel heavy on your face, no break outs and pores never feel clogged! I love this product so much I&#x27;m buying one for my sister!!!</li>
            <li> Works to a degree. It was alright. Don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again. Maybe ok for daily use, but not duing the summer in NY.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot and humid south and no matter how well you apply makeup it will melt off once you perspire.  I put the gel on my forehead, let it dry and then put on my makeup.  You literally do not perspire wherever you put the gel.  It works!</li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; woman but instead of having dry skin, mine is very oily! I have been waiting many years for my skin to become \\&quot;dry\\&quot; but I&#x27;ve now decided that it&#x27;s not going to happen. I was fed up with makeup disappearing from my face during warmer weather, so when I saw Face Saver in my local pharmacy I was eager to try it.  The first time I used it I applied too much, which meant that when I applied makeup over the top it felt too tacky.  As this product is supposed to give your skin a matte look, I was disappointed.  However, I tried it again the next day and this time, after washing my face and toning with witch-hazel, I applied quite a thin layer of Face Saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP 1: Allow about half an hour for the gel to dry after you have applied Face Saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP 2:  Don&#x27;t squeeze the tube, just let a little bit ooze out.  If you squeeze it, too much comes out and if you&#x27;re like me you won&#x27;t want to waste it, so you end up with a thick layer on your face, which is what you definitely don&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a powder-based foundation rather than a liquid one (the powder product also absorbs grease) so I waited until the Face Saver gel was completely dry before applying my foundation.  I did not touch up my makeup during my 10-hour working day, and was very pleased with how fresh it still looked by the time I got back home.  I had a little bit of oiliness on the T-zone (forehead/nose/chin) but nothing like I was getting before using Face Saver. If I had been going out in the evening I could have carefully blotted the T-zone area with a soft tissue and maybe brushed on a little powder, but I would not have had to remove the makeup and start from scratch again, as I have had to do in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Face Saver every time I want to wear make-up for more than a few hours - so every day for work, for sure.  I highly recommend it for anyone with greasy/oily skin.</li>
