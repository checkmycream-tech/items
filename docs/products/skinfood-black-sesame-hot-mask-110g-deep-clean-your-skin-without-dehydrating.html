            <li>The heat was not as warm as i was expecting, but it  did get remotely warm.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and it wasn&#x27;t too strong or anything.</li>
            <li>This seems more like an exfoliant then a mask.</li>
            <li>Love this mask but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I love SkinFood</li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love my face after that</li>
            <li>I think this product is ok.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to try more.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the smell.</li>
            <li>This product is the reason as to why I&#x27;m searching for more Skinfood products online.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the after effects of using this mask quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess its self heating and your body temp make it more liquid.  </li>
            <li>Keep a tissue on hand to wipe your top lip off with.  </li>
            <li>Skin not at all dry, just wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li>And this one is awesome,  my face is left smooth and refreshed  after use.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this is available on Amazon,</li>
            <li>I love how it works, it makes my skin feel so smooth</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly like sesame oil to me (kind of earthy and peanut-buttery).</li>
            <li>This is a hot mask but it doesn&#x27;t get super warm like many heating masks.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>After reading all the rave reviews and seeing the attractive packaging and company philosophy, I purchased 5 masks without ever testing SkinFood products (rice, blk sesame, egg white and acai berry).</li>
            <li>Their products are the absolute best for facial care!  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother and softer than when I started and it leaves you with a very fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I love this product, smells kinda funny</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this scrub.</li>
            <li>This does warm up, it leaves your skin super soft and relaxed feeling!  </li>
            <li>I love this mask, works very well.</li>
            <li>This deep cleaning mask is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells so good, just like sesame</li>
            <li>But one more that i dont really like because i think it to oil when i apply.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and I&#x27;ve been able to start using this product before it said it would be delivered.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and it really does work!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is another great product from Skinfood.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the masque while it&#x27;s on, and my skin felt great afterwards, but I was not thrilled to see some of the ingredients included parabens.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because the heating aspect isn&#x27;t super noticeable.</li>
            <li>My very first Skinfood product.</li>
            <li>It might look strange but it does feel good when you massage into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I love trying new creams and facemasks, but this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>texture is nice, but make sure your face isn&#x27;t too damp or it will be a little runny when you massage it</li>
            <li>I saw more results from cheap drugstore buys (even if short lived) than these.</li>
            <li>Love how it works on my sensitive</li>
            <li>scent is a very strong toasty, earthy, nutty one; it is likely to dissapoint ladies looking for fresh or fruity scented masks.</li>
            <li>the amazon version heats up right away and dries faster.</li>
            <li>The mask itself has little scent, which is great for those of us with sensitive skin and it lightly exfoliated.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really heat up like I expected it to, but I loved the effect after I washed it off.</li>
            <li>the paste warms up quite a bit but leaves skin very soft and smooth would recommend this product</li>
            <li>The mask does warms up a little when you apply it, it is a good face scrub.</li>
            <li>, she loves them and says that her skin has improved over just the past couple weeks, she asked me to find more things she can benefit from so i will be purchasing more products from tony moly, mizon, and etude as well as skin food.</li>
            <li>It really does heat up!</li>
            <li>The sesame can be a little too rough, but otherwise really great product!</li>
            <li>and I end up with it feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It really is more of a gentle warming that as soon as you put it on it heats up to the same temperature as your skin.</li>
            <li>and I really like the sesame smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this brand!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and massaged it gently into my problem areas and my goodness</li>
            <li>Because i don&#x27;t  really like the smell of seasame</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t  really care of smell</li>
            <li>The heat from this mask feels very relaxing.</li>
            <li>have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>This is the second mask that I tried from the brand and it was so worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>If the results are this obvious after 1 treatment, I am so excited to continue using it.</li>
            <li>You will like it if you enjoy subtle and earthy scents and want something that will clean your skin without dehydrating and leave it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to really deep clean.</li>
            <li>if not I&#x27;d literally hunt it down to buy more.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like black sesame plus the smell is not that strong anyway.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any warming, but it makes my face feel SO soft.  </li>
            <li>Sesame seeds are really good for your skin, because they contain vital nutrients and essential fatty acids like omega 3.</li>
            <li>If feels a little warm for about a second</li>
            <li>Plus it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but omg did it leave my skin soft, clear, radiant and hydrated !!</li>
            <li>It gritty too so it gently exfoliates!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>usually i buy it straight from asia (huge hassle)</li>
            <li>The only thing that I really didnt like was it felt a bit greasy, maybe like vaseline.</li>
            <li>The skin feels so soft afterwards. .</li>
            <li>It feels soft and is not harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t live up to its claims, in fact, none of them did anything despite the different ingredients and textures.</li>
            <li>But it left my skin soft and some of my scars have shrunk!</li>
            <li>This mask does smell a little bit funny, but you do get used to it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie (obviously), and have used low to high end masks.</li>
            <li>I use this once and it weird look but feels amazing after words.</li>
            <li>fresh!&lt;br /&gt;And not dry!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a smell, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all, just kind of natural, nothing that will irritate someone with sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the slight scrubbiness and it feels like my skin really does absorb this stuff.  </li>

            <li> fresh!&lt;br /&gt;And not dry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a smell, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all, just kind of natural, nothing that will irritate someone with sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the slight scrubbiness and it feels like my skin really does absorb this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It visibly tightened my pores, however it the effect didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels the exact same with a thin layer of film after use.  </li>
            <li> I had a small little button (&#x3D;blemish, but button sounds nicer) forming on my cheek right next to my nose and wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that little sucker got lifted right out with the use of this mask.</li>
            <li> But as with any skincare product, try not to use it every single day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had given me one of these (along with other skin products from S. Korea)</li>
            <li> The product is a grayish color with little black sesame seeds floating in it.</li>
            <li> so i bought her a few products from mizon</li>
            <li> As a fan of black sesame, this product is my cup of tea!</li>
            <li> Honestly no difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> The small little bad but the result perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> So if you are expecting anything dramatic then it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Wondering if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I would not repurchase or recommend any of these.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dripping in my eyes, but it did melt onto my lip and this stuff tastes HORRIBLE!  </li>

            <li> Amaaaaaazing!&lt;br /&gt;I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Its the perfect mask i used ever!&lt;br /&gt;Really its make the skin fresh!&lt;br /&gt;And not dry! Deep cleaning!.. The small little bad but the result perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Nice experience</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom who is 53 with some wrinkles here and there (she looks great for her age) but she is selfconscious about her skin, so i explained to her that Korean beauty products are where she needs to start buying from instead of lancome or clinique and she doubted so i bought her a few products from mizon, she loves them and says that her skin has improved over just the past couple weeks, she asked me to find more things she can benefit from so i will be purchasing more products from tony moly, mizon, and etude as well as skin food. i recommend all these brands.</li>
            <li> It really does heat up! It is amazing and I really like the sesame smell. It gritty too so it gently exfoliates! I highly recommend this product and this brand! It is a great addition to any skincare routine! A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Skinfood is simply amazing. This is the second mask that I tried from the brand and it was so worth the purchase! I had a small little button (&#x3D;blemish, but button sounds nicer) forming on my cheek right next to my nose and wouldn&#x27;t you know it, that little sucker got lifted right out with the use of this mask. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; up per say but who cares when it works so well. Yay for Skinfood masks!</li>
            <li> I use this once and it weird look but feels amazing after words.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing. I combine it with Egg White Pore Mask and the next morning I see a difference on the acne in my face.</li>
            <li> The sesame can be a little too rough, but otherwise really great product!</li>
            <li> What can you not like about skinfood products? I love this mask, works very well. The heat was not as warm as i was expecting, but it  did get remotely warm. The only thing that I really didnt like was it felt a bit greasy, maybe like vaseline. It did wash off very nicely and did not leave my skin feeling oily at all. This seems more like an exfoliant then a mask. Otherwise, i truly like this product.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout, we&#x27;re talking cystic pimples all ovet</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really heat up like I expected it to, but I loved the effect after I washed it off. My skin felt so smooth. The mask itself has little scent, which is great for those of us with sensitive skin and it lightly exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Love this mask but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; at all. If feels a little warm for about a second and then it&#x27;s gone. Wish the warmth lasted longer! I like the smell though!</li>
            <li> As a fan of black sesame, this product is my cup of tea! It&#x27;s an excellent mask and I really enjoyed using it. The skin feels so soft afterwards. .</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a sample my sister in law brought home from South Korea. I love the feel of the masque while it&#x27;s on, and my skin felt great afterwards, but I was not thrilled to see some of the ingredients included parabens.</li>
            <li> I LOVE SKINFOOD!! Their products are the absolute best for facial care!  This mask provides a calming &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; and is great to use at the end of a stressful day</li>
            <li> does its job. the paste warms up quite a bit but leaves skin very soft and smooth would recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love SkinFood so I had to buy some when I moved back to the States. I am glad I found this one. I love that this mask gets warm on the face!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the sesame mask from skinfood for 1.5 year now. usually i buy it straight from asia (huge hassle) therefore when i saw it on amazon, i gave it a shot. IT FEELS REALLY DIFFERENT!  the amazon version heats up right away and dries faster. the texture and color is also off.  Wondering if it&#x27;s fake.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had given me one of these (along with other skin products from S. Korea) and I finally got around to using it. All I can say is WOW! I did not expect it to really deep clean. I followed the directions and massaged it gently into my problem areas and my goodness, my skin drank this stuff. I can see it working before I washed it off. It visibly tightened my pores, however it the effect didn&#x27;t last long. But it left my skin soft and some of my scars have shrunk! Shrunk! I am so glad this is available on Amazon, if not I&#x27;d literally hunt it down to buy more. If the results are this obvious after 1 treatment, I am so excited to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. After reading all the rave reviews and seeing the attractive packaging and company philosophy, I purchased 5 masks without ever testing SkinFood products (rice, blk sesame, egg white and acai berry). One by one, I was underwhelmed. The mask didn&#x27;t live up to its claims, in fact, none of them did anything despite the different ingredients and textures. I&#x27;m a product junkie (obviously), and have used low to high end masks. I saw more results from cheap drugstore buys (even if short lived) than these. My skin looks and feels the exact same with a thin layer of film after use.  Needless to say, I would not repurchase or recommend any of these.</li>
            <li> This is a hot mask but it doesn&#x27;t get super warm like many heating masks. It really is more of a gentle warming that as soon as you put it on it heats up to the same temperature as your skin. So if you are expecting anything dramatic then it isn&#x27;t for you. The smell is exactly like sesame oil to me (kind of earthy and peanut-buttery). I liked the smell and it wasn&#x27;t too strong or anything. The product is a grayish color with little black sesame seeds floating in it. It might look strange but it does feel good when you massage into the skin. I left mine on for 10 minutes and washed it off. My skin felt smoother and softer than when I started and it leaves you with a very fresh feeling. You will like it if you enjoy subtle and earthy scents and want something that will clean your skin without dehydrating and leave it soft and smooth. I took one star off because the heating aspect isn&#x27;t super noticeable. Other than that it is another great product from Skinfood.</li>
            <li> This deep cleaning mask is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells so good, just like sesame seeds.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice, but make sure your face isn&#x27;t too damp or it will be a little runny when you massage it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It exfoliates gently, and it has helped my blackheads along with cleaning out my pores (getting rid of sebum, dead skin cells, etc.), which has also lead to smaller pores. But as with any skincare product, try not to use it every single day. I use it 2-3 times a week at the maximum.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this scrub.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love how it works on my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a very strong toasty, earthy, nutty one; it is likely to dissapoint ladies looking for fresh or fruity scented masks. I love woody/nutty/herbal smells though; so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all!</li>
            <li> This mask is really awesome! I really love the warm sensation you feel when you put it on your face! It spreads easily and it really does work! My skin is clearer and softer after using this face mask! Sesame seeds are really good for your skin, because they contain vital nutrients and essential fatty acids like omega 3. Sesame seeds also have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties which are great for a variety of skin issues like acne and so on.. This mask does smell a little bit funny, but you do get used to it! A very nice mask! I would recommend this for sure!</li>
            <li> Great product.I love my face after that</li>
            <li> Honestly no difference for my skin. I used it 3 times. I dunno ... will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I think this product is ok. Because i don&#x27;t  really like the smell of seasame but if you don&#x27;t  really care of smell .it&#x27;s also a good product  too. But one more that i dont really like because i think it to oil when i apply.</li>
            <li> Ive always wanted to try skinfood  mask. And this one is awesome,  my face is left smooth and refreshed  after use. You get a generous amount  too! Cant wait to try more.</li>
            <li> My very first Skinfood product. I&#x27;m hooked! The heat from this mask feels very relaxing. I love the texture and the smell. This product is the reason as to why I&#x27;m searching for more Skinfood products online.</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells kinda funny but omg did it leave my skin soft, clear, radiant and hydrated !! Skin not at all dry, just wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> This does warm up, it leaves your skin super soft and relaxed feeling!  I enjoyed the after effects of using this mask quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to warn any future users of this product though, it kinda &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; while you have it on.  I guess its self heating and your body temp make it more liquid.  Keep a tissue on hand to wipe your top lip off with.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with dripping in my eyes, but it did melt onto my lip and this stuff tastes HORRIBLE!  It also has a lingering after taste, so just keep a tissue on hand to prevent the experience that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a smell, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all, just kind of natural, nothing that will irritate someone with sinus issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very acne prone skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts or irritation, very gentle and wonderfully moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and I&#x27;ve been able to start using this product before it said it would be delivered. I love how it works, it makes my skin feel so smooth and I end up with it feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I like the smell despite what everybody else says. It smells exactly like black sesame plus the smell is not that strong anyway. The mask does warms up a little when you apply it, it is a good face scrub. It feels soft and is not harsh on the skin. Plus it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I love trying new creams and facemasks, but this is one of my favorites.  I don&#x27;t really notice any warming, but it makes my face feel SO soft.  I like the slight scrubbiness and it feels like my skin really does absorb this stuff.  When I rinse it off, it&#x27;s just the sesame chunks left.</li>
            <li> Tingly cheeks!! It feels so nice!</li>
