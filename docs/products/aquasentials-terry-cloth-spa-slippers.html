            <li>If your foot is anywhere over a women&#x27;s size 5, ordering the largest size would be wise.</li>

            <li>They are cushy and comfortable and supportive.  </li>
            <li>I like it very comfortable</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s been wearing them a lot and says they are very comfortable, but they are already showing signs of wear around the edges.</li>
            <li>Bought two pairs as price was irresistible, may buy more.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and then some!!</li>
            <li>Easy return.</li>
            <li>Comfortable as well.</li>

            <li>Want to return, but cost of shipping isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

            <li>She uses it with the wrap around towel in the morning when getting ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>soft fabric&lt;</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a true spa/luxury type slipper this likely isn&#x27;t the one but shouldn&#x27;t be expected considering the price.</li>

            <li> I do watch my footing while going down the stairs for fear of &amp;#34;sliding off the side&amp;#34; of the slipper and tripping.</li>

            <li> Like walking in platform slippers; Too Narrow; Very uncomfortable to walk in</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed; product is poorly constructed. Uneven support, I wear size 7 and purchased a size 9. I threw it out because i was so frustrated trying to get it to form to my feet. Whoever constructed this has no understanding of dimensions on a human foot. This is something I would probably find at the dollar store- even then I can even find one that at least fit properly.</li>
            <li> I bought these to wear around in the summer and they are perfect! they are comfy and you can wear them outside</li>
            <li> Nice and great quality. Fits perfect.</li>
            <li> Really incredible bathroom flip flops. Excellent quality and fit. Bought two pairs as price was irresistible, may buy more. Comfortable as well.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for a few weeks , the foam became deshaped and foot is no longer level when walking.</li>
            <li> When I walk in them my foot slides off the sole.  I still wear them but not often.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t  care for the cloth slipper as you walk in them they slip to the side, that not just me saying but my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> Seems a little thick soled hard to walk on.</li>
            <li> I slip off them, to avoid I must make sure my feet are wet.Strange....&lt;br /&gt;I like the size and look except the falling off of them</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  I found my foot slipping off the slipper off the back of the slipper when I walked -- too dangerous for me.</li>
            <li> I like it very comfortable</li>
            <li> They are comfortable but run extremely small. If your foot is anywhere over a women&#x27;s size 5, ordering the largest size would be wise.</li>
            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very soft fabric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;The base is very narrow.  I got the S/M size (I wear a size 7 narrow women&#x27;s shoe), and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable walking around my house in these because the sole is so narrow that I felt like my feet were going over the edges.</li>
            <li> At least two sizes smaller than claimed on the product description. Size fits small children. Cheap looking.  Want to return, but cost of shipping isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>

            <li> Wife loved them, they keep her feet warm</li>
            <li> Ran small. Easy return.</li>
            <li> She loves it! At 5 Foot even the small fit her perfect.  She uses it with the wrap around towel in the morning when getting ready for the day.  If our son needs attention or has a need she can easily attend to it and then get back to getting ready.</li>
            <li> These seem well made but are very narrow. My foot is a medium width and is wider than the slipper.&lt;br /&gt;Weird. Back they go.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter&#x27;s 10th birthday sleepover spa party. The girls loved them as did the ladies from the spa company.  They are cushy and comfortable and supportive.  They have a rubber sole so they don&#x27;t slip.  Worth every penny and then some!! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Wife hated them wasted money. Too narrow and can&#x27;t walk without tripping over them. Now they sit in a closet. FOREVER! But they are soft and good quality material.</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife as part of a Christmas package. she&#x27;s been wearing them a lot and says they are very comfortable, but they are already showing signs of wear around the edges.</li>
