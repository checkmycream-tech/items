            <li>It&#x27;s amazing can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!!</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey, but you have to understand that if this is what you need to pay to look and feel your best, then it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and my goal was to be able to use non-white sheets and towels!</li>
            <li>I love the results!</li>
            <li>Great for sensetice skins and keeps your skin acne free.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>which for me, was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I had flawless, babydoll skin my whole life</li>
            <li>The liquefied benzoyl peroxide is what makes this so effective.</li>
            <li>I was kind of relieved that it was just acne, even though I have no clue why my skin decided to misbehave...</li>
            <li>so be cautious about that if you&#x27;re gonna wear a nice shirt over it to work.</li>
            <li>Friends compliment my skin and say my skin is really nice and ask what I&#x27;ve done to it.</li>
            <li>And the smell of the product is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is amazingly effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>SO worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s the best benzoyl peroxide I&#x27;ve tried so far (</li>
            <li>Very good for drying out pimples and doesn&#x27;t leave too much mark on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
            <li>but I kind of like feeling it work :)</li>
            <li>Always comes quickly and is good quality.</li>
            <li>She has very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m now able to enjoy some things with dairy because of Obagi!</li>
            <li>I also use Murad SPF 20 anti-aging moisturizer for acne prone skin as part of my regime which has also been a god send :-).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know to blame Obagi as it had been more than a month since I&#x27;d switched.</li>
            <li>After a month on the antibiotic, things were much better but still erupting.</li>
            <li>I bought more Proactiv, stopped the Obagi and everything the dermatologist had prescribed including oral antibiotics, and within a week or two, things were better.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Excellent zit zapping potential</li>
            <li>I feel like Cetaphil cleans my face better</li>
            <li>These are very great products and I recommend them to anyone who has acne, pimply facial skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that my skin did not get used to the products and stop working</li>
            <li>so I turned to Amazon to find a better price.  </li>
            <li>I love Obagi.</li>
            <li>Combined use with this and Daily Care Cream Cleanser &#x3D; Great Looking skin!!</li>
            <li>I have to buy more.</li>
            <li>I hope theres some more that I can buy.</li>
            <li>I compared this bottle to the bottle I bought from the doctors office, and the most noticeable difference was the way the lot number was printed.  </li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love everything Obaji.</li>
            <li>It works fast and works great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many)...</li>
            <li>I love this with a toner in the am and glytone products in the evening.  </li>
            <li>I hope and pray that Obagi does not change a thing. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I, like many others who review these types of products, have struggled with acne for over a decade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did take some time to figure out how to best work it into my routine, and this will be different for everyone.</li>
            <li>I carried the lotion in the pocket of my cargo pants one time and, even though the lid was on securely, it leaked everywhere!</li>
            <li>any rate, the word of advice is that if you&#x27;re like many acne-prone folks who haven&#x27;t found anything that works, give this line a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ingenious.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>i love it :)</li>
            <li>Much better than over the counter, drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>and remember, patience is a virtue &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My girls and I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you :]</li>
            <li>I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very convienent to purchase on Amazon, and a nice price too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how the products work individually, but these three products together were amazing!!</li>
            <li>This stuff has significantly cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and the quality is excellent</li>
            <li>Combine this with professional peels/ microdermabrasion and you&#x27;ll have beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Works the best than other brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about OBAGI!</li>
            <li>I originally found out about this Obagi Benzoyl Peroxide lotion from a medi-spa I used to go to for chemical peels, but started ordering them from Amazon because it&#x27;s sold at a better price.</li>
            <li>Too strong for me ... caused a burning sensation</li>
            <li>At this rate, I think I can look forward to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and beautiful skin in a few more weeks!  </li>
            <li>and I love it - exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this regime for about 4 months now and my skin is breakout free.</li>
            <li>Obagi&#x27;s Therapeutic Lotion is a great addition to your current skin cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the whole kit, I use Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel + Obagi Theraputic Lotion - THATS IT!!!  </li>
            <li>So, just to be sure that is wasn&#x27;t authentic, I bought a new bottle from my doctor (an authorized seller), and compared.  </li>
            <li>Use with the moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be golden !</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from a doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>It worked better than when I first used Proactiv 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li>i originally bought it from my facialist and was a bit thrown off with the 75 dollar price tag.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin feeling light, smooth, and fresh.</li>
            <li>scrub like Proactiv&#x27;s to clean the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews of this product online I decided to purchase it myself and use in conjunction with the &amp;#34;pore therapy&amp;#34; toner.</li>
            <li>If you want to burn your skin right away - go for it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found a new source for it!!  </li>
            <li>I started using it twice a day and noticed a huge difference after the first day!</li>
            <li>She had a full face of acne, and now she is completly cleared.</li>
            <li>but  is just very drying and sit on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried EVERYTHING for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I was at a laser hair removal appt at a dr&#x27;s office and saw a poster for Clenziderm and was so impressed by the before/after pictures that I wrote down the name to see how much Amazon sold the products for ($$ at the doctor&#x27;s office).</li>
            <li>It dries out any blemish and quickly.</li>
            <li>Be prepared, sometimes it burns when you apply it, but that quickly goes away and it has never caused me any problems.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had perfect skin but from August to December 2011, my ENTIRE face was covered in tiny, skin colored bumps.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and break out every now and then, but this has been instrumental in quickly clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaks so quickly that it&#x27;s visible.</li>
            <li>My facialist recommended this product for quick treatment of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>price seems high at about $40 a bottle, but one bottle lasts me about 1 year, or more,</li>
            <li>My previous order was from Amazon and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I was really put off by the price tag when I first bought it, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back for more!</li>
            <li>I do not wear concealer or foundation anymore and love that I can go out and face the world with my natural skin!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with the first use!</li>
            <li>I am going without makeup for the first time in 3-5 years!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>However, I found that the best way to use it if you have mild to moderate acne, is to use a gentle cleanser and toner ( I am currently using obagi C regimen) and then apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Have reordered this item a number of times and service is always fast and accurate.  </li>
            <li>and I knew my skin reacts much better to benzoyl peroxide (through years of experimental use).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure it will clear up.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>so it was worth it to me.</li>
            <li>without success for 2 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quite a strong lotion with a high percentage of peroxide, so I would not suggest this going all over your face every day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for mild acne!</li>
            <li>Right  </li>
            <li>Right away I noticed a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>, I wanted to write a review right away</li>
            <li>My main concern was the huge protruding cystic bumps.</li>
            <li>It took several months for all the dark sports to disappear, but I&#x27;ve received compliments on how great my skin looks!    </li>
            <li>I love this Obagi product, generally.</li>
            <li>I now have blemish-free skin most of the time, and when I do get a pimple, they clear much faster than before.</li>
            <li>If your skin is even more sensitive or it just hurts too much for you</li>
            <li>It may be a strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also had two large ones pop up by the side of my nose at two different times - they went away more quickly but were still a nuisance.</li>
            <li>Very, very drying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone with any type of acne issue!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many salicylic acid treatments (didn&#x27;t do anything but dry out my skin), benzoyl peroxide treatments (effective to maybe 50%, but my face was still full of deep-seated scars and active pustules), glycolic acid treatments (burned my skin), and others, both prescription and over-the-counter.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Just trying the product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time i&#x27;ve used this product</li>
            <li>and i really like it!</li>
            <li>I have never, ever found a product that worked to cure my acne, but Obaji delivered exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I bought the lotion from amazon once I saw that my face was really clearing up!</li>
            <li>but I really hope people try these products out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lines (including Proactive, Murad, DDF, Aveda including grocery store brands, etc and also used BenzaClin topical Rx)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone who has cystic acne it really works!</li>
            <li>The first week, it cleared up about 50% of my acne, I am in my 8th week now, and I cannot be happier.</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked as consistently as this.</li>
            <li>The salicylic acid smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s an awfully expensive perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered them as a set for the first time, and directions were included in the package.</li>
            <li>If you have moderate to severe acne, then this is the magic potion for you.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I first tried this right after using the obagi cleanser and toner and had to wash it offbecause it really</li>
            <li>Dries skin out but it cleared up even those little stubborn bumps that can mostly be seen in the sun/natural light.</li>
            <li>Love it, does not dry the skin like most other products out there.</li>
            <li>It also stings a bit when you first apply it--which I don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li>then tried it waiting until the toner was completely dry and it was better.  </li>
            <li>Obagi may have a bleaching effect on dark colored pillowcases but its worth it for better skin</li>
            <li>Since using this lotion, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne either stops in its tracks once this is applied, so they never become huge deep pimples, or they disappear after 3-4 days (compared to the 3-4 weeks it used to be).</li>
            <li>It even seems to have improved the whole texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I act fast</li>
            <li>I was literally spending so much money on concealer</li>
            <li>and I was told by the clinician that this would absolutely work to get rid of my acne which was brought on by hormonal issues after pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The product really works -- it&#x27;s the 5% benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it because it was so pricey, but I bought the cream cleanser and pore therapy from her.</li>
            <li>but nevertheless, I have never broken out from it.</li>
            <li>It really hurts SOMETIMES</li>
            <li>It was/is very affordable on Amazon</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone and oily.</li>
            <li>I tried everything including Rxs and blue light therapy, etc.</li>
            <li>However, it really did wonders.  </li>
            <li>My facialist explained that this product is capable of going straight through to the pores, while over the counter medications do not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the one thing that gently keeps my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>This one was yellower and had a much stronger odor.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>She recommended this stuff, and I think it has absolutely done the trick.</li>
            <li>bp is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Obagi.</li>
            <li>really* worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to review the whole line (cleanser, lotion, moisturizer), because I&#x27;m assuming anyone reading the reviews will be looking to purchase the whole</li>
            <li>or so leaked straight into my pocket.</li>
            <li>I tightened the cap and, testing again, gently tipped it onto its side.</li>
            <li>I have tried absolutely everything</li>
            <li>Works very well and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It took about 2 months to see very noticeable results, and my acne was severe and cystic.</li>
            <li>i really like obaji</li>
            <li>it shipped fast.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>Obagi really helped cleared my face...</li>
            <li>product started working for me straight away.</li>
            <li>This has been the only thing that&#x27;s been able to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is still clear!!!</li>
            <li>, other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used just are very drying and sit on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t help my acne much more than other products.</li>
            <li>After a week I cut it down to once a day as it did have some drying effect (but not terrible), and I added a light moisturizer back into my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>The transformation is unbelievable and I am so thankful to this company for creating such a great product.</li>
            <li>It is the first time that I buy an acne product ( and I have bought ALOT) that really clears a blemish before it comes out completely.  </li>
            <li>But I feel like I have a more &#x27;normal&#x27; amount of acne for someone my age, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 30 years my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>Within a month, my skin was pretty much clear.</li>
            <li>Now they are nearly completely erased, for the first time in 13 years.</li>
            <li>The first tube has lasted me nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li>This order, however, seems quite watered down as it is much more runny.</li>
            <li>I will admit this is true particularly for the toner (lotion) and definitely the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live with out!    </li>
            <li>It sting just a little, especially if you dont allow the toner to dry completely, but it is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I got more black heads with the Pore Cleanser even before the eruptions started.</li>
            <li>(i am getting the occasional break out now, which is why i am back to order some more).  </li>
            <li>If I am eating healthy and taking care of myself, I only experience an occasional pimple here and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and actually see a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>In a few days the bumps clear and my skin is nice again.</li>
            <li>So between leaving the cleanser on for several minutes and only using it once per day, my skin seems to love the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My face literally cleared up within a week, highly recommend this product to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who has tried everything for breakouts.</li>
            <li>Nothing else, including rx creams, cleared up my spontaneous adult acne(just constant small red pimples, mostly on chin and cheeks).</li>
            <li>I do recommend the entire line if you are trying to clear your skin for the first time, but after that, I have found that using only the therapeutic lotion works just fine.</li>
            <li>I dry my face with a clean paper towel each time as well.</li>
            <li>I really like OBAGI so far.</li>
            <li>It was kind of my last resort for a topical product for my clogged pores and hormonal cystic acne because I&#x27;m hesitant to use chemicals to treat any type of bodily issue.</li>
            <li>Since the face wash and the moisturizing lotion contained salicylic acid and my face was pretty much healed, I figured I only needed the therapeutic lotion.</li>
            <li>and I continued to get a few more - and prescribed Benzaclin and oral antibiotics.</li>
            <li>Along with the toner, this is the only thing that truely controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li>Like many others, using the Clenziderm line all the time dried my skin out (and I have super-oily skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my fifth round of this line (I use the cleaner and the toner in the morning, and the cleanser and this cream at night) and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I am a 24-year-old that has mild acne for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>This confirmed for me that it is NOT REAL!  </li>
            <li>After using proactive for years and not seeing any results, I finally decided to buy a more pricey product, and it&#x27;s been money well spent.  </li>
            <li>It really is the only product you need if you have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>This product is very strong and can dry out my skin if I use it everyday but the occasional dry skin is worth not having huge boils on my face.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone trying to clear their acne.</li>
            <li>but CLEAR!</li>
            <li>&quot; have started to clear up!    </li>
            <li>I have never found anything that an clear up all of my skin issues (blackheads, hormonal acne, whiteheads, under skin bumps) and this stuff HAS!</li>
            <li>These products far surpass Proactive!</li>
            <li>for the first time in years i was actually not embarrassed to leave the house without foundation.  </li>
            <li>I first switched the scrub and toner with the Obagi Pore Therapy and Daily Care Foaming Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Actually, I noticed a difference the FIRST day</li>
            <li>I get the occasionally breakout, one or two pimples, or three tiny bumps but way better than a face covered with tiny bumps!!</li>
            <li>It is the same formula as I get in my dr.&#x27;s office, and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>only honest complaint about the whole system is the packaging.</li>
            <li>I resigned to the idea that the problem would never go away on its own, that products wouldn&#x27;t help me, and that I would have to wait until I was rich enough to get expensive laser treatments to fix my skin.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this, or most likely any of the seller&#x27;s other obagi products.  </li>
            <li>Have you ever bought a jumbo bag of Cheetos only to realize that the bag was only 20% full?</li>
            <li>I have had acne my whole adult/teenage life and after being clear for years on other medications, thought I would be stuck with acne through my pregnancy as it was no longer safe to use those other medicines.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obagi is worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>This product helps with acne prone skin - been using it for over 5 years now, and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>While my skin has improved over the years it has never been clear.</li>
            <li>and I have to say my skin has not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li>My skin is still clear.</li>
            <li>Acne on my face and body is almost 100% clear.  </li>
            <li>It took about two week for really clear skin.</li>
            <li>I discovered this lotion while i started doing facials hoping to clear my face for my wedding.</li>
            <li>After spending 10+ years looking for something to clear my skin (I&#x27;ve tried it all from Proactiv to prescription stuff), this is my go-to product.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for 2 days so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now 30 years old.</li>
            <li>red, bumpy, oily, and no matter how much makeup i put on it...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have had acne since the age of 12 years old.</li>
            <li>Well I only used this one for a week, so can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness I guess.</li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and have had acne since puberty.</li>
            <li>I work and have 2 children, so I am always busy and not taking care of myself.</li>
            <li>After years of battling with acne and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is nearly as sensitive as it gets, but I just put up with it.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne my whole entire life</li>
            <li>This line works for my 19 yr old son and my husband.</li>
            <li>My skin was a little bit red when I started using it, and I would probably avoid it in dead winter when my skin is at its most dry and sensitive, but my sensitive skin quickly got used to it, and it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>When I got this, my skin was deeply disfigured by scars and had many large, red, deep, very visible active pustules, as well as smaller pimples.</li>
            <li>I seen an esthetician and she recommended the whole kit for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as part of your facial ritual to keep your skin your skin clear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but these products seriously changed my skin for the better</li>
            <li>and they said they could only look up lot numbers by doctor, and that if I bought it on amazon it is not authentic, or it could be authentic but used/expired.  </li>
            <li>Most of my down time was spent researching methods of treating acne.</li>
            <li>I finally went to a highly recommended esthetician who informed me that hundreds of her clients have gotten used to Proactiv and it no longer works.  </li>
            <li>The only cons are that the product does burn for about a minute when you put it on your face (but you know it&#x27;s working!), and it can cause dead skin flakes, but this is easily exfoliated off.     </li>
            <li>Even my parents wonder how my skin is so smooth and glowing, knowing that ive suffered many years with bad skin.</li>
            <li>I can only say that up to now, i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, just some irritation and constant itching which is unbearable for me personally, but no change in the mild acne that I have on my back.</li>
            <li>Every dermatologist I visited put me on antibiotics, either topical or oral, and my face would always get really irritated and red</li>
            <li>but I have been using this for about 2 years with awesome results and this bottle burned my face like crazy for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>are the only things I use to keep my face clear!</li>
            <li>whoops, I caused a broad underlying one to erupt.</li>
            <li>I think no other product out there could beat obagi.</li>
            <li>this is the only acne product that works on my old skin!  </li>
            <li>we have tried every over the counter acne solution out there with little success.  </li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, my skin was CLEAR!!!!!</li>
            <li>My scars have faded considerably, and to help with this I also got a Clarisonic Pro 4-Speed brush to help clear my skin of scars and keep it clear of dead skin (it helps skin renewal and I highly recommend that too).     </li>
            <li>Last year as I was getting ready for a big event, my dermatologist recommended I try the entire Obagi Clenziderm line.</li>
            <li>I have been to 5 dermatologists, have spent so much money on drugstore face washes and products.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my forehead completely and now I only get 1-3 breakouts on my cheeks every now then.</li>
            <li>female, in my 30s, my acne has worsened in my adult years.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re apparently supposed to push up on the bottom of the moisturizer bottle while pumping to get the lotion out.</li>
            <li>I use this along with a Shiseido cleanser and a light moisturizer and it slowly cleared my acne.</li>
            <li>Disappointing for a good and pricy product.</li>
            <li>If your fade starts getting super dry, use this lotion every other night instead of every night.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks it was like I had a whole new face.</li>
            <li>If I feel like there&#x27;s a pimple starting to take place, I use the lotion and the next day, my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>I am still facing dryness in patches from the products as expected but it is slowly getting better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you, I have tried everything out there to clear my acne and have been struggling with this horror for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>Now that I am simply maintaining my clear complexion (that I still stare at in the mirror in disbelief), I use an organic face wash, and only the therapeutic lotion, because I figured that step is what actually kills the acne bacteria.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and as long as I can remember</li>
            <li>Apparently the drug store brands are made of particles too big to get into your pores.</li>
            <li>First couple of days I used it everyday (once a day.)</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin anyway, and I use this twice a day with no adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>The first few times it definitely burned a bit</li>
            <li>I bought the starter set and was a little taken aback by the price (about $110.00 for three products) but decided to go for it since absolutely nothing else had worked.</li>

            <li> and my goal was to be able to use non-white sheets and towels!</li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I had flawless, babydoll skin my whole life</li>
            <li> The liquefied benzoyl peroxide is what makes this so effective.</li>
            <li> I was kind of relieved that it was just acne, even though I have no clue why my skin decided to misbehave...</li>
            <li> so be cautious about that if you&#x27;re gonna wear a nice shirt over it to work.</li>
            <li> Friends compliment my skin and say my skin is really nice and ask what I&#x27;ve done to it.</li>
            <li> And the smell of the product is nice.  </li>
            <li> This is amazingly effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> SO worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s the best benzoyl peroxide I&#x27;ve tried so far (</li>
            <li> Very good for drying out pimples and doesn&#x27;t leave too much mark on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed so far.</li>
            <li> but I kind of like feeling it work :)</li>
            <li> Always comes quickly and is good quality.</li>
            <li> She has very fair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m now able to enjoy some things with dairy because of Obagi!</li>
            <li> I also use Murad SPF 20 anti-aging moisturizer for acne prone skin as part of my regime which has also been a god send :-).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know to blame Obagi as it had been more than a month since I&#x27;d switched.</li>
            <li> After a month on the antibiotic, things were much better but still erupting.</li>
            <li> I bought more Proactiv, stopped the Obagi and everything the dermatologist had prescribed including oral antibiotics, and within a week or two, things were better.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Excellent zit zapping potential</li>
            <li> I feel like Cetaphil cleans my face better</li>
            <li> These are very great products and I recommend them to anyone who has acne, pimply facial skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that my skin did not get used to the products and stop working</li>
            <li> so I turned to Amazon to find a better price.  </li>
            <li> I love Obagi.</li>
            <li> Combined use with this and Daily Care Cream Cleanser &#x3D; Great Looking skin!!</li>
            <li> I have to buy more.</li>
            <li> I hope theres some more that I can buy.</li>
            <li> I compared this bottle to the bottle I bought from the doctors office, and the most noticeable difference was the way the lot number was printed.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love everything Obaji.</li>
            <li> It works fast and works great.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many)...</li>
            <li> I love this with a toner in the am and glytone products in the evening.  </li>
            <li> I hope and pray that Obagi does not change a thing. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I, like many others who review these types of products, have struggled with acne for over a decade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take some time to figure out how to best work it into my routine, and this will be different for everyone.</li>
            <li> I carried the lotion in the pocket of my cargo pants one time and, even though the lid was on securely, it leaked everywhere!</li>
            <li> any rate, the word of advice is that if you&#x27;re like many acne-prone folks who haven&#x27;t found anything that works, give this line a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ingenious.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> i love it :)</li>
            <li> Much better than over the counter, drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> and remember, patience is a virtue &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My girls and I love this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you :]</li>
            <li> I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very convienent to purchase on Amazon, and a nice price too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the products work individually, but these three products together were amazing!!</li>
            <li> This stuff has significantly cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and the quality is excellent</li>
            <li> Combine this with professional peels/ microdermabrasion and you&#x27;ll have beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Works the best than other brand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about OBAGI!</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this Obagi Benzoyl Peroxide lotion from a medi-spa I used to go to for chemical peels, but started ordering them from Amazon because it&#x27;s sold at a better price.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me ... caused a burning sensation</li>
            <li> At this rate, I think I can look forward to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and beautiful skin in a few more weeks!  </li>
            <li> and I love it - exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regime for about 4 months now and my skin is breakout free.</li>
            <li> Obagi&#x27;s Therapeutic Lotion is a great addition to your current skin cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the whole kit, I use Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel + Obagi Theraputic Lotion - THATS IT!!!  </li>
            <li> So, just to be sure that is wasn&#x27;t authentic, I bought a new bottle from my doctor (an authorized seller), and compared.  </li>
            <li> Use with the moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be golden !</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from a doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> It worked better than when I first used Proactiv 7 years ago.  </li>
            <li> i originally bought it from my facialist and was a bit thrown off with the 75 dollar price tag.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin feeling light, smooth, and fresh.</li>
            <li> scrub like Proactiv&#x27;s to clean the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews of this product online I decided to purchase it myself and use in conjunction with the &amp;#34;pore therapy&amp;#34; toner.</li>
            <li> If you want to burn your skin right away - go for it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have found a new source for it!!  </li>
            <li> I started using it twice a day and noticed a huge difference after the first day!</li>
            <li> She had a full face of acne, and now she is completly cleared.</li>
            <li> but  is just very drying and sit on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried EVERYTHING for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I was at a laser hair removal appt at a dr&#x27;s office and saw a poster for Clenziderm and was so impressed by the before/after pictures that I wrote down the name to see how much Amazon sold the products for ($$ at the doctor&#x27;s office).</li>
            <li> It dries out any blemish and quickly.</li>
            <li> Be prepared, sometimes it burns when you apply it, but that quickly goes away and it has never caused me any problems.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had perfect skin but from August to December 2011, my ENTIRE face was covered in tiny, skin colored bumps.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and break out every now and then, but this has been instrumental in quickly clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaks so quickly that it&#x27;s visible.</li>
            <li> My facialist recommended this product for quick treatment of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> price seems high at about $40 a bottle, but one bottle lasts me about 1 year, or more,</li>
            <li> My previous order was from Amazon and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I was really put off by the price tag when I first bought it, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back for more!</li>
            <li> I do not wear concealer or foundation anymore and love that I can go out and face the world with my natural skin!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with the first use!</li>
            <li> I am going without makeup for the first time in 3-5 years!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> However, I found that the best way to use it if you have mild to moderate acne, is to use a gentle cleanser and toner ( I am currently using obagi C regimen) and then apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Have reordered this item a number of times and service is always fast and accurate.  </li>
            <li> and I knew my skin reacts much better to benzoyl peroxide (through years of experimental use).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure it will clear up.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> so it was worth it to me.</li>
            <li> without success for 2 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a strong lotion with a high percentage of peroxide, so I would not suggest this going all over your face every day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for mild acne!</li>
            <li> Right  </li>
            <li> Right away I noticed a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> , I wanted to write a review right away</li>
            <li> My main concern was the huge protruding cystic bumps.</li>
            <li> It took several months for all the dark sports to disappear, but I&#x27;ve received compliments on how great my skin looks!    </li>
            <li> I love this Obagi product, generally.</li>
            <li> I now have blemish-free skin most of the time, and when I do get a pimple, they clear much faster than before.</li>
            <li> If your skin is even more sensitive or it just hurts too much for you</li>
            <li> It may be a strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also had two large ones pop up by the side of my nose at two different times - they went away more quickly but were still a nuisance.</li>
            <li> Very, very drying.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone with any type of acne issue!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many salicylic acid treatments (didn&#x27;t do anything but dry out my skin), benzoyl peroxide treatments (effective to maybe 50%, but my face was still full of deep-seated scars and active pustules), glycolic acid treatments (burned my skin), and others, both prescription and over-the-counter.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just trying the product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;ve used this product</li>
            <li> and i really like it!</li>
            <li> I have never, ever found a product that worked to cure my acne, but Obaji delivered exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion from amazon once I saw that my face was really clearing up!</li>
            <li> but I really hope people try these products out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and when I first started using it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lines (including Proactive, Murad, DDF, Aveda including grocery store brands, etc and also used BenzaClin topical Rx)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for someone who has cystic acne it really works!</li>
            <li> The first week, it cleared up about 50% of my acne, I am in my 8th week now, and I cannot be happier.</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked as consistently as this.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s an awfully expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered them as a set for the first time, and directions were included in the package.</li>
            <li> If you have moderate to severe acne, then this is the magic potion for you.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this right after using the obagi cleanser and toner and had to wash it offbecause it really</li>
            <li> Dries skin out but it cleared up even those little stubborn bumps that can mostly be seen in the sun/natural light.</li>
            <li> Love it, does not dry the skin like most other products out there.</li>
            <li> It also stings a bit when you first apply it--which I don&#x27;t really mind.  </li>
            <li> then tried it waiting until the toner was completely dry and it was better.  </li>
            <li> Obagi may have a bleaching effect on dark colored pillowcases but its worth it for better skin</li>
            <li> Since using this lotion, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne either stops in its tracks once this is applied, so they never become huge deep pimples, or they disappear after 3-4 days (compared to the 3-4 weeks it used to be).</li>
            <li> It even seems to have improved the whole texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I act fast</li>
            <li> I was literally spending so much money on concealer</li>
            <li> and I was told by the clinician that this would absolutely work to get rid of my acne which was brought on by hormonal issues after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product really works -- it&#x27;s the 5% benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it because it was so pricey, but I bought the cream cleanser and pore therapy from her.</li>
            <li> but nevertheless, I have never broken out from it.</li>
            <li> It really hurts SOMETIMES</li>
            <li> It was/is very affordable on Amazon</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone and oily.</li>
            <li> I tried everything including Rxs and blue light therapy, etc.</li>
            <li> However, it really did wonders.  </li>
            <li> My facialist explained that this product is capable of going straight through to the pores, while over the counter medications do not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one thing that gently keeps my acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> This one was yellower and had a much stronger odor.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> She recommended this stuff, and I think it has absolutely done the trick.</li>
            <li> bp is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Obagi.</li>
            <li> really* worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to review the whole line (cleanser, lotion, moisturizer), because I&#x27;m assuming anyone reading the reviews will be looking to purchase the whole</li>
            <li> or so leaked straight into my pocket.</li>
            <li> I tightened the cap and, testing again, gently tipped it onto its side.</li>
            <li> I have tried absolutely everything</li>
            <li> Works very well and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It took about 2 months to see very noticeable results, and my acne was severe and cystic.</li>
            <li> i really like obaji</li>
            <li> it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Obagi really helped cleared my face...</li>
            <li> product started working for me straight away.</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that&#x27;s been able to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is still clear!!!</li>
            <li> , other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used just are very drying and sit on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t help my acne much more than other products.</li>
            <li> After a week I cut it down to once a day as it did have some drying effect (but not terrible), and I added a light moisturizer back into my cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> The transformation is unbelievable and I am so thankful to this company for creating such a great product.</li>
            <li> It is the first time that I buy an acne product ( and I have bought ALOT) that really clears a blemish before it comes out completely.  </li>
            <li> But I feel like I have a more &#x27;normal&#x27; amount of acne for someone my age, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 30 years my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> Within a month, my skin was pretty much clear.</li>
            <li> Now they are nearly completely erased, for the first time in 13 years.</li>
            <li> The first tube has lasted me nearly 2 months.</li>
            <li> This order, however, seems quite watered down as it is much more runny.</li>
            <li> I will admit this is true particularly for the toner (lotion) and definitely the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live with out!    </li>
            <li> It sting just a little, especially if you dont allow the toner to dry completely, but it is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I got more black heads with the Pore Cleanser even before the eruptions started.</li>
            <li> (i am getting the occasional break out now, which is why i am back to order some more).  </li>
            <li> If I am eating healthy and taking care of myself, I only experience an occasional pimple here and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and actually see a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> In a few days the bumps clear and my skin is nice again.</li>
            <li> So between leaving the cleanser on for several minutes and only using it once per day, my skin seems to love the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My face literally cleared up within a week, highly recommend this product to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who has tried everything for breakouts.</li>
            <li> Nothing else, including rx creams, cleared up my spontaneous adult acne(just constant small red pimples, mostly on chin and cheeks).</li>
            <li> I do recommend the entire line if you are trying to clear your skin for the first time, but after that, I have found that using only the therapeutic lotion works just fine.</li>
            <li> I dry my face with a clean paper towel each time as well.</li>
            <li> I really like OBAGI so far.</li>
            <li> It was kind of my last resort for a topical product for my clogged pores and hormonal cystic acne because I&#x27;m hesitant to use chemicals to treat any type of bodily issue.</li>
            <li> Since the face wash and the moisturizing lotion contained salicylic acid and my face was pretty much healed, I figured I only needed the therapeutic lotion.</li>
            <li> and I continued to get a few more - and prescribed Benzaclin and oral antibiotics.</li>
            <li> Along with the toner, this is the only thing that truely controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li> Like many others, using the Clenziderm line all the time dried my skin out (and I have super-oily skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fifth round of this line (I use the cleaner and the toner in the morning, and the cleanser and this cream at night) and my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I am a 24-year-old that has mild acne for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> This confirmed for me that it is NOT REAL!  </li>
            <li> After using proactive for years and not seeing any results, I finally decided to buy a more pricey product, and it&#x27;s been money well spent.  </li>
            <li> It really is the only product you need if you have mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong and can dry out my skin if I use it everyday but the occasional dry skin is worth not having huge boils on my face.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone trying to clear their acne.</li>
            <li> but CLEAR!</li>
            <li> &quot; have started to clear up!    </li>
            <li> I have never found anything that an clear up all of my skin issues (blackheads, hormonal acne, whiteheads, under skin bumps) and this stuff HAS!</li>
            <li> These products far surpass Proactive!</li>
            <li> for the first time in years i was actually not embarrassed to leave the house without foundation.  </li>
            <li> I first switched the scrub and toner with the Obagi Pore Therapy and Daily Care Foaming Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Actually, I noticed a difference the FIRST day</li>
            <li> I get the occasionally breakout, one or two pimples, or three tiny bumps but way better than a face covered with tiny bumps!!</li>
            <li> It is the same formula as I get in my dr.&#x27;s office, and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> only honest complaint about the whole system is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I resigned to the idea that the problem would never go away on its own, that products wouldn&#x27;t help me, and that I would have to wait until I was rich enough to get expensive laser treatments to fix my skin.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this, or most likely any of the seller&#x27;s other obagi products.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever bought a jumbo bag of Cheetos only to realize that the bag was only 20% full?</li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole adult/teenage life and after being clear for years on other medications, thought I would be stuck with acne through my pregnancy as it was no longer safe to use those other medicines.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obagi is worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> This product helps with acne prone skin - been using it for over 5 years now, and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> While my skin has improved over the years it has never been clear.</li>
            <li> and I have to say my skin has not been this clear in years.</li>
            <li> My skin is still clear.</li>
            <li> Acne on my face and body is almost 100% clear.  </li>
            <li> It took about two week for really clear skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this lotion while i started doing facials hoping to clear my face for my wedding.</li>
            <li> After spending 10+ years looking for something to clear my skin (I&#x27;ve tried it all from Proactiv to prescription stuff), this is my go-to product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 2 days so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now 30 years old.</li>
            <li> red, bumpy, oily, and no matter how much makeup i put on it...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have had acne since the age of 12 years old.</li>
            <li> Well I only used this one for a week, so can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness I guess.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and have had acne since puberty.</li>
            <li> I work and have 2 children, so I am always busy and not taking care of myself.</li>
            <li> After years of battling with acne and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is nearly as sensitive as it gets, but I just put up with it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne my whole entire life</li>
            <li> This line works for my 19 yr old son and my husband.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little bit red when I started using it, and I would probably avoid it in dead winter when my skin is at its most dry and sensitive, but my sensitive skin quickly got used to it, and it was absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> When I got this, my skin was deeply disfigured by scars and had many large, red, deep, very visible active pustules, as well as smaller pimples.</li>
            <li> I seen an esthetician and she recommended the whole kit for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as part of your facial ritual to keep your skin your skin clear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but these products seriously changed my skin for the better</li>
            <li> and they said they could only look up lot numbers by doctor, and that if I bought it on amazon it is not authentic, or it could be authentic but used/expired.  </li>
            <li> Most of my down time was spent researching methods of treating acne.</li>
            <li> I finally went to a highly recommended esthetician who informed me that hundreds of her clients have gotten used to Proactiv and it no longer works.  </li>
            <li> The only cons are that the product does burn for about a minute when you put it on your face (but you know it&#x27;s working!), and it can cause dead skin flakes, but this is easily exfoliated off.     </li>
            <li> Even my parents wonder how my skin is so smooth and glowing, knowing that ive suffered many years with bad skin.</li>
            <li> I can only say that up to now, i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, just some irritation and constant itching which is unbearable for me personally, but no change in the mild acne that I have on my back.</li>
            <li> Every dermatologist I visited put me on antibiotics, either topical or oral, and my face would always get really irritated and red</li>
            <li> but I have been using this for about 2 years with awesome results and this bottle burned my face like crazy for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> are the only things I use to keep my face clear!</li>
            <li> whoops, I caused a broad underlying one to erupt.</li>
            <li> I think no other product out there could beat obagi.</li>
            <li> this is the only acne product that works on my old skin!  </li>
            <li> we have tried every over the counter acne solution out there with little success.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, my skin was CLEAR!!!!!</li>
            <li> My scars have faded considerably, and to help with this I also got a Clarisonic Pro 4-Speed brush to help clear my skin of scars and keep it clear of dead skin (it helps skin renewal and I highly recommend that too).     </li>
            <li> Last year as I was getting ready for a big event, my dermatologist recommended I try the entire Obagi Clenziderm line.</li>
            <li> I have been to 5 dermatologists, have spent so much money on drugstore face washes and products.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my forehead completely and now I only get 1-3 breakouts on my cheeks every now then.</li>
            <li> female, in my 30s, my acne has worsened in my adult years.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re apparently supposed to push up on the bottom of the moisturizer bottle while pumping to get the lotion out.</li>
            <li> I use this along with a Shiseido cleanser and a light moisturizer and it slowly cleared my acne.</li>
            <li> Disappointing for a good and pricy product.</li>
            <li> If your fade starts getting super dry, use this lotion every other night instead of every night.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it was like I had a whole new face.</li>
            <li> If I feel like there&#x27;s a pimple starting to take place, I use the lotion and the next day, my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I am still facing dryness in patches from the products as expected but it is slowly getting better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you, I have tried everything out there to clear my acne and have been struggling with this horror for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Now that I am simply maintaining my clear complexion (that I still stare at in the mirror in disbelief), I use an organic face wash, and only the therapeutic lotion, because I figured that step is what actually kills the acne bacteria.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> Apparently the drug store brands are made of particles too big to get into your pores.</li>
            <li> First couple of days I used it everyday (once a day.)</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin anyway, and I use this twice a day with no adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li> The first few times it definitely burned a bit</li>
            <li> I bought the starter set and was a little taken aback by the price (about $110.00 for three products) but decided to go for it since absolutely nothing else had worked.</li>
            <li> My young adult son has tried a half dozen prescriptions for blemish control, including Proactiv, and this surpasses them all!</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like Obagi&#x27;s other products as I think they are too harsh, but I love this lotion as a spot treatment for my acne and trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, it is totally gone and flat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are that the product does burn for about a minute when you put it on your face, and it can cause dead skin flakes</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend using Clinique&#x27;s dark sport corrector [...] ) !</li>
            <li> The only other thing I changed was that I wash my face with a 4x4 gauze pad and very gentle soap (the scrubs actually make small cuts for bacteria to enter I was told).</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> At this rate this bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to leave a more detailed review for others who have suffered from terrible acne!</li>
            <li> I am the typical 33 year old woman.</li>
            <li> it can dry out your skin if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> To my utter amazement, my skin began to clear up after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I tried going back to other over the counter products, but the acne immediately came back.  </li>
            <li> While expensive, the Clenziderm line is worth every penny (besides, a little bit really goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I found this product and was hopeful, but honestly not expecting much.     </li>
            <li> The pore therapy will be kinda tingly, more like a cold feeling.</li>
            <li> When I started to run out, I decided to only purchase the therapeutic lotion since my acne was minimal</li>
            <li> There are still some darkened spots - but minor - 2.5 months after I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I can remember I&#x27;ve always had some sort of breakout on my face.</li>
            <li> but everything I did would not clear it up.</li>
            <li> After endless research and reviews I finally found this product.</li>
            <li> I use several of their other products, and i like the texture and the fact that they are never greasy.</li>
            <li> I think I will continue to use it every other or every few days just to prevent new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for this to dry out the skin around any blemishes.</li>
            <li> Clogged pores or pimples often dry up before they break the skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but if you put on the medicated lotion before your skin is dry, it burns.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it did dry my skin out around my mouth/chin, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that lotion couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> I use the obaji moisturizer if I get too dry and that doesn&#x27;t break me out either.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a cetaphil bar (3$) and pat dry and then put this miracle cream on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a point in buying the cleanser and moisturizer as they are pretty mediocre and you can definitely find products cheaper to use in conjunction with the therapeutic lotion.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve previously always purchased my Clenziderm products individually.</li>
            <li> So I am not sure if it actually works since I can&#x27;t get over the smell to use it on a regular.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other acne products do.</li>
            <li> My acne has completely cleared up except for a few old, tough scars.</li>
            <li> free to try this system because it seems to work for the vast majority of people, but note that if bad things start happening, don&#x27;t blame your hormones and aging.</li>
            <li> Not much luck.</li>
            <li> I tried apple cider vinegar with minimal results.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews before I made the decision to try this product.</li>
            <li> Within a couple days I noticed my skin clearing up and within a few weeks my breakouts were totally cleared up.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last you a few months (and I put it all over my cheeks, forehead, and chin every night).</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed, so the product lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> It took over a month for things to go back to before I&#x27;d used Obagi except for a few dark skin spots.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Helps other acne but does not get rid of every single black &amp; whitehead: washing, hormones, etc.</li>
            <li> About 6 weeks after starting Obagi, my chin started developing several large, painful, cystic acne bumps - which I do have on occasion but only one at a time and usually go away within 2-7 days.</li>
            <li> Usually bumps like this last over a week to up to a month.</li>
            <li> like I said--a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Now I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> The lotion on the other hand can feel like its burning your face.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if just using the lotion with other products will work or not.</li>
            <li> I still have occasional small breakouts, but nothing like I used to.</li>
            <li> maybe 20 or 30 times before the product was actually dispensed - not sure if its how it should be.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a fairly long time - I use it twice a day everyday and one bottle lasted six months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this, that, and the other, and nothing *</li>
            <li> I also noticed that using the foaming cleanser just like I&#x27;d used any other (massage in, immediately rinse off)</li>
            <li> This made all the difference (and didn&#x27;t work with other products).</li>
            <li> I had tried Proactive and all other OTC products.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a very long way, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price.</li>
            <li> But within a week, I&#x27;d say 90% of my active pustules were GONE.</li>
            <li> Without it, the whole bottle is rendered useless.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who have gotten used to Proactiv or tried other products and they have failed.  </li>
            <li> My hormones have settled down so I don&#x27;t need the product any longer, but I have recommended it to others and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it again if needed.</li>
            <li> I used it on my back and it worked very well some bad achne.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it costed A LOT less.</li>
            <li> Now I will only break out once a month, and very small little ones that I can handle.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount to spread in a very thin layer on the skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and if it ever stings, the sting quickly dissipates.</li>
            <li> At night, I use my Clinique acne products, which are much less harsh.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying</li>
            <li> I used this product along with the cleanser and saw little difference.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying</li>
            <li> All other topical treatments either dried out my skin, made them super oily, or burned if I ever went into the sun (making summers miserable).</li>
            <li> Well, after a few months of being uncontrollably pimply, I decided to get some otc medication.  </li>
            <li> I wait a few minuted before wearing them, but it seems like the chemical is still there and has a bleaching effect on the garment, which I didn&#x27;t see any caution about it on the packaging,</li>
            <li> FYI, I only use the cleanser and the Therapeutic Lotion (benzoyl peroxide cream) as I was not happy with the moisturizer (too greasy).</li>
            <li> It literally cleared up my skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> I  wash my face every night and and apply it to my towel dried skin after.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few creams that help my skin with breakouts.</li>
            <li> While this doesn&#x27;t erase acne in just a few hours (what does?), it dramatically shortens the pain and lifespan of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no idea how other people got results with it - to say if it really works I would need to leave it on skin for some time, which I can not as it burns so badly.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the entire line because I was experiencing the WORST break out phase EVER.</li>
            <li> A few tips: follow the instructions on the cleanser and wait at least 10 minutes after cleansing before using other products.</li>
            <li> the products mademe peel the first couple weeks (like a snake, kinda nasty) but my skin was so clear after that</li>
            <li> Just one little drop a day over her face after she washes and no more acne.</li>
            <li> Nothing brings those suckers down except for this product.</li>
            <li> i was searching furiously when i had one of my most awful breakouts</li>
            <li> not better...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the absolute worst skin, but I can count on both hands the number of days in my adult life that my skin has been without at least one pimple.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 small pimples and both were in areas where I probably didn&#x27;t use the therapeutic lotion like my on temple and under my nose.</li>
            <li> I am one of the very few unlucky ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old now and have had terrible, scarring cystic hormonal acne since I was 9 years old.</li>
            <li> Used it in the morning and night,m but at least for me very little change.</li>
            <li> Each time I was about to give it a chance I regret hardly.</li>
            <li> I use to have about 1-2 hard cystic acne breakouts every month.</li>
            <li> I mean, if that stuff worked, no teenager would have pimples...     </li>
            <li> and I had never experienced such terrible acne as I did when I was in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> I am very relieved it was just a bad product choice and not me!</li>
            <li> I started using Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;even better\\&quot; dark spot corrector (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called) to get rid of my acne scars from that terrible break out in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually all about using &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; means of taking care of my skin, but sadly, nothing I tried had an effect on clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> Then when the people dried out it left me with  Horrible pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I only break out now when I am stupid and miss a couple days of my skin regiment, which was unheard of eight months ago.</li>
            <li> A week before my period, I would get five or six painful blind spots that would last up to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just continued to get worse.</li>
            <li> all of which either made my skin worse or did not have any effect.</li>
            <li> The design for the moisturizer bottle is equally poor.</li>
            <li> (my entire face was covered, so bad i didnt even want to leave my house!)</li>
            <li> I had been getting this from a doctor&#x27;s office, but it was expensive and they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to avoid all foods with no dairy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I picked Obagi because it was expensive and made by doctors.  </li>
            <li> I never struggled with cystic acne, but the bumps across my face were still difficult for me to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> I know this sounds cheesy, but it truly has changed my self esteem.</li>
            <li> Sorry, if this was long and boring</li>
            <li> In a little over 6 weeks, I have seen a DRAMATIC CHANGE in my skin!!!</li>
            <li> i stumbled on this product when i was desperately trying to fix my skin.  </li>
            <li> but i was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was desperate and decided to use this product.</li>
            <li> I got some horrible acne a few months ago.</li>
            <li> but I think it feels so cold on your face</li>
            <li> The cream tingles slightly but nothing considerably outrageous or painful.</li>
            <li> and I did not react badly to the product, either.</li>
            <li> Really bad scarring acne.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I have used it for one day since it has a really bad odor that doesn&#x27;t go away since you have to reapply it throught the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff does, like all BP products, bleach the crap out of any fabric it touches over time.</li>
            <li> if you are like me and have ever had acne so bad that if affected your self esteem...please get this!  </li>
            <li> so when I started getting bumps, I literally hated looking in the mirror or having people look at my face.</li>
            <li> i have always had AWFUL acne.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and I was embarrassed to go out without a TON of cover-up.</li>
            <li> It was the worst I have ever seen my skin!</li>
            <li> That was 7 years ago and nowadays my face has been looking horrible as if the Proactiv is doing nothing.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dries skin out but it cleared up even those little stubborn bumps that can mostly be seen in the sun/natural light. Use with the moisturizer and you&#x27;ll be golden !</li>
            <li> After using proactive for years and not seeing any results, I finally decided to buy a more pricey product, and it&#x27;s been money well spent.  I use this product after the clarisonic face scrubber with the skinceuticals clarifying cleanser.  My face literally cleared up within a week, highly recommend this product to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Thus product is one of the best skin care priducts i gave used in many decades. No scent. Great for sensetice skins and keeps your skin acne free.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my daughter. It was recomended by a dermatologist.  She had a full face of acne, and now she is completly cleared. Very convienent to purchase on Amazon, and a nice price too! She swears by it.</li>
            <li> It just works. It can be a little drying but I did not find that it dried me out as much as others might have mentioned. The drying was definitely manageable considering the results. It dries out any blemish and quickly. Must be used regularly or you will see flare ups.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. Absolutely amazing. It was kind of my last resort for a topical product for my clogged pores and hormonal cystic acne because I&#x27;m hesitant to use chemicals to treat any type of bodily issue. I&#x27;m 24 and my acne began shortly after my 21st birthday. I had flawless, babydoll skin my whole life so when I started getting bumps, I literally hated looking in the mirror or having people look at my face. Most of my down time was spent researching methods of treating acne. I&#x27;m usually all about using &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; means of taking care of my skin, but sadly, nothing I tried had an effect on clearing my skin. I&#x27;ve changed my diet. Not much luck. I tried supplements. No change. I tried apple cider vinegar with minimal results. I&#x27;ve done honey masks, pH balanced cleansers, egg white masks, various essential oils, microfiber cloths, etc. and nothing would work. My main concern was the huge protruding cystic bumps. Nothing brings those suckers down except for this product. Ive been using this for 2 days so far. Results are almost unreal. The day this was delivered to my house, I was just getting a swollen lump under my eye on my cheek. Today, it is totally gone and flat. Usually bumps like this last over a week to up to a month. I had a bump on my forehead that you could see a mile away, and the day after...gone. I seen an esthetician and she recommended the whole kit for normal to dry skin. I was not about to pay $135 for 3 bottles. I have a cleanser I like and I use hemp seed oil for my moisturizer. I don&#x27;t see a point in buying the cleanser and moisturizer as they are pretty mediocre and you can definitely find products cheaper to use in conjunction with the therapeutic lotion. The therapeutic lotion is the workhorse with the clenziderm line. This product is nothing short of a miracle. I hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working! The liquefied benzoyl peroxide is what makes this so effective. My next issue is treating the pitted acne scars and texture issues and Iwill use a DIY vitamin c serum to take care of that. I highly recommend to anyone with any type of acne issue!!</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old now and have had terrible, scarring cystic hormonal acne since I was 9 years old. I have tried so many salicylic acid treatments (didn&#x27;t do anything but dry out my skin), benzoyl peroxide treatments (effective to maybe 50%, but my face was still full of deep-seated scars and active pustules), glycolic acid treatments (burned my skin), and others, both prescription and over-the-counter. I resigned to the idea that the problem would never go away on its own, that products wouldn&#x27;t help me, and that I would have to wait until I was rich enough to get expensive laser treatments to fix my skin. I found this product and was hopeful, but honestly not expecting much.     When I got this, my skin was deeply disfigured by scars and had many large, red, deep, very visible active pustules, as well as smaller pimples. But within a week, I&#x27;d say 90% of my active pustules were GONE. Now they are nearly completely erased, for the first time in 13 years. The transformation is unbelievable and I am so thankful to this company for creating such a great product. The first tube has lasted me nearly 2 months. My scars have faded considerably, and to help with this I also got a Clarisonic Pro 4-Speed brush to help clear my skin of scars and keep it clear of dead skin (it helps skin renewal and I highly recommend that too).     The only cons are that the product does burn for about a minute when you put it on your face (but you know it&#x27;s working!), and it can cause dead skin flakes, but this is easily exfoliated off.     I cannot recommend this product highly enough! Just give it a try, you won&#x27;t be dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> Now in my 40&#x27;s I started getting acne, hormone changes can cause acne around mouth and chin, after using several products a friend suggested Obagi skin care plus Clenziderm, Thank The Lord for Clenziderm! I don&#x27;t have any more acne!!</li>
            <li> Very, very drying. Be prepared for this to dry out the skin around any blemishes.</li>
            <li> The Obagi Clenziderm is the best acne treatment I have ever used - and I have used a lot, over-the-counter and prescription.  I am in my forties and have fought acne for years.  I have dry, sensitive skin anyway, and I use this twice a day with no adverse reactions.  It even seems to have improved the whole texture of my skin.  I had been getting this from a doctor&#x27;s office, but it was expensive and they discontinued it.  I am so glad to have found a new source for it!!  I have even gotten a couple of friends using it, they were so impressed with my response - they are sold too!  Be prepared, sometimes it burns when you apply it, but that quickly goes away and it has never caused me any problems.</li>
            <li> Obagi NuDerm face wash and Step 2 Benzoyl Peroxide are the only things I use to keep my face clear! These products far surpass Proactive! I&#x27;ve used the products for 4 months now and I&#x27;ve had no break outs except the initial ones after beginning the product. I&#x27;ve had acne since the age of 12 and I&#x27;m now 30 years old. It just continued to get worse. Dairy is the cause of my acne but it&#x27;s extremely difficult to avoid all foods with no dairy ingredients. I still don&#x27;t eat cheese or drink milk but I&#x27;m now able to enjoy some things with dairy because of Obagi! Thanks!</li>
            <li> saying this product is amazing is an understatement!!!  i stumbled on this product when i was desperately trying to fix my skin.  i have always had AWFUL acne. red, bumpy, oily, and no matter how much makeup i put on it...nothing helped! i was searching furiously when i had one of my most awful breakouts (my entire face was covered, so bad i didnt even want to leave my house!) and i found a review for obagi.  i bought the kit off some website for $100...pricey, but i was desperate.  This is the key product in the kit though.  Within a few weeks, my skin was CLEAR!!!!! not better...but CLEAR! which for me, was simply amazing.  for the first time in years i was actually not embarrassed to leave the house without foundation.  I actually stopped using obagi for a while too and my skin is still clear!!! (i am getting the occasional break out now, which is why i am back to order some more).  if you are like me and have ever had acne so bad that if affected your self esteem...please get this!  you wont regret it!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I am 31 years old and as long as I can remember I&#x27;ve always had some sort of breakout on my face. I&#x27;ve tried everything....Proactive, clearasil, equate, prescriptions from dermatologists, retin-a, max clarity foam and on and on and on...... After endless research and reviews I finally found this product. I use it with the Clarisonic brush and the step one Obagi skin cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using this regime for about 4 months now and my skin is breakout free. I occasionally see one trying to become something but I act fast and this product dries it up before it has a chance. This product is very strong and can dry out my skin if I use it everyday but the occasional dry skin is worth not having huge boils on my face. Awesome, awesome, awesome. Give it a try it&#x27;s amazing.  I also use Murad SPF 20 anti-aging moisturizer for acne prone skin as part of my regime which has also been a god send :-). Good luck.</li>
            <li> Just trying the product for the first time.  Results seem good and hope they continue for successful results on our son&#x27;s acne problem.</li>
            <li> This product helps with acne prone skin - been using it for over 5 years now, and it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I use this along with a Shiseido cleanser and a light moisturizer and it slowly cleared my acne. can&#x27;t live with out!    UPDATE 5/20/2016    I have been using this product for a while now. I would say it&#x27;s been about 3 years and I wanted to leave a more detailed review for others who have suffered from terrible acne! I originally bought the entire line because I was experiencing the WORST break out phase EVER. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s now and I had never experienced such terrible acne as I did when I was in my early 20s. It was horrible and I was embarrassed to go out without a TON of cover-up. I was literally spending so much money on concealer just so I can step out of the house. Well, I was desperate and decided to use this product. It took a couple of months for my face to return back to \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; When I started to run out, I decided to only purchase the therapeutic lotion since my acne was minimal and I knew my skin reacts much better to benzoyl peroxide (through years of experimental use). Since the face wash and the moisturizing lotion contained salicylic acid and my face was pretty much healed, I figured I only needed the therapeutic lotion. Since then, I&#x27;ve been using this product along with a face wash and a good moisturizer.    I will say that one bottle lasts me about a year. A little goes a long way. If I am eating healthy and taking care of myself, I only experience an occasional pimple here and there and this stuff will reduce the redness and size in about 1-2 days. The last time I purchased this product was Feb of 2015. Now I&#x27;m back for more! This stuff has changed my life! I do not wear concealer or foundation anymore and love that I can go out and face the world with my natural skin! I started using Clinique&#x27;s \\&quot;even better\\&quot; dark spot corrector (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called) to get rid of my acne scars from that terrible break out in my early 20s. My face is flawless now!! It took several months for all the dark sports to disappear, but I&#x27;ve received compliments on how great my skin looks!    I hope this product works for you as it did for me. I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews before I made the decision to try this product. If it did work for you and you&#x27;re still experiencing acne scars, I highly recommend using Clinique&#x27;s dark sport corrector [...] ) ! It&#x27;s pricey, but like I said--a little goes a long way! Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again! It left my skin burning  Then when the people dried out it left me with  Horrible pigmentation.  I had to cover up all the  Brown spots left by this product. It felt like  Something burned me .</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from a doctor&#x27;s office and I was told by the clinician that this would absolutely work to get rid of my acne which was brought on by hormonal issues after pregnancy. I bought the starter set and was a little taken aback by the price (about $110.00 for three products) but decided to go for it since absolutely nothing else had worked. Within a couple days I noticed my skin clearing up and within a few weeks my breakouts were totally cleared up. A little bit of this product goes a very long way, so don&#x27;t be discouraged by the price. You only need a tiny amount to spread in a very thin layer on the skin. I have sensitive skin and I did not react badly to the product, either. My hormones have settled down so I don&#x27;t need the product any longer, but I have recommended it to others and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it again if needed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;ve used this product and i really like it! my face is clearing up day by day</li>
            <li> I have had acne since the age of 12 years old. I am now 42. I have tried everything out there for my acne, even Acutane. While my skin has improved over the years it has never been clear. Until a nurse at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office explained to me the difference between over the counter benzoyl peroxide and Obagi&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide I had no idea. Apparently the drug store brands are made of particles too big to get into your pores. That is why it drys the skin and leaves a white residue on your face afterward. Obagi&#x27;s therapeutic lotion is made out of solubilized particles so they are smaller then your pores and can get to the source of the problem. What a concept a product that works!!! For the first time in 30 years my skin is completely clear. The only other thing I changed was that I wash my face with a 4x4 gauze pad and very gentle soap (the scrubs actually make small cuts for bacteria to enter I was told). I dry my face with a clean paper towel each time as well. That&#x27;s it!!! How simple. You won&#x27;t regret trying this product.</li>
            <li> If you want to burn your skin right away - go for it! It does the job.  I have no idea how other people got results with it - to say if it really works I would need to leave it on skin for some time, which I can not as it burns so badly. Probably will through it away. Each time I was about to give it a chance I regret hardly.</li>
            <li> I have had acne, nonstop, since I was 12 or 13, and am now on my way to 30. Last year as I was getting ready for a big event, my dermatologist recommended I try the entire Obagi Clenziderm line. To my utter amazement, my skin began to clear up after just a few days. After a few weeks it was like I had a whole new face. I have never, ever found a product that worked to cure my acne, but Obaji delivered exactly what it claims. It is like a miracle potion! Now that I am simply maintaining my clear complexion (that I still stare at in the mirror in disbelief), I use an organic face wash, and only the therapeutic lotion, because I figured that step is what actually kills the acne bacteria. I do recommend the entire line if you are trying to clear your skin for the first time, but after that, I have found that using only the therapeutic lotion works just fine.</li>
            <li> I first tried this right after using the obagi cleanser and toner and had to wash it offbecause it really hurt!&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it waiting until the toner was completely dry and it was better.  However, I found that the best way to use it if you have mild to moderate acne, is to use a gentle cleanser and toner ( I am currently using obagi C regimen) and then apply the lotion.  It sting just a little, especially if you dont allow the toner to dry completely, but it is WONDERFUL! It is the first time that I buy an acne product ( and I have bought ALOT) that really clears a blemish before it comes out completely.  It is great for spot treatments if you dont want all over face.  It really is the only product you need if you have mild to moderate acne. You can feel it working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you, I have tried everything out there to clear my acne and have been struggling with this horror for as long as I can remember. All other topical treatments either dried out my skin, made them super oily, or burned if I ever went into the sun (making summers miserable). Obagi Clenziderm is a miracle product!!! Because of the sensitivity of my skin, my aesthetician recommended I use it only to spot treat, do not apply like a moisturizer. I started using it twice a day and noticed a huge difference after the first day! It does tingle a bit if you apply it to larger areas but it doesn&#x27;t last long and it leaves your skin feeling light, smooth, and fresh. After a week I cut it down to once a day as it did have some drying effect (but not terrible), and I added a light moisturizer back into my cleansing routine. The treatment lotion and moisturizer balance eachother so well that I no longer have bouts of dryness and oilyness. My acne has completely cleared up except for a few old, tough scars. I actually realized that I didn&#x27;t have to use any of the lotion this last weekend at all. I think I will continue to use it every other or every few days just to prevent new breakouts. At this rate this bottle will last me a long time. SO worth every penny!!! Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am one of the very few unlucky ones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used Proactiv for about 15 years; it had not worked perfectly but quite well, but I thought Obagi&#x27;s being stronger would be even better and my goal was to be able to use non-white sheets and towels! I first switched the scrub and toner with the Obagi Pore Therapy and Daily Care Foaming Cleanser. But that wasn&#x27;t enough, so I added the Obagi Benzoyl Peroxide Therapeutic Lotion to my regimen. About 6 weeks after starting Obagi, my chin started developing several large, painful, cystic acne bumps - which I do have on occasion but only one at a time and usually go away within 2-7 days. But on Obagi, when one started resolving, another would pop up. On the two occasions I thought I would prevent a blackhead from turning into one, whoops, I caused a broad underlying one to erupt. I also had two large ones pop up by the side of my nose at two different times - they went away more quickly but were still a nuisance. I stopped wearing sunglasses just not to aggravate them or encourage more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know to blame Obagi as it had been more than a month since I&#x27;d switched. I went to the dermatologist who injected cortizone into the big ones - this was not a sure-fire cure - some still got bigger and I continued to get a few more - and prescribed Benzaclin and oral antibiotics. After a month on the antibiotic, things were much better but still erupting. Then it occurred to me that perhaps it had been the Obagi. I bought more Proactiv, stopped the Obagi and everything the dermatologist had prescribed including oral antibiotics, and within a week or two, things were better. It took over a month for things to go back to before I&#x27;d used Obagi except for a few dark skin spots. There are still some darkened spots - but minor - 2.5 months after I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for me, the salicylic acid&#x27;s shrinking of the pores actually traps bacteria in them. I got more black heads with the Pore Cleanser even before the eruptions started. And I can&#x27;t explain why the Benz. Perox. didn&#x27;t work, but perhaps my skin simply needs a Benz. Perox. scrub like Proactiv&#x27;s to clean the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to try this system because it seems to work for the vast majority of people, but note that if bad things start happening, don&#x27;t blame your hormones and aging. It may simply be that this system doesn&#x27;t work for you! I am very relieved it was just a bad product choice and not me!</li>
            <li> Have reordered this item a number of times and service is always fast and accurate.  Will continue with product and company in future.</li>
            <li> I got some horrible acne a few months ago. Who knows what caused it..stress or hormones?  Anyway, I was so worried that I went to the doctor. I was kind of relieved that it was just acne, even though I have no clue why my skin decided to misbehave... I can blame it on graduate school.  Anyway, the dermatologist said she could prescribe something, and I said \\&quot;No, I&#x27;m sure it will clear up.\\&quot;     Well, after a few months of being uncontrollably pimply, I decided to get some otc medication.  The dermatologist said benzoyl peroxide would work if I wanted to go OTC, but I didn&#x27;t trust the quality of the stuff they sell at the drugstore. I mean, if that stuff worked, no teenager would have pimples...     I picked Obagi because it was expensive and made by doctors.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of days in accordance with the package instructions and my \\&quot;granitos\\&quot; have started to clear up!    Actually, I noticed a difference the FIRST day and I am satisfied.  At this rate, I think I can look forward to \\&quot;normal\\&quot; and beautiful skin in a few more weeks!  A good product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product!  Stong, but very effective!  Only a small amount is needed, so the product lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> First couple of days I used it everyday (once a day.) Now I use it every other day. It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away. Highly recommend for mild acne!</li>
            <li> The product really works -- it&#x27;s the 5% benzoil peroxide. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and if it ever stings, the sting quickly dissipates. Clogged pores or pimples often dry up before they break the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews of this product online I decided to purchase it myself and use in conjunction with the &amp;#34;pore therapy&amp;#34; toner. It has been two weeks since I started using both once a day and I have to say my skin has not been this clear in years. I am still facing dryness in patches from the products as expected but it is slowly getting better. My pores are noticeably smaller and those under the skin bumps are smoothing away. I&#x27;m impressed so far. Will keep going and post an update shortly.</li>
            <li> I have always been very happy with Obagi. I use several of their other products, and i like the texture and the fact that they are never greasy. Well I only used this one for a week, so can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness I guess. I can only say that up to now, i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet, just some irritation and constant itching which is unbearable for me personally, but no change in the mild acne that I have on my back. however, it changed the color of several of my shirts before I notice it&#x27;s doing so. I wait a few minuted before wearing them, but it seems like the chemical is still there and has a bleaching effect on the garment, which I didn&#x27;t see any caution about it on the packaging, so be cautious about that if you&#x27;re gonna wear a nice shirt over it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product, as needed, for a number of years.  It&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> I really like OBAGI so far. I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and actually see a tremendous difference. The cream tingles slightly but nothing considerably outrageous or painful. I love the results!</li>
            <li> Excellent zit zapping potential</li>
            <li> I have tried everything but NOTHING worked as well as Obagi Clenizderm did for my face! I use the Obagi Daily Cream Cleanser, Pore Therapy and The Therapeutic Lotion in that order. I was recommended this product by an esthetician that I have been going to for a while. I never tried Obagi before and I didn&#x27;t really want to buy it because it was so pricey, but I bought the cream cleanser and pore therapy from her. I bought the lotion from amazon once I saw that my face was really clearing up! I have NEVER had perfect skin but from August to December 2011, my ENTIRE face was covered in tiny, skin colored bumps. I don&#x27;t know why but everything I did would not clear it up. It was the worst I have ever seen my skin! EVER!! I used the Obagi system, nothing else, and in 2 weeks, I could see a big difference. Within a month, my skin was pretty much clear. I get the occasionally breakout, one or two pimples, or three tiny bumps but way better than a face covered with tiny bumps!! I don&#x27;t know how the products work individually, but these three products together were amazing!! I think the cream cleanser was very similar to Cetaphil, so I think I will start using that when my cream cleanser runs out. The cream cleanser does not have any acne meds in it and I feel like it leaves a waxy film on my face but nevertheless, I have never broken out from it. I feel like Cetaphil cleans my face better so I will try that but I will not abandon the pore therapy (like a toner) or the lotion. The pore therapy will be kinda tingly, more like a cold feeling. Some say it burns but I think it feels so cold on your face (I think because of the menthol) it feels like it is burning but it doesnt hurt me. The lotion on the other hand can feel like its burning your face. It really hurts SOMETIMES but I just stick it out and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it whatsoever. These are very great products and I recommend them to anyone who has acne, pimply facial skin. I have dry skin and the products mademe peel the first couple weeks (like a snake, kinda nasty) but my skin was so clear after that so it was worth it to me. I don&#x27;t like writing reviews but these products seriously changed my skin for the better so I had to write a great review on it and hopefully someone will try it and see form themselves how amazing these products are! I tried drugstore products, Proactiv, Acne-free, Murad, etc. but nothing changed my skin like Obagi did. Sorry, if this was long and boring but I really hope people try these products out! Remember, I tried them as a set so I don&#x27;t know if just using the lotion with other products will work or not. I used the Cream cleanser and pore therapy in the morning with an SPF and at night, I used the cream cleanser, pore therapy, and the lotion. I know the lotion has a 2 on it for step 2 but I use that as my step 3. Hope you found this helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* August 11th 2012. My skin is still clear. I still get the occasionally bumps along my jawline and neck but only when it&#x27;s that time of the month or if I haven&#x27;t been caring for my skin like I should.. In a few days the bumps clear and my skin is nice again. Friends compliment my skin and say my skin is really nice and ask what I&#x27;ve done to it. Even my parents wonder how my skin is so smooth and glowing, knowing that ive suffered many years with bad skin. I&#x27;m so glad that my skin did not get used to the products and stop working *ahem* like proactiv did. After i used up the cream cleanser, I didn&#x27;t use Cetaphil like I said I was. Since I wear makeup on a daily basis, I had to have a cleanser that will remove my makeup with one wash and cetaphil does not do that. Right  now, I am using Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, followed by the Pore Therapy and the therapeutic lotion. Works beautifully. Will update in December which will be my one year using Obagi Clenziderm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne since I was a teenager and now I am in my 30&#x27;s and still have cystic acne and battle with it daily.  I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and when I first started using it I did have great results.  That was 7 years ago and nowadays my face has been looking horrible as if the Proactiv is doing nothing.  I finally went to a highly recommended esthetician who informed me that hundreds of her clients have gotten used to Proactiv and it no longer works.  So she recommended I try Obagi.  I noticed a difference with the first use! It worked better than when I first used Proactiv 7 years ago.  And the smell of the product is nice.  The downside is the price.  I must have this product so I turned to Amazon to find a better price.  The price on Amazon for any Obagi product can&#x27;t be beat.  I highly recommend this product for those who have gotten used to Proactiv or tried other products and they have failed.  With this price you have nothing to lose.  I love Obagi.</li>
            <li> If you take anything away from this review it should be that this line (Clenziderm) is the ONLY skin care line that has ever cleared my acne. I am 32 years old and have had acne since puberty. I don&#x27;t have the absolute worst skin, but I can count on both hands the number of days in my adult life that my skin has been without at least one pimple. I have tried so many lines (including Proactive, Murad, DDF, Aveda including grocery store brands, etc and also used BenzaClin topical Rx) all of which either made my skin worse or did not have any effect. I was at a laser hair removal appt at a dr&#x27;s office and saw a poster for Clenziderm and was so impressed by the before/after pictures that I wrote down the name to see how much Amazon sold the products for ($$ at the doctor&#x27;s office). It was/is very affordable on Amazon so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be such a loss if it didn&#x27;t work. Right away I noticed a difference in my skin, I wanted to write a review right away but thought I would give it some time. Its been 8 months and I am still so happy. I still have occasional small breakouts, but nothing like I used to. This benzoyl peroxide cream I believe is different because of the delivery system and it gets deep into your skin, other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used just are very drying and sit on the top of the skin. I now have blemish-free skin most of the time, and when I do get a pimple, they clear much faster than before. FYI, I only use the cleanser and the Therapeutic Lotion (benzoyl peroxide cream) as I was not happy with the moisturizer (too greasy).</li>
            <li> Excellent product but watch the expirary date when ordering online!</li>
            <li> Combined use with this and Daily Care Cream Cleanser &#x3D; Great Looking skin!! My skin is very acne prone and oily.</li>
            <li> Works the best than other brand. I have to buy more.The delivery is so awesome.I hope theres some more that I can buy.</li>
            <li> Nothing else, including rx creams, cleared up my spontaneous adult acne(just constant small red pimples, mostly on chin and cheeks). I tried everything including Rxs and blue light therapy, etc. without success for 2 years. This is amazingly effective for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 24-year-old that has mild acne for as long as I can remember.  I never struggled with cystic acne, but the bumps across my face were still difficult for me to get rid of.  This product is the only thing that works!! i originally bought it from my facialist and was a bit thrown off with the 75 dollar price tag. However, it really did wonders.  I looked to the internet for my next bottle and have not had any problems buying it online through amazon.  I tried going back to other over the counter products, but the acne immediately came back.  My facialist explained that this product is capable of going straight through to the pores, while over the counter medications do not.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one thing that gently keeps my acne at bay.  Combine this with professional peels/ microdermabrasion and you&#x27;ll have beautiful smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I compared this bottle to the bottle I bought from the doctors office, and the most noticeable difference was the way the lot number was printed.  They were facing different ways and in different fonts.  I called obagi and they said they could only look up lot numbers by doctor, and that if I bought it on amazon it is not authentic, or it could be authentic but used/expired.  So, just to be sure that is wasn&#x27;t authentic, I bought a new bottle from my doctor (an authorized seller), and compared.  This one was yellower and had a much stronger odor.  It also felt different between my fingers.  This confirmed for me that it is NOT REAL!  Please do not waste your money on this, or most likely any of the seller&#x27;s other obagi products.  Payless Beauty sent me a return label and is issuing a refund.</li>
            <li> Have you ever bought a jumbo bag of Cheetos only to realize that the bag was only 20% full? Same situation here.</li>
            <li> My young adult son has tried a half dozen prescriptions for blemish control, including Proactiv, and this surpasses them all!</li>
            <li> It is the same formula as I get in my dr.&#x27;s office, and so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> Trusted for 2 years already!!! Youll never regret, quite pricey but sure to deliver results, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My son uses the system and it actually helps.</li>
            <li> I love everything Obaji. The stuff just works.</li>
            <li> I have had acne my whole adult/teenage life and after being clear for years on other medications, thought I would be stuck with acne through my pregnancy as it was no longer safe to use those other medicines.  This product was recommended to me by my doctor and it has worked like a charm.  Acne on my face and body is almost 100% clear.  It works fast and works great.  To deal with the dryness I mix this in with my facial moisturizer morning and night to dilute it a bit before applying.  I have had no problems with redness or dryness by doing it this way.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well. But i had to press the dispenser maybe 20 or 30 times before the product was actually dispensed - not sure if its how it should be.</li>
            <li> An awesome product with awesome results!  I highly recommend this as part of your facial ritual to keep your skin your skin clear.</li>
            <li> Along with the toner, this is the only thing that truely controls my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from blackeads and acne for 20 years. (I&#x27;m 28) I have tried Proactive, Murad, Retin-A, you name it. I have never found anything that an clear up all of my skin issues (blackheads, hormonal acne, whiteheads, under skin bumps) and this stuff HAS! My Esthetician recommended this product to me, it&#x27;s the only acne treatment she uses as well. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $75+ in shop so I searched Amazon instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In a little over 6 weeks, I have seen a DRAMATIC CHANGE in my skin!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about OBAGI! I have not tried the whole kit, I use Skinceuticals LHA Cleansing Gel + Obagi Theraputic Lotion - THATS IT!!!  I use the Obagi Lotion at night only, because it dried out my skin too much using both morning/night. The first few times it definitely burned a bit but I kind of like feeling it work :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obagi is worth every single penny! I am going without makeup for the first time in 3-5 years! Obagi user for LIFE!</li>
            <li> It also stings a bit when you first apply it--which I don&#x27;t really mind.  Honestly it&#x27;s the best benzoyl peroxide I&#x27;ve tried so far (and I&#x27;ve tried many)... I just wish it costed A LOT less.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for acne and this has worked the best!! Especially for oily skin. I would recommend this for someone who has cystic acne it really works! It took about two week for really clear skin. It&#x27;s amazing can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!!</li>
            <li> Nothing else worked but this product. Very good for drying out pimples and doesn&#x27;t leave too much mark on the skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on my back and it worked very well some bad achne.  I would reccommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I love this with a toner in the am and glytone products in the evening.  Obagi may have a bleaching effect on dark colored pillowcases but its worth it for better skin and I can get white pillowcases.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else.  My daughter swears by it.  She has very fair and sensitive skin.  we have tried every over the counter acne solution out there with little success.  Just one little drop a day over her face after she washes and no more acne.</li>
            <li> I use to have about 1-2 hard cystic acne breakouts every month. They took forever to go away and usually left me with a scar. I decided it was time for a change since I am 38! My friend recommended this to me. It has worked for me for the last 4 months. I have had 2 small pimples and both were in areas where I probably didn&#x27;t use the therapeutic lotion like my on temple and under my nose. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, but if you put on the medicated lotion before your skin is dry, it burns.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. As long as I can remember I&#x27;ve always had some sort of breakout on my face. I was trying Benzac but  is just very drying and sit on the top of the skin.I saw all of the reviews on this product. I had to try it. The two weeks, it cleared up my skin.  It does sting a little at first, but that quickly goes away. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are that the product does burn for about a minute when you put it on your face, and it can cause dead skin flakes</li>
            <li> I originally found out about this Obagi Benzoyl Peroxide lotion from a medi-spa I used to go to for chemical peels, but started ordering them from Amazon because it&#x27;s sold at a better price. I have oily skin and break out every now and then, but this has been instrumental in quickly clearing up my skin. In the beginning it did dry my skin out around my mouth/chin, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that lotion couldn&#x27;t fix. This bottle should last you a few months (and I put it all over my cheeks, forehead, and chin every night). I also received this in a timely manner with no damage. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Hi. I am the typical 33 year old woman. I work and have 2 children, so I am always busy and not taking care of myself. I have had acne since the age of 11. Really bad scarring acne. I have been to 5 dermatologists, have spent so much money on drugstore face washes and products. I&#x27;ve been through every pill, cream, facewash, acne diet, ect...nothing cleared up my face. I would literally not go out of the house because of my face. Nothing helped. Then I saw all of the reviews on this product line for acne. I had to try it. The first week, it cleared up about 50% of my acne, I am in my 8th week now, and I cannot be happier. My acne is literally GONE. I have some scarring, but a chemical peel took care of that. Now I will only break out once a month, and very small little ones that I can handle. I cannot believe what this has done for me. I am so grateful. If you are reading this, please try it. It will help you!!! I will be a forever customer!!! It is a bit pricey, but you have to understand that if this is what you need to pay to look and feel your best, then it is worth every penny. I hope and pray that Obagi does not change a thing. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked as consistently as this. Cleared up my forehead completely and now I only get 1-3 breakouts on my cheeks every now then. Highly recommended for anyone who has tried everything for breakouts.</li>
            <li> After years of battling with acne and sensitive skin I finally went to a woman who gives facials and has experience in dermatology. She recommended this stuff, and I think it has absolutely done the trick. I only break out now when I am stupid and miss a couple days of my skin regiment, which was unheard of eight months ago. My skin was a little bit red when I started using it, and I would probably avoid it in dead winter when my skin is at its most dry and sensitive, but my sensitive skin quickly got used to it, and it was absolutely worth it. I was really put off by the price tag when I first bought it, but I am so glad I did. It also lasts a fairly long time - I use it twice a day everyday and one bottle lasted six months. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over 2 years.... female, in my 30s, my acne has worsened in my adult years. This stuff definitely helps reduce cystic acne and reduce the size, duration and intensity of cystic acne. Helps other acne but does not get rid of every single black &amp; whitehead: washing, hormones, etc. still play a role in that. But I feel like I have a more &#x27;normal&#x27; amount of acne for someone my age, which is to be expected. I use it 2x a day after washing- if it burns when you put it on, wait 10+ minutes after washing before using it. It stings sometimes for me in the summer when it&#x27;s humid and I don&#x27;t wait. This stuff does, like all BP products, bleach the crap out of any fabric it touches over time. Be cautious and buy white pillow cases!</li>
            <li> I re-order this product all the time....just great!  Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> this is the same product I have bought in stores at home and I love it - exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This product, along with the Pore Therapy toner, has been the answer to my 20+ year acne debacle. The solubilized (sp?) bp is the real deal. Thanks, Obagi.</li>
            <li> I, like many others who review these types of products, have struggled with acne for over a decade. I&#x27;ve tried this, that, and the other, and nothing *really* worked. While expensive, the Clenziderm line is worth every penny (besides, a little bit really goes a long way). I&#x27;m going to review the whole line (cleanser, lotion, moisturizer), because I&#x27;m assuming anyone reading the reviews will be looking to purchase the whole system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take some time to figure out how to best work it into my routine, and this will be different for everyone. Like many others, using the Clenziderm line all the time dried my skin out (and I have super-oily skin), so I only use it once per day (in the morning). At night, I use my Clinique acne products, which are much less harsh. This pattern was especially important in the winter. I also noticed that using the foaming cleanser just like I&#x27;d used any other (massage in, immediately rinse off) really didn&#x27;t help my acne much more than other products. What I learned to do was apply it at the beginning of my shower and leave it on until the end before rinsing. This made all the difference (and didn&#x27;t work with other products). So between leaving the cleanser on for several minutes and only using it once per day, my skin seems to love the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, many people complain that the series is uncomfortable. I will admit this is true particularly for the toner (lotion) and definitely the moisturizer. My skin is nearly as sensitive as it gets, but I just put up with it. If your skin is even more sensitive or it just hurts too much for you, I would try working with just the foaming cleanser. Sometimes the burning of the moisturizer even makes my eyes water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only honest complaint about the whole system is the packaging. I carried the lotion in the pocket of my cargo pants one time and, even though the lid was on securely, it leaked everywhere! A good $10-worth or so leaked straight into my pocket. I tightened the cap and, testing again, gently tipped it onto its side. It leaks so quickly that it&#x27;s visible. So never put/pack the lotion anywhere that it won&#x27;t always be upright. The salicylic acid smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s an awfully expensive perfume. The design for the moisturizer bottle is equally poor. I know it is claimed that the bottle is supposed to pump the product out, but it just doesn&#x27;t. I took a straw out of another product for it. Without it, the whole bottle is rendered useless. SEE EDIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the word of advice is that if you&#x27;re like many acne-prone folks who haven&#x27;t found anything that works, give this line a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I&#x27;ve previously always purchased my Clenziderm products individually. I&#x27;ve just ordered them as a set for the first time, and directions were included in the package. You&#x27;re apparently supposed to push up on the bottom of the moisturizer bottle while pumping to get the lotion out. I never would have realized you could do that. Ingenious.</li>
            <li> Tried it for about one month.  I used this product along with the cleanser and saw little difference. Used it in the morning and night,m but at least for me very little change.</li>
            <li> If you have moderate to severe acne, then this is the magic potion for you. I have suffered from acne my whole entire life and I can&#x27;t believe I just discovered this product recently. It literally cleared up my skin within a few days. I found that when I ran out if this product while I&#x27;m waiting for my next shipment, I would start breaking out again. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me several months ago...it cleared up my acne in no time at all..i love it :)</li>
            <li> not the same as what i bought at doctors office did not get the same results would like to get money back?</li>
            <li> Best acne lotion ever!!!!!!!  I have tried absolutely everything &amp; I finally rid of acne with this. I discovered this lotion while i started doing facials hoping to clear my face for my wedding. I  wash my face every night and and apply it to my towel dried skin after. It can be a little drying so do not place around your lips. I use the obaji moisturizer if I get too dry and that doesn&#x27;t break me out either. They are both amazing products! ! BUY THEM</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that&#x27;s been able to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well and have been using it for years. Much better than over the counter, drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I rated this item based on the smell. I brake out on my back and chest area. I just received this product and I have used it for one day since it has a really bad odor that doesn&#x27;t go away since you have to reapply it throught the day. So I am not sure if it actually works since I can&#x27;t get over the smell to use it on a regular.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few creams that help my skin with breakouts. I works wonders!  It also doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other acne products do.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried EVERYTHING for my adult acne. It was a 5 year battle, trying everything from changing my diet to ProActive, to you name it. I accidentally ran across a review for this product on You Tube one day and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I am so grateful for this product. I know this sounds cheesy, but it truly has changed my self esteem. It took about 2 months to see very noticeable results, and my acne was severe and cystic. I went from using it twice a day to now only at night. So give it a try!!! and remember, patience is a virtue &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i really like obaji, they make good products that work well. it can dry out your skin if you use it daily. it shipped fast.</li>
            <li> These obagi staff 1-6 sets saved my face! I heard it may damage kidney Dir it&#x27;s ingredients. But I will wait and see</li>
            <li> Obaji is the best skincare! My whole family uses it. This line works for my 19 yr old son and my husband.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me ... caused a burning sensation so I had to stop using it. Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again when my face heals?</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I use. It keeps my face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> My girls and I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works well for us if you use it every day like your supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my skin since I was 12. I&#x27;m 30 now. Every dermatologist I visited put me on antibiotics, either topical or oral, and my face would always get really irritated and red and I would still struggle with acne. This line truly changed my life. I was introduced by a woman giving me a facial who said it worked wonders for her too. I&#x27;m on my fifth round of this line (I use the cleaner and the toner in the morning, and the cleanser and this cream at night) and my face has never looked better. People are asking me what I&#x27;m using. A few tips: follow the instructions on the cleanser and wait at least 10 minutes after cleansing before using other products. If your fade starts getting super dry, use this lotion every other night instead of every night. Also, at my facialists recommendation I irdered the night lotion that comes with the &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; line of clenziderm and would put that on after applying this product. If you struggle with your skin give this stuff a try. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff has significantly cleared up my skin! After spending 10+ years looking for something to clear my skin (I&#x27;ve tried it all from Proactiv to prescription stuff), this is my go-to product. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to clear their acne. I have oily skin but still use this product. Also, this is the only piece needed from the kit to achieve results. I wash my face with a cetaphil bar (3$) and pat dry and then put this miracle cream on! Try it! Worth every penny! Great seller too! Always comes quickly and is good quality. Thank you :]</li>
            <li> I love this Obagi product, generally. My previous order was from Amazon and it worked great. This order, however, seems quite watered down as it is much more runny. Disappointing for a good and pricy product.</li>
            <li> best thing thats happened to my face. Very pricey but worth it. I dont know if the formula has changed but I have been using this for about 2 years with awesome results and this bottle burned my face like crazy for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Obagi&#x27;s Therapeutic Lotion is a great addition to your current skin cleansing regimen. I personally don&#x27;t like Obagi&#x27;s other products as I think they are too harsh, but I love this lotion as a spot treatment for my acne and trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a strong lotion with a high percentage of peroxide, so I would not suggest this going all over your face every day. However to get those up and coming pimple, it&#x27;s a great attack! Since using this lotion, I&#x27;ve noticed my acne either stops in its tracks once this is applied, so they never become huge deep pimples, or they disappear after 3-4 days (compared to the 3-4 weeks it used to be). While this doesn&#x27;t erase acne in just a few hours (what does?), it dramatically shortens the pain and lifespan of acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My system that has kept deep acne away for two years now it: Murad Time Release Acne Cleanser with a Clarisonic Mia 2, Murad Clarifying Toner, and Obagi Therapeutic Lotion for spot treatment. I swear by this routine and love all 4 of those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems high at about $40 a bottle, but one bottle lasts me about 1 year, or more, depending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love it, does not dry the skin like most other products out there. I had tried Proactive and all other OTC products. I found this one the best.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!! Obagi really helped cleared my face...I think no other product out there could beat obagi.</li>
            <li> this is the only acne product that works on my old skin!  doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and the quality is excellent</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that keeps my cystic acne under control. I use it with the pore therapy and a murad cleanser.</li>
            <li> My facialist recommended this product for quick treatment of breakouts.  It works!  It may be a strong for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had problems with acne for about six months. A week before my period, I would get five or six painful blind spots that would last up to two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product started working for me straight away. I don&#x27;t use it every day. If I feel like there&#x27;s a pimple starting to take place, I use the lotion and the next day, my skin is completely clear.</li>
