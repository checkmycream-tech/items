            <li> Poor quality. It came in silver when I thought it was gold. Not too happy. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to adjust it with. It&#x27;s either you have a slim arm or this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>

            <li> i LOVE THIS  except i tied it to tight and snapped it... easy fix tho ( still needa fix it still lol)</li>
            <li> Super cute, but it slides off easily if dancing around or reach for stuff on the ground. I don&#x27;t have big muscles to keep them up. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to arrive so make sure you order ahead.</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected. I am very pleased with it, it looks great.</li>
