            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>will be buying more as needed.</li>
            <li>Not yet sure thAE</li>
            <li>My husband had a severe case of fungus under most of his toenails.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s are some better options on Amazon (prices are from November 2012):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And make sure to use water and soap</li>
            <li>(antibacterial would be nice like a bar of \\&quot;Dial\\&quot; or come cheap Walgreens antibacterial stuff.</li>
            <li>AND THE TOP PART OF THE TOE THAT TOUCHES THE TOENAIL.</li>
            <li>This world has too many skanky feet</li>
            <li>Instead of the nail continuing to grow and the healthy part pushing out the fungal part, hers just FELL OFF after a month or so.</li>

            <li>it will take many weeks until the healthy nail has grown out</li>
            <li>but i can already see the beginnings of healty tissue and a healthy nail.  </li>
            <li>piggy paste and my toes are so much better</li>
            <li>Husband has been using this for a month and says it&#x27;s working better than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>&quot; this one was amazing and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>but, files are cheap so buy two and be safe instead of</li>
            <li>but, files are cheap so buy two and be safe instead of</li>
            <li>How wonderful IF the mfr provided some CONVENIENT way of covering toes OTHER THAN SAYING PUT A BAND-AID on every toe every day for 12 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>i find it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The paste is strong, in order to penetrate the nail.  </li>
            <li>But if you look at the fine print just below where it says \\&quot;3 month supply\\</li>
            <li>You have to be very very very consistent!</li>
            <li>THEN I FOUND A \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; (AND CHEAP) METHOD THAT WORKED</li>
            <li>The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li>Dove may make you all smooth and nice-smelling but it won&#x27;t kill bacteria).</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone for the kind words.</li>
            <li>Thanks to everyone for the kind words.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really important to cover the toe with a band-aid after application of the gel),</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not saying to do this every day, just do a very good job the first time and then regular upkeep while you cure.</li>
            <li>If I could get him to be consistent with using the Piggy Paste, I&#x27;m sure it would work for him.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>[BEING CLEAN, LOOKING CLEAN, SMELLING CLEAN]</li>
            <li>But if you have to go to work or wherever, put on CLEAN socks on and CLEAN shoes.</li>
            <li>But if you have to go to work or wherever, put on CLEAN socks on and CLEAN shoes.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 to 4 months for the nail to grow out clean of fungal infection.</li>
            <li>Service and delivery were good and the product does work if you use as directed for several months.</li>
            <li>Product price was good however, thirty dollars at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT and those who have not had success with it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t go nuts trying to make it smooth to the point where you file down to the meat underneath the nail.</li>
            <li>but I was persistent and it cleared quickly after.</li>
            <li>&quot; SO I STARTED GETTING REGULAR MANICURES AND PEDICURES AND WAS OK FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to absorb into a toenail quickly.</li>

            <li>but my feet are pretty again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M PRETTY METICULOUS ABOUT CLEAN SNEAKERS, SOCKS, ETC.</li>
            <li>So be clean and enjoy your new set of feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Good product works as expected</li>
            <li>Before trying Piggy Paste, I had been using NonyX Nail Gel with some success for years but my condition never seemed to be cured.</li>
            <li>Used other over the counter products with better ratings - this works better for me - it just takes time like all toe fungal products.</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s right, that mystery goo that your mom used to rub on your chest as a kid when you had a cough also cures fungus (toenails, fingernails, et al.).</li>
            <li>and I have most of the tube left.  </li>
            <li>it actually WORKS as stated and more...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how the fungus got started in the first place:</li>
            <li>You need to know how many toenails you&#x27;re treating beforehand because you only want to stick your finger in that jar once.</li>
            <li>Basically, just get into every conceivable part of your toenail that you can reach (IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>Basically, just get into every conceivable part of your toenail that you can reach (IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li>Soaking in white vinegar and/or using Vicks works better.</li>
            <li>this is the first time that anything at all has helped.  </li>
            <li>At first, I had problems with skin irritation around the nail.</li>
            <li>And when your nails finally look good enough to go to beach again, send me a pic of you in a bikini--unless you&#x27;re a guy, in which case just send me the money I saved you on Piggy Poo&#x27;s or</li>

            <li>, you want to file not only the distal edge (free edge) of the nail which you have trimmed but the actual surface (the top) of the nail.</li>
            <li>Filing the free edge if your nail can be done with a regular nail file or emery board, but filing the top might be easier if you buy what they call a \\&quot;nail buffer\\&quot; (which is basically a spongy rectangle with different grit sandpapers attached to each side.</li>
            <li>First you need to think about how much you need.</li>
            <li>In other words, if you have great fingernails and skanky toenails, don&#x27;t use the same file on each or...</li>
            <li>In other words, if you have great fingernails and skanky toenails, don&#x27;t use the same file on each or...</li>
            <li>You would be surprised how quickly .8 ounces (24 g) gets used up.</li>
            <li>While it could irritate the skin around the nail if you have sensitivities, the simplicity of applying this paste to the nail, wrapping it with a bandaid and forgetting about it for the day made it easy for my husband to use regularly.  </li>
            <li>and my 2 toenails are already starting to look more normal.</li>
            <li>Not sure this offers GREAT benefits...</li>
            <li>I then put a large amount of Piggy Paste on each toe almost every day, placed a band-aid over it, and wore it all day at work.  </li>
            <li>It has certainly paid off.  </li>
            <li>I assume different products work for different folks, but the results I had were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I can say it is really working for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works .</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>still using the product not seeing much change yet thought</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I received scripts for 4 different medications from my dermatologist and primary care physician.  </li>
            <li>WHO DISLIKES MODERN CHEMISTRY.</li>
            <li>&quot; Basically what that all means is that thymol gives fungus a one-two punch and is VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you can really scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep the bikini pics and your cash, you don&#x27;t even have to send me thanks.</li>

            <li>I tried this but for my toe nail fungus it really didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of the nail fungus.</li>
            <li>I gave this product one star because of the way the label can be very misleading.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I had toe nail fungus in my large toe for more than a decade - eventually it spread to two other toes.  </li>
            <li>Have tried virtually every other over-the-counter product over many years.</li>
            <li>And have a special nail file dedicated only to the fungus toes.</li>
            <li>And have a special nail file dedicated only to the fungus toes.</li>
            <li>and it, for the first time in a decade, looks about 95% clear.  </li>
            <li>Toenails can grow s-l-o-w-l-y, so it&#x27;s important to be patient and use this product long term.  </li>
            <li>You just want to file off the top layer of crust so that the thymol can penetrate down through the nail into the nailbed.</li>
            <li>I really noticed an improvement in the new nail growth after about 5 mos.</li>
            <li>This means you GET MORE and PAY LESS (about 10 cents per gram--</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out if excess Keratin build up is the same as a fungus...if they&#x27;re different, then that could explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you come up a little short when scooping and need more, use a different finger to grab a bit more.</li>
            <li>If you come up a little short when scooping and need more, use a different finger to grab a bit more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t all that inexpensive, so when you see that it&#x27;s a 3 month supply that makes the price seem a little better.  </li>
            <li>Went to a podiatrist and spent $1,000 for laser and it didn&#x27;t work (also was talked in to buying an ultraviolet light for $160 to sanitize my shoes).  </li>
            <li>wash feet, dry with a clean towel, put on flip flops while you do the rest of your morning routine (dressing, eating breakfast, etc.)</li>

            <li>I used piggy paste for about 10 months and my nail is new again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using NonyX and after several months my nails are finally starting to look better again.  </li>
            <li>maybe offers NO benefits compared to a pedicure-a-month for a couple of months!</li>
            <li>(obviously) I&#x27;m not saying to trim your nails every day, just make sure that you cut them short the first day you start your regimen, and from then on, clip from time-to-time as needed to keep them as short as possible.</li>
            <li>And be sure to get enough since you will be putting on a fresh bandage twice per day TIMES the number of toenails you are healing TIMES at least 30 days.</li>

            <li>If you can file it down smooth</li>
            <li>Fungal nails are often hard so this might not be easy but a long hot shower first (to soften the nail) should make things</li>
            <li>Finally, clear nails.</li>
            <li>Too early to see if it is going to work.</li>
            <li>I have not even been using this paste for 6 weeks yet and my nail is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>Been using the product for a year and is the old one that seems to work for me by making the nail softer.</li>
            <li>If ingrown nails are a concern, don&#x27;t trim TOO short, and trim in a straight (not curved) line.</li>
            <li>it has some ointment sitting on top, here&#x27;s how to apply: RUB it all over the toenail surface--physically RUB it into the nail even though it will not really absorb in; then JAM it into the lateral nail fold (that channel around the nail where the nail plate meets the finger skin); finally PUSH it under the toe nail plate--the front part where you can kinda get underneath it unless you are cut really short.</li>
            <li>So talk to a doc before and (if something unexpected happens) during the process.</li>

            <li>, this product will actually cost you four times as much.  </li>
            <li>It is going slowly, but surely.</li>
            <li>Anyway, as I said, despite all your best rubbing it did not absorb into your hard toenail so you should be left with a thin layer of the stuff on your toenail.</li>

            <li>In 5 weeks or so, my two small toes showed huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Even though fungus probably won&#x27;t live on a hard, dry, inorganic surface like a nail file or nail clippers, BE SURE TO STERILIZE YOUR NAIL CLIPPERS AFTER CLIPPING AND KEEP YOUR \\&quot;FUNGUS</li>

            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve only had this fungus since my live in Vietnam some 45 years ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Foremost among natural toe fungus remedies is an ingredient called \\&quot;Thymol\\&quot; which is extracted from regular old thyme (the herb you cook with).</li>
            <li>SO far, he&#x27;s only used it once.  </li>
            <li>I noticed absolutely no change in my toenail at all, and I was very vigilant to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li>far it has surpassed all my expectations and i&#x27;ve tried alot of products that have made the same claim as this product.</li>
            <li>Just look at the ingredients of the ointment (not green gel, not the white cream)</li>
            <li>And of course, if something unexpected happens that you think may require medical attention, get it.</li>
            <li>And of course, if something unexpected happens that you think may require medical attention, get it.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re a woman with cute little toes (fungus notwithstanding) get little Band-Aids.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care that other cheaper products may work as well; this one works (much of the guidance in that review was followed).</li>
            <li>My big toenail was completely infected with fungus for over 10 years and it is now about 90% gone, with just the end of the nail still slightly yellow.  </li>
            <li>I was upset that I didn&#x27;t see any results the first few months</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice that even when you towel dry your feet they are still kinda&#x27; soft and moist.</li>
            <li>and I changed my socks frequently and sprayed lysol in the shoes and let them dry outside</li>
    </ol>

            <li> now i can wear nail polish!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product...</li>
            <li> will be buying more as needed.</li>
            <li> Not yet sure thAE</li>
            <li> My husband had a severe case of fungus under most of his toenails.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s are some better options on Amazon (prices are from November 2012):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And make sure to use water and soap</li>
            <li> (antibacterial would be nice like a bar of \\&quot;Dial\\&quot; or come cheap Walgreens antibacterial stuff.</li>
            <li> AND THE TOP PART OF THE TOE THAT TOUCHES THE TOENAIL.</li>
            <li> This world has too many skanky feet</li>
            <li> Instead of the nail continuing to grow and the healthy part pushing out the fungal part, hers just FELL OFF after a month or so.</li>

            <li> it will take many weeks until the healthy nail has grown out</li>
            <li> but i can already see the beginnings of healty tissue and a healthy nail.  </li>
            <li> piggy paste and my toes are so much better</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this for a month and says it&#x27;s working better than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> &quot; this one was amazing and worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> but, files are cheap so buy two and be safe instead of</li>
            <li> but, files are cheap so buy two and be safe instead of</li>
            <li> How wonderful IF the mfr provided some CONVENIENT way of covering toes OTHER THAN SAYING PUT A BAND-AID on every toe every day for 12 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> i find it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The paste is strong, in order to penetrate the nail.  </li>
            <li> But if you look at the fine print just below where it says \\&quot;3 month supply\\</li>
            <li> You have to be very very very consistent!</li>
            <li> THEN I FOUND A \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; (AND CHEAP) METHOD THAT WORKED</li>
            <li> The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT.</li>
            <li> Dove may make you all smooth and nice-smelling but it won&#x27;t kill bacteria).</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone for the kind words.</li>
            <li> Thanks to everyone for the kind words.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really important to cover the toe with a band-aid after application of the gel),</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not saying to do this every day, just do a very good job the first time and then regular upkeep while you cure.</li>
            <li> If I could get him to be consistent with using the Piggy Paste, I&#x27;m sure it would work for him.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> [BEING CLEAN, LOOKING CLEAN, SMELLING CLEAN]</li>
            <li> But if you have to go to work or wherever, put on CLEAN socks on and CLEAN shoes.</li>
            <li> But if you have to go to work or wherever, put on CLEAN socks on and CLEAN shoes.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 to 4 months for the nail to grow out clean of fungal infection.</li>
            <li> Service and delivery were good and the product does work if you use as directed for several months.</li>
            <li> Product price was good however, thirty dollars at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT and those who have not had success with it</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t go nuts trying to make it smooth to the point where you file down to the meat underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> but I was persistent and it cleared quickly after.</li>
            <li> &quot; SO I STARTED GETTING REGULAR MANICURES AND PEDICURES AND WAS OK FOR MANY YEARS</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to absorb into a toenail quickly.</li>

            <li> Good product works as expected</li>
            <li> Before trying Piggy Paste, I had been using NonyX Nail Gel with some success for years but my condition never seemed to be cured.</li>
            <li> Used other over the counter products with better ratings - this works better for me - it just takes time like all toe fungal products.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s right, that mystery goo that your mom used to rub on your chest as a kid when you had a cough also cures fungus (toenails, fingernails, et al.).</li>
            <li> and I have most of the tube left.  </li>
            <li> it actually WORKS as stated and more...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how the fungus got started in the first place:</li>
            <li> You need to know how many toenails you&#x27;re treating beforehand because you only want to stick your finger in that jar once.</li>
            <li> Basically, just get into every conceivable part of your toenail that you can reach (IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> Basically, just get into every conceivable part of your toenail that you can reach (IMPORTANT:</li>
            <li> Soaking in white vinegar and/or using Vicks works better.</li>
            <li> this is the first time that anything at all has helped.  </li>
            <li> At first, I had problems with skin irritation around the nail.</li>
            <li> And when your nails finally look good enough to go to beach again, send me a pic of you in a bikini--unless you&#x27;re a guy, in which case just send me the money I saved you on Piggy Poo&#x27;s or</li>

            <li> , you want to file not only the distal edge (free edge) of the nail which you have trimmed but the actual surface (the top) of the nail.</li>
            <li> Filing the free edge if your nail can be done with a regular nail file or emery board, but filing the top might be easier if you buy what they call a \\&quot;nail buffer\\&quot; (which is basically a spongy rectangle with different grit sandpapers attached to each side.</li>
            <li> First you need to think about how much you need.</li>

            <li> In other words, if you have great fingernails and skanky toenails, don&#x27;t use the same file on each or...</li>
            <li> You would be surprised how quickly .8 ounces (24 g) gets used up.</li>
            <li> While it could irritate the skin around the nail if you have sensitivities, the simplicity of applying this paste to the nail, wrapping it with a bandaid and forgetting about it for the day made it easy for my husband to use regularly.  </li>
            <li> and my 2 toenails are already starting to look more normal.</li>
            <li> Not sure this offers GREAT benefits...</li>
            <li> I then put a large amount of Piggy Paste on each toe almost every day, placed a band-aid over it, and wore it all day at work.  </li>
            <li> It has certainly paid off.  </li>
            <li> I assume different products work for different folks, but the results I had were amazing.  </li>
            <li> I can say it is really working for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works .</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>

            <li> Fast delivery.</li>

            <li> &quot; Basically what that all means is that thymol gives fungus a one-two punch and is VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can really scrub.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I tried this but for my toe nail fungus it really didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of the nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I gave this product one star because of the way the label can be very misleading.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I had toe nail fungus in my large toe for more than a decade - eventually it spread to two other toes.  </li>
            <li> Have tried virtually every other over-the-counter product over many years.</li>
            <li> And have a special nail file dedicated only to the fungus toes.</li>

            <li> and it, for the first time in a decade, looks about 95% clear.  </li>
            <li> Toenails can grow s-l-o-w-l-y, so it&#x27;s important to be patient and use this product long term.  </li>
            <li> You just want to file off the top layer of crust so that the thymol can penetrate down through the nail into the nailbed.</li>
            <li> I really noticed an improvement in the new nail growth after about 5 mos.</li>
            <li> This means you GET MORE and PAY LESS (about 10 cents per gram--</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out if excess Keratin build up is the same as a fungus...if they&#x27;re different, then that could explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you come up a little short when scooping and need more, use a different finger to grab a bit more.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t all that inexpensive, so when you see that it&#x27;s a 3 month supply that makes the price seem a little better.  </li>
            <li> Went to a podiatrist and spent $1,000 for laser and it didn&#x27;t work (also was talked in to buying an ultraviolet light for $160 to sanitize my shoes).  </li>

            <li> maybe offers NO benefits compared to a pedicure-a-month for a couple of months!</li>
            <li> (obviously) I&#x27;m not saying to trim your nails every day, just make sure that you cut them short the first day you start your regimen, and from then on, clip from time-to-time as needed to keep them as short as possible.</li>
            <li> And be sure to get enough since you will be putting on a fresh bandage twice per day TIMES the number of toenails you are healing TIMES at least 30 days.</li>

            <li> If you can file it down smooth</li>
            <li> Fungal nails are often hard so this might not be easy but a long hot shower first (to soften the nail) should make things</li>
            <li> Finally, clear nails.</li>
            <li> Too early to see if it is going to work.</li>
            <li> I have not even been using this paste for 6 weeks yet and my nail is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a year and is the old one that seems to work for me by making the nail softer.</li>
            <li> If ingrown nails are a concern, don&#x27;t trim TOO short, and trim in a straight (not curved) line.</li>
            <li> it has some ointment sitting on top, here&#x27;s how to apply: RUB it all over the toenail surface--physically RUB it into the nail even though it will not really absorb in; then JAM it into the lateral nail fold (that channel around the nail where the nail plate meets the finger skin); finally PUSH it under the toe nail plate--the front part where you can kinda get underneath it unless you are cut really short.</li>
            <li> So talk to a doc before and (if something unexpected happens) during the process.</li>

            <li> , this product will actually cost you four times as much.  </li>
            <li> It is going slowly, but surely.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as I said, despite all your best rubbing it did not absorb into your hard toenail so you should be left with a thin layer of the stuff on your toenail.</li>

            <li> Even though fungus probably won&#x27;t live on a hard, dry, inorganic surface like a nail file or nail clippers, BE SURE TO STERILIZE YOUR NAIL CLIPPERS AFTER CLIPPING AND KEEP YOUR \\&quot;FUNGUS</li>

            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve only had this fungus since my live in Vietnam some 45 years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Foremost among natural toe fungus remedies is an ingredient called \\&quot;Thymol\\&quot; which is extracted from regular old thyme (the herb you cook with).</li>
            <li> SO far, he&#x27;s only used it once.  </li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no change in my toenail at all, and I was very vigilant to put it on every day.  </li>
            <li> far it has surpassed all my expectations and i&#x27;ve tried alot of products that have made the same claim as this product.</li>
            <li> Just look at the ingredients of the ointment (not green gel, not the white cream)</li>
            <li> And of course, if something unexpected happens that you think may require medical attention, get it.</li>
            <li> And of course, if something unexpected happens that you think may require medical attention, get it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman with cute little toes (fungus notwithstanding) get little Band-Aids.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a woman with cute little toes (fungus notwithstanding) get little Band-Aids.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care that other cheaper products may work as well; this one works (much of the guidance in that review was followed).</li>
            <li> My big toenail was completely infected with fungus for over 10 years and it is now about 90% gone, with just the end of the nail still slightly yellow.  </li>
            <li> I was upset that I didn&#x27;t see any results the first few months</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that even when you towel dry your feet they are still kinda&#x27; soft and moist.</li>
            <li> and I changed my socks frequently and sprayed lysol in the shoes and let them dry outside</li>
            <li> finally you have \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; remedies which have shown to be the least expensive and often the most effective with the least side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that applying Carmex with a Q-tip to the skin, before applying the paste &amp; bandage, decreased the irritation significantly.</li>
            <li> Then...THE LAST THING YOU DO BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE is move on to the next step, your feet should be sufficiently dry at this</li>
            <li> Then I read about Piggy Paste, tried it and although it takes a long time, I am finally seeing results.</li>
            <li> Eventually what will happen is that when the fungus is dead or in remission, the new nail that is growing from the base of your toe willbe opaque with a healthy pink underneath while the thick, yellow, crusty nail will grow further out and out (keep clipping it and saying good riddance and keep applying ointment even though fungus appears to be dead).</li>

            <li> For fungus you only want to use the coarsest grit file to loosen up the nail surface-scum.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP FOUR: DRY YOUR FEET.</li>
            <li> AS i EXPECTED, not enough time has gonr by.will revise later one</li>
            <li> If you think your shoes or sneakers may have fungus, use antifungal powder in them, or wash them with a little bleach added to the water (not directly on the sneakers or they will stain), or get a new pair, or whatever.</li>

            <li> seems to be working but taking a long time.</li>
            <li> and decided to continue the treatment diligently for however long it would take.  </li>
            <li> We gave piggy paste 4 months trial, following the directions carefully, and did not notice any change in the toenail.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick glob, then you dabbed on too much.</li>

            <li> After trying prescription remedies, nail removal, and other methods suggested by our family doctor, we finally looked to this.  </li>
            <li> I saw no results using all the other products, so this one is definitely a winner!!</li>
            <li> I used it every day until the tube ran dry.  </li>

            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t long before my toes got very red and raw.  </li>
            <li> This product recommends only using a little bit and band-aiding the toe after application - for a minimum of 2 hours.</li>
            <li> so I removed the band-aid and didn&#x27;t use the product again - but what started as a minor itch, turned first into pink blisters and then turned into an angry purple rash that surrounded my nail.  </li>
            <li> Piggy Paste was such a waste of money...</li>
            <li> I read the review carefully posted on 11/20/12.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned my feat carefully 2x a day.  </li>
            <li> but the nail bed came in pink.</li>
            <li> I do give my big toe a few days off each week to allow the skin to repair itself.</li>
            <li> If I had started this treatment a few weeks earlier I would have made it this summer.  </li>

            <li> This means: don&#x27;t rush out of the shower put the ointment on your wet feet, cover up with your fungus-ridden sneakers and think that this is going to work.</li>

            <li> (now you know why I said not to get any ointment on the bottom of your toe; if it&#x27;s wet from the ointment or shower moisture</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am on my second tube and it seems to be working, but you must have patience.</li>
            <li> Too early to see if it is going to work.</li>
            <li> Quit looking for a cure... you have found it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I know that does the trick. Patience is key.</li>
            <li> This product recommends only using a little bit and band-aiding the toe after application - for a minimum of 2 hours. I followed the directions to the letter - using it on two toes. On the third day of use I notice one of my toes had started itching uncontrollably so I removed the band-aid and didn&#x27;t use the product again - but what started as a minor itch, turned first into pink blisters and then turned into an angry purple rash that surrounded my nail.  Disgusting, itchy, nasty, mess. One week later it has still not heeled despite using cortisone ointment.  I finally broke down and went to the doctor who told me I had a 3rd degree chemical burn. Seriously?  From Piggy Paste.  Third degree burn.  How does stuff like this even get on the market?!</li>
            <li> I can say it is really working for me. It&#x27;s been a month since I have been using piggy paste and the fungus is already gone!!</li>
            <li> Have tried virtually every other over-the-counter product over many years. This is the ONLY one that works. If you are diligent about applying it (almost) daily and leaving it on for ~2 hours without disturbing it, you can expect to see healthy nail growth starting within 2 months.</li>
            <li> Service and delivery were good and the product does work if you use as directed for several months.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve only had this fungus since my live in Vietnam some 45 years ago. Piggy past doesn&#x27;t claim to get rid of it with one tube and I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  I used it every day until the tube ran dry.  I cant say it helped but it didn&#x27;t hurt.  For the price I doubt that I&#x27;ll continue buying tubes until I&#x27;m totally cured. You would be surprised how quickly .8 ounces (24 g) gets used up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hubby.  He has fungus on all of his toes from being in VietNam for the war.  The fungus causes his toenails to get very hard and fall off.  He even has a fingernail that has done the same thing.  If I could get him to be consistent with using the Piggy Paste, I&#x27;m sure it would work for him.  SO far, he&#x27;s only used it once.  If it were me, I would have it on everyday.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> After trying prescription remedies, nail removal, and other methods suggested by our family doctor, we finally looked to this.  While it could irritate the skin around the nail if you have sensitivities, the simplicity of applying this paste to the nail, wrapping it with a bandaid and forgetting about it for the day made it easy for my husband to use regularly.  Finally, clear nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works . Took 3 months got to use it every day .it takes time but it works</li>
            <li> I have tried other products for the nail infection with no results but the Piggy paste has done the job. The service was great and I recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks now but I think it is starting to work.  Easy to use and my 2 toenails are already starting to look more normal.</li>
            <li> Price and size as advertised.  Fast delivery.  I would recommend this product from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Good product works as expected</li>
            <li> Before trying Piggy Paste, I had been using NonyX Nail Gel with some success for years but my condition never seemed to be cured. If I stopped using it, I would notice that under my nail tips would start to recede and the nail would begin to turn yellow again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the ad for Piggy Paste I decided to give it a try and it wasn&#x27;t long before my toes got very red and raw.  I might have ignored that issue if my nails didn&#x27;t start to get worse and worse.  I complained in an email to Dr. Paul and he responded with some suggestions on how to prevent the red/raw reaction, but nothing about the fact that my symptoms worsened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone back to using NonyX and after several months my nails are finally starting to look better again.  Piggy Paste was such a waste of money...and I have most of the tube left.  I guess it works for some and not for others. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out if excess Keratin build up is the same as a fungus...if they&#x27;re different, then that could explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I suggest that if you decide to try it, buy it from Walgreens but keep track of your receipt!  Walgreens will refund your money if you have your receipt (I wish I could find mine!!)</li>
            <li> still using the product not seeing much change yet thought but im still trying to use it as long as it lasts</li>
            <li> Not sure this offers GREAT benefits... maybe offers NO benefits compared to a pedicure-a-month for a couple of months! Inconvenient to use and requires 12 weeks per directions! HOLY COW... that IS 3 MONTHS! How wonderful IF the mfr provided some CONVENIENT way of covering toes OTHER THAN SAYING PUT A BAND-AID on every toe every day for 12 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ridiculous! Might as well say bag feet in sandwich bags! Two weeks of silliness and ENOUGH! Find alternate solution!</li>
            <li> Used other over the counter products with better ratings - this works better for me - it just takes time like all toe fungal products.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to work so through reviews need several weeks of using the product to see results.</li>
            <li> Tried for a few days,, but the smell of the paste was pretty bad and I didn&#x27;t want to walk around with stinky  feet, even though you are supposed to apply with a bandaid... It could not mask the smell. Product price was good however, thirty dollars at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Effectivly clearing up my fungus.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have not even been using this paste for 6 weeks yet and my nail is almost completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about this product but after trying it for 2 months I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that actually gets rid of fungus.  Use as directed and be patient.  I will always keep this product on hand.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I used it every day for 15 months with no results.</li>
            <li> I used Piggy Paste daily until the bottle ran out, which was about 5 or 6 months.  For me, it was a waste of money and a waste of all those bandaids.  I noticed absolutely no change in my toenail at all, and I was very vigilant to put it on every day.  My toenail is still just as thick as it was before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this stuff on my pinky finger. It&#x27;s only been a week and it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s working yet. But I&#x27;ll keep using it till the tube is used up.</li>
            <li> the tube sent is a 3 month supply and at this time i&#x27;m about through the 2nd month.&lt;br /&gt;so far it has surpassed all my expectations and i&#x27;ve tried alot of products that have made the same claim as this product. i&#x27;ll probably be ordering another tube at some time in the future.</li>
            <li> not happy with this...don&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;bandaging,&amp;#34; and therefore I don&#x27;t use it. if I don&#x27;t use it, I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This product is the only that has helped me.  The doctor had me take a prescription for two months to try and get rid of the toe fungus&lt;br /&gt;but that did not help.  Then I read about Piggy Paste, tried it and although it takes a long time, I am finally seeing results. This is a&lt;br /&gt;product I will continue to purshcase</li>
            <li> I used piggy paste for about 10 months and my nail is new again. I was upset that I didn&#x27;t see any results the first few months but I was persistent and it cleared quickly after. You have to be very very very consistent! I never missed a day and I changed my socks frequently and sprayed lysol in the shoes and let them dry outside then I soaked my feet in vinegar and listerine mix for 30 every other day. I saw no results using all the other products, so this one is definitely a winner!! Yes it was time consuming but my feet are pretty again! now i can wear nail polish!! :)</li>
            <li> Love this product...it actually WORKS as stated and more...Very effective ...I have recommended it to friends and family as well.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a year and is the old one that seems to work for me by making the nail softer.</li>
            <li> Sweetie has been using this for various problems for a couple of years. yes, it is expensive, but nothing else works quite like it. will be buying more as needed.</li>
            <li> I read the review carefully posted on 11/20/12.  I don&#x27;t care that other cheaper products may work as well; this one works (much of the guidance in that review was followed). I had toe nail fungus in my large toe for more than a decade - eventually it spread to two other toes.  I received scripts for 4 different medications from my dermatologist and primary care physician.  Nothing worked - neither topical applications nor pills.  Went to a podiatrist and spent $1,000 for laser and it didn&#x27;t work (also was talked in to buying an ultraviolet light for $160 to sanitize my shoes).  Then I read the review noted.  I cleaned my feat carefully 2x a day.  I purchased anti-fungal powder for my shoes and use it daily.  I started using a anti-fungal spray in my shoes weekly (and washing my non-work shoes regularly).  I then put a large amount of Piggy Paste on each toe almost every day, placed a band-aid over it, and wore it all day at work.  In 5 weeks or so, my two small toes showed huge improvement.  By 10 weeks or so, there was no trace in my small toes.  I have been doing it for about 14 weeks now on my big toe and it, for the first time in a decade, looks about 95% clear.  There is only trace left on my toe nail tip but the nail bed came in pink. I do give my big toe a few days off each week to allow the skin to repair itself. I had given up on ever showing my toes in public (not that I want to show my toes, but I was embarrased to wear open shoes).  If I had started this treatment a few weeks earlier I would have made it this summer.  I am on my 4th tube.  Given the money and time spent on other \\&quot;cures\\&quot; this one was amazing and worth every cent.  If  you&#x27;ve had trouble with fungus, give this a try.  I assume different products work for different folks, but the results I had were amazing.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> Not yet sure thAE IT WORKS AS WELL AS i EXPECTED, not enough time has gonr by.will revise later one</li>
            <li> Honey says this is one of the only things that works on his &amp;#34;unhappy&amp;#34; toenail.</li>
            <li> The reason I have reordered this product is it seems to soften toe nails, making thickening nails easier to cut.  It does not eliminate fungus under the nail--at least, not at the upper portion of the nail--even after months of use.</li>
            <li> seems to be working but taking a long time.</li>
            <li> great !! piggy paste. I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> pain to use do not buy does not cure problem</li>
            <li> My husband had a severe case of fungus under most of his toenails. They have greatly improved. Still have a ways to go until &amp;#34;all clear&amp;#34;.  It is going slowly, but surely.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  You have to be patient but you will see results.  I noticed results right away and I didn&#x27;t follow the instructions- I never used a band-aid and I always have my nails painted because it&#x27;s sandal season.  Once I stop wearing open toed shoes I hope to see my mess of ugly toes gone.  One thing that should be mentioned in the instructions is to spray your shoes with Lysol when your done wearing your shoes.</li>
            <li> My mom followed directions as stated on the instruction. Product didnt perform as expected.</li>
            <li> There are a number of proven solutions to the toenail fungus problem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Nail removal surgery is painful and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;*Laser surgery is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;*Prescription Oral Medications (like Lamisil) can be expensive and often have side effects.&lt;br /&gt;*Over-the-counter medications (like Fungicure) can be moderately expensive and have potential side effects.&lt;br /&gt;*And finally you have \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; remedies which have shown to be the least expensive and often the most effective with the least side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I SHOULD PROBABLY DISCLOSE HERE THAT I&#x27;M NOT SOME ALL-NATURAL VEGAN HIPPY WHO DISLIKES MODERN CHEMISTRY. I&#x27;M A MEAT AND POTATOES GUY FROM BROOKLYN WHO IS INTO HYGIENE [BEING CLEAN, LOOKING CLEAN, SMELLING CLEAN] AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF ONE DAY, \\&quot;HEY SELF, PEDICURES ARE A GREAT WAY TO KEEP YOUR FEET LOOKING GOOD, PLUS YOU GET A NICE FOOT MASSAGE FROM THE NAIL GIRL.\\&quot; SO I STARTED GETTING REGULAR MANICURES AND PEDICURES AND WAS OK FOR MANY YEARS BUT THEN ONE DAY I GOT AN INFECTED TOENAIL THAT *HAD TO* HAVE BEEN FROM THE NAIL JOINT SINCE I&#x27;M PRETTY METICULOUS ABOUT CLEAN SNEAKERS, SOCKS, ETC. ANYWAY, AFTER A YEAR OF FAILED REMEDIES FROM MY DOCTOR&#x27;S \\&quot;WESTERN MEDICINE BOOK OF FAILED REMEDIES\\&quot; I WAS READY TO TAKE MY THICK YELLOW-WITH-WHITE-CRUST FUNGAL TOENAIL AND JOIN A CIRCUS SIDESHOW. THEN I FOUND A \\&quot;NATURAL\\&quot; (AND CHEAP) METHOD THAT WORKED SO WELL, IT MADE ME WANT TO CHANT, WORSHIP CRYSTALS AND BURN INCENSE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foremost among natural toe fungus remedies is an ingredient called \\&quot;Thymol\\&quot; which is extracted from regular old thyme (the herb you cook with). According to Wikipedia: \\&quot;The antifungal nature of thymol is caused by thymol&#x27;s ability to alter in the hyphal morphology and cause hyphal aggregates, resulting in reduced hyphal diameters and lyses of hyphal wall. Additionally, thymol is lipophilic, enabling it to interact with the cell membrane of fungus cells, altering cell membrane permeability permitting the loss of macromolecules.\\&quot; Basically what that all means is that thymol gives fungus a one-two punch and is VERY EFFECTIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I doing all this yapping? Well, with regard to Piggy Paste, the \\&quot;secret\\&quot; ingredient in the product is...THYMOL. So (and here is my actual review) Piggy Paste works, but for the price they are charging it sucks. I give it 5-stars for efficacy and 1-star for price. Average of 3-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s are some better options on Amazon (prices are from November 2012):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A 24 gram (.8 oz.) tube of Dr. Paul&#x27;s Piggy Paste is $28...about $1.20 per gram. Pretty expensive if you ask me (and that seems to be the major complaint in the other reviews).&lt;br /&gt;*Thymol extract (from various vendors) is about $20 for 24 grams (1 oz.) that&#x27;s about 80 cents per gram. A little cheaper but not cheap enough. It&#x27;s just an extract so it doesn&#x27;t come with the other \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that&#x27;s in Piggy Paste but trust me, the Thymol is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;*What if I told you there is a product that contains Thymol and a 50 gram (1.76 oz.) bottle only cost $5. This means you GET MORE and PAY LESS (about 10 cents per gram--THAT&#x27;S 1/10TH THE PRICE PEOPLE!!!). The Miracle Product is...Vicks Vaporub ointment?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right, that mystery goo that your mom used to rub on your chest as a kid when you had a cough also cures fungus (toenails, fingernails, et al.). Just look at the ingredients of the ointment (not green gel, not the white cream) and you&#x27;ll see \\&quot;THYMOL\\&quot; there plain as day. Need further proof? Just search online for \\&quot;Vicks Vaporub toenail fungus\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find about a gazillion pages confirming this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT and those who have not had success with it did not put the proper effort into curing themselves. Basically it&#x27;s the same instructions that you get with \\&quot;Piggy Paste\\&quot;, \\&quot;Funginail\\&quot; or even prescription topical medications. But let me say it AGAIN...The way you apply the ointment is JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE INGREDIENT. If you don&#x27;t carve out an extra five minutes per day to do this regimen properly, then you&#x27;re just wasting your time and money. So, here&#x27;s the process...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Apply AT LEAST twice per day. Presumably this would be after you shower in the morning and before you go to bed at night. Or if you&#x27;re one of those people who shower at night, then you also need to wash your feet when you wake up.&lt;br /&gt;*FIRST STEP, WASH YOUR FEET. In the morning this probably means a shower but at night you need to get off your lazy butt and wash your feet before bed. And make sure to use water and soap (antibacterial would be nice like a bar of \\&quot;Dial\\&quot; or come cheap Walgreens antibacterial stuff. Dove may make you all smooth and nice-smelling but it won&#x27;t kill bacteria). And when I say \\&quot;wash\\&quot;, I mean \\&quot;WASH\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t just assume that the dirty soap/water running down your body while you shower will clean your feet. Get in there and scrub your feet, toes, your toenails, dig out the dirt under your nails, etc. You can even buy a foot-scrubber or something so you can really scrub.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP TWO, TRIM YOUR NAILS. The healing process will take from a month to a year depending on how skanky your toenails are so (obviously) I&#x27;m not saying to trim your nails every day, just make sure that you cut them short the first day you start your regimen, and from then on, clip from time-to-time as needed to keep them as short as possible. If ingrown nails are a concern, don&#x27;t trim TOO short, and trim in a straight (not curved) line. Fungal nails are often hard so this might not be easy but a long hot shower first (to soften the nail) should make things easier.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP THREE, FILE YOUR NAILS. Again, the recovery process can take a while so I&#x27;m not saying to do this every day, just do a very good job the first time and then regular upkeep while you cure. Oh, ALSO (VERY IMPORTANT), you want to file not only the distal edge (free edge) of the nail which you have trimmed but the actual surface (the top) of the nail. Fungal nails are often thick and bumpy. If you can file it down smooth that&#x27;s great but don&#x27;t go nuts trying to make it smooth to the point where you file down to the meat underneath the nail. You just want to file off the top layer of crust so that the thymol can penetrate down through the nail into the nailbed. Filing the free edge if your nail can be done with a regular nail file or emery board, but filing the top might be easier if you buy what they call a \\&quot;nail buffer\\&quot; (which is basically a spongy rectangle with different grit sandpapers attached to each side. Women use it to file the nail surface, then switch to a finer grit, then again and again and the nail comes out shiny. For fungus you only want to use the coarsest grit file to loosen up the nail surface-scum.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP FOUR: DRY YOUR FEET. This means: don&#x27;t rush out of the shower put the ointment on your wet feet, cover up with your fungus-ridden sneakers and think that this is going to work. That&#x27;s how the fungus got started in the first place: MOISTURE. You need to THOROUGHLY DRY your feet after washing each day. You&#x27;ll notice that even when you towel dry your feet they are still kinda&#x27; soft and moist. So what you need to do is: wash feet, dry with a clean towel, put on flip flops while you do the rest of your morning routine (dressing, eating breakfast, etc.) Then...THE LAST THING YOU DO BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE is move on to the next step, your feet should be sufficiently dry at this point.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP FIVE: APPLY THE VICKS VAPORUB. First you need to think about how much you need. If you are doing one toenail it&#x27;s not a lot. If you are doing all ten toenails...well, use your judgment. You need to know how many toenails you&#x27;re treating beforehand because you only want to stick your finger in that jar once. Sticking it in to get enough for one toenail, then going back for ointment to put on toenail #2 would likely transfer some fungus from toenail #1 back into thejar. You know what I mean? Like double-dipping a chip...gross. So scoop out enough for all toenails involved, drop a dollop on each toenail and then get to work on your toenails one at a time. If you come up a little short when scooping and need more, use a different finger to grab a bit more. Once each toe that needs it has some ointment sitting on top, here&#x27;s how to apply: RUB it all over the toenail surface--physically RUB it into the nail even though it will not really absorb in; then JAM it into the lateral nail fold (that channel around the nail where the nail plate meets the finger skin); finally PUSH it under the toe nail plate--the front part where you can kinda get underneath it unless you are cut really short. Basically, just get into every conceivable part of your toenail that you can reach (IMPORTANT: DO NOT GET IT ON THE BOTTOM PART OF YOUR TOE, JUST THE TOENAIL ITSELF AND THE TOP PART OF THE TOE THAT TOUCHES THE TOENAIL. YOU WILL SEE WHY IN THE NEXT STEP). So basically what you&#x27;re doing is trying to rub ointment INTO a hard surface but it&#x27;s an oil-based product so it&#x27;s not going to absorb into a toenail quickly. So if all that rubbing is not really going to make it absorb, why bother? Well, eventually it WILL absorb and that&#x27;s the point...the rubbing you do now will give it a head start. Anyway, as I said, despite all your best rubbing it did not absorb into your hard toenail so you should be left with a thin layer of the stuff on your toenail. If you DO NOT have a thin layer of the stuff on your toenail after the rub then you dabbed on too little. If you have a thick glob, then you dabbed on too much. No big deal, just make the proper adjustments next time. For now, finish the rest of the toenails if any (rub, jam, and push), then move on to the next step.&lt;br /&gt;*STEP SIX: Get a box of the cheapest Band-Aids--sorry, \\&quot;adhesive bandages\\&quot;--you can find that actually stick (I like the fabric ones). You are going to put the little gauze part over your toenail and wrap the adhesive part to stick under the bottom of your toe (now you know why I said not to get any ointment on the bottom of your toe; if it&#x27;s wet from the ointment or shower moisture the band-aid won&#x27;t stick). If you&#x27;re a woman with cute little toes (fungus notwithstanding) get little Band-Aids. If you&#x27;re a dude with big fat honkin&#x27; toes, get big ones. Just use your heads people. And be sure to get enough since you will be putting on a fresh bandage twice per day TIMES the number of toenails you are healing TIMES at least 30 days. So of you have one bad toenail that clears up in a month, you still need 60 bandages (one toe, x 2 daily bandages x 30 days). If you have some thick, yellow nails that look like claws and will take a long time to cure, well...buy in bulk. But keep in mind, even with Band-Aid costs, this method will always come out cheaper than all the other solutions.&lt;br /&gt;*FINAL STEP: If you don&#x27;t have to leave the house, great, keep the flip flops on. But if you have to go to work or wherever, put on CLEAN socks on and CLEAN shoes. If you think your shoes or sneakers may have fungus, use antifungal powder in them, or wash them with a little bleach added to the water (not directly on the sneakers or they will stain), or get a new pair, or whatever. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to try and kill a fungus on your toenail and then wrap them in a fungus-riddled shoe. Use common sense: UNTIL YOU GET RID OF THE FUNGUS FOLLOW THESE RULES: 1) never put socks on again after you have taken them off (I know it&#x27;s tempting when you wake up in the morning to walk the dog to just throw on the pair you had last night but DON&#x27;T DO IT) 2) NEVER wear shoes/sneakers without socks (sandals or flip-flops are okay if your toes are exposed to the air and not trapped in little fungus ovens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it people, PREPARE TO BE AMAZED. Eventually what will happen is that when the fungus is dead or in remission, the new nail that is growing from the base of your toe willbe opaque with a healthy pink underneath while the thick, yellow, crusty nail will grow further out and out (keep clipping it and saying good riddance and keep applying ointment even though fungus appears to be dead). And when your nails finally look good enough to go to beach again, send me a pic of you in a bikini--unless you&#x27;re a guy, in which case just send me the money I saved you on Piggy Poo&#x27;s or whatever it&#x27;s called. I&#x27;m kidding, I&#x27;m kidding!!! Keep the bikini pics and your cash, you don&#x27;t even have to send me thanks. I&#x27;m just happy if this helps someone out there the way it helped me. And if it DOES help you, pass along the secret. This world has too many skanky feet so let&#x27;s all do something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final word of advice: STERILIZE YOUR STUFF. Even though fungus probably won&#x27;t live on a hard, dry, inorganic surface like a nail file or nail clippers, BE SURE TO STERILIZE YOUR NAIL CLIPPERS AFTER CLIPPING AND KEEP YOUR \\&quot;FUNGUS FILE\\&quot; SEPARATE FROM YOUR NORMAL NAIL FILE. Soak your clippers in some alcohol for a minute, then dry thoroughly. You don&#x27;t want to pass the fungus along to the family, or transmit it to your fingernails. And have a special nail file dedicated only to the fungus toes. In other words, if you have great fingernails and skanky toenails, don&#x27;t use the same file on each or...well, you can guess what might happen. Mark your \\&quot;fungus file\\&quot; and \\&quot;fungus buffer\\&quot; so that you know not to use them on your uninfected fingernails or uninfected toenails. Again...it&#x27;s unlikely a fungus will live on a file which is not moist and not organic but, files are cheap so buy two and be safe instead of sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final, Final word of advice: I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone (other than infants) having a sensitivity to Vicks Vaporub (and I would certainly not recommend this remedy for kids--I don&#x27;t even know if they get toenail fungus), but only you and your doc know your medical history so if there&#x27;s something there that you or he/she thinks might prohibit you from this treatment, it&#x27;s best to find out. And of course, if something unexpected happens that you think may require medical attention, get it. My friend had a fungal nail and I told her to do this. It was her little pinky toe. Instead of the nail continuing to grow and the healthy part pushing out the fungal part, hers just FELL OFF after a month or so. She has small toes and her pinky toe is supertiny so the exposed nailbed was not bothersome. She just kept it under a bandage until the new (and healthy) nail grew in. She was AMAZED and HAPPY. But the point of that story is that things happen. So talk to a doc before and (if something unexpected happens) during the process. The goal here is health, but a nailbed exposed to the world could be a lot more dangerous than an ungly fungus nail. So be clean and enjoy your new set of feet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[UPDATE 1/30/14] Wrote this review over a year ago and I have received a lot of great feedback from others, many of whom have had positive results.

            <li> Well, it did nothing to solve the problem.  Soaking in white vinegar and/or using Vicks works better.</li>
            <li> I used on my thumbs as it was recommended by my dermatologist. I followed directions religiously and it worked!</li>
            <li> this stuff is slow to work</li>
            <li> this is a bit cumbersome to use (it&#x27;s really important to cover the toe with a band-aid after application of the gel), but after a week or so it&#x27;s possible to see that the infected tissue peels away and can be removed.  it will take many weeks until the healthy nail has grown out but i can already see the beginnings of healty tissue and a healthy nail.  this is the first time that anything at all has helped.  great stuff!</li>
            <li> I tried this but for my toe nail fungus it really didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of the nail fungus.</li>
            <li> I gave this product one star because of the way the label can be very misleading.  This stuff isn&#x27;t all that inexpensive, so when you see that it&#x27;s a 3 month supply that makes the price seem a little better.  But if you look at the fine print just below where it says \\&quot;3 month supply\\&quot;, it states \\&quot;for one toe\\&quot;.  So if you have 4 toes infected and you want to treat them for at least 3 months (and that would be a minimum to maybe \\&quot;see\\&quot; results, this product will actually cost you four times as much.  As usual, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> My pharmacist recommended this.  It is applyed daily and covered with a bandaid.  It cured the problem in six weeks.  It is twenty dollars less however at a Walgreens Pharmacy.  The price here is outrageous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Paul&#x27;s Piggy Paste for 11 mos. with very good results.  Toenails can grow s-l-o-w-l-y, so it&#x27;s important to be patient and use this product long term.  My big toenail was completely infected with fungus for over 10 years and it is now about 90% gone, with just the end of the nail still slightly yellow.  At first, I had problems with skin irritation around the nail. The paste is strong, in order to penetrate the nail.  I found that applying Carmex with a Q-tip to the skin, before applying the paste &amp; bandage, decreased the irritation significantly. The skin would still slough off, but there was little to no discomfort.  I really noticed an improvement in the new nail growth after about 5 mos. and decided to continue the treatment diligently for however long it would take.  It has certainly paid off.  I expect to declare victory in the next few months and finally end the treatment.[[ASIN:B0073WOJUU Dr. Paul&#x27;s Gel, Piggy Paste 0.8 oz (24 g)]]</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I struggled to get rid of a fungal infection of big toe for 5 years using a variety of products.  Piggy Paste did the trick.  You must be diligent in application.  I put a large drop on toenail and spread it over the entire nail especially on the base.  I then covered with a bandaid and left on overnight.  It took about 3 to 4 months for the nail to grow out clean of fungal infection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Doctor had me take pills for for a fungis no results&lt;br /&gt;recommended piggy paste and my toes are so much better</li>
            <li> We gave piggy paste 4 months trial, following the directions carefully, and did not notice any change in the toenail. I am happy it worked for others but it did not work for us.</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this for a month and says it&#x27;s working better than anything else he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find. Glad I found it on here. My husband&#x27;s dr told him it&#x27;s the best and has never failed. So far so good. Still have 6 weeks left to use it.</li>
            <li> it works. but you have to be strict in using it!</li>
            <li> this is a great product..i find it easy to use. i did not have any issues or side effects. thanks</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. I&#x27;ve used this product before and was amazed at the price difference that was on-line!&lt;br /&gt;Since I can&#x27;t tolerate medicines taken by mouth this product helps me keep my problem in check.</li>
            <li> I was excited because of the reviews.  However, when I received it and read the directions--that were NOT in the online explaination--I see I am required to put a bandaid on each toe every day for at least 30 days.  What a  bother and what an expense!.  I hope I can send it back since I haven&#x27;t opened it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement with this product</li>
