            <li>love the color and it works for me :)</li>
            <li>but I got it fixed so its all good!</li>
            <li>great color, remember to heat your alternative hair color for vibrant shades</li>
            <li>The color is a very bright yellow that mixes well with Splat&#x27;s orange to make a mango.  </li>
            <li>(most light colors don&#x27;t)  </li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping,</li>
            <li>Makes an awesome green that doesn&#x27;t look lime.</li>
            <li>So much fun!</li>
            <li>The fact it glows under a black light it pretty awesome too.</li>
            <li>Glows under black light as it says, very accurate, i have always loved manic panic dyes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still super bright and yellow.</li>
            <li>Ordered this online and now with the primary colors can make any color she wants!</li>
            <li>;) love this yellow:)</li>
            <li>Maybe this is my own fault, but I was going for more of a natural golden yellow look.</li>
            <li>The best part is that the yellow really lasts a long time before it starts to fade out.  </li>
            <li>amazing color, but comes out alittle green, to get a good yellow i mix in a little orange to soften the greener tones and it works great</li>
            <li>this comes out SOOOO bright, a perfect yellow, not pale, not sickeningly bright, but like sunshine yellow :)</li>
            <li>It also adds a kind of gold sheen to darker than blonde hair, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth very penny.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair this color after bleaching it first and it turned out just as described.</li>
            <li>it is obviously more yellow.</li>
            <li>but when I washed it for the first time I could see a lot of it washed out.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>If yellow is what you want, then this would be 5 stars :)</li>
            <li>I once dyed my hair using the Electric Lava color and it faded in such a way that it was orange at the roots still, but bright yellow at the tips, making my hair look like fire.</li>
            <li>Bleached my hair to a pretty light yellow.</li>
            <li>Which was fine for us, but if you really want a banana yellow, I would pass on this one.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels much thicker and healthier.  </li>
            <li>It seems ups does not believe in handling packages very well</li>
            <li>Color was a neon yellow and super vibrant</li>
            <li>Although, most people mistook the color as full-blown green...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a neon yellow, super vibrant and so far I&#x27;ve had it on my hair for.....</li>
            <li>this color must be used on hair that is bleached very light, if you have too much orange in your hair, you&#x27;ll get a sunrise orangey yellow but still yellow color, if that&#x27;s what you want go for it, otherwise blonde/yellow bleached hair (or in rare cases if your natural blonde you can just wash with claryfying shampoo or Dish soap before using it and it will stick the same)</li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t do your research, this product is an astounding color of yellow, with a green tint.</li>
            <li>It actually made my hair look green in some lighting because of how bright yellow it was.</li>
            <li>but instead it only died certain parts of my hair</li>
            <li>Not  the color in photo, very tennis ball yellow.</li>
            <li>so I should&#x27;ve gotten the hint that it will not look natural.</li>
            <li>so I went as far as buying it online....</li>
            <li>like Lady Gaga in the Telephone period ;) an amazingly bright color, if you want to go yellow GO YELLOW ALSO: if you are doing Rainbow hair, don&#x27;t buy Purple Orange or Green, just buy the Pillarbox Red, Shocking Blue, and this Electric Banana and make Orange Green and Purple by mixing, its the best way to get the proper shades, and purple made with these two lasts much longer than most purples in the manic panic book, and it won&#x27;t fade to indigo blue or anything.</li>
            <li>eh is okay not great not a fan</li>

            <li> The yellow, if used on unbleached hair (mine is colored, I&#x27;m slowly going lighter from very dark) is very natural looking and won&#x27;t make a huge mess everywhere like the darker colors of manic panic.  </li>
            <li> My only recommendation is to wear slightly darker colors</li>
            <li> Only gave my hair a green tint ........</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll save about $30 not buying those three other colors</li>
            <li> Some people are just really color blind.</li>
            <li> a little over a month</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a hair dye, then look no more.</li>
            <li> I tried to dye my hair using this yellow to get that fire look immediately, but within a couple days it faded to a weird green and looked terrible with the orange.</li>
            <li> A waste of money :(</li>

            <li> I actually use this as sort of a deep conditioner for my hair.  The yellow, if used on unbleached hair (mine is colored, I&#x27;m slowly going lighter from very dark) is very natural looking and won&#x27;t make a huge mess everywhere like the darker colors of manic panic.  I leave it on for hours or overnight and wash out and my hair feels much thicker and healthier.  It also adds a kind of gold sheen to darker than blonde hair, which I really like.  My only recommendation is to wear slightly darker colors so you don&#x27;t end up with yellow splotches on your clothes after washing it out.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a hair dye, then look no more. This product is worth very penny.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping,</li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t do your research, this product is an astounding color of yellow, with a green tint. I dyed my hair this color after bleaching it first and it turned out just as described. Although, most people mistook the color as full-blown green... it is obviously more yellow. Some people are just really color blind. But, if this color strikes your interest, buy it!! I&#x27;d say it is the best brand.</li>
            <li> Very, VERY yellow. Glows under black light as it says, very accurate, i have always loved manic panic dyes.</li>
            <li> Not  the color in photo, very tennis ball yellow.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair, and like to do the hair around my face neon colors to brighten. I took a shot on this thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to show up in my hair. (most light colors don&#x27;t)  this was perfect. It showed up neon and stayed in for months.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves all the manic panics and loves to mix them too when she feels like it to great effect very vibrant colors and cheaper then beauty supply shops excluding the shipping of course</li>
            <li> The product says its a semi permanent color but my experience was that the color didn&#x27;t last even 1 wash! A waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I once dyed my hair using the Electric Lava color and it faded in such a way that it was orange at the roots still, but bright yellow at the tips, making my hair look like fire. I tried to dye my hair using this yellow to get that fire look immediately, but within a couple days it faded to a weird green and looked terrible with the orange.</li>
            <li> did not stay in hair at all</li>
            <li> Dyed my hair rainbow about a month ago and electric banana is still bright as ever! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Bleached my hair to a pretty light yellow. Color was a neon yellow and super vibrant but when I washed it for the first time I could see a lot of it washed out.</li>
            <li> This creates the brightest yellow hair I have ever seen! So much fun! The best part is that the yellow really lasts a long time before it starts to fade out.  I put up a review with the hair style and pics of the color here: http://sugarskulllife.com/inspiration/manic-panics-electric-banana-turns-her-bangs-into-sunbeams</li>
            <li> this color must be used on hair that is bleached very light, if you have too much orange in your hair, you&#x27;ll get a sunrise orangey yellow but still yellow color, if that&#x27;s what you want go for it, otherwise blonde/yellow bleached hair (or in rare cases if your natural blonde you can just wash with claryfying shampoo or Dish soap before using it and it will stick the same) this comes out SOOOO bright, a perfect yellow, not pale, not sickeningly bright, but like sunshine yellow :) like Lady Gaga in the Telephone period ;) an amazingly bright color, if you want to go yellow GO YELLOW ALSO: if you are doing Rainbow hair, don&#x27;t buy Purple Orange or Green, just buy the Pillarbox Red, Shocking Blue, and this Electric Banana and make Orange Green and Purple by mixing, its the best way to get the proper shades, and purple made with these two lasts much longer than most purples in the manic panic book, and it won&#x27;t fade to indigo blue or anything. ;) and you&#x27;ll save about $30 not buying those three other colors ;) good luck ;) love this yellow:)</li>
            <li> great color, remember to heat your alternative hair color for vibrant shades</li>
            <li> amazing color, but comes out alittle green, to get a good yellow i mix in a little orange to soften the greener tones and it works great</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s a neon yellow, super vibrant and so far I&#x27;ve had it on my hair for..... a little over a month and it&#x27;s still super bright and yellow. The fact it glows under a black light it pretty awesome too.</li>
            <li> Used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair, and it turned out really, really bright. It looks like we colored her hair with a highlighter! Which was fine for us, but if you really want a banana yellow, I would pass on this one.</li>
            <li> eh is okay not great not a fan</li>
            <li> Only gave my hair a green tint ........ I wanted streaks but instead it only died certain parts of my hair greenish/yellow</li>
            <li> The color is a very bright yellow that mixes well with Splat&#x27;s orange to make a mango.  Or is stunning by itself!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is my own fault, but I was going for more of a natural golden yellow look. This gave me highlighter color. But then again, the name of it is ELECTRIC BANANA so I should&#x27;ve gotten the hint that it will not look natural. It actually made my hair look green in some lighting because of how bright yellow it was. If you want YELLOW hair, this is for you. This ruined my natural-looking ombre but I got it fixed so its all good! It just depends on what you&#x27;re going for. If yellow is what you want, then this would be 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> Product came in a box properly packed with bubble wrap, but it was open and there was dye all over the box! I am unsure whether this was the sellers fault or just ups. It seems ups does not believe in handling packages very well</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this color to add to the rainbow affect so she loves it it came in a timely manner so if you have a child that is into coloring hair this does come out looking yellow.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t purchase this color in stores anymore! Awesome find! I mix this with 1/2 part electric banana, and 3/4 part blue. Makes an awesome green that doesn&#x27;t look lime. Amazed that I found it!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t sell this in stores anymore so I went as far as buying it online....love the color and it works for me :)</li>
            <li> Manic Panic are always the best!</li>
            <li> Good deal. Fyi hair needs to be very light for colored hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves to color her hair. She wanted to make a rainbow. She found red and blue locally but couldn&#x27;e find yellow. Ordered this online and now with the primary colors can make any color she wants!</li>
            <li> Awesome color love it</li>
