            <li>Any of these products are great.</li>
            <li>The smells are great.</li>
            <li>Great body wash.</li>
            <li>The body wash has a very nice aroma, it had great lather.</li>
            <li>:o)  </li>
            <li>It has the best smell- leaves my skin smelling like gummy bears, and who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like sweet candy?!</li>
            <li>It has a good lather though.</li>
            <li>and this is a good one.</li>
            <li>The rich consistency of this product is incredible.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash!</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love aveeno products because they are made with soy and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked every Aveeno product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good for a two-bottle package and the product itself is in good condition.</li>
            <li>Very nice body wash; smells like fresh peaches and ice cream to me</li>
            <li>It is just this soft, delicious, gorgeous smell of yummy golden peaches wafting through your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Always have been a big fan of aveeno products, this one has a nice pleasant summery smell and works really good too.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this body wash.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to purchase it, since I&#x27;m not a fan of ginger, but this is more peach than ginger</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>Would love it if Aveeno also did a body lotion or cream with this scent; it is uplifting on a dreary morning.  </li>
            <li>Glad than Amazon ships this to Mexico</li>
            <li>Great on dry skin, but not as good as the fig/shea scent.</li>
            <li>They are either too cloyingly sweet or too off the mark to be believable as a peach scent.     </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>A favorite....clean light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve seen this sold for $8+ in the stores, so getting 2 for $14 on Amazon (with Free Super Saver Shipping &amp; another qualified item) is a bit of a savings.</li>
            <li>My daughter LOVES this product and asks me to special order it when she runs out.  </li>
            <li>Fresh light peach scent.</li>
            <li>Pretty floral, but not to strong scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the lather, the scent took me a while to adjust to, but it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is loaded with antioxidants and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I also received body lotion in my stocking, so it took my skin&#x27;s softness to a higher level!  </li>
            <li>This soap leaves my skin feeling refreshed and pretty well moisturized!</li>
            <li>It is a creamy white liquid that feels incredibly silky as you shower and afterwards, you&#x27;re left with smooth silky skin that is hydrated and not tight or dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First of all, white peach and ginger are a great combination that smells terrific!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I had tried their body wash.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Aveeno body wash.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for lots of long lasting suds when used with a body puff sponge/scrubby, but you will find yourself needing to use more if used with a washcloth, and you will go through it very quickly if you don&#x27;t use anything (ie: except your hand).</li>
            <li>This is pure luxury...more peach than ginger, as noted by another reviewer.  </li>
            <li>It wakes up your senses and leaves you feeling ready to start the day......</li>
            <li>Thanks again for sending the peach body wash to me.</li>
            <li>The scent lingers in the bathroom but not so much on the skin which is a plus for some.  </li>
            <li>I have used Aveeno - Not exclusively but more than any other brand.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite body wash out there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Wash, then you&#x27;ll find the texture to be a bit thinner and white.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry area and my skin always looks better with a separate moisturizer on those especially dry days, anyway.</li>
            <li>This white peach &amp; ginger combo is pleasing, not irritating.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is barely noticeable and after I get out of the shower you cannot smell it at all on my skin.</li>
            <li>I particularly love the Positively Nourishing line, since at times I&#x27;ve found other Aveeno products to be a little heavy.</li>
            <li>This is a lighter product, but it does not dry my skin.</li>
            <li>I find it has a neutral effect on my skin, it does not dry it out or make it itch like some gels do.</li>

            <li> Always have been a big fan of aveeno products, this one has a nice pleasant summery smell and works really good too.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has a terrific line of body and bath products. This was the first time I had tried their body wash. First of all, white peach and ginger are a great combination that smells terrific! The rich consistency of this product is incredible. It is loaded with antioxidants and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean and healthy. It wakes up your senses and leaves you feeling ready to start the day......Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this body wash. The price is pretty good for a two-bottle package and the product itself is in good condition.</li>
            <li> Usually peach-scented products don&#x27;t make the grade. They are either too cloyingly sweet or too off the mark to be believable as a peach scent.     This white peach &amp; ginger combo is pleasing, not irritating. If you enjoy Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Wash, then you&#x27;ll find the texture to be a bit thinner and white. It has a good lather though. Yet you can still multi-task and use it as a shaving cream.     I took a risk in buying two of these. It paid off and I&#x27;d do it again. I think I&#x27;ve seen this sold for $8+ in the stores, so getting 2 for $14 on Amazon (with Free Super Saver Shipping &amp; another qualified item) is a bit of a savings.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out after eyeing it for some time now.  Holy cow, Batman!  Who knew that heaven could come in a bottle?  This is pure luxury...more peach than ginger, as noted by another reviewer.  The scent is not overwhelming at all.  It is just this soft, delicious, gorgeous smell of yummy golden peaches wafting through your bathroom.  Your skin will thank you as it drinks in this hydrating body wash.  I am, unfortunately, cursed with very sensitive skin and my skin was not irritated at all.  You get plenty of bang for your buck as a little goes a long way...all you need is a tiny drop on your shower poof.  It is a creamy white liquid that feels incredibly silky as you shower and afterwards, you&#x27;re left with smooth silky skin that is hydrated and not tight or dry.&lt;br /&gt;I almost want to share this stuff with my husband...&amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; being the key word here.  Another body wash in this line that I&#x27;d like to try is the fig and shea butter, or even the lavender one.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is barely noticeable and after I get out of the shower you cannot smell it at all on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveeno - Not exclusively but more than any other brand.  I ordered Philosophy from QVC and was very disappointed.  Aveeno is a lot less money and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo.  I like to mix the brands and this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for sending the peach body wash to me. I love aveeno products because they are made with soy and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The body wash has a very nice aroma, it had great lather. But it left my skin too dry! No moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> A favorite....clean light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in the Aveeno products. I particularly love the Positively Nourishing line, since at times I&#x27;ve found other Aveeno products to be a little heavy. This is a lighter product, but it does not dry my skin. This fragrance is my favorite. I hesitated to purchase it, since I&#x27;m not a fan of ginger, but this is more peach than ginger and it&#x27;s lovely. I like all the fragrances in the line, but this one stands out. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Aveeno body wash.  I&#x27;ve used the face cleanser for a couple of years, now; so when I received the body wash as a stocking stuffer this Christmas, I was looking forward to using it.  I love the lather, the scent took me a while to adjust to, but it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  The only places that had a bit of dryness were the areas that are usually dry on me, but even they weren&#x27;t as dry.  I also received body lotion in my stocking, so it took my skin&#x27;s softness to a higher level!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash! It is a little expensive but I can&#x27;t find it any where around my town not even at the \\&quot;big W\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Very nice body wash; smells like fresh peaches and ice cream to me :o)  I find it has a neutral effect on my skin, it does not dry it out or make it itch like some gels do. The scent lingers in the bathroom but not so much on the skin which is a plus for some.  Would love it if Aveeno also did a body lotion or cream with this scent; it is uplifting on a dreary morning.  My husband also likes this wash so ... win win!  Glad than Amazon ships this to Mexico because even though we can find Aveeno here, the selection is limited to a few facial products.</li>
            <li> Any of these products are great. It keeps your skin from drying out. The smells are great. Very little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES this product and asks me to special order it when she runs out.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fresh light peach scent. Great body wash. Great on dry skin, but not as good as the fig/shea scent. You don&#x27;t need much for lots of long lasting suds when used with a body puff sponge/scrubby, but you will find yourself needing to use more if used with a washcloth, and you will go through it very quickly if you don&#x27;t use anything (ie: except your hand).</li>
            <li> Same price as when this product is on sale at our local Target.  Pretty floral, but not to strong scent.  I&#x27;ve liked every Aveeno product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite body wash out there. It has the best smell- leaves my skin smelling like gummy bears, and who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like sweet candy?! This soap leaves my skin feeling refreshed and pretty well moisturized! It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like some soaps do, but if it&#x27;s really dry out you&#x27;ll still need some lotion. I have absolutely no complaints with that though! I live in a very dry area and my skin always looks better with a separate moisturizer on those especially dry days, anyway.</li>
