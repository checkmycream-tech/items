    <ol>
            <li> makes your hands so smooth</li>
            <li> This scrub has mineral oil, a petroleum by product, not all natural. I avoid all petroleum by products whenever I can. Had to throw it out because I read the label after using it a few times. They should provide all the ingredients on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scrub, although I&#x27;ve only used it once, is exactly what I wanted it to be. It smells good, feels like it gets all the dead skin off, but leaves your skin moistened and not dehydrated like normal soap. You may feel a tad oily at first but it doesn&#x27;t last. I don&#x27;t think I even need to wear lotion when I use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and how it moistures my skin! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again as the price is a bit higher than most exfoliates, but I am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily. Works very well and is great for feet. The scent is light enough for men and women.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I love the vanilla aroma and the oil makes my skin very soft.  This is a product that i will buy again.</li>
            <li> well , the reason I gave this product three stars only is that it does not scrub the way I expect it . However, it has very beautiful scent and keep the body soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more when needed.  I love the way it makes my feet and legs feel.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week in the shower. It really helps keep my feet soft. The scent is very pleasant and I would recommend it anyone who enjoys scrubs.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SOOOO SOFT AND IT SMELLS GREAT.... I FIND THAT I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO SLATHER ALL KINDS OF CREAM ON ME AFTER I USE THIS</li>
            <li> This product is amazing with anyone who has eczema. My toddler was scratching and making himself bleed. With this product it cleared up most of his rashes and leaves his skin amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I just love this product your skin feels so smooth and moisturized. Some scrubs use a gel which leaves your skin looking dull but this scrub uses oil which leaves your skin shiny. In addition, Salt scrubs tend to leave skin smoother than sugar scrubs because sugar is more gentle. Also stay clear of the scrubs with unnatural colors like blue and purple they don&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> Salt scrubs can be very coarse, so that you actually can&#x27;t use them very actively.  This scrub has very nice fine Dead Sea salt crystals that almost feel like a sugar scrub.  The oils of the scrub are also very nice-- lots of sweet almond oil and  olive oil.  The scent is nice, not overpowering.  As another reviewer remarked, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot for excellent results.  And at less than half the price for other scrubs I&#x27;ve not been happy with!</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and this helps keep my skin from being so dry and itchy after showering. It seems to last almost the whole day without me needing to add moisturizer. I can&#x27;t ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did have a mild allergic reaction (skin irritation) after my first use. If don&#x27;t use it for days/weeks and start using it again I get a mild reaction. I developed hives for a few hours the first time. The subsequent effects were milder each time. This effect goes away entirely with continued use.</li>
            <li> It may be a good product, but the one that I received smelled like the oil in it had gone rancid so I returned it.  I did not want to chance buyj</li>
            <li> Hey great product .i love it</li>
            <li> The salt scrub is a very good product and works well on my dry skin. A little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes your skin so soft and smooth and the scent is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but leaves the shower oily</li>
