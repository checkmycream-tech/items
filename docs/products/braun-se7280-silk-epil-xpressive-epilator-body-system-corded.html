            <li>This is not for someone happy with shaving.  </li>

            <li>All in all, a great product.</li>
            <li>The service and price were  great.  </li>
            <li>HOW GREAT YOUR SKIN IS--</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and it feels great to not have to shave every day.</li>
            <li>Handy dandy plucking is so great!</li>
            <li>I also brave it and use the highest speed - it&#x27;s quicker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I just finished my 4th time and the pain is now manageable.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this epilator-</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I waned to post a review immediately for both items.</li>
            <li>My wife found it great.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I was happily stunned.   </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how happy I am now, after months and months of trying to epilate in vain with the panasonic model.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Works really great.</li>
            <li>The package also includes some Soothing Wipes which are great.</li>
            <li>Braun is a great brand.</li>
            <li>but if it does what it says I&#x27;ll love it !!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Again, a MUCH better experience than waxing!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very comfortable, looks awesome!!!</li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!!!!</li>
            <li>Well, let me start off by saying this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Again, I would still say a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Though, having used it now, I can tell you that adding the light is the best idea ever!</li>
            <li>THis is a good epilator no doubt...</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the pain its good going from then.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Emjoi, but that doesn not work 1/2 as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Good product, except for the noise it makes.</li>
            <li>I had a good amount of stubble on my legs, but I took my time over a couple of hours and went to work.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it - although it hurts a lot until get used.</li>
            <li>I tried than to find another one,of course I return on my beloved Brown and I trusted on reviews this time...</li>
            <li>But once she used it, she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Over all, I&#x27;m really pleased with it! :o)</li>
            <li>The Braun SE7280 is like going from a hotel to a full service resort!!!   </li>
            <li>Better that he thinks I&#x27;m a magical creature who is naturally flawless.    </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance...</li>
            <li>This might improve as I become more experienced with this gizmo and my skin gets used to epilation.</li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with it,</li>
            <li>Am very pleased</li>
            <li>The shaver didn&#x27;t work for me either - It seemed to be working great, and I loved the light.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>You will love this product!</li>
            <li>Have found that using it after soaking in a hot tub is best.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product!   </li>
            <li>I was determined to stick with it for a month or two, but after 3 weeks, despite doing exfoliation, on top of stubble and bumps, I realized I had a gazillion ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and is hassle free.  </li>
            <li>Amazing item..</li>
            <li>I also think one of their newer models looks amazing: the Braun Silk-epil 9 Skin Spa.</li>
            <li>So that is nice.</li>
            <li>So that is nice.</li>
            <li>though it was nice</li>
            <li>I liked the speed too, though when doing my research</li>
            <li>This is so nice</li>
            <li>Also the shaver hear is nice for when I forgot to do it the night before and still need to get rid of the leg hair.  </li>
            <li>However, Amazon had it priced much lower which made it a great deal!</li>
            <li>product has a nice girly design</li>
            <li>HONEST TRUTH:  </li>
            <li>In fact, I ended up just loving the shaver part.</li>
            <li>Nice Performance.</li>
            <li>I would nightly have to sit in a warm bath, then scrub my legs with a washcloth to loosen the hairs.</li>
            <li>I did not even do it after a warm shower or pain reliever or alcohol or the olay wipes provided.  </li>
            <li>Whatever model you select in Braun it has got its own way of satisfaction.    </li>
            <li>it was timely and so apt.</li>
            <li>best if you buy things straight from the store.</li>
            <li>No amount of advertising could have convinced me to buy this, I have to thank the reviewers here at Amazon for the details and honest insight.</li>
            <li>And, it was not as effective as i had hoped.</li>
            <li>But nevertheless, I am THRILLED about this.  </li>
            <li>after I bought this for her, she did not quite liked my idea in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Massage system is not that effective.</li>
            <li>It makes all the hair easy to see, even if your light in the bathroom is not as good!</li>
            <li>In fact, it is very easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>and takes out even the tiniest and thinnest of hair, leaving you with perfect smooth skin that you can show off right away (without having to wait for the redness to go away like with waxing).</li>
            <li>If you wax this will be a nice refreshing change.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best epilator I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best epilator I have ever used</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and am very happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>That is until I discovered how easy and painless this is!  </li>
            <li>And I am especially impressed that the area that caused me the most initial discomfort (arm pits) is the one I am most pleased about!</li>
            <li>The wipes make your skin very smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pretty bright and nice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this epitator.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s corded (more power).</li>
            <li>But, I was able to make it to one appointment.</li>
            <li>, I had so many ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li>So I shaved the day before, and the next day, after a shower (best time to do it)</li>
            <li>I suffered through and when I was done, was glad I did it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>I have been using epilators for more than 15 years now.</li>
            <li>it requires a lot more planning since batteries need to be charges ahead of time.</li>
            <li>And...unfortunately.. not that many shops had it available.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of more days to re-place the order with another vendor</li>
            <li>(this time the product was $50 more than the one that proved out of stock).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it and</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone that wants to achieve a great result and likes the comfort of using an epilator whenever -without thinking about charging ahead.</li>
            <li>Not quite what I imagined - I thought I would be able to deal with the pain that I read about</li>
            <li>The pain fades more with each use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Be sure to pull your skin taut</li>
            <li>so it works more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.    </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing from what I can tell, and I had a highly experienced waxer at the salon I went to.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase more of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time I got to the shin area I was used to the pain and was able to finish without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I think the longer hair created more pulling.  </li>
            <li>/catch most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really do love this epilator and prefer it over all to shaving.</li>
            <li>thats for darn sure]).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SURE many if not ALL will work for you.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed my face most of my post pubescent life.</li>
            <li>And when I tell you it was as (AND STILL IS AFTER 1 WEEK) smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt-believe it!   </li>
            <li>Now I have more of a reason to NEVER shave again.</li>
            <li>But, it doesn&#x27;t matter, I still love it.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more affordable solution than salon waxing, this is for sure the way to go.    </li>
            <li>and I do not have to use it weekly any more.</li>
            <li>For me, turning my head and watching makes it more tolerable than watching it the mirror.</li>
            <li>Thinking maybe i need to exfoliate more, before and after epilating.</li>
            <li>After reading the many reviews, I settled on this model and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to wash yourself after to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>This one is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews, rating and every time the rating and reviews have voted for one product as \\&quot;The Best\\&quot;, and that is undoubtedly \\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with Amazon delivery services..</li>
            <li>I also found that if I change the direction of the epilator, I get better results.</li>
            <li>However i have to warn you that although i was accustomed to waxing my legs, using the epilator hurt more than waxing</li>
            <li>but i kept on using it and am getting more accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews over Braun epilators.</li>
            <li>I have not heard of a better brand.     </li>
            <li>it a try :)</li>
            <li>.It works much better with that part off</li>
            <li>I will be shopping for a better one soon.</li>
            <li>OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   </li>
            <li>In all my years (and there are getting to be distressingly many of them)</li>
            <li>Decided to take a chance and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>why isn&#x27;t it advertized better</li>
            <li>so more women can know about it?  </li>
            <li>It tends to add up, but I have been ok with paying someone else to take care of my business...</li>
            <li>I got most of the hairs and decided to give it a rest.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoyed my review please say so.</li>
            <li>Each worked better than the one before.</li>
            <li>The best way to compare this product is to say it is similar to the difference between skin that has been shaved with a razor vs. skin that has been shaved with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I just had to order some more from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li>My pits are still soooooo smooth!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>In a very short time, this one epilates and shaves perfectly, without leaving any hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this newer version, and I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I would say that it is much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>After I adjusted my method, the product removed most of the hair in one stroke.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd epilator and it is the best.</li>
            <li>Love my Braun epilator.</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hair (I sometimes miss the finer ones but the light helps a lot), legs stay smooth for a good while and the head can be rinsed under water.</li>
            <li>After a good night&#x27;s sleep, I felt brave enough to try it again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with the results of my face and arms that I really want to move onto my legs and underarms</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to do my legs, arms and underarms that way.    </li>
            <li>That means more area is covered at once -</li>
            <li>Epilators are ultimately better than waxing and shaving.</li>
            <li>It is better for your skin health, promotes smoother skin without the damage of waxing.</li>
            <li>The blades are placed in a slightly concave configuration, which is great for legs, and not so great for pits and bikini line.    </li>
            <li>The light is a great feature, it really helps to see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li>I find it super effective.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about this, is that I imagine that I can have smooth skin for longer periods of time compared to shaving.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and the cord is nice (no batteries needed)    </li>
            <li>It is not completely painless, I&#x27;ll be honest, but once you get used to it, it does the job beautifully.    </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of picking up the hairs, even when I move it in all different directions.</li>
            <li>Love the light..</li>
            <li>The light is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love that it includes a light, a shaver, a trimmer, and</li>
            <li>This  newer one is more comfortable to use even.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy with it that I convinced my 16 year old daughter to try it.</li>
            <li>I love the light in the front.</li>
            <li>Since this model that I&#x27;m reviewing is 3 years old, I am looking into getting a newer model that has some great updated features.</li>
            <li>My face (includes my neck) is really the key thing that I focus on, the rest of my body is just a great, great bonus for me.</li>
            <li>Again, I would still say a good purchase.any real growth for a while.</li>
            <li>It looked practical, sounded reasonable and the reviews were good -</li>
            <li>I wish I was one of those people singing the praises of the epilator, but absolutely nothing good came out of my 3 week experiment with it.  </li>
            <li>In general pain level was very mild, mostly a pinch and a pull, unfortunately I experienced no tickling.</li>
            <li>Also I have to do it more often than most because my hair grows quite quickly.</li>
            <li>The smart light is a great help in low light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I used it first time last night and was more than impressed.  </li>
            <li>I did not have to repeatedly go over areas to remove hair, and the pivoting head allowed me to easily navigate with no pulling.</li>
            <li>The legs are not as easy to rid of hair.  </li>
            <li>and i know its not goin to be easy...</li>
            <li>Face-2 (seriously, easy as pie)  </li>
            <li>Easy to travel.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy.    </li>
            <li>It even travels easily.  </li>
            <li>This product is far superior with better technology and results that amaze me every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I am happy with how this Braun SE7280 model has performed and I trust the brand in general.</li>
            <li>They have a 5 o clock shadow all their own to be exact.</li>
            <li>[my caps] item and the cord is for charging purposes and works fine and fits the item and charges well.  </li>
            <li>but everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about trying it on my underarms, but it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>had it sence xmas of 2011 still working fine recomended it to all the ladys in my fam.</li>
            <li>Just a quick stroke of this terror and they were gone, finito, hasta la vista baby!   </li>
            <li>it is fast and a lot more efficient!  </li>
            <li>had (still have) huge concerns about the battery operated versions as 1.</li>
            <li>I found pressing on the area with my free hand greatly helped (learned this at my local salon).  </li>
            <li>I even hit the peach fuzz around my jaw just to see what that would look like - HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I went to bed without putting on any lotion and woke up with smooth, normal-looking legs.     </li>
            <li>You see what you&#x27;re doing and the light helps you see which areas you need to focus on</li>
            <li>and then how smooth and hairless your skin is.</li>
            <li>The light helps a lot to ensure that you got everything.</li>
            <li>i dun think these epilators can every be pain free...</li>
            <li>But now its smooth sailing.     </li>
            <li>Overall a great product for someone like me who hates going to the salon.     </li>
            <li>this is important).</li>
            <li>My legs never were this smooth before.</li>
            <li>I think this product is worth it :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean too.                         </li>
            <li>and on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being pain free and 10 being my nightmare of shaving)</li>
            <li>It does get the job done though, and my underarms have been hair free for over a month now.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li>It grabs even the smallest hairs and the light helps to see the area.  </li>
            <li>Here instead of waiting for smooth skin you should wait for hair.</li>
            <li>I hope this review will help the beginner&#x27;s .Enjoy smooth and glowing skin with Braun.    </li>
            <li>so no one can hear that lawn mower sound and my screams of pain.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t make you perfectly smooth</li>
            <li>I have never epilated or waxed in any of the relevant areas.</li>
            <li>Success, I love my epilator.    </li>
            <li>three - Legs remain pleasingly smooth, will move on to problematic underarm and bikini areas.</li>
            <li>I owned an old silk epil which i liked, unfortunately (or fortunately :-))</li>
            <li>It is efficient, effective and fast.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one because it had a pivoting head much like my razor</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The thing is, my legs never felt smooth.  </li>
            <li>I could take or leave the light</li>
            <li>- they are SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>What a great extra bonus!!</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than waxing!!!  </li>
            <li>trimming attachment is very useful.</li>
            <li>Laser hair removal has been the most successful for me - so long as it was done at a true dermatologist&#x27;s office and not a \\&quot;spa\\</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that your legs will not feel as smooth when compared to shaving, however you can walk bare-legged over many days with no noticeable stubble and applying lotion right after helps to make them feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li>I like to use rubbing alcohol to keep the tweezers free of any body oils so it can grab even super fine hairs.</li>
            <li>To be honest, that is the main reason I got it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using a loofah regularly and we all know that regular loofah or skin brushing is one of the most important factors to having great skin!!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, durable, safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure if you use it once, you&#x27;ll never ever want to epilate without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My solution to this is to keep epilating on a more consistent basis.</li>
            <li>My solution to this is to keep epilating on a more consistent basis.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I usually am accustomed to waxing my legs and decided to buy an epilator and did my research and found that this was the best corded epilator.  </li>
            <li>was pretty challenging, though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about it.</li>
            <li>which narrows the gap with waxing and will save a little more time which is always great.</li>
            <li>This is also sealed so that you can run it under water to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean, the design doesn&#x27;t let the motor get clogged up with hair</li>
            <li>It is also amazing to be able to remove unwanted hair at home rather than be chained to your salon - especially if you are going away with your boyfriend to South America for 4 weeks</li>
            <li>I am very positive that there will come the day where my pink new best friend will be in the cupboard most of the time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave the under arm black or anything its seriously perfect... but not from first use.</li>
            <li>After that first time, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any further discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be great to avoid the time and money that I spent going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as painful as the ones from the 80s.  </li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>hair is just hair, but life, well, it&#x27;s a whole heck of a lot more than hair on my chiny chin chin</li>
            <li>That is true.  </li>
            <li>As per the instruction booklet, I started off using the lower power setting with the \\&quot;beginner cap.\\&quot; By the end of the evening, I had it on full power using the \\&quot;efficiency cap.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I get into a good routine, it can only get even easier as time passes...</li>
            <li>but it does good enough.</li>
            <li>The product is good especially the add ons that I have received with this purchase viz, the shaver and the strips etc.</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law once described her bikini wax in infinite detail - enough to put me off body waxing for good.</li>
            <li>I go to the salon once a month to get a full \\&quot;take</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t plug it for two days you can see the beard in full bloom.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re used to the feeling, give yourself a full grooming (whatever that consists of for you).  </li>
            <li>The only places to get a good grip on it were the buttons that release the blade head.  </li>
            <li>It feels like pin pricks, really nothing more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not as bad as I thought.  </li>
            <li>My strategy was to start using it on my leg areas that weren&#x27;t so sensitive, then work on more sensitive areas as I got more and more used to it</li>
            <li>Once again, taking many deep breaths, I was able to do both underarms.</li>
            <li>I meant.. test like in just testing it here and there for a quick couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>if if any better than my older braun epilator...</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars, because it didn&#x27;t grab all my hairs, but maybe I am just super</li>
            <li>Now, for those of us with PCOS (In my case, its severe) we know that the hair under our chins isn&#x27;t peach fuzz-its along the lines of a whiskery texture and when it is waxed more than likely you will also have to pluck to remove the many that just refuse to come out.</li>
            <li>I had an older model and used it for 10 years till it started giving problems and decided to upgrade not expecting anything more than what I already had.</li>
            <li>I was leaning towards a cordless model, but after reading reviews about how quickly the battery tends to be depleted, I decided to go with the corded model.</li>
            <li>Waxing is faster and is over quickly and someone else is doing it which is the upside.</li>
            <li>got so excited about it when I unpacked the box that I wanted to test it right away.</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator.</li>
            <li>first order got canceled (products showed as being available on Amazon but</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me more than 2 weeks to put things together and run into this model that is a new but corded model.</li>
            <li>I agree with anyone who says it hurts, it&#x27;s true, but if you are trying to choose something for epilation, the process itself is hurting, so in every kind of epilation it will actually hurt.   </li>
            <li>It is definitely true that once you start using it on hairs that are softer when growing back, it is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grip, and while epilators in general may tend to miss finer hairs on the first pass, this one seems to get more in fewer passes than the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that the hair grows back much more fine and smoother over time.</li>
            <li>I like this better than shaving because it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut most of the hair off from the tip, and since it grabs most of them from the root, the hair which does grow back has more of a finer tip, resulting in less \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;-like feel.</li>

            <li>The bikini area did hurt a little in some areas more than others but nowhere near as much as it hurts at my salon does a very good wax.  </li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m really hair free for 4 weeks it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found the light to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for light hair growth.</li>
            <li>It is so great not having to shave all of the time (every few days).  </li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice.</li>
            <li>Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice.</li>
            <li>I do not trust that they can be as powerful as the corded options 2.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this a shot, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I did.     </li>
            <li>Its far better than going to a salon and can be used at the comfort of your home and  at your time and leisure.</li>
            <li>This is a good investment I believe, especially considering how much I spend money with shaving, and that shaving can cause nicks/cuts, unlike epilating (with a quality epilator like this one IMO).    </li>
            <li>but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>i think its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re not really gonna get a good at home hair removal treatment without pain.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s worth the trade.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>My face and arm pits are more sensitive.</li>
            <li>And to keep with the scenario, this latest Emjoi (now 6-7 years old) was like going from a motel to a hotel.      </li>
            <li>Well worth getting.</li>
            <li>Lasted me a good few years and comes with lots of attachments, a built in light, and low/high speed settings.</li>
            <li>face is a success.</li>
            <li>The machine is small and packs beautifully in a bag.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend actually said the other day that he never noticed how great my arms were.....not sure about that</li>
            <li>I first washed my arm/hand in warm water, then patted dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>The other really good news?  </li>
            <li>until the next day when the redness and small bumps disappeared and my skin was SMOOTH and FLAWLESS!</li>
            <li>and/or you haven&#x27;t done it in a while-stings right??)    </li>
            <li>I use it right after the shower and put a calming lotion on afterward.</li>
            <li>arrived today, and I used it right away, just out of the shower...</li>
            <li>Will anyone in their right mind buy an used epilator?    </li>
            <li>i did alot of research before buying and this one was the right one for me....</li>
            <li>It is a very sensitive gadget and is really easy to burn yourself.   </li>
            <li>This model is better than the one I had before, because of its multiple heads, speed, the ease with which you can wash/clean it and fancy features like the wipes, smart light and shimmery body.    </li>
            <li>Only thing that makes it 1 less to the best is the delivery time.</li>
            <li>and the lasers are much stronger at the true doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and only need to shave once every 5 days, which may be part of the issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has few other attachments for trimming and stuff which are good too.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to clean and easy to store.</li>
            <li>I opted for the corded model because I read too many complaints about the rechargeable battery dying or not being powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Facial brushes range from $30 - $300 depending on what you buy so thisis a great extra feature.</li>
            <li>I must say that when buying an epilator make the extra sacrifice to buy a good quality one even if it is a little more pricy then others on the market, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>No mess, easy touch ups,</li>
            <li>Like I said, my hair grows in really fine and soft.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I kept working through the pain (and taking MANY deep breaths!), I started to get accustomed to the epilator sensation, which lessened the pain.     </li>
            <li>Underarms do not have much surface area, so if you breathe through it, you&#x27;ll be done in no time!     </li>
            <li>Initially  I was scared to death and could&#x27;t use it for more than 1 minute.</li>
            <li>So, I used many different brands and types.</li>
            <li>However, it is probably because it works faster and picks more hair up in each second.</li>
            <li>Besides, it seemed most of the hairs it pulled, only broke off and when I tried underarms and groin area, it would often grab my skin too..</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I have used two epilators from epilady the Braun works as well as the first one did when it came out in the 80&#x27;s, the spring coiled one.</li>
            <li>I like the light which does help to see what you&#x27;re doing, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud.</li>
            <li>Plus the feature that is supposed to massage the skin actually limits the gripping areas for the tweezers</li>
            <li>Day one - tried it out on the kids and husband first.</li>
            <li>Tenatively begin use, after first pass regain enthusiasm.</li>
            <li>Been using for more than 10 years now (different versions, of course)</li>
            <li>BUT when I got my package well, first, one side of the box was opened and retaped.</li>
            <li>sure enough those hairs were gone.      </li>
            <li>It actually could be user error, but I still find super fine baby hairs after going over the area a couple times.</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you i have been using epilators since the mid-80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This epilator has so many improvements from the last model.</li>
            <li>Although I have to do many passes to finally get all the hair, it beats shaving, and setting up my wax warmer!</li>
            <li>When used on my legs it does take my breathe away at first, but I did get use to it.</li>
            <li>more red bumps...</li>
            <li>First wax, then use the epilator every two weeks or so depending on your needs.</li>
            <li>i think consistent use will improve its performance.</li>
            <li>Probably the weirdest sensation to overcome is the fact that it felt a bit incisive at first (go figure...</li>
            <li>My recommendations for first time epilators:    </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to exfoliate daily.  </li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews about the different brands and models.</li>
            <li>The first time hurt like a #$%^&amp;@</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, it hurt more to do my arms</li>
            <li>The shorter the beauty routine, the more we are likely to stick to it!!    </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Pain wise, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my underarms and my legs</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun epilator for more than 5 years now and wanted to replace my old one, though working, with a new version.</li>
            <li>Shaving wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;ll still have black dots on my fair skin afterward, and waxing often is too much of a pain.</li>
            <li>It really does create the right glow to catch your hairs.  </li>
            <li>When I say my hair is thick, course, and bushy I&#x27;m talking thicker, more course, and more bushy than some parts of my husbands body hair.</li>
            <li>I am pretty particular about epilating and I have no pain or discomfort after all these many years of epilating and occasionally waxing (NO shaving!</li>
            <li>But... I guess, this one is pretty fast anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In summary, I love it and wish I had found one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li>It does hurt the first time, but it is much like that of waxing.  </li>
            <li>I was resigned to just wearing long jeans most of the time until I found out about epilators.</li>
            <li>but again, go slowly and over time, you will be successful.  </li>
            <li>It feels like waxing but the pain lasts less, its over more quickly and is much easier.</li>
            <li>I also have dark facial hair and thought maybe this would be great for that issue as well.    </li>
            <li>When using an electric razor you can never get the true silky smooth feeling that a regular razor offers.    </li>
            <li>All parts and pieces are easy to clean, and the products is no louder than a typical electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t cut me (when I was younger I would burn my face from heating wax too much, but haven&#x27;t done it in years) and it is easy.</li>
            <li>and it would be fine next time.     </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even believe that it worked in such less time, so fast and with such a wonderful epilation.</li>
            <li>the product includes a nice little pouch to store it.</li>
            <li>I have given birth twice, and do think I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but it hurts, hurts, hurts to use this.</li>
            <li>I decided that between those two models, it was worth paying a little more for the swiveling head, narrower lighter body style, and Olay wipes.</li>
            <li>Epilating everywhere might take longer that the batteries last for; huge inconvenience to stop, recharge batteries, restart 3.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t silky smooth, but works well enough that you can&#x27;t see the hair without looking very closely.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on the great reviews it received and because I&#x27;ve been a faithful user of Braun epilators for years, but wanted to see if the technology has improved in the last few years.  </li>
            <li>It can be very intimidating, especially the look and sound</li>
            <li>I used to wax myself at home, but the whole procedure would take time.</li>
            <li>This thing does the job fast.</li>
            <li>Meaning, if after 7 days you do this to your legs, you wouldn&#x27;t notice any real growth for a while.</li>
            <li>I may not have used this product correctly, but I&#x27;ve never missed that much hair with my Bic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care about the light when I bought it, but it actually does make a difference in seeing what you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>Thank you SO MUCH).</li>
            <li>This allowed the epilator to get to the shorter hairs much easier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come cross yet and hope it becomes available again</li>
            <li>There is a pinching sensation but after a couple times I really did get used to it.</li>
            <li>Alright, so lets get a couple of things straight:  </li>
            <li>Also, noticed that the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; and \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t really change anything - they both operate simultaneously either way.</li>
            <li>All epilator&#x27;s hurt a bit, but this one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Pulls the hairs out very well.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>so I was faced with going to the spa just to get my underarms done or waiting until my legs were ready to get waxed too.  </li>
            <li>Also, you can take breaks if it&#x27;s too much for you to do it one sitting.  </li>
            <li>Plus with it costing 100$, it really is cheaper than by shaving/waxing equipment each month.  </li>
            <li>they gently massage and epilate hair without much pain..</li>
            <li>I have used it twice till now, I have already mastered in using, I even try on my sensitive areas   of course, and it hurts but worth bearing..</li>
            <li>because you can really see how it works on hair on the body..</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon.    </li>
            <li>I am ready to buy another epilator, and this is the one I&#x27;ve picked.  </li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it fast</li>
            <li>For real, I have like maybe 12 hairs on each leg</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li>I did not feel much pain during the process probably because I waxed a couple of weeks before.</li>
            <li>I have waxed and tweezed for years, and was ready for the &#x27;pain&#x27;.</li>
            <li>a bit pricey but well wort every penny use it onece a week just to be extra smooth.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it helps that much.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after much research and reading a lot of reviews.</li>
            <li>and arms (couldn&#x27;t finish it hurt so much).</li>
            <li>The difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>so it never bothered me that much - until I decided to try the Braun epilator on it and see what it would be like.</li>
            <li>It has multiple heads for different areas, which is nice.</li>
            <li>However, the hair on my thighs is light and thin and has never grown in course and the epilator is not as effective on hairs like that.</li>
            <li>This is a good investment I believe, especially considering how much I spend money with shaving, and that shaving can cause nicks/cuts, unlike epilating (with a quality epilator like this one IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried this on my right arm recently, and on my left arm again.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that it is not cordless, like the emjoli, a feature i found to be very useful.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin (with some Asian) which is pretty sensitive, with dark hair.</li>
            <li>The epilator is very loud at first</li>
            <li>From times I came across many devices and products but each of them have some or the other defects.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and tips (such as shaving in the shower, then starting with the first epilation), I am exceptionally pleased with this product and my experiences.  </li>
            <li>This miracle in an electronic rotating tweezer package is what makes my hairy life easy in the long run-and I&#x27;m thankful!   </li>
            <li>After my fourth time epilating underarms, legs, bikini line, tops of toes (don&#x27;t pretend ladies don&#x27;t get hair there), I experienced very little discomfort and had acclimated to the sensation.  </li>
            <li>I think most people can get through it as long as their skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I paid $150 for a full leg wax and bikini wax last year before I went on vacation, and still ended up shaving the whole vacation</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this epilator to anyone who wants a simple and complete hair removal solution.</li>
            <li>It is such a pain to have to shave every single day to have something like smooth legs, and with the promise of smooth legs for extended periods of time</li>
            <li>Following the advice of other reviewers, I took a nice hot bath and exfoliated before using my Braun SE7280.</li>
            <li>With methods like waxing, the hair needs to be much longer to be pulled, leaving you with periods of time where you have hair... but with epilating, I believe I can keep touching up whenever necessary, since it works on even very short hairs (like 3mm or so).</li>
            <li>i thought it would be the best epilator ever, but no, it is very expensive, and sometimes does not remove the hairs, but cut them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and by the end of my first session, my legs looked like I had shoved them into a hornets nest.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the thing must be complete garbage because all I felt was a tickle, no pinch, nothing.  </li>
            <li>It was fast, needed few passes, and no pain (held off doing anything for a month while deciding what to do, so my legs were indeed ready for a trim (TMI :)).</li>
            <li>Which also grows back extremely fast, and is pretty much all over me (thanks, genetics.</li>
            <li>I was able to spot hairs in places that I missed previously.  </li>
            <li>The hairs come out easily and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>I have to use it at night as the red spots don&#x27;t go away quickly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I find it helps to take a deep breath before you start and just move it as quickly as you can in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>The pain dissipates quickly - within ten seconds.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Braun epilator that broke after dropping it.  </li>
            <li>I am black so the hair on my legs are pretty shrt and fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not,</li>
            <li>Quick swipe of the Olay wipes, deep breath.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one mainly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>The second go-round on my left arm pretty much didn&#x27;t hurt at all (MUCH better compared to the first time!), and it left MUCH fewer red bumps than before - practically none.</li>
            <li>The second go-round on my left arm pretty much didn&#x27;t hurt at all (MUCH better compared to the first time!), and it left MUCH fewer red bumps than before - practically none.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It feels pokey like little zaps of static electricity.</li>
            <li>In any event, 3 mintues of ridiculous pain is well worth it for months of hair free skin!</li>
            <li>first I was a little put off by the options available from Braun (I def.</li>
            <li>Understanding that hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate, I&#x27;ve been using it almost on a daily basis because I want to remove as much hair as I can from the root so that I can enjoy having hair-free legs for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I had let mine grow out thinking I would be able to get everything and not need a touch up in a few days.  </li>
            <li>Since I been using epilator in the past 20 years, the pain really does not bother me and I rather to have the job done quicker and better.   </li>
            <li>In the long run I save much more with this one time investment because the only razors that work for me were the mens 5 blade razor which is quite pricey for replacement cartridges.     </li>
            <li>It took two weeks to get all the visible ingrowns gone, and make my legs look normal again.</li>
            <li>The product says hair free for up to 4 weeks or so, that isn&#x27;t true because i use my epilator at least once a week despite this this epilator works</li>
            <li>My chin is smooth and bare at last!!</li>
            <li>Then I waited a few days for more hair to grow in where I had shaved, and then I epilated again....</li>
            <li>However, I think that an epilator is better in the long run for your skin health and overall condition</li>
            <li>And, the more you use it - the less sensitive you will be.  </li>
            <li>&quot; this is a best way, this removes hair from the roots..and  the hair which grows back is much lighter and  growth becomes less in due course,  but one has to wait for hair to grow long to get waxed again</li>
            <li>I continued to use it on my face but adapted the routine to using a facial loofah the day before and numbing the area with an ice cube right before use.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few minutes, gets ALL the hair, has a conveniant light that helps see all the hair (I used to have to go out to my back patio to be able to see what I was doing)</li>
            <li>The best advice I can give is to use this in the late afternoon when you&#x27;re not going to leave your house -- you are left with tiny red spots where the hair gets pulled out, but this is gone by morning.  </li>
            <li>As said above, I won&#x27;t be able to afford the Silk-epil 9 for a few months but I will definitely post a detailed comparison review when I get it.    </li>
            <li>It only hurts the first few times, but the more you do it,</li>
            <li>Its compact in size than its other competitors and light in weight.</li>
            <li>when plucking your eyebrows was new</li>
            <li>Until I saw this new creation.</li>
            <li>Seriously this product is amazing..</li>
            <li>The best part, for those of you fence-sitters out there who might be afraid to try this out, is the fact that this model includes a shaver head and a trimmer, along with the different attachments for the epilator itself.</li>
            <li>Then I came across the electric epilators again, so I decided to check out what Amazon had and read the various reviews for the different kinds available.  </li>
            <li>the hair comes out very soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews about it after my loyal old Remington died after ten years of hard work.  </li>
            <li>This was more painful, to be expected - but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I thought, wow, this could be it!</li>
            <li>I would not use for the first time if you had not waxed your last hair removal.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time epilating in several years.</li>
            <li>I think that will improve with time though, as I used to wax my pits and it hurt the first couple of times and became easier later.  </li>
            <li>I heard waxing once first and epilating the hair that grows back helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it definitely hurt at first.</li>
            <li>only hurt the first time I did it, but that is going to be something that differs with each person.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the epilator on my legs that has medium-thick dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>It works more similar to a razor than any other product.</li>
            <li>Hot shower to soften hair, shave, then epilate anything left.  </li>
            <li>The results were fantastic - gone were the dark course hairs.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the new model.</li>
            <li>Be cautious if you have thick and strong hair, as this  may pain a little more.     </li>
            <li>Epilates quickly and easily every single piece of hair regardless of how small it is.</li>
            <li>So...the sections I epilated were covered in red bumps, just as advertised, but it faded, more or less over night.</li>
            <li>My only complaint which is likely not due to the product is that I struggle with ingrowns and many many while growing out get ingrown quite deeply</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, with just 1 use, this little thing has already paid for itself as I used it on my legs, arms, arm pits (this caused the most discomfort, but it only lasted for a minute or so in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Well, this Braun terror did not even need me to pluck (ok, I plucked 1 hair because it was in the crease of my neck and my Braun baby was having a hard time with it-but</li>
            <li>I was also able to get all areas by myself in hardly anytime at all.      </li>
            <li>I did my research on different models, I could not care too much about the little light this model comes with.</li>
            <li>I may have more hairs on my legs than most women, but I don&#x27;t even use it because it hurts that bad.</li>
            <li>Even the product manual highlights how sensitive this area can be.</li>
            <li>The last one I had just broke a couple of weeks ago and after years and year of intense usage.</li>
            <li>everything make it complete...</li>
            <li>It lets you trim, shave and take out hair completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, doesn&#x27;t give you cuts or burns, doesn&#x27;t cause inflammations etc.</li>
            <li>I wasnt nearly as intimidated.</li>
            <li>There were a few missed hairs, but the light on the device helped me to see</li>
            <li>But that hair was so long that I knew I just needed to get rid of it first</li>
            <li>The old wives tale of the hait growing in darker is untrue.  </li>
            <li>It removes hair completely and she has stopped using wax products.  </li>
            <li>Hair grows in at vastly different rates, and it is much easier when the hair is sparse.</li>
            <li>Remember being warned that if you pluck your eyebrows too much, the hair will eventually not grow back?  </li>
            <li>But, again, I use it regularly so there&#x27;s never been that much hair to remove all at once.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried my epilator yet, but i have turned it on to see how loud it is.     </li>
            <li>(Leg hair with one days growth, naturally.)</li>
            <li>I almost bought this on another site for over $100 but found the same thing for much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair grown in really soft and never stubbly.  </li>
            <li>By the way, the hair growth on my chin was beginning to look like a lawn and my eyesight was too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me to keep up with plucking (even with a x15 mirror and bifocals).</li>
            <li>I was use to silkepil, but mine was really old.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my right arm recently, and on my left arm again.</li>
            <li>I just hope my legs go back to normal after I start shaving again!  </li>
            <li>no mess, worries about burns, and miss a spot</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this product was to remove the small fine blond hairs that cannot be removed by laser.  </li>
            <li>considered purchasing an older version just because I thought that was the only way I could get a corded one.</li>
            <li>The price of this model was higher and we were a bit unsure about investing such a big chunk of change</li>
            <li>I now wear shorts for the first time in my life, and would have given this product ten stars if possible.  </li>
            <li>After chasing myself around the house yelling &#x27;ouch ouch ouch&#x27; the first few times, i really learned to like it.  </li>
            <li>I have only depilated once before: 20 years ago when I was in high school and \\&quot;had to have\\&quot; an Epilady.</li>
            <li>There are 2 power settings (low &amp; high) and 3 interchangeable \\&quot;caps\\&quot; that expose increasing amounts of surface area.</li>
            <li>my hair was long and it was ready to be removed.</li>
            <li>After my first time I have had minimal irritation post epillating</li>
            <li>Its much better than the daily irritation i was dealing with by shaving and the embarrassing red bumps everyday.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re plucking hairs from your skin at a remarkably high speed, so don&#x27;t expect a painless experience the first few times.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, spent more than $11 to ship it back and was asked by seller if I wanted a replacement item.  </li>
            <li>And every 2 days or so, I&#x27;d go back over my legs because new hair kept coming in, and I could never get all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my upper legs is finer than the hair on my lower legs, so doing the upper legs doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all.     </li>
            <li>I had to go over areas a couple times, but this wasn&#x27;t really a problem since it appears to pull only the hair &amp; not the actual skin.</li>
            <li>It worked very well on my face (cheeks, chin and upper lip), underarms and bikini area, but my legs are a different story.</li>
            <li>But this little epilator has left my skin in both areas BARE and SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Of course it hurt the first time, especially under my chin, but the pain is short and getting rid of this unwanted facial hair takes me two minutes instead of 2-3 hours in the evening, which I used to spend to plug it.</li>
            <li>Second take a pain reliever 30 minutes before you start epilating, and third if you are 21 or older try a glass of wine or something to take the edge off.     </li>
            <li>The epilator was quite a bit painful, but I ended up using it as a trimmer/shaver and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The LED light really helps spotlight thin blonde peach fuzz.   </li>
            <li>So, here I am, clearly with a used epilator that was assembled from various spare parts...  </li>
            <li>It felt ticklish, not really that much pain at all.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re probably nowhere near as hairy as someone such as myself.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it on my arms, stomach and legs so far.  </li>
            <li>all of them barely visible.  </li>
            <li>If you ever do get around to trying your armpits you will be surprised how deep the hair follicles grow beneath the surface!  </li>
            <li>but I had it for different years and it became old.</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace it with the same model, but it was an old model and not anymore on sale.</li>
            <li>So I developed a routine, to epilate and than to wax the next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is far preferrable to waxing, however, especially on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li>The noise level is no different than the Emjoi, and is not as loud as husband&#x27;s electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>but you can bet your Braun that I am not letting this baby near my southern ladyparts...  </li>
            <li>There weren&#x27;t that many to begin with and they were thin anyhow.    </li>
            <li>Larger head: the company website says that the new head is 40% larger.</li>
            <li>My hesitations were due to the fact that this model was a lot more expensive than other similar but un-corded models (up to 80% more</li>
            <li>You will get little red dots all over your legs (same is true for waxing)</li>
            <li>(be careful here, pull your skin extra tight because its easy to get it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; in the epilator.</li>
            <li>At first, I did experience some ingrown leg hairs, but I starting scrubbing my legs with a rough Japanese washcloth and using Amlactin lotion, which eliminated the problem.  </li>
            <li>After doing extensive research I decided to use this new Braun model based on previous reviewers&#x27; satisfaction with older braun models.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it grabs only part of the hair which is frustrating because I have a lot more hair on my thighs</li>
            <li>It hurts a little at first</li>
            <li>and my total lack of funds in general  - and also bc</li>
            <li>Having waited an entire month to remove any excess body hair (I was getting ready to send my money back if it wasn&#x27;t doing what it allegedly promised)</li>
            <li>That is way too much trouble that I am willing to take for getting this done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So wax a few times first.  </li>
            <li>[really, I&#x27;d rather spend $2,000 on a trip to Europe or a down payment for a Vespa...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put off replacing my old Epilady for years because I thought all others would be the same, take as long to get all the hair</li>
            <li>The morning following, the red spots had faded considerably, to barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any apparent ingrown hairs from the last time I epilated (on my left arm).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any apparent ingrown hairs from the last time I epilated (on my left arm).  </li>
            <li>I just received this epilator a few days ago and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>It has become a good deal less uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The hair I grow grows back thickly and quickly.   </li>
            <li>But I did also wanted to keep up to date and take advantage of whatever other new features out</li>
            <li>So I thought that I could go without  using the epic for a few weeks and be free of my hair nightmare for at least that time.</li>

            <li> This is not for someone happy with shaving.  </li>

            <li> All in all, a great product.</li>

            <li> HOW GREAT YOUR SKIN IS--</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and it feels great to not have to shave every day.</li>
            <li> Handy dandy plucking is so great!</li>
            <li> I also brave it and use the highest speed - it&#x27;s quicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I just finished my 4th time and the pain is now manageable.</li>

            <li> I was happily stunned.   </li>

            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> Works really great.</li>
            <li> The package also includes some Soothing Wipes which are great.</li>

            <li> but if it does what it says I&#x27;ll love it !!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Again, a MUCH better experience than waxing!!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very comfortable, looks awesome!!!</li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, let me start off by saying this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Again, I would still say a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Though, having used it now, I can tell you that adding the light is the best idea ever!</li>
            <li> THis is a good epilator no doubt...</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the pain its good going from then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Emjoi, but that doesn not work 1/2 as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Good product, except for the noise it makes.</li>
            <li> I had a good amount of stubble on my legs, but I took my time over a couple of hours and went to work.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it - although it hurts a lot until get used.</li>
            <li> I tried than to find another one,of course I return on my beloved Brown and I trusted on reviews this time...</li>
            <li> But once she used it, she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Over all, I&#x27;m really pleased with it! :o)</li>
            <li> The Braun SE7280 is like going from a hotel to a full service resort!!!   </li>
            <li> Better that he thinks I&#x27;m a magical creature who is naturally flawless.    </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance...</li>
            <li> This might improve as I become more experienced with this gizmo and my skin gets used to epilation.</li>
            <li> and I was very satisfied with it,</li>
            <li> Am very pleased</li>
            <li> The shaver didn&#x27;t work for me either - It seemed to be working great, and I loved the light.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> You will love this product!</li>
            <li> Have found that using it after soaking in a hot tub is best.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product!   </li>
            <li> I was determined to stick with it for a month or two, but after 3 weeks, despite doing exfoliation, on top of stubble and bumps, I realized I had a gazillion ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li> It does a great job and is hassle free.  </li>
            <li> Amazing item..</li>
            <li> I also think one of their newer models looks amazing: the Braun Silk-epil 9 Skin Spa.</li>
            <li> So that is nice.</li>
            <li> So that is nice.</li>
            <li> though it was nice</li>
            <li> I liked the speed too, though when doing my research</li>
            <li> This is so nice</li>
            <li> Also the shaver hear is nice for when I forgot to do it the night before and still need to get rid of the leg hair.  </li>
            <li> However, Amazon had it priced much lower which made it a great deal!</li>
            <li> product has a nice girly design</li>
            <li> HONEST TRUTH:  </li>
            <li> In fact, I ended up just loving the shaver part.</li>
            <li> Nice Performance.</li>
            <li> I would nightly have to sit in a warm bath, then scrub my legs with a washcloth to loosen the hairs.</li>
            <li> I did not even do it after a warm shower or pain reliever or alcohol or the olay wipes provided.  </li>
            <li> Whatever model you select in Braun it has got its own way of satisfaction.    </li>
            <li> it was timely and so apt.</li>
            <li> best if you buy things straight from the store.</li>
            <li> No amount of advertising could have convinced me to buy this, I have to thank the reviewers here at Amazon for the details and honest insight.</li>
            <li> And, it was not as effective as i had hoped.</li>
            <li> But nevertheless, I am THRILLED about this.  </li>
            <li> after I bought this for her, she did not quite liked my idea in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Massage system is not that effective.</li>
            <li> It makes all the hair easy to see, even if your light in the bathroom is not as good!</li>
            <li> In fact, it is very easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> and takes out even the tiniest and thinnest of hair, leaving you with perfect smooth skin that you can show off right away (without having to wait for the redness to go away like with waxing).</li>
            <li> If you wax this will be a nice refreshing change.  </li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best epilator I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best epilator I have ever used</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and am very happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> That is until I discovered how easy and painless this is!  </li>
            <li> And I am especially impressed that the area that caused me the most initial discomfort (arm pits) is the one I am most pleased about!</li>
            <li> The wipes make your skin very smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty bright and nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this epitator.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s corded (more power).</li>
            <li> But, I was able to make it to one appointment.</li>
            <li> , I had so many ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li> So I shaved the day before, and the next day, after a shower (best time to do it)</li>
            <li> I suffered through and when I was done, was glad I did it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for more than 15 years now.</li>
            <li> it requires a lot more planning since batteries need to be charges ahead of time.</li>
            <li> And...unfortunately.. not that many shops had it available.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of more days to re-place the order with another vendor</li>
            <li> (this time the product was $50 more than the one that proved out of stock).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it and</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone that wants to achieve a great result and likes the comfort of using an epilator whenever -without thinking about charging ahead.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I imagined - I thought I would be able to deal with the pain that I read about</li>
            <li> The pain fades more with each use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Be sure to pull your skin taut</li>
            <li> so it works more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.    </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing from what I can tell, and I had a highly experienced waxer at the salon I went to.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase more of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the time I got to the shin area I was used to the pain and was able to finish without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I think the longer hair created more pulling.  </li>
            <li> /catch most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really do love this epilator and prefer it over all to shaving.</li>
            <li> thats for darn sure]).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SURE many if not ALL will work for you.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my face most of my post pubescent life.</li>
            <li> And when I tell you it was as (AND STILL IS AFTER 1 WEEK) smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt-believe it!   </li>
            <li> Now I have more of a reason to NEVER shave again.</li>
            <li> But, it doesn&#x27;t matter, I still love it.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a more affordable solution than salon waxing, this is for sure the way to go.    </li>
            <li> and I do not have to use it weekly any more.</li>
            <li> For me, turning my head and watching makes it more tolerable than watching it the mirror.</li>
            <li> Thinking maybe i need to exfoliate more, before and after epilating.</li>
            <li> After reading the many reviews, I settled on this model and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash yourself after to prevent ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> This one is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews, rating and every time the rating and reviews have voted for one product as \\&quot;The Best\\&quot;, and that is undoubtedly \\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with Amazon delivery services..</li>
            <li> I also found that if I change the direction of the epilator, I get better results.</li>
            <li> However i have to warn you that although i was accustomed to waxing my legs, using the epilator hurt more than waxing</li>
            <li> but i kept on using it and am getting more accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews over Braun epilators.</li>
            <li> I have not heard of a better brand.     </li>
            <li> it a try :)</li>
            <li> .It works much better with that part off</li>
            <li> I will be shopping for a better one soon.</li>
            <li> OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   </li>
            <li> In all my years (and there are getting to be distressingly many of them)</li>
            <li> Decided to take a chance and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> why isn&#x27;t it advertized better</li>
            <li> so more women can know about it?  </li>
            <li> It tends to add up, but I have been ok with paying someone else to take care of my business...</li>
            <li> I got most of the hairs and decided to give it a rest.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoyed my review please say so.</li>
            <li> Each worked better than the one before.</li>
            <li> The best way to compare this product is to say it is similar to the difference between skin that has been shaved with a razor vs. skin that has been shaved with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I just had to order some more from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li> My pits are still soooooo smooth!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> In a very short time, this one epilates and shaves perfectly, without leaving any hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this newer version, and I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I would say that it is much better than shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> After I adjusted my method, the product removed most of the hair in one stroke.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd epilator and it is the best.</li>
            <li> Love my Braun epilator.</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hair (I sometimes miss the finer ones but the light helps a lot), legs stay smooth for a good while and the head can be rinsed under water.</li>
            <li> After a good night&#x27;s sleep, I felt brave enough to try it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the results of my face and arms that I really want to move onto my legs and underarms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to do my legs, arms and underarms that way.    </li>
            <li> That means more area is covered at once -</li>
            <li> Epilators are ultimately better than waxing and shaving.</li>
            <li> It is better for your skin health, promotes smoother skin without the damage of waxing.</li>
            <li> The blades are placed in a slightly concave configuration, which is great for legs, and not so great for pits and bikini line.    </li>
            <li> The light is a great feature, it really helps to see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li> I find it super effective.  </li>
            <li> What I love most about this, is that I imagine that I can have smooth skin for longer periods of time compared to shaving.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and the cord is nice (no batteries needed)    </li>
            <li> It is not completely painless, I&#x27;ll be honest, but once you get used to it, it does the job beautifully.    </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of picking up the hairs, even when I move it in all different directions.</li>
            <li> Love the light..</li>
            <li> The light is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love that it includes a light, a shaver, a trimmer, and</li>
            <li> This  newer one is more comfortable to use even.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy with it that I convinced my 16 year old daughter to try it.</li>
            <li> I love the light in the front.</li>
            <li> Since this model that I&#x27;m reviewing is 3 years old, I am looking into getting a newer model that has some great updated features.</li>
            <li> My face (includes my neck) is really the key thing that I focus on, the rest of my body is just a great, great bonus for me.</li>
            <li> Again, I would still say a good purchase.any real growth for a while.</li>
            <li> It looked practical, sounded reasonable and the reviews were good -</li>
            <li> I wish I was one of those people singing the praises of the epilator, but absolutely nothing good came out of my 3 week experiment with it.  </li>
            <li> In general pain level was very mild, mostly a pinch and a pull, unfortunately I experienced no tickling.</li>
            <li> Also I have to do it more often than most because my hair grows quite quickly.</li>
            <li> The smart light is a great help in low light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I used it first time last night and was more than impressed.  </li>
            <li> I did not have to repeatedly go over areas to remove hair, and the pivoting head allowed me to easily navigate with no pulling.</li>
            <li> The legs are not as easy to rid of hair.  </li>
            <li> and i know its not goin to be easy...</li>
            <li> Face-2 (seriously, easy as pie)  </li>
            <li> Easy to travel.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy.    </li>
            <li> It even travels easily.  </li>
            <li> This product is far superior with better technology and results that amaze me every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with how this Braun SE7280 model has performed and I trust the brand in general.</li>
            <li> They have a 5 o clock shadow all their own to be exact.</li>
            <li> [my caps] item and the cord is for charging purposes and works fine and fits the item and charges well.  </li>
            <li> but everything else is fine.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about trying it on my underarms, but it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> had it sence xmas of 2011 still working fine recomended it to all the ladys in my fam.</li>
            <li> Just a quick stroke of this terror and they were gone, finito, hasta la vista baby!   </li>
            <li> it is fast and a lot more efficient!  </li>
            <li> had (still have) huge concerns about the battery operated versions as 1.</li>
            <li> I found pressing on the area with my free hand greatly helped (learned this at my local salon).  </li>
            <li> I even hit the peach fuzz around my jaw just to see what that would look like - HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I went to bed without putting on any lotion and woke up with smooth, normal-looking legs.     </li>
            <li> You see what you&#x27;re doing and the light helps you see which areas you need to focus on</li>
            <li> and then how smooth and hairless your skin is.</li>
            <li> The light helps a lot to ensure that you got everything.</li>
            <li> i dun think these epilators can every be pain free...</li>
            <li> But now its smooth sailing.     </li>
            <li> Overall a great product for someone like me who hates going to the salon.     </li>
            <li> this is important).</li>
            <li> My legs never were this smooth before.</li>
            <li> I think this product is worth it :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean too.                         </li>
            <li> and on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being pain free and 10 being my nightmare of shaving)</li>
            <li> It does get the job done though, and my underarms have been hair free for over a month now.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky smooth</li>
            <li> It grabs even the smallest hairs and the light helps to see the area.  </li>
            <li> Here instead of waiting for smooth skin you should wait for hair.</li>
            <li> I hope this review will help the beginner&#x27;s .Enjoy smooth and glowing skin with Braun.    </li>
            <li> so no one can hear that lawn mower sound and my screams of pain.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make you perfectly smooth</li>
            <li> I have never epilated or waxed in any of the relevant areas.</li>
            <li> Success, I love my epilator.    </li>
            <li> three - Legs remain pleasingly smooth, will move on to problematic underarm and bikini areas.</li>
            <li> I owned an old silk epil which i liked, unfortunately (or fortunately :-))</li>
            <li> It is efficient, effective and fast.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one because it had a pivoting head much like my razor</li>
            <li> and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> The thing is, my legs never felt smooth.  </li>
            <li> I could take or leave the light</li>
            <li> - they are SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> What a great extra bonus!!</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than waxing!!!  </li>
            <li> trimming attachment is very useful.</li>
            <li> Laser hair removal has been the most successful for me - so long as it was done at a true dermatologist&#x27;s office and not a \\&quot;spa\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that your legs will not feel as smooth when compared to shaving, however you can walk bare-legged over many days with no noticeable stubble and applying lotion right after helps to make them feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> I like to use rubbing alcohol to keep the tweezers free of any body oils so it can grab even super fine hairs.</li>
            <li> To be honest, that is the main reason I got it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a loofah regularly and we all know that regular loofah or skin brushing is one of the most important factors to having great skin!!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, durable, safe and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure if you use it once, you&#x27;ll never ever want to epilate without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My solution to this is to keep epilating on a more consistent basis.</li>
            <li> My solution to this is to keep epilating on a more consistent basis.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I usually am accustomed to waxing my legs and decided to buy an epilator and did my research and found that this was the best corded epilator.  </li>
            <li> was pretty challenging, though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about it.</li>
            <li> which narrows the gap with waxing and will save a little more time which is always great.</li>
            <li> This is also sealed so that you can run it under water to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean, the design doesn&#x27;t let the motor get clogged up with hair</li>
            <li> It is also amazing to be able to remove unwanted hair at home rather than be chained to your salon - especially if you are going away with your boyfriend to South America for 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I am very positive that there will come the day where my pink new best friend will be in the cupboard most of the time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave the under arm black or anything its seriously perfect... but not from first use.</li>
            <li> After that first time, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any further discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be great to avoid the time and money that I spent going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as painful as the ones from the 80s.  </li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> hair is just hair, but life, well, it&#x27;s a whole heck of a lot more than hair on my chiny chin chin</li>
            <li> That is true.  </li>
            <li> As per the instruction booklet, I started off using the lower power setting with the \\&quot;beginner cap.\\&quot; By the end of the evening, I had it on full power using the \\&quot;efficiency cap.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I get into a good routine, it can only get even easier as time passes...</li>
            <li> but it does good enough.</li>
            <li> The product is good especially the add ons that I have received with this purchase viz, the shaver and the strips etc.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law once described her bikini wax in infinite detail - enough to put me off body waxing for good.</li>
            <li> I go to the salon once a month to get a full \\&quot;take</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t plug it for two days you can see the beard in full bloom.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re used to the feeling, give yourself a full grooming (whatever that consists of for you).  </li>
            <li> The only places to get a good grip on it were the buttons that release the blade head.  </li>
            <li> It feels like pin pricks, really nothing more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not as bad as I thought.  </li>
            <li> My strategy was to start using it on my leg areas that weren&#x27;t so sensitive, then work on more sensitive areas as I got more and more used to it</li>
            <li> Once again, taking many deep breaths, I was able to do both underarms.</li>
            <li> I meant.. test like in just testing it here and there for a quick couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> if if any better than my older braun epilator...</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars, because it didn&#x27;t grab all my hairs, but maybe I am just super</li>
            <li> Now, for those of us with PCOS (In my case, its severe) we know that the hair under our chins isn&#x27;t peach fuzz-its along the lines of a whiskery texture and when it is waxed more than likely you will also have to pluck to remove the many that just refuse to come out.</li>
            <li> I had an older model and used it for 10 years till it started giving problems and decided to upgrade not expecting anything more than what I already had.</li>
            <li> I was leaning towards a cordless model, but after reading reviews about how quickly the battery tends to be depleted, I decided to go with the corded model.</li>
            <li> Waxing is faster and is over quickly and someone else is doing it which is the upside.</li>
            <li> got so excited about it when I unpacked the box that I wanted to test it right away.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator.</li>
            <li> first order got canceled (products showed as being available on Amazon but</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me more than 2 weeks to put things together and run into this model that is a new but corded model.</li>
            <li> I agree with anyone who says it hurts, it&#x27;s true, but if you are trying to choose something for epilation, the process itself is hurting, so in every kind of epilation it will actually hurt.   </li>
            <li> It is definitely true that once you start using it on hairs that are softer when growing back, it is much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grip, and while epilators in general may tend to miss finer hairs on the first pass, this one seems to get more in fewer passes than the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the hair grows back much more fine and smoother over time.</li>
            <li> I like this better than shaving because it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut most of the hair off from the tip, and since it grabs most of them from the root, the hair which does grow back has more of a finer tip, resulting in less \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;-like feel.</li>

            <li> The bikini area did hurt a little in some areas more than others but nowhere near as much as it hurts at my salon does a very good wax.  </li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m really hair free for 4 weeks it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found the light to be very helpful.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for light hair growth.</li>
            <li> It is so great not having to shave all of the time (every few days).  </li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice.</li>
            <li> Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice.</li>
            <li> I do not trust that they can be as powerful as the corded options 2.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a shot, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I did.     </li>
            <li> Its far better than going to a salon and can be used at the comfort of your home and  at your time and leisure.</li>
            <li> This is a good investment I believe, especially considering how much I spend money with shaving, and that shaving can cause nicks/cuts, unlike epilating (with a quality epilator like this one IMO).    </li>
            <li> but it is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> i think its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re not really gonna get a good at home hair removal treatment without pain.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s worth the trade.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> My face and arm pits are more sensitive.</li>
            <li> And to keep with the scenario, this latest Emjoi (now 6-7 years old) was like going from a motel to a hotel.      </li>
            <li> Well worth getting.</li>
            <li> Lasted me a good few years and comes with lots of attachments, a built in light, and low/high speed settings.</li>
            <li> face is a success.</li>
            <li> The machine is small and packs beautifully in a bag.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend actually said the other day that he never noticed how great my arms were.....not sure about that</li>
            <li> I first washed my arm/hand in warm water, then patted dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> The other really good news?  </li>
            <li> until the next day when the redness and small bumps disappeared and my skin was SMOOTH and FLAWLESS!</li>
            <li> and/or you haven&#x27;t done it in a while-stings right??)    </li>
            <li> I use it right after the shower and put a calming lotion on afterward.</li>
            <li> arrived today, and I used it right away, just out of the shower...</li>
            <li> Will anyone in their right mind buy an used epilator?    </li>
            <li> i did alot of research before buying and this one was the right one for me....</li>
            <li> It is a very sensitive gadget and is really easy to burn yourself.   </li>
            <li> This model is better than the one I had before, because of its multiple heads, speed, the ease with which you can wash/clean it and fancy features like the wipes, smart light and shimmery body.    </li>
            <li> Only thing that makes it 1 less to the best is the delivery time.</li>
            <li> and the lasers are much stronger at the true doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and only need to shave once every 5 days, which may be part of the issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has few other attachments for trimming and stuff which are good too.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to clean and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I opted for the corded model because I read too many complaints about the rechargeable battery dying or not being powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Facial brushes range from $30 - $300 depending on what you buy so thisis a great extra feature.</li>
            <li> I must say that when buying an epilator make the extra sacrifice to buy a good quality one even if it is a little more pricy then others on the market, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> No mess, easy touch ups,</li>
            <li> Like I said, my hair grows in really fine and soft.  </li>
            <li> I found that if I kept working through the pain (and taking MANY deep breaths!), I started to get accustomed to the epilator sensation, which lessened the pain.     </li>
            <li> Underarms do not have much surface area, so if you breathe through it, you&#x27;ll be done in no time!     </li>
            <li> Initially  I was scared to death and could&#x27;t use it for more than 1 minute.</li>
            <li> So, I used many different brands and types.</li>
            <li> However, it is probably because it works faster and picks more hair up in each second.</li>
            <li> Besides, it seemed most of the hairs it pulled, only broke off and when I tried underarms and groin area, it would often grab my skin too..</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I have used two epilators from epilady the Braun works as well as the first one did when it came out in the 80&#x27;s, the spring coiled one.</li>
            <li> I like the light which does help to see what you&#x27;re doing, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud.</li>
            <li> Plus the feature that is supposed to massage the skin actually limits the gripping areas for the tweezers</li>
            <li> Day one - tried it out on the kids and husband first.</li>
            <li> Tenatively begin use, after first pass regain enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> Been using for more than 10 years now (different versions, of course)</li>
            <li> BUT when I got my package well, first, one side of the box was opened and retaped.</li>
            <li> sure enough those hairs were gone.      </li>
            <li> It actually could be user error, but I still find super fine baby hairs after going over the area a couple times.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you i have been using epilators since the mid-80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This epilator has so many improvements from the last model.</li>
            <li> Although I have to do many passes to finally get all the hair, it beats shaving, and setting up my wax warmer!</li>
            <li> When used on my legs it does take my breathe away at first, but I did get use to it.</li>
            <li> more red bumps...</li>
            <li> First wax, then use the epilator every two weeks or so depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> i think consistent use will improve its performance.</li>
            <li> Probably the weirdest sensation to overcome is the fact that it felt a bit incisive at first (go figure...</li>
            <li> My recommendations for first time epilators:    </li>
            <li> Also, be sure to exfoliate daily.  </li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews about the different brands and models.</li>
            <li> The first time hurt like a #$%^&amp;@</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, it hurt more to do my arms</li>
            <li> The shorter the beauty routine, the more we are likely to stick to it!!    </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Pain wise, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my underarms and my legs</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun epilator for more than 5 years now and wanted to replace my old one, though working, with a new version.</li>
            <li> Shaving wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;ll still have black dots on my fair skin afterward, and waxing often is too much of a pain.</li>
            <li> It really does create the right glow to catch your hairs.  </li>
            <li> When I say my hair is thick, course, and bushy I&#x27;m talking thicker, more course, and more bushy than some parts of my husbands body hair.</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular about epilating and I have no pain or discomfort after all these many years of epilating and occasionally waxing (NO shaving!</li>
            <li> But... I guess, this one is pretty fast anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In summary, I love it and wish I had found one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It does hurt the first time, but it is much like that of waxing.  </li>
            <li> I was resigned to just wearing long jeans most of the time until I found out about epilators.</li>
            <li> but again, go slowly and over time, you will be successful.  </li>
            <li> It feels like waxing but the pain lasts less, its over more quickly and is much easier.</li>
            <li> I also have dark facial hair and thought maybe this would be great for that issue as well.    </li>
            <li> When using an electric razor you can never get the true silky smooth feeling that a regular razor offers.    </li>
            <li> All parts and pieces are easy to clean, and the products is no louder than a typical electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t cut me (when I was younger I would burn my face from heating wax too much, but haven&#x27;t done it in years) and it is easy.</li>
            <li> and it would be fine next time.     </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even believe that it worked in such less time, so fast and with such a wonderful epilation.</li>
            <li> the product includes a nice little pouch to store it.</li>
            <li> I have given birth twice, and do think I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but it hurts, hurts, hurts to use this.</li>
            <li> I decided that between those two models, it was worth paying a little more for the swiveling head, narrower lighter body style, and Olay wipes.</li>
            <li> Epilating everywhere might take longer that the batteries last for; huge inconvenience to stop, recharge batteries, restart 3.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t silky smooth, but works well enough that you can&#x27;t see the hair without looking very closely.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the great reviews it received and because I&#x27;ve been a faithful user of Braun epilators for years, but wanted to see if the technology has improved in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It can be very intimidating, especially the look and sound</li>
            <li> I used to wax myself at home, but the whole procedure would take time.</li>
            <li> This thing does the job fast.</li>
            <li> Meaning, if after 7 days you do this to your legs, you wouldn&#x27;t notice any real growth for a while.</li>
            <li> I may not have used this product correctly, but I&#x27;ve never missed that much hair with my Bic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care about the light when I bought it, but it actually does make a difference in seeing what you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> Thank you SO MUCH).</li>
            <li> This allowed the epilator to get to the shorter hairs much easier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come cross yet and hope it becomes available again</li>
            <li> There is a pinching sensation but after a couple times I really did get used to it.</li>
            <li> Alright, so lets get a couple of things straight:  </li>
            <li> Also, noticed that the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; and \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t really change anything - they both operate simultaneously either way.</li>
            <li> All epilator&#x27;s hurt a bit, but this one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Pulls the hairs out very well.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> so I was faced with going to the spa just to get my underarms done or waiting until my legs were ready to get waxed too.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can take breaks if it&#x27;s too much for you to do it one sitting.  </li>
            <li> Plus with it costing 100$, it really is cheaper than by shaving/waxing equipment each month.  </li>
            <li> they gently massage and epilate hair without much pain..</li>
            <li> I have used it twice till now, I have already mastered in using, I even try on my sensitive areas   of course, and it hurts but worth bearing..</li>
            <li> because you can really see how it works on hair on the body..</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon.    </li>
            <li> I am ready to buy another epilator, and this is the one I&#x27;ve picked.  </li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it fast</li>
            <li> For real, I have like maybe 12 hairs on each leg</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> I did not feel much pain during the process probably because I waxed a couple of weeks before.</li>
            <li> I have waxed and tweezed for years, and was ready for the &#x27;pain&#x27;.</li>
            <li> a bit pricey but well wort every penny use it onece a week just to be extra smooth.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think it helps that much.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after much research and reading a lot of reviews.</li>
            <li> and arms (couldn&#x27;t finish it hurt so much).</li>
            <li> The difference is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> so it never bothered me that much - until I decided to try the Braun epilator on it and see what it would be like.</li>
            <li> It has multiple heads for different areas, which is nice.</li>
            <li> However, the hair on my thighs is light and thin and has never grown in course and the epilator is not as effective on hairs like that.</li>
            <li> This is a good investment I believe, especially considering how much I spend money with shaving, and that shaving can cause nicks/cuts, unlike epilating (with a quality epilator like this one IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried this on my right arm recently, and on my left arm again.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that it is not cordless, like the emjoli, a feature i found to be very useful.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin (with some Asian) which is pretty sensitive, with dark hair.</li>
            <li> The epilator is very loud at first</li>
            <li> From times I came across many devices and products but each of them have some or the other defects.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and tips (such as shaving in the shower, then starting with the first epilation), I am exceptionally pleased with this product and my experiences.  </li>
            <li> This miracle in an electronic rotating tweezer package is what makes my hairy life easy in the long run-and I&#x27;m thankful!   </li>
            <li> After my fourth time epilating underarms, legs, bikini line, tops of toes (don&#x27;t pretend ladies don&#x27;t get hair there), I experienced very little discomfort and had acclimated to the sensation.  </li>
            <li> I think most people can get through it as long as their skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I paid $150 for a full leg wax and bikini wax last year before I went on vacation, and still ended up shaving the whole vacation</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this epilator to anyone who wants a simple and complete hair removal solution.</li>
            <li> It is such a pain to have to shave every single day to have something like smooth legs, and with the promise of smooth legs for extended periods of time</li>
            <li> Following the advice of other reviewers, I took a nice hot bath and exfoliated before using my Braun SE7280.</li>
            <li> With methods like waxing, the hair needs to be much longer to be pulled, leaving you with periods of time where you have hair... but with epilating, I believe I can keep touching up whenever necessary, since it works on even very short hairs (like 3mm or so).</li>
            <li> i thought it would be the best epilator ever, but no, it is very expensive, and sometimes does not remove the hairs, but cut them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and by the end of my first session, my legs looked like I had shoved them into a hornets nest.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the thing must be complete garbage because all I felt was a tickle, no pinch, nothing.  </li>
            <li> It was fast, needed few passes, and no pain (held off doing anything for a month while deciding what to do, so my legs were indeed ready for a trim (TMI :)).</li>
            <li> Which also grows back extremely fast, and is pretty much all over me (thanks, genetics.</li>
            <li> I was able to spot hairs in places that I missed previously.  </li>
            <li> The hairs come out easily and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> I have to use it at night as the red spots don&#x27;t go away quickly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I find it helps to take a deep breath before you start and just move it as quickly as you can in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> The pain dissipates quickly - within ten seconds.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Braun epilator that broke after dropping it.  </li>
            <li> I am black so the hair on my legs are pretty shrt and fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not,</li>
            <li> Quick swipe of the Olay wipes, deep breath.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one mainly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> The second go-round on my left arm pretty much didn&#x27;t hurt at all (MUCH better compared to the first time!), and it left MUCH fewer red bumps than before - practically none.</li>
            <li> The second go-round on my left arm pretty much didn&#x27;t hurt at all (MUCH better compared to the first time!), and it left MUCH fewer red bumps than before - practically none.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It feels pokey like little zaps of static electricity.</li>
            <li> In any event, 3 mintues of ridiculous pain is well worth it for months of hair free skin!</li>
            <li> first I was a little put off by the options available from Braun (I def.</li>
            <li> Understanding that hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate, I&#x27;ve been using it almost on a daily basis because I want to remove as much hair as I can from the root so that I can enjoy having hair-free legs for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I had let mine grow out thinking I would be able to get everything and not need a touch up in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Since I been using epilator in the past 20 years, the pain really does not bother me and I rather to have the job done quicker and better.   </li>
            <li> In the long run I save much more with this one time investment because the only razors that work for me were the mens 5 blade razor which is quite pricey for replacement cartridges.     </li>
            <li> It took two weeks to get all the visible ingrowns gone, and make my legs look normal again.</li>
            <li> The product says hair free for up to 4 weeks or so, that isn&#x27;t true because i use my epilator at least once a week despite this this epilator works</li>
            <li> My chin is smooth and bare at last!!</li>
            <li> Then I waited a few days for more hair to grow in where I had shaved, and then I epilated again....</li>
            <li> However, I think that an epilator is better in the long run for your skin health and overall condition</li>
            <li> And, the more you use it - the less sensitive you will be.  </li>
            <li> &quot; this is a best way, this removes hair from the roots..and  the hair which grows back is much lighter and  growth becomes less in due course,  but one has to wait for hair to grow long to get waxed again</li>
            <li> I continued to use it on my face but adapted the routine to using a facial loofah the day before and numbing the area with an ice cube right before use.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes, gets ALL the hair, has a conveniant light that helps see all the hair (I used to have to go out to my back patio to be able to see what I was doing)</li>
            <li> The best advice I can give is to use this in the late afternoon when you&#x27;re not going to leave your house -- you are left with tiny red spots where the hair gets pulled out, but this is gone by morning.  </li>
            <li> As said above, I won&#x27;t be able to afford the Silk-epil 9 for a few months but I will definitely post a detailed comparison review when I get it.    </li>
            <li> It only hurts the first few times, but the more you do it,</li>
            <li> Its compact in size than its other competitors and light in weight.</li>
            <li> when plucking your eyebrows was new</li>
            <li> Until I saw this new creation.</li>
            <li> Seriously this product is amazing..</li>
            <li> The best part, for those of you fence-sitters out there who might be afraid to try this out, is the fact that this model includes a shaver head and a trimmer, along with the different attachments for the epilator itself.</li>
            <li> Then I came across the electric epilators again, so I decided to check out what Amazon had and read the various reviews for the different kinds available.  </li>
            <li> the hair comes out very soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews about it after my loyal old Remington died after ten years of hard work.  </li>
            <li> This was more painful, to be expected - but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I thought, wow, this could be it!</li>
            <li> I would not use for the first time if you had not waxed your last hair removal.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time epilating in several years.</li>
            <li> I think that will improve with time though, as I used to wax my pits and it hurt the first couple of times and became easier later.  </li>
            <li> I heard waxing once first and epilating the hair that grows back helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it definitely hurt at first.</li>
            <li> only hurt the first time I did it, but that is going to be something that differs with each person.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the epilator on my legs that has medium-thick dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> It works more similar to a razor than any other product.</li>
            <li> Hot shower to soften hair, shave, then epilate anything left.  </li>
            <li> The results were fantastic - gone were the dark course hairs.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the new model.</li>
            <li> Be cautious if you have thick and strong hair, as this  may pain a little more.     </li>
            <li> Epilates quickly and easily every single piece of hair regardless of how small it is.</li>
            <li> So...the sections I epilated were covered in red bumps, just as advertised, but it faded, more or less over night.</li>
            <li> My only complaint which is likely not due to the product is that I struggle with ingrowns and many many while growing out get ingrown quite deeply</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, with just 1 use, this little thing has already paid for itself as I used it on my legs, arms, arm pits (this caused the most discomfort, but it only lasted for a minute or so in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Well, this Braun terror did not even need me to pluck (ok, I plucked 1 hair because it was in the crease of my neck and my Braun baby was having a hard time with it-but</li>
            <li> I was also able to get all areas by myself in hardly anytime at all.      </li>
            <li> I did my research on different models, I could not care too much about the little light this model comes with.</li>
            <li> I may have more hairs on my legs than most women, but I don&#x27;t even use it because it hurts that bad.</li>
            <li> Even the product manual highlights how sensitive this area can be.</li>
            <li> The last one I had just broke a couple of weeks ago and after years and year of intense usage.</li>
            <li> everything make it complete...</li>
            <li> It lets you trim, shave and take out hair completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, doesn&#x27;t give you cuts or burns, doesn&#x27;t cause inflammations etc.</li>
            <li> I wasnt nearly as intimidated.</li>
            <li> There were a few missed hairs, but the light on the device helped me to see</li>
            <li> But that hair was so long that I knew I just needed to get rid of it first</li>
            <li> The old wives tale of the hait growing in darker is untrue.  </li>
            <li> It removes hair completely and she has stopped using wax products.  </li>
            <li> Hair grows in at vastly different rates, and it is much easier when the hair is sparse.</li>
            <li> Remember being warned that if you pluck your eyebrows too much, the hair will eventually not grow back?  </li>
            <li> But, again, I use it regularly so there&#x27;s never been that much hair to remove all at once.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried my epilator yet, but i have turned it on to see how loud it is.     </li>
            <li> (Leg hair with one days growth, naturally.)</li>
            <li> I almost bought this on another site for over $100 but found the same thing for much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair grown in really soft and never stubbly.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the hair growth on my chin was beginning to look like a lawn and my eyesight was too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me to keep up with plucking (even with a x15 mirror and bifocals).</li>
            <li> I was use to silkepil, but mine was really old.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my right arm recently, and on my left arm again.</li>
            <li> I just hope my legs go back to normal after I start shaving again!  </li>
            <li> no mess, worries about burns, and miss a spot</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this product was to remove the small fine blond hairs that cannot be removed by laser.  </li>
            <li> considered purchasing an older version just because I thought that was the only way I could get a corded one.</li>
            <li> The price of this model was higher and we were a bit unsure about investing such a big chunk of change</li>
            <li> I now wear shorts for the first time in my life, and would have given this product ten stars if possible.  </li>
            <li> After chasing myself around the house yelling &#x27;ouch ouch ouch&#x27; the first few times, i really learned to like it.  </li>
            <li> I have only depilated once before: 20 years ago when I was in high school and \\&quot;had to have\\&quot; an Epilady.</li>
            <li> There are 2 power settings (low &amp; high) and 3 interchangeable \\&quot;caps\\&quot; that expose increasing amounts of surface area.</li>
            <li> my hair was long and it was ready to be removed.</li>
            <li> After my first time I have had minimal irritation post epillating</li>
            <li> Its much better than the daily irritation i was dealing with by shaving and the embarrassing red bumps everyday.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re plucking hairs from your skin at a remarkably high speed, so don&#x27;t expect a painless experience the first few times.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, spent more than $11 to ship it back and was asked by seller if I wanted a replacement item.  </li>
            <li> And every 2 days or so, I&#x27;d go back over my legs because new hair kept coming in, and I could never get all the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my upper legs is finer than the hair on my lower legs, so doing the upper legs doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all.     </li>
            <li> I had to go over areas a couple times, but this wasn&#x27;t really a problem since it appears to pull only the hair &amp; not the actual skin.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my face (cheeks, chin and upper lip), underarms and bikini area, but my legs are a different story.</li>
            <li> But this little epilator has left my skin in both areas BARE and SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> Of course it hurt the first time, especially under my chin, but the pain is short and getting rid of this unwanted facial hair takes me two minutes instead of 2-3 hours in the evening, which I used to spend to plug it.</li>
            <li> Second take a pain reliever 30 minutes before you start epilating, and third if you are 21 or older try a glass of wine or something to take the edge off.     </li>
            <li> The epilator was quite a bit painful, but I ended up using it as a trimmer/shaver and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The LED light really helps spotlight thin blonde peach fuzz.   </li>
            <li> So, here I am, clearly with a used epilator that was assembled from various spare parts...  </li>
            <li> It felt ticklish, not really that much pain at all.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re probably nowhere near as hairy as someone such as myself.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it on my arms, stomach and legs so far.  </li>
            <li> all of them barely visible.  </li>
            <li> If you ever do get around to trying your armpits you will be surprised how deep the hair follicles grow beneath the surface!  </li>
            <li> but I had it for different years and it became old.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace it with the same model, but it was an old model and not anymore on sale.</li>
            <li> So I developed a routine, to epilate and than to wax the next time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is far preferrable to waxing, however, especially on the bikini line.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is no different than the Emjoi, and is not as loud as husband&#x27;s electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> but you can bet your Braun that I am not letting this baby near my southern ladyparts...  </li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t that many to begin with and they were thin anyhow.    </li>
            <li> Larger head: the company website says that the new head is 40% larger.</li>
            <li> My hesitations were due to the fact that this model was a lot more expensive than other similar but un-corded models (up to 80% more</li>
            <li> You will get little red dots all over your legs (same is true for waxing)</li>
            <li> (be careful here, pull your skin extra tight because its easy to get it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; in the epilator.</li>
            <li> At first, I did experience some ingrown leg hairs, but I starting scrubbing my legs with a rough Japanese washcloth and using Amlactin lotion, which eliminated the problem.  </li>
            <li> After doing extensive research I decided to use this new Braun model based on previous reviewers&#x27; satisfaction with older braun models.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it grabs only part of the hair which is frustrating because I have a lot more hair on my thighs</li>
            <li> It hurts a little at first</li>
            <li> and my total lack of funds in general  - and also bc</li>
            <li> Having waited an entire month to remove any excess body hair (I was getting ready to send my money back if it wasn&#x27;t doing what it allegedly promised)</li>
            <li> That is way too much trouble that I am willing to take for getting this done.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So wax a few times first.  </li>
            <li> [really, I&#x27;d rather spend $2,000 on a trip to Europe or a down payment for a Vespa...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put off replacing my old Epilady for years because I thought all others would be the same, take as long to get all the hair</li>
            <li> The morning following, the red spots had faded considerably, to barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any apparent ingrown hairs from the last time I epilated (on my left arm).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any apparent ingrown hairs from the last time I epilated (on my left arm).  </li>
            <li> I just received this epilator a few days ago and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> It has become a good deal less uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The hair I grow grows back thickly and quickly.   </li>
            <li> But I did also wanted to keep up to date and take advantage of whatever other new features out</li>
            <li> So I thought that I could go without  using the epic for a few weeks and be free of my hair nightmare for at least that time.</li>
            <li> So I thought that I could go without  using the epic for a few weeks and be free of my hair nightmare for at least that time.</li>
            <li> And the depressing fact that for all my shaving and dealing with irritation my hair was already growing back by afternoon supper time (with a good razor)    if you struggle with thick hair, fast growth, and daily razor burn</li>
            <li> I do feel the retail price would be too high to pay since there are comparable epilators for much less.</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;re still painful to do, it&#x27;s not nearly so bad as the first time, and the area is so small that it&#x27;s over quickly.  </li>
            <li> Let me encourage first timers like I was, that the first time is a. painful enough becuase every single hair is getting pulled, not just new growth, and that the the irritation was only bad the first time because it was so many hairs at one time.</li>
            <li> I did it the next day, the next, and by day four had far less hair to pull and my skin had gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Several long minutes later, turned it on.</li>
            <li> First time is rough, but I did it over a few days</li>
            <li> I started with my lower legs, and although it was quite painful at times, I was able to completely depilate from my ankles to just above my knees.</li>
            <li> at least the first time-</li>
            <li> So if you have a hot date, do this at least 24 hours in advance</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this epilator is that I have a lot of trouble getting smooth underarms from it-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to do laser and I am too embarrassed to let the hair on my face grow long enough for a wax, and to tweeze it all would take hours.</li>
            <li> The process took a long time (about an hour to do both upper and lower legs)</li>
            <li> I tried this epilator on hair that was 2-3mm long on my left arm, during the evening (as indicated in the instructions --</li>
            <li> You get the same results as waxing, but save the money the long run, and you don&#x27;t have to take the time to work around the spa&#x27;s schedule</li>
            <li> it pulls even a flat lying hair..</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last just as long.  </li>
            <li> Meaning some will be long enough to pull out and some won&#x27;t be</li>
            <li> So far have not had any ingrown hairs or other complications!</li>
            <li> Though more expensive, it deserves every single penny!</li>
            <li> I can get much smoother legs when I shave, at least for several hours, than I ever did with this epilator.  </li>
            <li> I used it a bit on my bikini line - KILLED - and on my underarms - also KILLED - but it&#x27;s worth the pain in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair on my arms which is not very heavy</li>
            <li> After a few times (and several ice cubes and a few tears)  it has grown back so much lighter.</li>
            <li> This review is totally out of personal experience, not with the intention to degrade other products.</li>
            <li> Not only does it remove hairs painlessly (at least for me) but it does&#x27;t pull and pinch the skin like the older versions used to.  </li>
            <li> so I can focus on keeping the skin stretched and flat!!    </li>
            <li> I know the price is a little steep, but it was worth it for me, because I trust Braun Silk-Epil, and have been using it for the past 8 years.</li>
            <li> This is great for two reasons: 1) as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s less painful to epilate shorter hairs, so you can use the trimmer before epilating, and 2)</li>
            <li> and though it was still kind of painful (a tolerable pain), I did it.</li>
            <li> I realize now I could&#x27;ve saved 3/4 of what I spent for this gadget for a simple women&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought the Silk Epil as an alternative, figuring I would just have to use it 4 times to make the money back in what I would&#x27;ve spent at the salon.</li>
            <li> any outing your body hair always bother&#x27;s you as you have to wait a long to get it waxed.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to wait for your hair to grow long..</li>
            <li> I could have given this product 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for a couple minor things.</li>
            <li> A bit spendy for JUST a trimmer, but it worked well for a long time.</li>
            <li> At first I was annoyed with it because it wasn&#x27;t removing enough hair.</li>
            <li> The one thing that bothers me a little, is that the epilator can&#x27;t really grab hair which is less than 2mm long, leaving some stubble.</li>
            <li> The one thing that bothers me a little, is that the epilator can&#x27;t really grab hair which is less than 2mm long, leaving some stubble.</li>
            <li> Then there were some that were still deep down, that i&#x27;d have to use a needle to get out, and they were long and gross.</li>
            <li> In the mean time, I still much prefer this over the balancing act in the shower to shave with the risk of nicks.</li>
            <li> Usually, every 2-3 years I buy a new one, and now I am 35.</li>
            <li> I was sad that I had to let that one go, but excited that I got the chance to justify an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally always preferred silk-epil over all other hair removal systmes.</li>
            <li> But do I grow extremely course hair underneath my chin and along my upper lip?</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is so coarse that within hours of shaving I have sharp stubble.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was somewhat uncomfortable the first time, especially around the ankles, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> I can see thin and smooth hair growing which is unnoticeable in my private areas which earlier had thick, dark and coarse hair..    </li>
            <li> I am blond but have a lot of hair, which is brown and very long.</li>
            <li> I next did both underarms, which is significantly more painful than the legs.</li>
            <li> like i can use this directly on dry skin ...and get done with it ....where as with waxing...</li>
            <li> Did not read review recommending three alcoholic beverages prior to use, now understand the need, would recommend general anesthesia instead.     </li>
            <li> I tried waxing, but the hair breakage I was left with made the experience a total waste of money and time.   </li>
            <li> and it deserves every single</li>
            <li> (I expected this, I&#x27;m a PCOSr, not a typical fuzzy lady) but they are so few that even I am amazed...</li>
            <li> The only that one might can complain is that this one is a little bit more painful than mine prior ones.</li>
            <li> The swelling I talked about earlier with the armpits did go down.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely get the corded version as it takes around a half hour to do both legs</li>
            <li> but they do harm and it makes hair grow thicker..and the same itching, burning, black spots on the skin..e.t.c, e.t.c    </li>
            <li> (If you&#x27;re not a regular waxer, then the threshold of slight pain/discomfort may make you rethink this purchase...)  </li>
            <li> your as skin tight as possible.</li>
            <li> Pull your as skin tight as possible.  </li>
            <li> I saw some small red bumps a few minutes afterwards, then rolled on some PFB Vanish Skin Treatment (for avoiding ingrown hairs), and the red bumps lasted only a 4-5 hours or so.</li>
            <li> I placed this little wonder underneath my chin and within 60 seconds ALL of the extra hairs were GONE!</li>
            <li> You will wonder why it took so long to discover this!!!</li>
            <li> For the beginners, it might be little painful as you yourself pull every hair, but if you are used to waxing before, then that is not a big issue here, you feel like tickling sensation around .Surprisingly, the hair which grows back will be more soft ,thin and you don&#x27;t feel any burning or itching.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it hurt - MUCH more than waxing.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the most painful area to epilate.</li>
            <li> Hence, this model, albeit at least $100 more expensive than others I could&#x27;ve purchased, was my choice.  </li>
            <li> But, it wasn&#x27;t everythingi expected.</li>
            <li> In one review it said to use it everyday for 7 days as all hair grows at different rates.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few days ago from a local bed and bath shop.</li>
            <li> (it stings but thats expected, and the benefit of hair gone in 60 seconds?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my underarms every three weeks every summer for the last few years - which adds up money-wise.</li>
            <li> Be careful..</li>
            <li> Epilate periodically over the next few days to acclimate to the sensation.  </li>
            <li> I am going to keep going with my arms, I think I will only have to use it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Though its a little less painful when you get it done from a professional beauty parlor, its always not feasible and cheap also.</li>
            <li> So nice and round, pleasing to the eye, but difficult to hold with no good handgrips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved, waxed, and plucked, and figured plucking at an incredibly high speed couldn&#x27;t be worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty fast and little less painful.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much less painful and does a better job.</li>
            <li> In the last few years, the hair on my chin got darker and darker, now it is black.</li>
            <li> , I have been told that I have a high tolerance for pain, but something about this particular product and how it works just isn&#x27;t that bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> did not look or even wanted to consider any other brand).</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, it does hurt.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one other hint.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;No, thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out all the other accessories.   </li>
            <li> So even if you have a lower tolerance, you have other options to alleviate the pain.  </li>
            <li> After plugging in epilator have to take break due to spasmodic hand trembling.</li>
            <li> My pits on the other hand DO HAVE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER ever had problems with ingrown hairs due to shaving.  </li>
            <li> : the first time I epilated, I had 2 or 3 days worth of growth on my legs, and it was VERY painful, so I ended up shaving some strips on both legs just to have less hair to epilate and to lessen the pain.  </li>
            <li> It means that I grow excessive amounts of body hair than the average female, 2b)</li>
            <li> Since the armpit hairs grow in several directions, there is one small patch under my arms that I find it difficult to reach with the large head of the epilator.  </li>
            <li> This seemed a bit expensive at first, but then I calculated what I was spending on disposable razors and the time involved, this beats disposables hands down.   </li>
            <li> On your face, which I touch everyday, I notice every single hair.</li>
            <li> On your face, which I touch everyday, I notice every single hair.</li>
            <li> Turns out it was not a good experience, and after 3 weeks of really trying hard to like it, I&#x27;m giving up on it.  </li>
            <li> While it is slightly uncomfortable the first few times, it becomes unnoticeable with continued use.    </li>
            <li> Today every woman is using one or the other way of hair removing products and methods and always ending up in a mess..  </li>
            <li> it will not leave skin with dark spots.    </li>
            <li> totally not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Initially you should go slowly so that you get accustomed to the device as well as  to the pain.</li>
            <li> Now I am a woman with coarse and thick leg hair.</li>
            <li> If you go very slowly, and run the epilator over the same spot a few times, you basically get every hair -- and I only paid a little over $100 for this item.   </li>
            <li> so your skin has time to settle down.     </li>
            <li> They roll up and down, but scratch a bit if you move side to side.</li>
            <li> THIS BRAUN SILK-EPIL XPRESSIVE IS A HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> When my epilator needs replacing at some point down the road, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Having never epilated before, and haunted by my older sister&#x27;s exlamation of how the EpiLady she received back in the 1980&#x27;s hurt like hell, I was very wary about purchasing an epilator.  </li>
            <li> But like one of the other reviews on here, I have extremely pale skin, and extremely dark hair.</li>
            <li> The Braun SE7280 has helped me recover from my previous epilator trauma.</li>
            <li> It is less that what I had when i shaved.</li>
            <li> And I have less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It is less that what I had when i shaved.</li>
            <li> And I have less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This being the case, I could not care less (or see the value added) of a cordless option that you could use in the shower.</li>
            <li> the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> For the price of the epilators and the time they last (a few years at least)</li>
            <li> And with less pain.</li>
            <li> And third, the most disgusting of it all, there was a hair on one of the epilator heads.</li>
            <li> I had a previous one that lasted 9 years.  </li>
            <li> I run this over my legs in less time than it takes to shave.</li>
            <li> This epilator hurts way less than waxing.</li>
            <li> and you have less time to go to a saloon or waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waxing in saloons cost way expensive and if you are particularly concerned about saving also.</li>
            <li> When I was an insecure Jr. High girl I STILL DIDN&#x27;T SHAVE my legs or armpits because of the pain involved.</li>
            <li> Granted, yes, no matter how hairy I am it does not change the fact that there is a small amount of estrogene and progesterone floating around my blood, thus hindering some of the bushy thickness from growing to the likes of my husbands in particular areas (I&#x27;ll just spare you the details and list em here: legs, face, &amp; belly), however, when I tell you I have never in my life known a woman hairier than myself and I am not being dramatic</li>
            <li> Since that epilator wasn&#x27;t too bad, I thought I would try a full size one for my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> If you like that and don&#x27;t want the mess then change over.  </li>
            <li> thick and dark skin becomes dark and rough.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving everyday and didn&#x27;t want to do laser treatments because of the super long wait time in between treatments where you are not allowed to shave, ew!  </li>
            <li> My husband kept coaxing me to go ahead and find a different one, he said there must be something wrong, maybe it was just worn out &#x27;cause it was taking soooooo long to do.</li>
            <li> like i said i been using it for a little over a year...</li>
            <li> I often catch that little area with the Philips Bliss.     </li>
            <li> So little that I don&#x27;t even bother to shave them.  </li>
            <li> This little device has solved that problem.</li>
            <li> -nothing has kept those ferocious hairs from growing back this slowly in all my hair removing days (since I was 14 baby!)    </li>
            <li> Be warned, ingrowns can get infected and that is really dangerous, especially if they are on the back of your legs</li>
            <li> all hair was gone in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> but it saves a few steps...</li>
            <li> few helpful hints:&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> EXFOILIATE AND MOISTURIZE EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> IF YOU DON&#x27;T EXFOILIATE EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Using this product for a few months...</li>
            <li> I stopped for a few seconds to gather my breath</li>
            <li> I was really tired of using such products and methods..</li>
            <li> After a few years, I tried the underarm area.  </li>
            <li> it will probably take a few months for those areas.      </li>
            <li> What took me ages before, took me a few minutes today.</li>
            <li> Waste lots of time, water, and razors that way, but maintain my sanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not brave enough to use this on my underarms yet.   </li>
            <li> Exfoliation helps with ingrown hairs and also to slough off dead skin cells so your skin will shine and be at</li>
            <li> (and yes, this all takes place with brand new razors each shave, expensive razors, loads of shaving cream, not pressing hard, etc.</li>
            <li> Not as bad as first time at all.     </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it was so painful that I screamed.</li>
            <li> After removing the visible hair that first day, it&#x27;s never been as painful.</li>
            <li> and because those hard black hairs often couldn&#x27;t be removed with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It hurt quite badly to remove the hair on my upper lip initially, but I think that too will improve with time, like waxing.    </li>
            <li> Maybe it is less painful for other ladies out there, but it is hard for me to believe that somebody would choose to epilate in the shower with all the steam and dim light.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate this about myself and have always been self conscious, never wanting peple to see my face without make-up, and have my face bee touched too late in the day as I would already get a little growth back by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have very little to no hair on my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> You simply can&#x27;t yank hairs out of your body by the root without having the skin get angry and revolt against you in response.</li>
            <li> i am not sure</li>
            <li> I found it helpful to keep going over an area until I could feel that no more hair was being removed.</li>
            <li> My feminine 5 o&#x27;clock shadow was no more within maybe 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I tried using an epilator many years ago, and found it horrible.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s gonna save us money and a few trips to his hairstylist!    </li>
            <li> I calculated the amount that i usually pay for waxing my legs once a month and realised that the epilator will pay for it in about 8 months.</li>
            <li> but of course it is not safe used in that way.  </li>
            <li> Contemplate alcoholic beverages, as it is ten in the a.m. consider this ill advised.</li>
            <li> I vaguely remembered seeing some epilators back in the eighties, but never tried one.  </li>
            <li> It is no more painful than gently exfoiliating with a loofa.</li>
            <li> I would be so lazy with shaving, this is a life-saver.  </li>
            <li> Also, it has a small hum when in use but not at all noisy.</li>
            <li> but after a few weeks it started to slow down, and within on year it was impossible to properly epilate.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really not that bad, especially if you have gotten waxed before.  </li>
            <li> It really does make a big difference in the pain - the tugging feeling is awful.</li>
            <li> But I found the newer version to be extremely painful when compared to the older one even though I am used to epilation.</li>
            <li> I find that my hair removal is quicker and less irritating if I stick with the attachments that have the nubby rollers on either side of the epilating window.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the third time, and it seems to be less painful with each use.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a bit of the bikini area just to test it out, and oddly enough it&#x27;s not as bad (for me) as the legs are, at least the lower half of my legs.</li>
            <li> I used it on the bottom part of my legs just fine, but tried it on the bikini area and it was just too awful.</li>
            <li> But I do have to say that it has a hard time getting all the hairs I want pulled.</li>
            <li> But I do have to say that it has a hard time getting all the hairs I want pulled.</li>
            <li> Is it hard on me?</li>
            <li> I did notice that this is getting dull after 2+ years.  </li>
            <li> WOW was it painful.</li>
            <li> I always take out hair as soon as they pop out, that way it hurts the least.</li>
            <li> (in my bathroom, by myself, of course) has spared me for years on those insecure days when I just felt like the world knew my hairy secret and couldn&#x27;t even wait another day for it to grow back in order to wax.     </li>
            <li> Well, after 12 years of using the Braun epilators, I can say that the hair on my legs, and underarms are sparse to say the least.  </li>
            <li> It removes hair (mine at least)</li>
            <li> that is as least 0.5mm in length.</li>
            <li> But company promised me a refund for late delivery</li>
            <li> That being said I still thought WAXING hurt AND NEVER went for a wax without at least taking a pain killer and meeting with the girls for before or after drinks.     </li>
            <li> and I have been using them for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> but i think its like slowly acclimatizing myself to it...</li>
            <li> just slow and take your time...</li>
            <li> Needless to say I never completed my bikini area due to that.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with watery/tearing eyes though!</li>
            <li> Could not do without it now --- no more shaving legs and underarms in the shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 in the past, but nothing compares to this one!</li>
            <li> My first reaction was that it was just too painful to use!</li>
            <li> I mean seriously, if I can&#x27;t do this then I have no business trying( I read that from one review).</li>
            <li> The underarms, however, hurt so badly that I could barely finish the job.  </li>
            <li> The first use was VERY painful.  </li>
            <li> It might seem scary to do thefastest setting, but it hurts less.     </li>
            <li> Serious.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to maneuver under the armpits.  </li>
            <li> When one area became too painful, I moved to a different one.</li>
            <li> Do I feel ugly and gross because of it?</li>
            <li> talking to a friend, she told me how she bought one years ago and sent it back because it was too painful to use...</li>
            <li> Waxing was extremely messy or expensive, and pulled my skin causing bruising.</li>
            <li> Its definitely less painful than waxing at home and its not at all messy like the wax also.</li>
            <li> (I needed to let it rest between legs as it would tend to overheat and get weak)</li>
            <li> I also use it on my underarm hair which again was painful the first time and not as bad after.</li>
            <li> I had little red dots on my legs but they weren&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> so i am kinda confused about that...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been meaning to get an epilator for a while because I was tired of shaving.</li>
            <li> I got so tired of shaving EVERY DAY in the summer time</li>
            <li> I found it frustrating for heavier growth.</li>
            <li> I was scared after hearing from other people on how painful epilators can be.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be less painful on the shorter hairs on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull</li>
            <li> Is it as dramatic as it sounds?</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s probably less painful on the legs.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smoother and easier to use, less painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> It was a little painful but tolerable to use on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have tried shaving and waxing my legs and chin, but it was awful and expensive to have done professionally.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> BUt sadly   </li>
            <li> I have used epilators for years, and this one is the least painful.</li>
            <li> I did the waxing thing for a while but stopped because it got too expensive, and I had regrowth within a week.</li>
            <li> I found that to be a bit silly and misleading.     </li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I was worried.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Epi-log (Sorry could not resist.): Have been using epilator for about a month now.</li>
            <li> Before this, my wife used to be miserable because she always used the traditional waxing products.</li>
            <li> I had used a previous braun epilator years ago and found it to be very painful</li>
            <li> if worse comes to worst and you can&#x27;t handle the pain, at least you can still use the razor head to shave.</li>
            <li> For years I have had to shave and tweeze, always afraid someone could see my embarrassing hair.</li>
            <li> Now I am afraid to even try it, but I will.</li>
            <li> I recieved it in the mail today, and I have been crazy waiting for it to come in.</li>
            <li> but I am sort of afraid of the pain.</li>
            <li> Very Painful in the start, but slowly you adapt to it.</li>
            <li> For years I had been afraid to use an epilator because my mom told me how bad the old-style Epilady hurt.</li>
            <li> well...at this point, my legs look so bad, I&#x27;m AFRAID to keep it up.      </li>
            <li> I have heard for years about how painful these products are--and since it was going to be either waxing (expensive!)</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT THAT BAD</li>
            <li> The underarms are just as bad.   </li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me.  </li>
            <li> How bad can this be?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even feel painful.     </li>
            <li> prettier\\&quot; (so I thought at the time) and every time I would feel regret because of the extremely painful ingrowns, rashes, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is painful.  </li>
            <li> But, not so painful that you can&#x27;t deal with it.  </li>
            <li> SO that may be \\&quot;painless\\&quot; for me may be painful for some...</li>
            <li> A bad product, which was painful, it took all day to epilate and after some months it doesn&#x27;t even epilate anymore.  </li>
            <li> Every woman knows waxing is painful.</li>
            <li> However I was disappointed when I tried it.</li>
            <li> Here is the link: [...]    </li>
            <li> Stupidly after two months, i wanted to try it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, based on the reviews, but I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly, but what an unpleasant surprise!  </li>
            <li> It was a very bad experience.</li>
            <li> The feet didn&#x27;t hurt (like I wrote before I used to wax for years), but some of the hair grew in very bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my legs anymore, but it is still very painful on my underarms--</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> HATE IT!</li>
            <li> This purchase was my worst experience buying on Amazon and, trust me, I&#x27;ve done A LOT of buying here.</li>
            <li> This is very painful!</li>
            <li> Ingrowns are awful.</li>
            <li> I have never used one before, and thought it&#x27;d be awful with the root ends.  </li>
            <li> And god was it awful!!!  </li>

            <li> This is my very first epilator. I used to wax myself at home, but the whole procedure would take time. Finally I decided to purchase Braun 7280 and regret I didn&#x27;t do it earlier. This thing does the job fast. I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this epitator. I&#x27;ve put off replacing my old Epilady for years because I thought all others would be the same, take as long to get all the hair, I&#x27;d have to do a hundred passes over the same spots, etc. Boy, was I wrong. My husband kept coaxing me to go ahead and find a different one, he said there must be something wrong, maybe it was just worn out &#x27;cause it was taking soooooo long to do. I finally did. I purchased the Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive. I love it. It only takes a few minutes, gets ALL the hair, has a conveniant light that helps see all the hair (I used to have to go out to my back patio to be able to see what I was doing) so now I can do my legs in the bathroom. I love that it&#x27;s corded (more power). I can&#x27;t say enough...great machine!</li>
            <li> I just received this epilator a few days ago and used it for the first time last night. Following the advice of other reviewers, I took a nice hot bath and exfoliated before using my Braun SE7280. I started with my lower legs, and although it was quite painful at times, I was able to completely depilate from my ankles to just above my knees. I found that if I kept working through the pain (and taking MANY deep breaths!), I started to get accustomed to the epilator sensation, which lessened the pain.     I next did both underarms, which is significantly more painful than the legs. Even the product manual highlights how sensitive this area can be. Once again, taking many deep breaths, I was able to do both underarms. When one area became too painful, I moved to a different one. Underarms do not have much surface area, so if you breathe through it, you&#x27;ll be done in no time!     Feeling triumphant, I depilated my toe \\&quot;fur\\&quot;. Yes, I said \\&quot;toe fur\\&quot;. Now finished, I took a cotton pad soaked in alcohol and rubbed all the areas. I had little red dots on my legs but they weren&#x27;t horrible. I went to bed without putting on any lotion and woke up with smooth, normal-looking legs.     I&#x27;m really impressed with the Braun SE7280. I did not have to repeatedly go over areas to remove hair, and the pivoting head allowed me to easily navigate with no pulling. The cord is a great length and I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about charging. I have only depilated once before: 20 years ago when I was in high school and \\&quot;had to have\\&quot; an Epilady. I could not suffer that torture and ended up giving it to my best friend. The Braun SE7280 has helped me recover from my previous epilator trauma. I will wait to see how my Braun holds up with subsequent use, so for now I will leave my rating at a solid 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Well, let me start off by saying this was a good purchase. But, it wasn&#x27;t everythingi expected. My hair problem is on my face. Years ago I tried have laser hair removal on my bikini area, lower back and bottom, and my chin, jaw area of my face. We started with everything except my face, and by the time I got to my face I had lost my job and ran out of money. But, I was able to make it to one appointment. I was told to prep by shaving, and so i did. This was the biggest mistake. After that appointment, Iran out of money and couldn&#x27;t go back. Well, the hair on my face grew back thicker everywhere. It was awful. For years I have had to shave and tweeze, always afraid someone could see my embarrassing hair. Not only that, I had so many ingrown hairs too. It has been a nightmare. Why have I been cursed with hair? I hate this about myself and have always been self conscious, never wanting peple to see my face without make-up, and have my face bee touched too late in the day as I would already get a little growth back by the end of the day.  Anyhow, it&#x27;s 5 years since then and I  finally came across the silk epil from braun. A lightbulb went on. I thought, wow, this could be it! I can&#x27;t afford to do laser and I am too embarrassed to let the hair on my face grow long enough for a wax, and to tweeze it all would take hours. So i read all the reviews, took all the advice into consideration, and bought it. In one review it said to use it everyday for 7 days as all hair grows at different rates. So I shaved the day before, and the next day, after a shower (best time to do it) I tried it. WOW was it painful. I suffered through and when I was done, was glad I did it. I did it the next day, the next, and by day four had far less hair to pull and my skin had gotten used to it. I did it through day 7. But what I realized, is that unlike the bikini area, arms, legs, I can&#x27;t have ANY hair grow back and bee visible. Meaning, if after 7 days you do this to your legs, you wouldn&#x27;t notice any real growth for a while. On your face, which I touch everyday, I notice every single hair. So I thought that I could go without  using the epic for a few weeks and be free of my hair nightmare for at least that time. BUt sadly&lt;br /&gt;no. I have to touch up daily. Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice. It is less that what I had when i shaved. And I have less ingrown hairs. So that is nice. But I do have to say that it has a hard time getting all the hairs I want pulled. I have to o back and tweeze some. It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be. Again, I would still say a good purchase.any real growth for a while. On your face, which I touch everyday, I notice every single hair. So I thought that I could go without  using the epic for a few weeks and be free of my hair nightmare for at least that time. BUt sadly   no. I have to touch up daily. Although, not all hair comes back at once which is nice. It is less that what I had when i shaved. And I have less ingrown hairs. So that is nice. But I do have to say that it has a hard time getting all the hairs I want pulled. I have to o back and tweeze some. It&#x27;s better than shaving, but not everything I wanted it to be. Again, I would still say a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for more than 15 years now. All have been Brauns. The last one I had just broke a couple of weeks ago and after years and year of intense usage. I was sad that I had to let that one go, but excited that I got the chance to justify an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little put off by the options available from Braun (I def. did not look or even wanted to consider any other brand). I am pretty particular about epilating and I have no pain or discomfort after all these many years of epilating and occasionally waxing (NO shaving! Why do women to that to themselves???). This being the case, I could not care less (or see the value added) of a cordless option that you could use in the shower. Maybe it is less painful for other ladies out there, but it is hard for me to believe that somebody would choose to epilate in the shower with all the steam and dim light.&lt;br /&gt;I had (still have) huge concerns about the battery operated versions as 1. I do not trust that they can be as powerful as the corded options 2. Epilating everywhere might take longer that the batteries last for; huge inconvenience to stop, recharge batteries, restart 3. it requires a lot more planning since batteries need to be charges ahead of time. That is way too much trouble that I am willing to take for getting this done.&lt;br /&gt;I considered purchasing an older version just because I thought that was the only way I could get a corded one. But I did also wanted to keep up to date and take advantage of whatever other new features out there.&lt;br /&gt;It took me more than 2 weeks to put things together and run into this model that is a new but corded model. And...unfortunately.. not that many shops had it available.&lt;br /&gt;My first order got canceled (products showed as being available on Amazon but 2 days later I was informed that it was actually out of stock). It took me a couple of more days to re-place the order with another vendor (this time the product was $50 more than the one that proved out of stock). My hesitations were due to the fact that this model was a lot more expensive than other similar but un-corded models (up to 80% more expensive).&lt;br /&gt;But now that I have used it, I can tell that this product is the best there is and it deserves every single penny.&lt;br /&gt;I got so excited about it when I unpacked the box that I wanted to test it right away. I meant.. test like in just testing it here and there for a quick couple of minutes. But I just could not stop... It was that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I did my research on different models, I could not care too much about the little light this model comes with. I though it was nice it had it, but that would def. not drive my decision. Though, having used it now, I can tell you that adding the light is the best idea ever! You see what you&#x27;re doing and the light helps you see which areas you need to focus on and then how smooth and hairless your skin is. It is pretty bright and nice. You&#x27;ll love it and pretty sure if you use it once, you&#x27;ll never ever want to epilate without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Than the epilator itself it&#x27;s great. Epilates quickly and easily every single piece of hair regardless of how small it is. I liked the speed too, though when doing my research I wished I could find a model that had 3 speeds instead of 2. But... I guess, this one is pretty fast anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to achieve a great result and likes the comfort of using an epilator whenever -without thinking about charging ahead. Though more expensive, it deserves every single penny!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I imagined - I thought I would be able to deal with the pain that I read about but I couldn&#x27;t.  I have waxed before but not regularly and someone did it to me rather than me hurting myself.  The shaver didn&#x27;t work for me either - It seemed to be working great, and I loved the light.  I finished shaving, got all lotioned up and went outside and then I noticed I missed lots of hair.  I have very fine hair and only need to shave once every 5 days, which may be part of the issue.  I may not have used this product correctly, but I&#x27;ve never missed that much hair with my Bic.</li>
            <li> This is not for someone happy with shaving.  The pain fades more with each use.  So wax a few times first.  If you like that and don&#x27;t want the mess then change over.  I would not use for the first time if you had not waxed your last hair removal.  It will hurt.  If you wax this will be a nice refreshing change.  No mess, easy touch ups, LOVE IT! I like the different head options.  I can not shave with a razor it is not an option, so for years have been waxing at home.  This is so nice no mess, worries about burns, and miss a spot it&#x27;s ok you can go back in a second.  I have to use it at night as the red spots don&#x27;t go away quickly on my skin.  Also the shaver hear is nice for when I forgot to do it the night before and still need to get rid of the leg hair.  This has defiantly made my life easier.  I use it on my mustache also. (that one however does make my eyes water every time) It does not get as close as I would like to the underside of my nose by tweezers take care of that.</li>
            <li> I have used epilators for years, and this one is the least painful. In fact, it is very easy on the skin. Be sure to pull your skin taut so it works more efficiently. It has multiple heads for different areas, which is nice. I didn&#x27;t care about the light when I bought it, but it actually does make a difference in seeing what you&#x27;re shaving. I am very pleased with this item. I do feel the retail price would be too high to pay since there are comparable epilators for much less. However, Amazon had it priced much lower which made it a great deal!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as painful as the ones from the 80s.  It didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  Works great on the underarms - all hair was gone in just a few seconds.  The legs are not as easy to rid of hair.  They aren&#x27;t silky smooth, but works well enough that you can&#x27;t see the hair without looking very closely.  And the hair that grows back isn&#x27;t as course.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.    [[ASIN:B0016GTOFY Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Corded]]</li>
            <li> I just got this delivered today from Amazon. For years I had been afraid to use an epilator because my mom told me how bad the old-style Epilady hurt. But like one of the other reviews on here, I have extremely pale skin, and extremely dark hair. Which also grows back extremely fast, and is pretty much all over me (thanks, genetics. Thank you SO MUCH). I did the waxing thing for a while but stopped because it got too expensive, and I had regrowth within a week. I wanted to give this a shot, and so far, I&#x27;m glad I did.     Like other reviewers have said, it does hurt. A lot. But it&#x27;s no worse than waxing from what I can tell, and I had a highly experienced waxer at the salon I went to. The light helps a lot to ensure that you got everything. You will have red bumps from the epilation at least the first time- but I had that from waxing too. You simply can&#x27;t yank hairs out of your body by the root without having the skin get angry and revolt against you in response. So if you have a hot date, do this at least 24 hours in advance so your skin has time to settle down.     I&#x27;ve done a bit of the bikini area just to test it out, and oddly enough it&#x27;s not as bad (for me) as the legs are, at least the lower half of my legs. The hair on my upper legs is finer than the hair on my lower legs, so doing the upper legs doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all.     The best part, for those of you fence-sitters out there who might be afraid to try this out, is the fact that this model includes a shaver head and a trimmer, along with the different attachments for the epilator itself. This is great for two reasons: 1) as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s less painful to epilate shorter hairs, so you can use the trimmer before epilating, and 2) if worse comes to worst and you can&#x27;t handle the pain, at least you can still use the razor head to shave. So it&#x27;s not a total loss if you just can&#x27;t handle the pain.     Oh, and one other hint. The epilator has two speed settings. It might seem scary to do thefastest setting, but it hurts less.     All in all, a great product. I&#x27;m very glad I bit the bullet and bought this.</li>
            <li> THis is a good epilator no doubt...it does hurt...i wont lie about that...i am not sure if if any better than my older braun epilator...i didnt quite realise that we cant regard this one and it has to be use plugged in...I read in one of the earlier reviews that the user had rechared it and then used it...so i am kinda confused about that...the trimmer..shaver...everything make it complete...its time consuming..but it saves a few steps...like i can use this directly on dry skin ...and get done with it ....where as with waxing...i do have to have a shower later..same for shaving...this is easier...i still have to this on my looser skin parts...and i know its not goin to be easy...but i think its like slowly acclimatizing myself to it...i dun think these epilators can every be pain free...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a few days ago from a local bed and bath shop. I had used a previous braun epilator years ago and found it to be very painful so I ended up throwing it out.  After reading reviews about this model I decided to give it another shot.  I was pleasantly surprised with the new model. I followed the directions that came in the package and even tried the pre-epilation wipes that came with the product.  I don&#x27;t know what they did as I did not feel the results that it said I should.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase more of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on my lower legs by the ankles as the instructions suggested.  I found this to be the most painful area to epilate. Holding the skin taught helped ease the pain but did not stop it.  I found pressing on the area with my free hand greatly helped (learned this at my local salon).  By the time I got to the shin area I was used to the pain and was able to finish without any problems.  The process took a long time (about an hour to do both upper and lower legs) but if I&#x27;m really hair free for 4 weeks it will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few helpful hints:&lt;br /&gt;Keep the hair as short as possible. I had let mine grow out thinking I would be able to get everything and not need a touch up in a few days.  I think the longer hair created more pulling.  I found it to be less painful on the shorter hairs on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pull your as skin tight as possible. This allowed the epilator to get to the shorter hairs much easier.  Although it is more difficult to do on larger areas such as thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely won&#x27;t wait until the hair fully grows in before doing this again.  I will give myself weekly touch-ups to help minimize the length of time it takes and to lessen the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a nice girly design and I found the light to be very helpful.  I was able to spot hairs in places that I missed previously.  I found it helpful to keep going over an area until I could feel that no more hair was being removed.</li>
            <li> My Mom keeps stealing this from me.,  This is the best epp. I&#x27;ve come cross yet and hope it becomes available again so I can get one for my mom, so she&#x27;ll leave mine alone.  The service and price were  great.  EXFOILIATE AND MOISTURIZE EVERYDAY OR YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS.  I DON&#x27;T CARE WHO YOU ARE OR HOW GREAT YOUR SKIN IS--IF YOU DON&#x27;T EXFOILIATE EVERYDAY YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEMS!!!</li>
            <li> This seemed a bit expensive at first, but then I calculated what I was spending on disposable razors and the time involved, this beats disposables hands down.   I do not need to shave as often!   My daughter was hesitant, but she tried it before her wedding and now I have to buy another one!</li>
            <li> Using this product for a few months...Loving it so far.Once you get used to the pain its good going from then. Just use anythig that helps you in reducing the pain. Its far better than going to a salon and can be used at the comfort of your home and  at your time and leisure. Initially  I was scared to death and could&#x27;t use it for more than 1 minute. But now its smooth sailing.     Overall a great product for someone like me who hates going to the salon.     Bravo Braun!!!</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this epilator to anyone who wants a simple and complete hair removal solution. It lets you trim, shave and take out hair completely. It&#x27;s fast, durable, safe and easy to use. I know the price is a little steep, but it was worth it for me, because I trust Braun Silk-Epil, and have been using it for the past 8 years. This model is better than the one I had before, because of its multiple heads, speed, the ease with which you can wash/clean it and fancy features like the wipes, smart light and shimmery body.    I&#x27;ve personally always preferred silk-epil over all other hair removal systmes. It&#x27;s not messy, doesn&#x27;t give you cuts or burns, doesn&#x27;t cause inflammations etc. and takes out even the tiniest and thinnest of hair, leaving you with perfect smooth skin that you can show off right away (without having to wait for the redness to go away like with waxing). It only hurts the first few times, but the more you do it, the less it hurts. I always take out hair as soon as they pop out, that way it hurts the least.</li>
            <li> The epilator is very loud at first but once I knew how it felt to use it I wasnt nearly as intimidated. I use it once a week and it feels great to not have to shave every day. I use it on my upper lip, my legs, and stomach. I find that the pre epilating wipes help desensitize a bit. I find that my hair removal is quicker and less irritating if I stick with the attachments that have the nubby rollers on either side of the epilating window. There is a pinching sensation but after a couple times I really did get used to it. I should use it 2 times a week so I can get the shorter level of hair that pops up about a day after I epilate. I suggest a ingrown hair serum or cream. I am trying princereigns serum. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> My Background:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have pretty fair skin (with some Asian) which is pretty sensitive, with dark hair. I have another epilator I used once or twice, several years ago. This is my first time epilating in several years. Keep in mind that I also have gotten my arms waxed once before (about 2 years ago), and sugared once before (about 2 months ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I tried this epilator on hair that was 2-3mm long on my left arm, during the evening (as indicated in the instructions -- gives time to disappear overnight). I first washed my arm/hand in warm water, then patted dry with a clean towel. Then I began epilating as indicated in the instructions. I&#x27;d move my hands to stretch the skin on my left arm to make it \\&quot;taut\\&quot; before epilating against the direction of hair growth, as indicated in the instructions. (I read the instructions before proceeding-- this is important). I had to go over areas a couple times, but this wasn&#x27;t really a problem since it appears to pull only the hair &amp; not the actual skin. It felt ticklish, not really that much pain at all. I saw some small red bumps a few minutes afterwards, then rolled on some PFB Vanish Skin Treatment (for avoiding ingrown hairs), and the red bumps lasted only a 4-5 hours or so. The morning following, the red spots had faded considerably, to barely noticeable. My skin is pretty smooth. There were a few missed hairs, but the light on the device helped me to see/catch most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I gave this product 4 stars, because it didn&#x27;t grab all my hairs, but maybe I am just super picky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  What I love most about this, is that I imagine that I can have smooth skin for longer periods of time compared to shaving. With methods like waxing, the hair needs to be much longer to be pulled, leaving you with periods of time where you have hair... but with epilating, I believe I can keep touching up whenever necessary, since it works on even very short hairs (like 3mm or so). I plan to post an additional comment for my post, on the long-term results. This is a good investment I believe, especially considering how much I spend money with shaving, and that shaving can cause nicks/cuts, unlike epilating (with a quality epilator like this one IMO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried this on my right arm recently, and on my left arm again. The second go-round on my left arm pretty much didn&#x27;t hurt at all (MUCH better compared to the first time!), and it left MUCH fewer red bumps than before - practically none. I applied PFB Vanish afterwards to both arms, to prevent ingrowns. I don&#x27;t have any apparent ingrown hairs from the last time I epilated (on my left arm).  The one thing that bothers me a little, is that the epilator can&#x27;t really grab hair which is less than 2mm long, leaving some stubble. My solution to this is to keep epilating on a more consistent basis. I like this better than shaving because it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut most of the hair off from the tip, and since it grabs most of them from the root, the hair which does grow back has more of a finer tip, resulting in less \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;-like feel.

            <li> I am from Europe, and I always used epilator since I was 15. Usually, every 2-3 years I buy a new one, and now I am 35. So, I used many different brands and types. However, I would like to share with you that this one is the best for me. The fastest and picks up the smallest hair. My legs never were this smooth before. The only that one might can complain is that this one is a little bit more painful than mine prior ones. However, it is probably because it works faster and picks more hair up in each second. Since I been using epilator in the past 20 years, the pain really does not bother me and I rather to have the job done quicker and better.   I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I really do love this epilator and prefer it over all to shaving. My only complaint which is likely not due to the product is that I struggle with ingrowns and many many while growing out get ingrown quite deeply and I end up spending 30 minutes scraping them to the surface before epilating. Also I have to do it more often than most because my hair grows quite quickly. So even with all the negatives stacked against me I still prefer this tot he daily razor burn I was having even with years of shopping for the best razor and best shaving cream. In the long run I save much more with this one time investment because the only razors that work for me were the mens 5 blade razor which is quite pricey for replacement cartridges.     Let me encourage first timers like I was, that the first time is a. painful enough becuase every single hair is getting pulled, not just new growth, and that the the irritation was only bad the first time because it was so many hairs at one time. After my first time I have had minimal irritation post epillating and it doesn&#x27;t even feel painful.     I also use it on my underarm hair which again was painful the first time and not as bad after. Its much better than the daily irritation i was dealing with by shaving and the embarrassing red bumps everyday. And the depressing fact that for all my shaving and dealing with irritation my hair was already growing back by afternoon supper time (with a good razor)    if you struggle with thick hair, fast growth, and daily razor burn I think this product is worth it :)</li>
            <li> To deal with increased ear hair... I bought the Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance... leaving my ears thoroughly plucked,clean,smooth and neat. I only regret not having one years ago. It&#x27;s easy to clean too.                         Craig</li>
            <li> PREFACE:  Alright, so lets get a couple of things straight:  1. When I say my hair is thick, course, and bushy I&#x27;m talking thicker, more course, and more bushy than some parts of my husbands body hair. Granted, yes, no matter how hairy I am it does not change the fact that there is a small amount of estrogene and progesterone floating around my blood, thus hindering some of the bushy thickness from growing to the likes of my husbands in particular areas (I&#x27;ll just spare you the details and list em here: legs, face, &amp; belly), however, when I tell you I have never in my life known a woman hairier than myself and I am not being dramatic (why would I want to be?!), please believe it!   2. I have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). That means a couple of things: 2a) It means that I grow excessive amounts of body hair than the average female, 2b) The hair I grow grows back thickly and quickly.   3. Yes, I DO HAVE A BEARD. Is it like my husbands? No, not at all. Is it as dramatic as it sounds? No, not at all. But do I grow extremely course hair underneath my chin and along my upper lip? Yes, I do. Is it hard on me? Yes, it is. Do I feel ugly and gross because of it? No, I don&#x27;t! I embrace my feminine 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and realize that life is wayyyyy too short to give a heck about whether or not my chin is hairless. Also, I&#x27;ve had it since I was 13 and I&#x27;m 24-11 years of living with hormone imbalance, its all just added bonuses of my life at this point. And, I&#x27;m a BIG believer in hair removal products however they come (except depilatory creams [i&#x27;d be a hairy lady-man any day of the week than put that poison on my face ever again] and electrolysis [really, I&#x27;d rather spend $2,000 on a trip to Europe or a down payment for a Vespa...hair is just hair, but life, well, it&#x27;s a whole heck of a lot more than hair on my chiny chin chin thats for darn sure]).  Moving Forward:  Since I never give reviews and covet any reviews on body hair removal products I want each of you who readthis to keep in mind that:   a) you&#x27;re probably nowhere near as hairy as someone such as myself.   b) if you are looking for an epilator just for basic hair removal, TRUST ME I&#x27;m SURE many if not ALL will work for you.   c) hair removal that involves pulling hair from the root of your body HURTS (go back to the days when plucking your eyebrows was new and/or you haven&#x27;t done it in a while-stings right??)    MY BRIEF HAIR REMOVAL HISTORY    Shaving: HATE IT! I NEVER SHAVE! When I was an insecure Jr. High girl I STILL DIDN&#x27;T SHAVE my legs or armpits because of the pain involved. I would cave once in a while and shave to \\&quot;feel prettier\\&quot; (so I thought at the time) and every time I would feel regret because of the extremely painful ingrowns, rashes, cuts, etc. (and yes, this all takes place with brand new razors each shave, expensive razors, loads of shaving cream, not pressing hard, etc. etc. etc.)     Waxing: I&#x27;ve waxed my face most of my post pubescent life. Waxing in painless for me, I&#x27;m an expert at it. It doesn&#x27;t cause ingrowns, it doesn&#x27;t cause rashing, it doesn&#x27;t cut me (when I was younger I would burn my face from heating wax too much, but haven&#x27;t done it in years) and it is easy. I don&#x27;t mind growing my hair out to wait for a wax.     Plucking: Handy dandy plucking is so great! Having those tweezers on hand to help maintain the beastly growth as it was awaiting its next waxing appt. (in my bathroom, by myself, of course) has spared me for years on those insecure days when I just felt like the world knew my hairy secret and couldn&#x27;t even wait another day for it to grow back in order to wax.     HONEST TRUTH:  Did it get the hairs?  Having waited an entire month to remove any excess body hair (I was getting ready to send my money back if it wasn&#x27;t doing what it allegedly promised) my hair was long and it was ready to be removed. I placed this little wonder underneath my chin and within 60 seconds ALL of the extra hairs were GONE! Just a quick stroke of this terror and they were gone, finito, hasta la vista baby!   Now, for those of us with PCOS (In my case, its severe) we know that the hair under our chins isn&#x27;t peach fuzz-its along the lines of a whiskery texture and when it is waxed more than likely you will also have to pluck to remove the many that just refuse to come out. Well, this Braun terror did not even need me to pluck (ok, I plucked 1 hair because it was in the crease of my neck and my Braun baby was having a hard time with it-but that hair was peach fuzzy anyway, so no biggy). After I finished my chin I went to my upper lip and BAM! all gone!   My feminine 5 o&#x27;clock shadow was no more within maybe 90 seconds. And when I tell you it was as (AND STILL IS AFTER 1 WEEK) smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt-believe it!   Some hairs have started growing back (I expected this, I&#x27;m a PCOSr, not a typical fuzzy lady) but they are so few that even I am amazed...and I&#x27;ve been waxing for YEARS-nothing has kept those ferocious hairs from growing back this slowly in all my hair removing days (since I was 14 baby!)    Did it hurt?  It feels like waxing but the pain lasts less, its over more quickly and is much easier. Don&#x27;t be a wuss! IT IS NOT THAT BAD and I&#x27;m hairier than probably 99% of you.   When I was epilating my thighs I stopped for a few seconds to gather my breath because it was stinging a lot. But that hair was so long that I knew I just needed to get rid of it first and it would be fine next time.     What parts did I epilate? and on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being pain free and 10 being my nightmare of shaving) how was the pain?  Face-2 (seriously, easy as pie)  Bikini Line-4 (be careful here, pull your skin extra tight because its easy to get it \\&quot;caught\\&quot; in the epilator. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when its caught, it stings a bit then burns afterward because the skin has been cut.   Upper thighs-7 (i had to stop and breathe at a couple points)  My lady V (aka vagina)-4 (it stings but thats expected, and the benefit of hair gone in 60 seconds? yes please!)  My lady lump in the back (aka butt [including inside crack] &lt;---hey, i&#x27;m just being honest)-3      OVERALL RATING:  5 stars! This miracle in an electronic rotating tweezer package is what makes my hairy life easy in the long run-and I&#x27;m thankful!   Now I have more of a reason to NEVER shave again.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something like this product so I don&#x27;t have to wax, pluck or shave my chin and upper lip.  It does a great job and is hassle free.  It hurts a little at first but it is so worth it.  Easy to travel.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am in my 30s and I have had keratosis pilaris on my skin forever. This basically makes me prone to ingrown hairs. I had mistakenly convinced myself that an epilator was the solution. Besides, it seemed most of the hairs it pulled, only broke off and when I tried underarms and groin area, it would often grab my skin too.. Ouch! Needless to say I never completed my bikini area due to that. Also, noticed that the \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; and \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t really change anything - they both operate simultaneously either way. I found that to be a bit silly and misleading.     In fact, I ended up just loving the shaver part. I realize now I could&#x27;ve saved 3/4 of what I spent for this gadget for a simple women&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2008 and am about to buy another one.  I&#x27;ve tried the Emjoi, but that doesn not work 1/2 as good as this one.  I did notice that this is getting dull after 2+ years.  But, it doesn&#x27;t matter, I still love it.  Love the light..it helps a lot.  I use it right after the shower and put a calming lotion on afterward. All epilator&#x27;s hurt a bit, but this one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as others I&#x27;ve tried.  And, the more you use it - the less sensitive you will be.  The old wives tale of the hait growing in darker is untrue.  You will love this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously this product is amazing.. i can&#x27;t put it in words... I&#x27;ve bought it from an airport back in Sep 2009 and I been using it since its been doing miracles to me.. i just ordered one for my sister. and i know if mine breaks i will def buy another one. also i use it under my arms n it doesn&#x27;t leave the under arm black or anything its seriously perfect... but not from first use. like i said i been using it for a little over a year... it leaves my under arm white, and hair dont come back out for a while. n the hair comes out very soft. i think its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars for epilation.  I tried using an epilator many years ago, and found it horrible.  However, decided to give it a go again, and this product truly works.  Yes, it is painful.  What do you expect when you pull hair out at the root? ;)  But, not so painful that you can&#x27;t deal with it.  Try taking a Tylenol an hour before you epilate, that may help.  For the legs, I find the pain bearable.  For the underarms, it hurts like a son of a b*tch!  I think that will improve with time though, as I used to wax my pits and it hurt the first couple of times and became easier later.  I also use this on my face.  I find it super effective.  To be honest, that is the main reason I got it.  It hurt quite badly to remove the hair on my upper lip initially, but I think that too will improve with time, like waxing.    If you are looking for a more affordable solution than salon waxing, this is for sure the way to go.    I don&#x27;t think the trimmer works well, but as that was not the reason for buying the product, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I have used two epilators from epilady the Braun works as well as the first one did when it came out in the 80&#x27;s, the spring coiled one. but that one tended to wear out, while I think this one will last. The Braun is stronger than my epilady corded  model which I just replaced (I needed to let it rest between legs as it would tend to overheat and get weak) the Braun does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the great reviews it received and because I&#x27;ve been a faithful user of Braun epilators for years, but wanted to see if the technology has improved in the last few years.  I wanted a corded version - no messing with batteries or low charge situations for me...  Hence, this model, albeit at least $100 more expensive than others I could&#x27;ve purchased, was my choice.  The item arrived promptly, but what an unpleasant surprise!  No invoice was included in the package.  Ooookey...  Not a big deal.  The item&#x27;s box was already unsealed.  Ooookey... Still not a deal-breaker.  Epilator came with a cord alright, BUT required an adapter included in the package.  What?! An adapter?! Why?! Ooookey...  Plug it in.  But the cord doesn&#x27;t stay in the epilator.  So, here I am, clearly with a used epilator that was assembled from various spare parts...  Contacted my bank asking them to cancel the transaction.  Long story short, spent more than $11 to ship it back and was asked by seller if I wanted a replacement item.  \\&quot;No, thanks! And please wave the 20% restocking fee because the item was already used - the box was unsealed when it arrived.\\&quot;  The seller did replace all the money, but here is the e-mail I got from them, \\&quot;Dear Customer, we have examined the item and this is a CORDLESS [my caps] item and the cord is for charging purposes and works fine and fits the item and charges well.  As a courtesy we will refund your account in full.\\&quot; WHAAAT?!  Then why are you advertising it as CORDED and charge an arm and a leg for it?! Stay away from the seller and do yourself a favor and buy Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil 5 Epilator.  Same technology, a lot cheaper AND corded.  This purchase was my worst experience buying on Amazon and, trust me, I&#x27;ve done A LOT of buying here.</li>
            <li> Anybody who says this doesn&#x27;t hurt is LYING! This is very painful! It does get the job done though, and my underarms have been hair free for over a month now. I used it a bit on my bikini line - KILLED - and on my underarms - also KILLED - but it&#x27;s worth the pain in my opinion. I find it helps to take a deep breath before you start and just move it as quickly as you can in a circular motion. I also brave it and use the highest speed - it&#x27;s quicker. I usually end up with watery/tearing eyes though! I imagine it&#x27;s probably less painful on the legs. In any event, 3 mintues of ridiculous pain is well worth it for months of hair free skin!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a men&#x27;s electric razor and I thought I should write a review on this product.  I don&#x27;t use it, but my wife raves about this everytime she uses it.  She said in the beginning, there is a bit of pain, but once you get use to it, its the best.  It removes hair completely and she has stopped using wax products.  This is ideal  for under arms and legs. I owned Braun products and they have always been flawless.  I think a very good product should receive a review.</li>
            <li> I had an older model and used it for 10 years till it started giving problems and decided to upgrade not expecting anything more than what I already had. This product is far superior with better technology and results that amaze me every time I use it. My skin is silky smooth and I do not have to use it weekly any more. Once every two weeks is sufficient! The price of this model was higher and we were a bit unsure about investing such a big chunk of change but now that I have it I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  While it is slightly uncomfortable the first few times, it becomes unnoticeable with continued use.    Could not do without it now --- no more shaving legs and underarms in the shower!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time using an epilator.  It was a little painful but tolerable to use on my legs.  Then I tried armpit and bikini area.  This was more painful, to be expected - but it works great.  Even the littlest hairs removed.      Easy to clean, and the cord is nice (no batteries needed)    I&#x27;m still trying to figure out all the other accessories.   I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed my underarms every three weeks every summer for the last few years - which adds up money-wise. I bought the Silk Epil as an alternative, figuring I would just have to use it 4 times to make the money back in what I would&#x27;ve spent at the salon. The first time I tried it, it was so painful that I screamed. I couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it hurt - MUCH more than waxing. I&#x27;m happy to say that I just finished my 4th time and the pain is now manageable. Not pain-free, but a similar level to waxing, which I can tolerate. Here&#x27;s how I did it:    1. Start on your legs to get used to the sensation. It&#x27;s unlike anything else.  2. Use it on as short as hair as possible. It really does make a big difference in the pain - the tugging feeling is awful. I shaved and then tried again four days later.  3. Pull your as skin tight as possible.  4. For me, turning my head and watching makes it more tolerable than watching it the mirror. Must be a psychological thing, but it is a big difference.  5. Take a deep breath and just plow through it. I hold my breath and take a pause between each pass. The pain dissipates quickly - within ten seconds.  6. Don&#x27;t wait for all the hair to grow back before epilating again. Hair grows in at vastly different rates, and it is much easier when the hair is sparse. I do it every week, and it gets easier each time.    Good luck!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0016GTOFY Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Corded]]    Good product, except for the noise it makes. Very Painful in the start, but slowly you adapt to it. Nice Performance.</li>
            <li> So i give this 3 stars because it does work. Pulls the hairs out very well. Its painfull. Really. I used it on the bottom part of my legs just fine, but tried it on the bikini area and it was just too awful. The underarms are just as bad.   Heres where the problems are. Ingrowns are awful. They literally covered the entire area of my lower legs after two months of use. So i stopped using it. I would nightly have to sit in a warm bath, then scrub my legs with a washcloth to loosen the hairs. Then there were some that were still deep down, that i&#x27;d have to use a needle to get out, and they were long and gross. It took two weeks to get all the visible ingrowns gone, and make my legs look normal again. Stupidly after two months, i wanted to try it again. Thinking maybe i need to exfoliate more, before and after epilating. Same results again. Its now sitting in my bathroom cabinet. A hundred bucks just sitting around.  Be warned, ingrowns can get infected and that is really dangerous, especially if they are on the back of your legs and you don&#x27;t see them.</li>
            <li> I have waxed for a couple of years.  Then I got the Philips Bliss Bikini with Epilator for my bikini area.  Since that epilator wasn&#x27;t too bad, I thought I would try a full size one for my legs and underarms.  After reading the many reviews, I settled on this model and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I was spending about $60 waxing my lower legs and underarms at the spa each time.  Inevitably, my underarms grew faster than my leg hair so I was faced with going to the spa just to get my underarms done or waiting until my legs were ready to get waxed too.  Now I no longer have that dilemma.    Pros:  The light is fantastic!  It really does create the right glow to catch your hairs.  I would definitely get the corded version as it takes around a half hour to do both legs and you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of juice.  You get the same results as waxing, but save the money the long run, and you don&#x27;t have to take the time to work around the spa&#x27;s schedule - you can do it when it works for you.  Cleaning is easy.    Cons:  It&#x27;s a little difficult to maneuver under the armpits.  Since the armpit hairs grow in several directions, there is one small patch under my arms that I find it difficult to reach with the large head of the epilator.  I often catch that little area with the Philips Bliss.     Not specific to this product, but a couple of notes about epilating.  You will get little red dots all over your legs (same is true for waxing) that take several hours to go away so do your epilating at night.  Also, like waxing, it can hurt, but your legs/underarms do become desensitized over time as you do it.</li>
            <li> I was scared after hearing from other people on how painful epilators can be.  It&#x27;s really not as bad as I thought.  It can be very intimidating, especially the look and sound but eh you get through it.  I&#x27;ve only used it on my arms, stomach and legs so far.  It does hurt, thats no lie but you&#x27;re not really gonna get a good at home hair removal treatment without pain.  With the pain, you get finer hair and I think it&#x27;s worth the trade.  I have a relatively high tolerance for pain so it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me.  I think most people can get through it as long as their skin isn&#x27;t too sensitive.  I&#x27;m Indian and have an abundance of hair but the pain was manageable.  I did not even do it after a warm shower or pain reliever or alcohol or the olay wipes provided.  So even if you have a lower tolerance, you have other options to alleviate the pain.  I heard waxing once first and epilating the hair that grows back helps a lot.  Also, you can use a numbing treatment.  Just make sure to wash yourself after to prevent ingrown hairs.  I think it&#x27;s really not that bad, especially if you have gotten waxed before.  Also, you can take breaks if it&#x27;s too much for you to do it one sitting.  Plus with it costing 100$, it really is cheaper than by shaving/waxing equipment each month.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I had an older Braun epilator that broke after dropping it.  This one is so much better.  It grabs even the smallest hairs and the light helps to see the area.  I only wish it would be chargeable so that you didn&#x27;t need the cord plugged in.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best epilator I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;ve owned 2 in the past, but nothing compares to this one! It&#x27;s got everything you could possibly want and need, and then some!    I love that it includes a light, a shaver, a trimmer, and the epilator itself is a wonder! It is not completely painless, I&#x27;ll be honest, but once you get used to it, it does the job beautifully.    I use the trimmer/shaver for my boyfriend&#x27;s sideburns, and he is abolutely amazed at how it works -it&#x27;s gonna save us money and a few trips to his hairstylist!    Definetely buy this product, you will not regret it!!!</li>
            <li> i thought it would be the best epilator ever, but no, it is very expensive, and sometimes does not remove the hairs, but cut them. is definitely not suggested.very painfull,.....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t as yet used it but if it does what it says I&#x27;ll love it !!</li>
            <li> Hi All...  Recently I have purchased Braun silk Epil- 7280,Xpressive.  I would like to share my experience with everyone, so that others might benefit from it.    Today every woman is using one or the other way of hair removing products and methods and always ending up in a mess..  I was really tired of using such products and methods..\\&quot;Shaving\\&quot; this is an instant method for hair removal but, that results last for just a jiffy..then starts burning, itching what not then the hair which grows back is thick and dark skin becomes dark and rough.  Next here comes in the list is \\&quot;Cream\\&quot; even they are also instant but they do harm and it makes hair grow thicker..and the same itching, burning, black spots on the skin..e.t.c, e.t.c    \\&quot;Waxing\\&quot; this is a best way, this removes hair from the roots..and  the hair which grows back is much lighter and  growth becomes less in due course,  but one has to wait for hair to grow long to get waxed again this not a solution .If you have a sudden party or any outing your body hair always bother&#x27;s you as you have to wait a long to get it waxed. Here instead of waiting for smooth skin you should wait for hair. Every method is included with pain, time and the result is nowhere to count.    From times I came across many devices and products but each of them have some or the other defects. I used to wonder that there should be something or some device which should work like waxing and remove hair from the roots without harming skin. At last I found a device which actually does what I used to wonder that is an \\&quot;Epilator\\&quot;. Now my research for epilator has begun..I read many reviews, rating and every time the rating and reviews have voted for one product as \\&quot;The Best\\&quot;, and that is undoubtedly \\&quot;BRAUN\\&quot;.  Whatever model you select in Braun it has got its own way of satisfaction.    My model   is \\&quot;Xpressive -7280\\&quot; chorded. This is a very handy model, fits perfectly in palm and  can use with lot of comfort. The massaging rollers play a very big rolewhile epilating..they gently massage and epilate hair without much pain.. it pulls each and every hair..even the shortest hair is not spared..For the beginners, it might be little painful as you yourself pull every hair, but if you are used to waxing before, then that is not a big issue here, you feel like tickling sensation around .Surprisingly, the hair which grows back will be more soft ,thin and you don&#x27;t feel any burning or itching. Sometimes you may notice ingrown hair..but if you use scrubber ,pumice or anything, those ingrown hair comes out of the upper layer of the skin and you can epilate it. Be cautious if you have thick and strong hair, as this  may pain a little more.     Initially you should go slowly so that you get accustomed to the device as well as  to the pain. I have used it twice till now, I have already mastered in using, I even try on my sensitive areas   of course, and it hurts but worth bearing..I can see thin and smooth hair growing which is unnoticeable in my private areas which earlier had thick, dark and coarse hair..    I titled as an Excellent enemy for hair..because you can really see how it works on hair on the body..it pulls even a flat lying hair..you don&#x27;t have to wait for your hair to grow long..it will not make your skin darker like shaving..it will not leave skin with dark spots.    I hope this review will help the beginner&#x27;s .Enjoy smooth and glowing skin with Braun.    I am totally satisfied with Amazon delivery services..it was timely and so apt.Thanks to amazon.    Note: This review is totally out of personal experience, not with the intention to degrade other products.</li>
            <li> Just want to say I have been using epilators for about 12 years, and the Braun products are the very best. Yes, it will hurt a bit when you begin using it.  My strategy was to start using it on my leg areas that weren&#x27;t so sensitive, then work on more sensitive areas as I got more and more used to it (ie, the curve in your foot/ankle area, etc.)  After a few years, I tried the underarm area.  Ok...so that can cause some tears maybe...but again, go slowly and over time, you will be successful.  It is definitely true that once you start using it on hairs that are softer when growing back, it is much more comfortable.  You can use this same process on the bikini area...just slow and take your time...it will probably take a few months for those areas.      The best news?  Remember being warned that if you pluck your eyebrows too much, the hair will eventually not grow back?  Well, after 12 years of using the Braun epilators, I can say that the hair on my legs, and underarms are sparse to say the least.  That is true.  Keep plucking away, and over time you will have fewer and fewer hairs.  For someone who has decided that this is the way to go for removing hair for the rest of my life...not a big deal to wait for the eventual permanent removal!  The other really good news?  For the price of the epilators and the time they last (a few years at least)...You will save an incredible amount of money on razors, cream, etc.     I am ready to buy another epilator, and this is the one I&#x27;ve picked.  All I can say is buy a Braun, they are the best.  Tried Panasonic...rechargable...Not even close in comparison.  By the way, I would suggest always buying a CORDED eipilator...you don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of power!</li>
            <li> Yes, it definitely hurt at first. I had a good amount of stubble on my legs, but I took my time over a couple of hours and went to work. There are 2 power settings (low &amp; high) and 3 interchangeable \\&quot;caps\\&quot; that expose increasing amounts of surface area. As per the instruction booklet, I started off using the lower power setting with the \\&quot;beginner cap.\\&quot; By the end of the evening, I had it on full power using the \\&quot;efficiency cap.\\&quot; You do get used to the pain. Understanding that hair doesn&#x27;t grow at the same rate, I&#x27;ve been using it almost on a daily basis because I want to remove as much hair as I can from the root so that I can enjoy having hair-free legs for an extended period of time. It&#x27;s true that your legs will not feel as smooth when compared to shaving, however you can walk bare-legged over many days with no noticeable stubble and applying lotion right after helps to make them feel a lot smoother. I have sensitive skin and by the end of my first session, my legs looked like I had shoved them into a hornets nest. I had the same experience when I had my legs waxed and the esthetician said it was a histamine reaction. It goes away within an hour or so. I shave my entire leg and I got different results in each area using the epilator. The epilator removes the courser stubble on my lower legs with no problem at all. It doesn&#x27;t take just a portion of the hair; the entire hair with the follicle bulb is removed. However, the hair on my thighs is light and thin and has never grown in course and the epilator is not as effective on hairs like that. Sometimes, it grabs it and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t and sometimes it grabs only part of the hair which is frustrating because I have a lot more hair on my thighs and I like them hair-free. That&#x27;s my reason for giving it only 4 stars. I have yet to master the epilator around the knee area, but you just have to experiment. I also found that if I change the direction of the epilator, I get better results. Rather than using like a razor shaving from the ankle to the knee, I go sideways, diagonally, and from the knee towards the ankle. In summary, I love it and wish I had found one of these a long time ago. After removing the visible hair that first day, it&#x27;s never been as painful. But, again, I use it regularly so there&#x27;s never been that much hair to remove all at once. I have only shaved once over the last couple of weeks. I like the light which does help to see what you&#x27;re doing, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud. If you&#x27;re working on an area that&#x27;s \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; (like my inner thighs), pull the skin taut or it can pinch - oweee). If anyone has a trick for epilating around the knees, let me know.</li>
            <li> I usually am accustomed to waxing my legs and decided to buy an epilator and did my research and found that this was the best corded epilator.  However i have to warn you that although i was accustomed to waxing my legs, using the epilator hurt more than waxing but i kept on using it and am getting more accustomed to it now. The product says hair free for up to 4 weeks or so, that isn&#x27;t true because i use my epilator at least once a week despite this this epilator works well although it makes a lot of noise when it is on. I also like the shaver attachment to shave when i dont feel like epilating.  I calculated the amount that i usually pay for waxing my legs once a month and realised that the epilator will pay for it in about 8 months. I must say that when buying an epilator make the extra sacrifice to buy a good quality one even if it is a little more pricy then others on the market, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> I am black so the hair on my legs are pretty shrt and fine. I used to shave, then wax for for a year) then realized I am throwing my money away. Bought this and I am pissed that I did not get it sooner. My threshold for pain is medium. Upper thighs are a bitch since they hurt a tad bit...but everything else is fine.  It removes hair (mine at least) that is as least 0.5mm in length. Serious. Just have to take your time and angle the machine properly</li>
            <li> ok. I haven&#x27;t tried my epilator yet, but i have turned it on to see how loud it is.     It sounds like a lawn mower!! Now I am afraid to even try it, but I will. I recieved it in the mail today, and I have been crazy waiting for it to come in. I have read many reviews over Braun epilators. They seem to be the highest rated epilators in the world. I have not heard of a better brand.     In reading all of those reviews I have heard of some tips. One thing, if your a woman if you can&#x27;t do this then how are you going to have kids. I mean seriously, if I can&#x27;t do this then I have no business trying( I read that from one review). Second take a pain reliever 30 minutes before you start epilating, and third if you are 21 or older try a glass of wine or something to take the edge off.     Me, I know I will be turning my music on tonight so no one can hear that lawn mower sound and my screams of pain. Well, hopefully I won&#x27;t have to scream of the pain.     I will try to do another review to tell you how it went.     Later!</li>
            <li> I have heard for years about how painful these products are--and since it was going to be either waxing (expensive!) or getting one of these, I thought I&#x27;d try it...&lt;br /&gt;After talking to a friend, she told me how she bought one years ago and sent it back because it was too painful to use...When I told her I wanted to use it not only on my legs, but under my arms and bikini area, she gasped in horror.  So, needless to say, I was worried.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today, and I used it right away, just out of the shower...&lt;br /&gt;It was no big deal!  I have never used one before, and thought it&#x27;d be awful with the root ends.  It was not \\&quot;fun\\&quot; and I did feel it, but doing my legs was no big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bikini area and under my arms was pretty challenging, though--it did hurt, but not unbearable.  (I did break out in a sweat after awhile...)&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have been told that I have a high tolerance for pain, but something about this particular product and how it works just isn&#x27;t that bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Once I get into a good routine, it can only get even easier as time passes...&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been meaning to get an epilator for a while because I was tired of shaving. I finally just bit the bullet and did it.    I am happy with this epilator- it doesn&#x27;t make you perfectly smooth but it does good enough. I have a feeling that as time passes and I have been epilating longer I&#x27;ll be smoother, since your hair does grow at different rates and epilating is supposed to make it scarcer.    My only complaint with this epilator is that I have a lot of trouble getting smooth underarms from it- it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a very good job of picking up the hairs, even when I move it in all different directions. I think I might need to talk my boyfriend into doing the actual epilating so I can focus on keeping the skin stretched and flat!!    Pain wise, I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with my underarms and my legs only hurt the first time I did it, but that is going to be something that differs with each person.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews about it after my loyal old Remington died after ten years of hard work.  However I was disappointed when I tried it. The pivoting head only goes in two directions and frankly is not of any use. Plus the feature that is supposed to massage the skin actually limits the gripping areas for the tweezers .It works much better with that part off but of course it is not safe used in that way.  I will be shopping for a better one soon.</li>
            <li> I have used Braun epilators for over 15 years. Have been more or less happy as they did the job...until i \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to The Silk-Epil Xpressive 7280.  I don&#x27;t know if it was my particular epilator or not, but after a few weeks it started to slow down, and within on year it was impossible to properly epilate. It never did a thourough job. I was about to go back and buy a Braun Xelle, when I decided to read all the review and found out about the Emjoi Emagine AP18. I ordered it on mazon, got it today and...I am in heaven. What took me ages before, took me a few minutes today. And with less pain. Can it be? I am so happy that I waned to post a review immediately for both items. OMG, this Emjoi is fantastic!   Good luck!</li>
            <li> My wife found it great. Only thing that makes it 1 less to the best is the delivery time. But company promised me a refund for late delivery and I think this happens once in a while with every company. Still my experience is overall satisfactory.</li>
            <li> The product is good especially the add ons that I have received with this purchase viz, the shaver and the strips etc. I have been using Braun epilator for more than 5 years now and wanted to replace my old one, though working, with a new version. But I found the newer version to be extremely painful when compared to the older one even though I am used to epilation. I wonder why?</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a body hair-phobe. Shave in all areas (legs, bikini, underarms) daily. Waste lots of time, water, and razors that way, but maintain my sanity. I saw this epilator when it was a gold box deal. Had a Christmas gift certificate, so thought, \\&quot;why not?\\&quot;     In all my years (and there are getting to be distressingly many of them) I have never epilated or waxed in any of the relevant areas. My sister-in-law once described her bikini wax in infinite detail - enough to put me off body waxing for good. I saw a friends epilady years ago and immediately recognized it as an implement of torture. So I slogged along year after year with my daily defoliation. Until I saw this new creation. It looked practical, sounded reasonable and the reviews were good - so I bought it.     Day one - tried it out on the kids and husband first. (Never said I was a saint.) Kids said that it \\&quot;tickled\\&quot; and pinched a bit. Husband screamed in agony. Decided to trust the kids.    Day two - after a hour of yoga and deep breathing plugged in the device. Several long minutes later, turned it on. Hesitantly applied it to my lower leg. (Leg hair with one days growth, naturally.) In general pain level was very mild, mostly a pinch and a pull, unfortunately I experienced no tickling. Once I a while there was a \\&quot;YOW\\&quot; moment, but nothing to go on about. Success, I love my epilator.    Day three - Legs remain pleasingly smooth, will move on to problematic underarm and bikini areas. How bad can this be? Answer: Very. Did not read review recommending three alcoholic beverages prior to use, now understand the need, would recommend general anesthesia instead.     Days four, five and six - ponder impending sale of nightmare inducing epilator. Will anyone in their right mind buy an used epilator?    Day seven - notice offensive leg hair is returning. Eye epilator. Begin yoga and deep breathing sequence. After plugging in epilator have to take break due to spasmodic hand trembling. Contemplate alcoholic beverages, as it is ten in the a.m. consider this ill advised. Tenatively begin use, after first pass regain enthusiasm. Not as bad as first time at all.     Resolution - will continue to use on leg area. Bikini and underarm areas will remain unmolested.     Epi-log (Sorry could not resist.): Have been using epilator for about a month now. It has become a good deal less uncomfortable. Have found that using it after soaking in a hot tub is best. The hairs come out easily and with minimal pain. So far have not had any ingrown hairs or other complications! (Note: still limiting use to leg area - wimpish character remains intact.)</li>
            <li> Amazing item.. no pain.. just a bit when you start but you get used to it fast, you dont realize it after a 1 min. the hair takes weeks to grow back.. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I vaguely remembered seeing some epilators back in the eighties, but never tried one.  Didn&#x27;t realize they were still around until I stumbled onto this one on Amazon.  Decided to take a chance and am so glad I did.  This is so wonderful--why isn&#x27;t it advertized better so more women can know about it?  The hair on my legs is so coarse that within hours of shaving I have sharp stubble.  With the epilator, this problem is eliminated.  Yes, it was somewhat uncomfortable the first time, especially around the ankles, but no big deal.  After that first time, I haven&#x27;t really experienced any further discomfort.  The underarms, however, hurt so badly that I could barely finish the job.  Although they&#x27;re still painful to do, it&#x27;s not nearly so bad as the first time, and the area is so small that it&#x27;s over quickly.  At first, I did experience some ingrown leg hairs, but I starting scrubbing my legs with a rough Japanese washcloth and using Amlactin lotion, which eliminated the problem.  I use the epilator once a week (probably takes an hour to do arms and legs) while watching television.  The hair that grows back is softer and finer and not at all prickly.  The light is a great feature, it really helps to see what you&#x27;re doing.  I now wear shorts for the first time in my life, and would have given this product ten stars if possible.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The item itself is wonderful. Been using for more than 10 years now (different versions, of course) BUT when I got my package well, first, one side of the box was opened and retaped. Second, not all the contents had the plastic package covering them. And third, the most disgusting of it all, there was a hair on one of the epilator heads. I&#x27;m suspecting that this has been used and returned, no idea. Be careful.. best if you buy things straight from the store.</li>
            <li> This brand and the product itself is wonderful.  I had a previous one that lasted 9 years.  So I&#x27;m hoping that this one will last just as long.  This  newer one is more comfortable to use even.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to use this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I owned an old silk epil which i liked, unfortunately (or fortunately :-)) it broke so I bought this one and what a difference with the one I had! It is a lot smoother and easier to use, less painful and I can even do my under arm and the bikini area! it is fast and a lot more efficient!  I totally recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Wow! I don&#x27;t know if I will ever stop gushing about this products.  I go to the salon once a month to get a full \\&quot;take it all off\\&quot; bikini wax.  It tends to add up, but I have been ok with paying someone else to take care of my business... That is until I discovered how easy and painless this is!  I ordered this product for my armpits which I have had struggled with.  I hate shaving everyday and didn&#x27;t want to do laser treatments because of the super long wait time in between treatments where you are not allowed to shave, ew!  But I digress.    I have very little to no hair on my arms and legs.  So little that I don&#x27;t even bother to shave them.  (No I&#x27;m not a hippy)  For real, I have like maybe 12 hairs on each leg all of them barely visible.  So I started there.  One leg at a time.  At first I thought the thing must be complete garbage because all I felt was a tickle, no pinch, nothing.  I checked, double checked, searched, sure enough those hairs were gone.      Well no big deal... There weren&#x27;t that many to begin with and they were thin anyhow.    On to the pit!  I had shaved them yesterday so they have 24 hours of growth.  My pits on the other hand DO HAVE HAIR.  They have a 5 o clock shadow all their own to be exact. Quick swipe of the Olay wipes, deep breath.  Mixed sensation of excitement and fear.      PAINLESS!      Albeit... there was a tiny bit of blood and swelling.  If you ever do get around to trying your armpits you will be surprised how deep the hair follicles grow beneath the surface!  I was.  I got most of the hairs and decided to give it a rest.  From what I have read epilation takes days.        The bikini area did hurt a little in some areas more than others but nowhere near as much as it hurts at my salon does a very good wax.  Also the pain went away instantly as soon as I was done with each section as opposed to the discomfort I get after waxing.  I was also able to get all areas by myself in hardly anytime at all.      The swelling I talked about earlier with the armpits did go down.  Everything looks just beautiful now.    Disclaimer: I am used to the sensation of having my hair pulled out... SO that may be \\&quot;painless\\&quot; for me may be painful for some... That being said I still thought WAXING hurt AND NEVER went for a wax without at least taking a pain killer and meeting with the girls for before or after drinks.     Thank you.  If you enjoyed my review please say so.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product!   I got so tired of shaving EVERY DAY in the summer time just so I can wear shorts, capri&#x27;s, or a dress.   The first use was VERY painful.  For me, it was worth it.  I just used it for the third time, and it seems to be less painful with each use.   If you go very slowly, and run the epilator over the same spot a few times, you basically get every hair -- and I only paid a little over $100 for this item.   I tried waxing, but the hair breakage I was left with made the experience a total waste of money and time.   I paid $150 for a full leg wax and bikini wax last year before I went on vacation, and still ended up shaving the whole vacation just so I could wear a bathing suit every day.   I&#x27;m not brave enough to use this on my underarms yet.   The best advice I can give is to use this in the late afternoon when you&#x27;re not going to leave your house -- you are left with tiny red spots where the hair gets pulled out, but this is gone by morning.  By the third use, the red spots almost had disappeared before bedtime.   I hope you find this review helpful.</li>
            <li> This is such a savior when comparing to shaving.  It does hurt the first time, but it is much like that of waxing.  Much cheaper than waxing!!!  I am hooked.  I have had years of problems with shaving my legs and I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this Braun SE7280 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator, I read the glowing reviews of the earlier model (Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle). Over 500 people gave it a 4 or 5 star rating. That was impressive. I decided that between those two models, it was worth paying a little more for the swiveling head, narrower lighter body style, and Olay wipes. This is also sealed so that you can run it under water to clean. I like to use rubbing alcohol to keep the tweezers free of any body oils so it can grab even super fine hairs. The LED light really helps spotlight thin blonde peach fuzz.   Does it hurt? I enjoy using the epilator on my legs that has medium-thick dark brown hair. It is no more painful than gently exfoiliating with a loofa. My face and arm pits are more sensitive. It feels pokey like little zaps of static electricity. There are star shaped beads that stimulate the skin before the hair is pulled. They roll up and down, but scratch a bit if you move side to side. I was so happy with it that I convinced my 16 year old daughter to try it. We used the Olay wipes before, but she still couldn&#x27;t hold still because she said it hurt.  I could have given this product 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for a couple minor things. It actually could be user error, but I still find super fine baby hairs after going over the area a couple times. I exfoliate and moisturize with an alphahydroxy acid lotion, but still have some ingrown hairs. This might improve as I become more experienced with this gizmo and my skin gets used to epilation. In the mean time, I still much prefer this over the balancing act in the shower to shave with the risk of nicks. I run this over my legs in less time than it takes to shave. Waxing was extremely messy or expensive, and pulled my skin causing bruising. This epilator hurts way less than waxing. No amount of advertising could have convinced me to buy this, I have to thank the reviewers here at Amazon for the details and honest insight.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you i have been using epilators since the mid-80&#x27;s.  I got an EpiLady in the mid-80&#x27;s. After chasing myself around the house yelling &#x27;ouch ouch ouch&#x27; the first few times, i really learned to like it.  Since then, i have had 2 Emjoi&#x27;s.  Going to Emjoi from EpiLady was like going was like going from sleeping on a rock-bed to a motel.     My current Emjoi has cracked heads and the cord feels like it is going to break but, it keeps doing its job.  And to keep with the scenario, this latest Emjoi (now 6-7 years old) was like going from a motel to a hotel.      Because the Emjoi is seemingly on its last legs, i decided to try the &#x27;NO!&#x27;. It was a lot of money to smell burning hair!  And, it was not as effective as i had hoped. It is a very sensitive gadget and is really easy to burn yourself.   That combined with the fact that you had to sandpaper your legs, etc... afterwards to get smoothness, i decided to ditch it and get another epilator.    I was going to go for another Emjoi when i saw a review here that compared the Emjoi to the Braun.  Knowing the quality of Braun products, i decided to try it.  I used it first time last night and was more than impressed.  It is a bit noisy,  but decided i could stand the noise for the job it did. It was fast, needed few passes, and no pain (held off doing anything for a month while deciding what to do, so my legs were indeed ready for a trim (TMI :)). I was happily stunned.   The Braun SE7280 is like going from a hotel to a full service resort!!!   Well worth getting.</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators to remove leg hair for almost 20 years and have tried 4 different products during this time: the epilady, another braun product, an emoji product and this braun silk-epil. Each worked better than the one before. This is the BEST product yet. It is efficient, effective and fast.  It works more similar to a razor than any other product. My only regret is that it is not cordless, like the emjoli, a feature i found to be very useful.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it - although it hurts a lot until get used. Recommend the product good results!!</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this epilator at my request for Christmas.  It is by far the best epilator I have ever used and I have been using them for at least 20 years. Not only does it remove hairs painlessly (at least for me) but it does&#x27;t pull and pinch the skin like the older versions used to.  The best thing for a traveller like me, is that this epilator is \\&quot;Dual Voltage\\&quot; and can be used anywhere in the world.  THIS BRAUN SILK-EPIL XPRESSIVE IS A HANDS DOWN WINNER!!!</li>
            <li> The best way to compare this product is to say it is similar to the difference between skin that has been shaved with a razor vs. skin that has been shaved with an electric razor.  When using an electric razor you can never get the true silky smooth feeling that a regular razor offers.    This product pulls the hair out entirely, unlike a razor that cuts it off at the surface.  Therefore it will take a while to grow back (unlike shaving which grows back daily).  However, all of the hair in one area is not all on the same growing cycle.  Meaning some will be long enough to pull out and some won&#x27;t be and yet some will still be beneath the skin about to erupt through the surface.  Laser hair removal has been the most successful for me - so long as it was done at a true dermatologist&#x27;s office and not a \\&quot;spa\\&quot; that is \\&quot;affiliated\\&quot; with a doctor.  I have done both and the lasers are much stronger at the true doctor&#x27;s office.  The reason I purchased this product was to remove the small fine blond hairs that cannot be removed by laser.  It worked very well on my face (cheeks, chin and upper lip), underarms and bikini area, but my legs are a different story.</li>
            <li> I almost bought this on another site for over $100 but found the same thing for much cheaper on Amazon. This epilator has so many improvements from the last model. It&#x27;s easier to clean, the design doesn&#x27;t let the motor get clogged up with hair and it&#x27;s much less painful and does a better job. I give it a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at BB&amp;B with a 20% coupon over 6 months ago and use it about once a week.  I would be so lazy with shaving, this is a life-saver.  My hair grown in really soft and never stubbly.  I use it on my legs and my underarms.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my legs anymore, but it is still very painful on my underarms--so I always use the Braun pre-epillation wipes.  In fact, I just had to order some more from Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere.  Like I said, my hair grows in really fine and soft.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!! Why didn&#x27;t I get one sooner?! I have tried shaving and waxing my legs and chin, but it was awful and expensive to have done professionally. But this little epilator has left my skin in both areas BARE and SMOOTH. What about pain, you may ask? It&#x27;s not so bad. But I have not tried it on underarms or anywhere else. That, I will have to see about later. By the way, the hair growth on my chin was beginning to look like a lawn and my eyesight was too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me to keep up with plucking (even with a x15 mirror and bifocals). This little device has solved that problem. My chin is smooth and bare at last!!</li>
            <li> If you are a regular waxer, then this is just for you!  You will wonder why it took so long to discover this!!! (If you&#x27;re not a regular waxer, then the threshold of slight pain/discomfort may make you rethink this purchase...)  But nevertheless, I am THRILLED about this.  Years ago - maybe 20? - when electric epilators 1st came out, my mother bought one.  And god was it awful!!!  And that&#x27;s what stuck with me all these years.  Then I came across the electric epilators again, so I decided to check out what Amazon had and read the various reviews for the different kinds available.  When all was said and done, I figured that just bikini waxing alone was around $25 each time.  So if I used this on JUST my bikini area 3 times, it will have paid for itself. So I bought it.  I liked this one because it had a pivoting head much like my razor AND it was corded (not a rechargeable battery).  (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)  Suffice it to say, with just 1 use, this little thing has already paid for itself as I used it on my legs, arms, arm pits (this caused the most discomfort, but it only lasted for a minute or so in the beginning.  Then it was tolerable...) and bikini area.  If I had gone to a salon to have had all of this done, I would have paid close to $100 anyway in 1 shot.  And here I am on day #4 and no noticeable/visible stubble anywhere.  And I am especially impressed that the area that caused me the most initial discomfort (arm pits) is the one I am most pleased about! My pits are still soooooo smooth!  I am very happy!  :o)</li>
            <li> Received my Braun epilator a couple of weeks ago and had the chance to use it a couple of times on my legs, under arms, and bikini line. Although I have to do many passes to finally get all the hair, it beats shaving, and setting up my wax warmer! When used on my legs it does take my breathe away at first, but I did get use to it. Underarms and bikini line were easy-peasy since I&#x27;m a regular waxer I&#x27;m sure. Over all, I&#x27;m really pleased with it! :o)</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator. I have had another model of Brown and I was very satisfied with it, but I had it for different years and it became old. I wanted to replace it with the same model, but it was an old model and not anymore on sale. So I tried with a model of Panasonic. It was a very bad experience. A bad product, which was painful, it took all day to epilate and after some months it doesn&#x27;t even epilate anymore.  I tried than to find another one,of course I return on my beloved Brown and I trusted on reviews this time...and it was fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t even believe that it worked in such less time, so fast and with such a wonderful epilation. I can&#x27;t even describe how happy I am now, after months and months of trying to epilate in vain with the panasonic model. In a very short time, this one epilates and shaves perfectly, without leaving any hair. I agree with anyone who says it hurts, it&#x27;s true, but if you are trying to choose something for epilation, the process itself is hurting, so in every kind of epilation it will actually hurt.   This is the best product I ever used and I hope it will last in the same conditions it is now.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and saw that some people had problems with ingrown hair, bumps and the like, but I was hopeful.  I&#x27;m one of those people who shaves in the morning and has stubble by the same evening.  It is such a pain to have to shave every single day to have something like smooth legs, and with the promise of smooth legs for extended periods of time, I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  Turns out it was not a good experience, and after 3 weeks of really trying hard to like it, I&#x27;m giving up on it.  I see people recommending \\&quot;stick with it for 1-3 months\\&quot; on some websites...well...at this point, my legs look so bad, I&#x27;m AFRAID to keep it up.      My experience: the first time I epilated, I had 2 or 3 days worth of growth on my legs, and it was VERY painful, so I ended up shaving some strips on both legs just to have less hair to epilate and to lessen the pain.  I figured that as the hair grew back in the strips, I could go at it with the epilator, and I&#x27;d never have to do all the hair at one time.  I couldn&#x27;t take the pain.  So...the sections I epilated were covered in red bumps, just as advertised, but it faded, more or less over night. Well, the red faded, but my legs stayed bumpy.   Then I waited a few days for more hair to grow in where I had shaved, and then I epilated again....more red bumps...but I figured I&#x27;d get used to it and I&#x27;d stop getting bumps.  The thing is, my legs never felt smooth.  I kept feeling stubble, even after I epilated.  Stubble and bumps.  And every 2 days or so, I&#x27;d go back over my legs because new hair kept coming in, and I could never get all the hairs out.  I epilated the way I mow the lawn, back and forth, then horizontal, then at a diagonal...Still, I could never get all the hairs out.  And my legs stayed bumpy and stubbly. They stayed red and bumpy for 8 or so hours after epilating, then the red would go away, but the bumps didn&#x27;t.     I was determined to stick with it for a month or two, but after 3 weeks, despite doing exfoliation, on top of stubble and bumps, I realized I had a gazillion ingrown hairs!  I have NEVER ever had problems with ingrown hairs due to shaving.  So, after three weeks, I show my red, bumpy, stubbly legs (with ingrown hairs) to my husband and said, \\&quot;why am I doing this?\\&quot;  I can get much smoother legs when I shave, at least for several hours, than I ever did with this epilator.  And the ingrown hairs??  I&#x27;m still working on those.      Conclusion:  totally not worth it.  I wish I was one of those people singing the praises of the epilator, but absolutely nothing good came out of my 3 week experiment with it.  I just hope my legs go back to normal after I start shaving again!  Ugh.</li>
            <li> The epilator was quite a bit painful, but I ended up using it as a trimmer/shaver and it worked great. Lasted me a good few years and comes with lots of attachments, a built in light, and low/high speed settings. A bit spendy for JUST a trimmer, but it worked well for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am blond but have a lot of hair, which is brown and very long. I also have a beard, especially on my chin, which I have been plugging or waxing for years. In the last few years, the hair on my chin got darker and darker, now it is black. If I don&#x27;t plug it for two days you can see the beard in full bloom. I stopped waxing because I couldn&#x27;t stand the humiliation in the beauty parlor anymore and because those hard black hairs often couldn&#x27;t be removed with the wax.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered that epilator because of the great reviews and haven&#x27;t regretted it once! I NEVER USED AN EPILATOR BEFORE. I grew up in Germany and knew that Braun is a very good and reliable brand. I love the light in the front. It makes all the hair easy to see, even if your light in the bathroom is not as good! I use the epilator for my legs and my face. Of course it hurt the first time, especially under my chin, but the pain is short and getting rid of this unwanted facial hair takes me two minutes instead of 2-3 hours in the evening, which I used to spend to plug it. The feet didn&#x27;t hurt (like I wrote before I used to wax for years), but some of the hair grew in very bad. So I developed a routine, to epilate and than to wax the next time.&lt;br /&gt;My face is a success. It takes me two minutes to epilate the hair which took me over 3 hours to plug. The hair is getting thinner and lighter....and it takes longer for the hair to grow back. I am very positive that there will come the day where my pink new best friend will be in the cupboard most of the time!&lt;br /&gt;The epilator comes with another head for trimming! It is worth every cent!!!! I highly recommend it to anybody! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I was use to silkepil, but mine was really old. I decided to get this newer version, and I just love it. It is pretty fast and little less painful. I get my hair back in about 20 days.</li>
            <li> Now I am a woman with coarse and thick leg hair. Shaving wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;ll still have black dots on my fair skin afterward, and waxing often is too much of a pain. I was resigned to just wearing long jeans most of the time until I found out about epilators. After doing extensive research I decided to use this new Braun model based on previous reviewers&#x27; satisfaction with older braun models. I only used this once and I would say that it is much better than shaving or waxing. At first I was annoyed with it because it wasn&#x27;t removing enough hair. Then I realized that it was because I wasn&#x27;t using it at a 90 degree angle to my skin, so people, don&#x27;t be like me and read the instructions. After I adjusted my method, the product removed most of the hair in one stroke. I did not feel much pain during the process probably because I waxed a couple of weeks before. I think this is the best way to start using this product. First wax, then use the epilator every two weeks or so depending on your needs. That way you won&#x27;t feel pain. Oh, and use it close to the skin or you&#x27;ll pull the hair and that&#x27;ll hurt.</li>
            <li> This works very well for light hair growth. I found it frustrating for heavier growth. i think consistent use will improve its performance.</li>
            <li> The epilator is what I was expecting. It works great, it&#x27;s very comfortable, looks awesome!!! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Having never epilated before, and haunted by my older sister&#x27;s exlamation of how the EpiLady she received back in the 1980&#x27;s hurt like hell, I was very wary about purchasing an epilator.  I&#x27;ve shaved, waxed, and plucked, and figured plucking at an incredibly high speed couldn&#x27;t be worse than waxing.  After reading the reviews and tips (such as shaving in the shower, then starting with the first epilation), I am exceptionally pleased with this product and my experiences.  Epilation does hurt.  You&#x27;re plucking hairs from your skin at a remarkably high speed, so don&#x27;t expect a painless experience the first few times.  It is far preferrable to waxing, however, especially on the bikini line.  I was apprehensive about trying it on my underarms, but it worked fine.  Probably the weirdest sensation to overcome is the fact that it felt a bit incisive at first (go figure...you&#x27;re pulling hair out of your follicles).  After my fourth time epilating underarms, legs, bikini line, tops of toes (don&#x27;t pretend ladies don&#x27;t get hair there), I experienced very little discomfort and had acclimated to the sensation.  The shaver function works well, too.  All parts and pieces are easy to clean, and the products is no louder than a typical electric shaver.  It even travels easily.  My recommendations for first time epilators:    Hot shower to soften hair, shave, then epilate anything left.  Epilate periodically over the next few days to acclimate to the sensation.  Once you&#x27;re used to the feeling, give yourself a full grooming (whatever that consists of for you).  If you&#x27;re like me and have persistent, robust hair, you can expect to repeat the process in about five days.  The hair does grow back finer each time, and I expect a longer duration in between epilations as use continues.  Also, be sure to exfoliate daily.  I use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Citrus Spice Exfoliating soap on all epillated surfaces to avoid ingrown hairs.  Again, a MUCH better experience than waxing!!</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews about the different brands and models. I chose this one mainly because of the reviews. I have waxed and tweezed for years, and was ready for the &#x27;pain&#x27;. I was pleasantly surprised and am very happy with my choice. I was leaning towards a cordless model, but after reading reviews about how quickly the battery tends to be depleted, I decided to go with the corded model. This also was an excellent decision on my part.   I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i did alot of research before buying and this one was the right one for me....a bit pricey but well wort every penny use it onece a week just to be extra smooth. had it sence xmas of 2011 still working fine recomended it to all the ladys in my fam.</li>
            <li> Works really great. First time is rough, but I did it over a few days so it wasn&#x27;t so bad.  It is so great not having to shave all of the time (every few days).  With this it is every couple of weeks, touch up only.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get into the pros and cons of epilating vs. shaving vs waxing except to say that for me, epilating is a perfect solution.  Having done it for years (since they were first introduced), pain is a non-issue and redness is minor and disappears with a few hours. Epilating is definitely something that you build a tolerance for over time and repetition.  I bought this model to replace an Emjoi Optima. I had two complaints about the Emjoi. (1) the shape: So nice and round, pleasing to the eye, but difficult to hold with no good handgrips.  The only places to get a good grip on it were the buttons that release the blade head.  (2) The blades are placed in a slightly concave configuration, which is great for legs, and not so great for pits and bikini line.    About the Braun.  I think it&#x27;s perfect for what it is supposed to do. Easy to grip, and while epilators in general may tend to miss finer hairs on the first pass, this one seems to get more in fewer passes than the Emjoi.  I could take or leave the light, I don&#x27;t think it helps that much.  The noise level is no different than the Emjoi, and is not as loud as husband&#x27;s electric shaver.  It comes with different switchable heads, including a \\&quot;Beginner&#x27;s Head\\&quot;, but I just use the one that came pre-installed.    This is my 3rd epilator and it is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought this after much research and reading a lot of reviews. Before this, my wife used to be miserable because she always used the traditional waxing products. Every woman knows waxing is painful. I always saw her in tears after her waxing exercise. Though its a little less painful when you get it done from a professional beauty parlor, its always not feasible and cheap also. Waxing in saloons cost way expensive and if you are particularly concerned about saving also. I am writing some comments from my wife below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after I bought this for her, she did not quite liked my idea in the beginning. But once she used it, she absolutely loved it. Its definitely less painful than waxing at home and its not at all messy like the wax also. Thats the big advantage. You can use it just before you are leaving for a party or so and you have less time to go to a saloon or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has few other attachments for trimming and stuff which are good too.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to clean and easy to store. the product includes a nice little pouch to store it. Its compact in size than its other competitors and light in weight. So its perfect for traveling too. The package also includes some Soothing Wipes which are great. The wipes make your skin very smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attachments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimming attachment is very useful. Massage system is not that effective. The smart light is a great help in low light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, based on the reviews, but I absolutely hate it. I regret buying it.  I have given birth twice, and do think I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, but it hurts, hurts, hurts to use this. I may have more hairs on my legs than most women, but I don&#x27;t even use it because it hurts that bad.</li>
            <li> Love my Braun epilator. I opted for the corded model because I read too many complaints about the rechargeable battery dying or not being powerful enough. It gets most of the hair (I sometimes miss the finer ones but the light helps a lot), legs stay smooth for a good while and the head can be rinsed under water. I tried it on my underarms this weekend. The first time hurt like a #$%^&amp;@ so I stopped. After a good night&#x27;s sleep, I felt brave enough to try it again and though it was still kind of painful (a tolerable pain), I did it. Am very pleased but you can bet your Braun that I am not letting this baby near my southern ladyparts...  When my epilator needs replacing at some point down the road, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun SE7280 about 3 years ago. I planned on using it on my legs as an alternative to waxing. I thought it would be great to avoid the time and money that I spent going to the salon. I also have dark facial hair and thought maybe this would be great for that issue as well.    My first reaction was that it was just too painful to use! I used it on my face (I&#x27;m brave!) and arms (couldn&#x27;t finish it hurt so much). The result was a ton of red bumps and I thought I&#x27;d never use it again....until the next day when the redness and small bumps disappeared and my skin was SMOOTH and FLAWLESS! I couldn&#x27;t believe it.    I continued to use it on my face but adapted the routine to using a facial loofah the day before and numbing the area with an ice cube right before use. The results were fantastic - gone were the dark course hairs. I even hit the peach fuzz around my jaw just to see what that would look like - HUGE difference. I have noticed that the hair grows back much more fine and smoother over time. The difference is very noticeable. Strangely enough, it hurt more to do my arms so I gave up on that until recently. I have dark hair on my arms which is not very heavy so it never bothered me that much - until I decided to try the Braun epilator on it and see what it would be like. At this point, I&#x27;m a pro with the machine and decided that an ice cube would do the trick. And it did! I just can not believe the difference in what my arms look like - they are SO SMOOTH. After a few times (and several ice cubes and a few tears)  it has grown back so much lighter. I am going to keep going with my arms, I think I will only have to use it every few weeks. My boyfriend actually said the other day that he never noticed how great my arms were.....not sure about that but we all know that I didn&#x27;t tell him what I&#x27;ve done. Better that he thinks I&#x27;m a magical creature who is naturally flawless.    I&#x27;m so happy with the results of my face and arms that I really want to move onto my legs and underarms but I am sort of afraid of the pain. YES, this hurts. It feels like pin pricks, really nothing more but it still hurts. It&#x27;s a lot less painful than waxing. Waxing is faster and is over quickly and someone else is doing it which is the upside. However, I think that an epilator is better in the long run for your skin health and overall condition so I&#x27;m sticking with it. Since this model that I&#x27;m reviewing is 3 years old, I am looking into getting a newer model that has some great updated features. I can&#x27;t afford it yet but I&#x27;ll share what I&#x27;m looking at (I did a TON of research when I bought this bc of the price and my total lack of funds in general  - and also bc I want the best) That said, I&#x27;m sticking with Braun bc I am happy with how this Braun SE7280 model has performed and I trust the brand in general. I also think one of their newer models looks amazing: the Braun Silk-epil 9 Skin Spa. Here is the link: [...]    Reasons why I&#x27;m upgrading:    1. WATERPROOF! As stated, I&#x27;m planning on doing my legs and I have heard that using the epilator in water is PAINLESS. I can&#x27;t believe it is totally painless but that is what the reviews are saying. If so, jackpot. I&#x27;d love to do my legs, arms and underarms that way.    2. Larger head: the company website says that the new head is 40% larger. That means more area is covered at once - which narrows the gap with waxing and will save a little more time which is always great. The shorter the beauty routine, the more we are likely to stick to it!!    3. EXFOLIATION BRUSH! No explanation needed! But I will explain nonetheless. ;) Exfoliation helps with ingrown hairs and also to slough off dead skin cells so your skin will shine and be at it&#x27;s best. I&#x27;m using a loofah regularly and we all know that regular loofah or skin brushing is one of the most important factors to having great skin!!    4. FACIAL BRUSH! What a great extra bonus!! Facial brushes range from $30 - $300 depending on what you buy so thisis a great extra feature. I&#x27;m so excited about it. ESPECIALLY, since I&#x27;m using the epilator on my face as well as my body. My face (includes my neck) is really the key thing that I focus on, the rest of my body is just a great, great bonus for me. As said above, I won&#x27;t be able to afford the Silk-epil 9 for a few months but I will definitely post a detailed comparison review when I get it.    Final words for people considering this product or switching to epilation for hair removal: definitely try it. Braun is a great brand. Epilators are ultimately better than waxing and shaving. It is better for your skin health, promotes smoother skin without the damage of waxing. It is also amazing to be able to remove unwanted hair at home rather than be chained to your salon - especially if you are going away with your boyfriend to South America for 4 weeks and you want him to think that you&#x27;re naturally perfect. The machine is small and packs beautifully in a bag. Also, it has a small hum when in use but not at all noisy. Overall, great product. Consider my reference to the enhanced model I talk about in this review when making your purchase decision. I think the upgrades featured in the 9 would boost my experience to 5 stars.    GOOD LUCK!!</li>
