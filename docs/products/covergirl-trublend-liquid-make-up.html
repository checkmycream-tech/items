            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing make up.</li>
            <li>It just makes my face look like one smooth even skin tone (the way GOD intended it to be), kind of like the way your face was when you were a kid.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I will be surely buying again with no doubts,</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>This will last a good while!</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>The shade I have is too light and in addition the product is too runny.  </li>
            <li>Worth it !</li>
            <li>I absolutely just love covergirl liquid make-up.  </li>
            <li>it was true to my shade.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>how fast it came, not to mention the price was insanely cheap for such good brand + quality</li>
            <li>, Its goes on evenly and gives a smooth natural look also its definately shine free.</li>
            <li>The only plus about this product that makes it better than the clean liquid foundation is the pump.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good makeup but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li>and you dont really know your wearing make up!</li>
            <li>nice price, I have to mix it because i ordered the color too dark.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product it wasn&#x27;t oily and a little darker than what i needed nonetheless I can use powder to make it lighter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about make up, but I just so happened to try this kind a few years ago, and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>my face was very oily.</li>
            <li>It really does blend with your complexion</li>
            <li>My item ship super fast I received my package so quick it was really unbelievable</li>

            <li>If you are looking for a natural type of look this is the foundation for you.</li>
            <li>I ordered this in the color tawny and it turned out to be darker than the clean liquid foundation version which is what I usually use.</li>

            <li> The product arrived earlier than I expected and wrapped well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to try anything new because this foundation fits my face like a glove!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing for the last few years.</li>
            <li> Only need a small dab to cover the face.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve got a wrong shade, my fault.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes, and I have scars/blemishes from pimples that I get every now and</li>
            <li> The skin tone is a wee bit dark</li>
            <li> I am redoing my feedback due to I make an error on previous feedback few hours ago.</li>
            <li> I dont usually wear makeup</li>
            <li> was anxious to see if it matched my shade and it did even when it dries</li>
            <li> But then when I tried to use it as a contour, the foundation had a weird texture and you could see 2 colors as if its components were breaking down.</li>
            <li> Anyway I tried it only once on my face and my skin broke out really bad.</li>
            <li> I picked wrong color, cannot use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that i&#x27;ve got a wrong color for me</li>
            <li> It very thin and does not cover anything.  </li>
            <li> and it stinks.</li>
            <li> Then I offered it to one of my friends with darker skin, she swatched it on her hand and it stained her hand like crazy</li>
            <li> Horrible it looks like it expired already</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing came 10 shades darker, pissed.</li>
            <li> works great!! I dont usually wear makeup but i got this to try and i love it. it&#x27;s light and you dont really know your wearing make up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about make up, but I just so happened to try this kind a few years ago, and I have been using it ever since. My friend always asks me if I am wearing Mac. And I tell her, this is the same make up I&#x27;ve been wearing for the last few years. I have dark circles under my eyes, and I have scars/blemishes from pimples that I get every now and then (once a month). This make up covers up all of that. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing make up. It just makes my face look like one smooth even skin tone (the way GOD intended it to be), kind of like the way your face was when you were a kid. I&#x27;m afraid to try anything new because this foundation fits my face like a glove!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am redoing my feedback due to I make an error on previous feedback few hours ago. I mistaken gave a 3 stars in instead of 5. I can honestly say this seller more than qualifies for a 5 star no doubt about that, Amazing seller! My item ship super fast I received my package so quick it was really unbelievable how fast it came, not to mention the price was insanely cheap for such good brand + quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really my first time using this product I only ordered 1 just to see how it will work for me. Ok, Its very light &amp; nice but does a good job. I do like the look I get after foundation dries properly, Its goes on evenly and gives a smooth natural look also its definately shine free. If you are looking for a natural type of look this is the foundation for you. Oh, I am African American with a skin color as Halle Berry and the tawny color did well for me, Its a very little darker than my color but looks really natural and nice..&lt;br /&gt;I will be surely buying again with no doubts, Hope this helps..</li>
            <li> I ordered this in the color tawny and it turned out to be darker than the clean liquid foundation version which is what I usually use. It also doesn&#x27;t do any favors for those with oily skin like me, after applying in the morning by the afternoon my face was very oily. The only plus about this product that makes it better than the clean liquid foundation is the pump.</li>
            <li> Well this shade worked well as a foundation. It does blend in, but I think I prefer Revlon. It was okay</li>
            <li> Shade didn&#x27;t match...I chose the shade knowing I am a 865 Tawny  in cover girl outlast figured the 465 would be the same tawny ..didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> To start with the dispenser stopped working after 2 uses.  I must open the cap to remove the foundation.  The shade I have is too light and in addition the product is too runny.  It very thin and does not cover anything.  I have ruddy skin and this foundation is like transparent.  I might as well use nothing.  Do not like it.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good makeup but its too dark for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product it wasn&#x27;t oily and a little darker than what i needed nonetheless I can use powder to make it lighter. The product arrived earlier than I expected and wrapped well</li>
            <li> Horrible it looks like it expired already and it stinks.</li>
            <li> Once it oxidized it did not match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> nice price, I have to mix it because i ordered the color too dark.</li>
            <li> I picked wrong color, cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Its the Best if u mix it with concealer and everything it has a very flawless look afterwards</li>
            <li> I absolutely just love covergirl liquid make-up.  The trublend is a awesome foundation. It really does blend with your complexion</li>
            <li> Only need a small dab to cover the face. Worth it ! It blends well. The skin tone is a wee bit dark so I mix it well with a lighter foundation. This will last a good while! Would recommend</li>
            <li> Tried it and i liked it... it&#x27;s just that i&#x27;ve got a wrong color for me so i ended up giving it away...</li>
            <li> Loved it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;That is all I can say, I bought the shade by guess as I have never purchase cover girl trueblend before.&lt;br /&gt;I was anxious to see if it matched my shade and it did even when it dries it was true to my shade.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Came well packaged and before the alloyed time as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve got a wrong shade, my fault. But then when I tried to use it as a contour, the foundation had a weird texture and you could see 2 colors as if its components were breaking down. Anyway I tried it only once on my face and my skin broke out really bad.

Long story short, it ended up in trash.</li>
