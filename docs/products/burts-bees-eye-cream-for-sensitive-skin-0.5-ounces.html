    <ol>
            <li>This product is perfect, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I have my contact lens on</li>
            <li>I have tried all of Burt&#x27;s Bees eye creams, and I think i like this one best.  </li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>But this product is awesome, as you can expect from Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Best of luck!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>Very good eye cream for the price.  </li>
            <li>Then the areas around my eyes were beautiful - no itch and no soreness.</li>
            <li>My wife swears by this product and while I do not know a lot about skin care products this seems to work as she has really beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product and quality.</li>
            <li>The product might be great, but I&#x27;m still struggling with the cap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well it works, but it feels great on.</li>
            <li>And it makes a great primer for under make up.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was so happy, that had plagued me for MONTHS.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes, very nice</li>
            <li>Great product, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>good ...  </li>
            <li>Good price, the products work, and not spending a fortune on &amp;#34;prestidge&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>good  </li>
            <li>/&gt;very good</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>was looking at all these super-expensive eye creams (that I can&#x27;t afford) to see what would be good for my problem,</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews and thought this would be a good product for me.  </li>
            <li>the product itself, it&#x27;s of good quality to be frank.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to friends/family, but I&#x27;m happy to hear that it seems to be working for most people.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>In 2 days of using it twice a day my eczema is 90% better!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>so very easy to squeeze out, works wonderfully on my eye lids, very good price, will buy from again next time.</li>
            <li>results are amazing.</li>
            <li>the berfalitis thanks is wonderful recommend it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn, feels like a nice, moisturizing cream, doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Keep this pressure and wait for it to come out at its own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So my advice is that this product is well worth your time and money, because my under eyes have NEVER looked this good!</li>
            <li>Very good, very easy to use, right consistency</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream is the best cream I have sensitive skin and eye creams</li>
            <li>A simpler cap would be more effective.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is so far the BEST eye product for me!</li>
            <li>this is the first time ever that i&#x27;ve used a cream for my eyes and I love the way this stuff smooths the fine wrinkles by my eyebrow and best of all this stuff does NOT break out my skin like most face creams do....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light,  not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is a non&#x3D;scented, very light weight cream that keeps the skin around my eyes moist and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Under my eyes, my skin was so chapped that I had more wrinkles that I never seen before.</li>
            <li>It is an okay product.</li>
            <li>These all work just as well or better.</li>
            <li>Ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li>The container could be better designed.  </li>
            <li>With most I wake up with puffy and irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li>I also think it bothered my eyes - they seemed to burn more when I was using it.  </li>
            <li>I am trying just argan oil for now - it seems to work better, though it takes a while to soak in.\&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started buying this after reading labels of most eye creams and deciding I wanted to use something a bit simpler.  </li>
            <li>, i haven&#x27;t see any effect.or the effect was too tiny,my wife will use for more time, then survey the effect</li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be able to rub it all over your eyes?</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eye cream.</li>
            <li>But, I saw that this was one of Allure&#x27;s top rated eye creams under $20, so I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Helped some, mostly a moisturizer to use in winter.  </li>
            <li>I do like it because my eye does look a lot better.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I tried it out that night before going to bed and immediately loved the light silky smooth feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I found Eucerin Original Healing cream to use instead and it has been perfect with the sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li>That DID clear up beautifully.</li>
            <li>and this stuff works pretty good...</li>
            <li>good product reasonable priced :)</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive face lotion in this line and it works great for my face and eyes.</li>
            <li>A lot of lotions and eye creams make my skin react, but this was a great purchase for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so farCnot very hydrating for my purpose but still a good product</li>
            <li>This really was too good for me.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t seem fair</li>
            <li>Hopefully at this rate I&#x27;ll make full recovery and can once again use cosmetics!</li>
            <li>Works fine for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did seem to reduce some of the fine lines I now have, though, so I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li>Once I took out my contact and washed both it and my eye, it was fine.</li>
            <li>This cream is so smooth and coats under my eyes so easily.</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s time to start using a fine wrinkle remover</li>
            <li>A huge relief to find this product.  </li>
            <li>feel it cheaply made.</li>
            <li>After telling me about it, she used it two days in a row and experienced the same problems I was having.</li>
            <li>Its price is cheaper than many high-price eye creams I have had, but the worth quality.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, inoffensive, cream that lightly moisturizes.</li>
            <li>However, this one did not, it was great, it leaves my entire eye area feeling moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this eye cream because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It serves as a nice under eye cream for sensitive skin for sure, but if you&#x27;re looking for lots of moisture</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would just use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Night Cream on the eye area and get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>At the age of 29, I had my first bout of eczema- on my eye-lid!!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the best job of eliminating wrinkles or fine lines, but it does keep the tissue around my eyes soft and keeps them from becoming dry and haggard looking.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and found that it should be good for my dry skin around eyes in the winter.</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance and goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive eyes (I am prone to millia with lots of eye creams), and I really like it for the price.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a cream nothing special.</li>
            <li>No complaints, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I looked like I haven&#x27;t slept for days even though I would have a full nights rest.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>During the winter the area under my eyes and the area on top of my eyes (eyelids) get very sore and itchy.</li>
            <li>i also like to keep it in the fridge and apply it cool.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin - not heavy or greasy - and it doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using many Eye creams but this product doesn&#x27;t have a high quality.</li>
            <li>Plus, one little bottle lasts a long time and once I&#x27;ve run out, I will purchase more enthusiastically :D</li>
            <li>Quality of a material is exquisite, delicate taste, expecting that it bring a surprise to me!</li>
            <li>and this is the first cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate them!</li>
            <li>nothing like I&#x27;d ever experienced before, and I was freaking out a little.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect lightweight eye cream and it&#x27;s sensitive as well which is an extra bonus because we all know how sensitive the eye area can be!</li>
            <li>the only reason I gave it four stars is I actually need something just a little more emollient,  but it works great for day to day,  and price was good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again, but maybe it&#x27;s worth trying if you have eczema.</li>
            <li>I love this because it&#x27;s not greasy, has no aggravating scent and rubs in completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I discontinued use and contacted the manufacturer-they did refund my money, which was probably the only thing I liked about product.</li>
            <li>Chemotherapy destroys the moisture in your sensitive skin, and most skin moisturizers cause my eyes to run.  </li>
            <li>I got my moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone with a lot of dry skin around the eyes and with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing that it has lasted this long.  </li>
            <li>I love their whole line of sensitive skin products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin under my eyes feel tight, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I had never had eczema before, and tried so many different creams (evening doing nothing).  </li>
            <li>This is my first with this product ...</li>
            <li>I use it am and pm (am under spf moisturizer) and have only been using it two weeks, but I have better, softer, smoother skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>the NEXT MORNING my lids were already feeling 1000x better.</li>
            <li>After two more applications (the next day) the skin around my eyes was so irritated from the cream that I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li>applied to finger tip first.</li>
            <li>I use it daily to look more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; at work.</li>
            <li>Very convinient!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BEWARE first timers.</li>
            <li>My first time I kept squeezing until it burst out of the tip.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin, most products that say sensitive, still burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this in hopes of getting a cheaper less chemical version of kiehls rose artica(sp?</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Here it is almost a year later and this product is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>So I did some research and saw wonderful reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot because I really didn&#x27;t want to continue using steroid cream on my eyes, anyhow I&#x27;m less than a week in and the tightness and the dry patches and the redness has improved drastically!</li>
            <li>I woke up with really irritated eyes.</li>
            <li>However, this was a very runny lotion, not creamy like I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, which is great, but there&#x27;s no great benefits to using this eye cream.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I tried dozens of eye creams but none of them worked because they were really meant for anti-aging purposes.</li>
            <li>i have not noticed any real difference in the skin around my eyes from using this.</li>
            <li>I am not too fond of the packaging (the squeeze tube can be tricky and sometimes squeezes out too much, thus wasting the product).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I went at it really cautiously</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m seeing a real difference, which amazes me every morning.</li>
            <li>i think that&#x27;s true of any eye product at this point, but i do like keeping that sensitive skin soft!</li>
            <li>There might be other products out there that are better, but this did the job for me.</li>
            <li>Some other 4.5 star products may shrink bags or lighten circles better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had eczema before, but got it for the first time after misusing a cheap toner by smearing it all over my face (including eyelids and undereye area) due to laziness.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective this will be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disputing that it works for other people, I&#x27;m sure it does, but I bought this stuff specifically because I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>saw this one at the grocery store on sale for $7 and grabbed the last tube, lucky me.</li>
            <li>and I find an alternate product, but I don&#x27;t think I can ask much more of such an affordable, all-natural product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin - I have allergic reactions easily.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin around my eyes and had an allergic reaction to this product!  </li>
            <li>: Be super careful when using this the first time.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes because I like Burt&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>All it did was leave the area very dry and lines were more apparent.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good...not as powerful as I expected which is why I put 4 stars.</li>
            <li>The package is really iffy when you first open it</li>
            <li>This one glides on smoothly and does not cause any redness or other irritation.</li>
            <li>New edit: I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from Amazon for quite some time now</li>
            <li>I was disappointed with this eye cream as normally Burts Bees products are excellent.  </li>
            <li>This particular tube must have been old as it wasn&#x27;t creamy at all.</li>
            <li>I like this eye cream because I have very sensitive skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other eye creams, from cheap generic to top of the line expensive and never had a reaction before.</li>
            <li>The one on the right is the old one &amp; the one on the left is the one I just received-different!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I encounter such situation.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li>I developed some sort of eczema on my right eyelid and right under my left eye (which was strange b/c</li>
            <li>I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general, but my skin reacted to this particular line, Sensitive Skin With Cotton Extract.  </li>
            <li>The tip of the tube is soft so that I can squeeze the cream near my eyes directly.</li>
            <li>I think it was old</li>
            <li>I was looking for an eye cream for sensitive skin/eyes.  </li>
            <li>Old review: Since I was a young teenager, I&#x27;ve always had under eye rings.</li>
            <li>I bought the burts bees sensitive eye cream and the puffiness went away.</li>
            <li>This is for younger skins, but its gentle with your eyes</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; should be Sensitive.</li>
            <li>but this is not for sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>This may be for sensitive skin, but it is not for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Had an allergic reaction to this \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>so I think it will last a few months before needing more.</li>
            <li>I love it -- and one of the few eye creams I can actually use and wear all day without it getting into my eyes (from sweating or whatever) and burning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sinks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>put it on every night, and it doesn&#x27;t reduce my dark circles as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but it moisturizes my skin really well, which is a problem for me on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li>The effect is very general, I can&#x27;t see the effect.</li>
            <li>This product is ok sometimes, but other times it stung a little going on.</li>
            <li>as other reviewers have said -- on the first application you will most likely squeeze too hard and have a few weeks worth on your finger.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry facial skin</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s Friday, the patches are significantly reduced and softened though still healing, and the itching/peeling only happens on a relatively small scale when the product completely dries up.</li>
            <li>Now they are just little creases when I smile.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a strange looking applicator type tip that really works well only</li>
            <li>and then I saw this one, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Eye Cream, and decided that it couldn&#x27;t hurt anymore than anything else, and since it was only $10 on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(apparently) do, this is the stuff.  </li>
            <li>This product (Sensitive) totally worked.</li>
            <li>I do have really sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Even worse, when I pull off the top cap, the cream can already be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a big difference, maybe a little less puffiness, but giving it 4 stars anyway since I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive skin care line.</li>
            <li>I think if you stick a little pin in the tip and break it up before squeezing you might be able to keep the mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li>First time I used it half the bottle erupted all over my hand.</li>
            <li>Not good at all for those with true sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it, there was a little sting because my skin was so sore</li>
            <li>Dark circles have been lessened, but the real kicker was my crow&#x27;s feet at the corner of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Does seem to gently moisturize, minimize dark circles, &amp; puffiness.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened it I wasted the product.  </li>
            <li>It dried almost instantly so I could put my regular night cream right over it without standing around waiting.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I went out and bought this because I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding eye creams that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and most of the reviews on here seemed positive; however, after only a few applications, I realized I&#x27;d wasted my money.</li>
            <li>Instructions say to squeeze a little out then dab a dot on your skin; some reviews mention difficulty with the product squirting out but that only happened to me first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even been a week and the dry skin on my upper lash line is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is the only positive thing I can say about it), but it completely dried out the skin under my eyes, worsening my wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet and making me look older--something I&#x27;m obviously trying to avoid by using eye creams!</li>
            <li>I have very temperamental skin -- sometimes it&#x27;s dry and flaky, other times it feels greasy and porous.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is perfect, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I have my contact lens on</li>
            <li> I have tried all of Burt&#x27;s Bees eye creams, and I think i like this one best.  </li>

            <li> Great product and quality.</li>
            <li> The product might be great, but I&#x27;m still struggling with the cap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well it works, but it feels great on.</li>
            <li> And it makes a great primer for under make up.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was so happy, that had plagued me for MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes, very nice</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> good ...  </li>
            <li> Good price, the products work, and not spending a fortune on &amp;#34;prestidge&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> good  </li>
            <li> /&gt;very good</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> was looking at all these super-expensive eye creams (that I can&#x27;t afford) to see what would be good for my problem,</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and thought this would be a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> the product itself, it&#x27;s of good quality to be frank.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to friends/family, but I&#x27;m happy to hear that it seems to be working for most people.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li> In 2 days of using it twice a day my eczema is 90% better!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> so very easy to squeeze out, works wonderfully on my eye lids, very good price, will buy from again next time.</li>
            <li> results are amazing.</li>
            <li> the berfalitis thanks is wonderful recommend it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, feels like a nice, moisturizing cream, doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Keep this pressure and wait for it to come out at its own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So my advice is that this product is well worth your time and money, because my under eyes have NEVER looked this good!</li>
            <li> Very good, very easy to use, right consistency</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream is the best cream I have sensitive skin and eye creams</li>
            <li> A simpler cap would be more effective.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is so far the BEST eye product for me!</li>
            <li> this is the first time ever that i&#x27;ve used a cream for my eyes and I love the way this stuff smooths the fine wrinkles by my eyebrow and best of all this stuff does NOT break out my skin like most face creams do....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light,  not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is a non&#x3D;scented, very light weight cream that keeps the skin around my eyes moist and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes, my skin was so chapped that I had more wrinkles that I never seen before.</li>
            <li> It is an okay product.</li>
            <li> These all work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> Ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li> The container could be better designed.  </li>
            <li> With most I wake up with puffy and irritated eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also think it bothered my eyes - they seemed to burn more when I was using it.  </li>
            <li> I am trying just argan oil for now - it seems to work better, though it takes a while to soak in.\&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started buying this after reading labels of most eye creams and deciding I wanted to use something a bit simpler.  </li>
            <li> , i haven&#x27;t see any effect.or the effect was too tiny,my wife will use for more time, then survey the effect</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be able to rub it all over your eyes?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream.</li>
            <li> But, I saw that this was one of Allure&#x27;s top rated eye creams under $20, so I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Helped some, mostly a moisturizer to use in winter.  </li>
            <li> I do like it because my eye does look a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I tried it out that night before going to bed and immediately loved the light silky smooth feeling of it on my skin.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I found Eucerin Original Healing cream to use instead and it has been perfect with the sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li> That DID clear up beautifully.</li>
            <li> and this stuff works pretty good...</li>
            <li> good product reasonable priced :)</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive face lotion in this line and it works great for my face and eyes.</li>
            <li> A lot of lotions and eye creams make my skin react, but this was a great purchase for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so farCnot very hydrating for my purpose but still a good product</li>
            <li> This really was too good for me.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t seem fair</li>
            <li> Hopefully at this rate I&#x27;ll make full recovery and can once again use cosmetics!</li>
            <li> Works fine for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did seem to reduce some of the fine lines I now have, though, so I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> Once I took out my contact and washed both it and my eye, it was fine.</li>
            <li> This cream is so smooth and coats under my eyes so easily.</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s time to start using a fine wrinkle remover</li>
            <li> A huge relief to find this product.  </li>
            <li> feel it cheaply made.</li>
            <li> After telling me about it, she used it two days in a row and experienced the same problems I was having.</li>
            <li> Its price is cheaper than many high-price eye creams I have had, but the worth quality.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, inoffensive, cream that lightly moisturizes.</li>
            <li> However, this one did not, it was great, it leaves my entire eye area feeling moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this eye cream because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It serves as a nice under eye cream for sensitive skin for sure, but if you&#x27;re looking for lots of moisture</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would just use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Night Cream on the eye area and get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> At the age of 29, I had my first bout of eczema- on my eye-lid!!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the best job of eliminating wrinkles or fine lines, but it does keep the tissue around my eyes soft and keeps them from becoming dry and haggard looking.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and found that it should be good for my dry skin around eyes in the winter.</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance and goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for sensitive eyes (I am prone to millia with lots of eye creams), and I really like it for the price.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a cream nothing special.</li>
            <li> No complaints, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I looked like I haven&#x27;t slept for days even though I would have a full nights rest.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> During the winter the area under my eyes and the area on top of my eyes (eyelids) get very sore and itchy.</li>
            <li> i also like to keep it in the fridge and apply it cool.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin - not heavy or greasy - and it doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using many Eye creams but this product doesn&#x27;t have a high quality.</li>
            <li> Plus, one little bottle lasts a long time and once I&#x27;ve run out, I will purchase more enthusiastically :D</li>
            <li> Quality of a material is exquisite, delicate taste, expecting that it bring a surprise to me!</li>
            <li> and this is the first cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate them!</li>
            <li> nothing like I&#x27;d ever experienced before, and I was freaking out a little.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect lightweight eye cream and it&#x27;s sensitive as well which is an extra bonus because we all know how sensitive the eye area can be!</li>
            <li> the only reason I gave it four stars is I actually need something just a little more emollient,  but it works great for day to day,  and price was good.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again, but maybe it&#x27;s worth trying if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s not greasy, has no aggravating scent and rubs in completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I discontinued use and contacted the manufacturer-they did refund my money, which was probably the only thing I liked about product.</li>
            <li> Chemotherapy destroys the moisture in your sensitive skin, and most skin moisturizers cause my eyes to run.  </li>
            <li> I got my moneys worth out of it</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone with a lot of dry skin around the eyes and with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing that it has lasted this long.  </li>
            <li> I love their whole line of sensitive skin products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin under my eyes feel tight, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> I had never had eczema before, and tried so many different creams (evening doing nothing).  </li>
            <li> This is my first with this product ...</li>
            <li> I use it am and pm (am under spf moisturizer) and have only been using it two weeks, but I have better, softer, smoother skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> the NEXT MORNING my lids were already feeling 1000x better.</li>
            <li> After two more applications (the next day) the skin around my eyes was so irritated from the cream that I had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> applied to finger tip first.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to look more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; at work.</li>
            <li> Very convinient!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE first timers.</li>
            <li> My first time I kept squeezing until it burst out of the tip.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin, most products that say sensitive, still burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes of getting a cheaper less chemical version of kiehls rose artica(sp?</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Here it is almost a year later and this product is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> So I did some research and saw wonderful reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot because I really didn&#x27;t want to continue using steroid cream on my eyes, anyhow I&#x27;m less than a week in and the tightness and the dry patches and the redness has improved drastically!</li>
            <li> I woke up with really irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> However, this was a very runny lotion, not creamy like I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, which is great, but there&#x27;s no great benefits to using this eye cream.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried dozens of eye creams but none of them worked because they were really meant for anti-aging purposes.</li>
            <li> i have not noticed any real difference in the skin around my eyes from using this.</li>
            <li> I am not too fond of the packaging (the squeeze tube can be tricky and sometimes squeezes out too much, thus wasting the product).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I went at it really cautiously</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing a real difference, which amazes me every morning.</li>
            <li> i think that&#x27;s true of any eye product at this point, but i do like keeping that sensitive skin soft!</li>
            <li> There might be other products out there that are better, but this did the job for me.</li>
            <li> Some other 4.5 star products may shrink bags or lighten circles better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had eczema before, but got it for the first time after misusing a cheap toner by smearing it all over my face (including eyelids and undereye area) due to laziness.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how effective this will be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disputing that it works for other people, I&#x27;m sure it does, but I bought this stuff specifically because I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> saw this one at the grocery store on sale for $7 and grabbed the last tube, lucky me.</li>
            <li> and I find an alternate product, but I don&#x27;t think I can ask much more of such an affordable, all-natural product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin - I have allergic reactions easily.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin around my eyes and had an allergic reaction to this product!  </li>
            <li> : Be super careful when using this the first time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes because I like Burt&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> All it did was leave the area very dry and lines were more apparent.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good...not as powerful as I expected which is why I put 4 stars.</li>
            <li> The package is really iffy when you first open it</li>
            <li> This one glides on smoothly and does not cause any redness or other irritation.</li>
            <li> New edit: I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from Amazon for quite some time now</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this eye cream as normally Burts Bees products are excellent.  </li>
            <li> This particular tube must have been old as it wasn&#x27;t creamy at all.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream because I have very sensitive skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other eye creams, from cheap generic to top of the line expensive and never had a reaction before.</li>
            <li> The one on the right is the old one &amp; the one on the left is the one I just received-different!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I encounter such situation.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> I developed some sort of eczema on my right eyelid and right under my left eye (which was strange b/c</li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general, but my skin reacted to this particular line, Sensitive Skin With Cotton Extract.  </li>
            <li> The tip of the tube is soft so that I can squeeze the cream near my eyes directly.</li>
            <li> I think it was old</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream for sensitive skin/eyes.  </li>
            <li> Old review: Since I was a young teenager, I&#x27;ve always had under eye rings.</li>
            <li> I bought the burts bees sensitive eye cream and the puffiness went away.</li>
            <li> This is for younger skins, but its gentle with your eyes</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; should be Sensitive.</li>
            <li> but this is not for sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> This may be for sensitive skin, but it is not for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> so I think it will last a few months before needing more.</li>
            <li> I love it -- and one of the few eye creams I can actually use and wear all day without it getting into my eyes (from sweating or whatever) and burning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sinks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> put it on every night, and it doesn&#x27;t reduce my dark circles as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but it moisturizes my skin really well, which is a problem for me on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty thinner than I expected.</li>
            <li> The effect is very general, I can&#x27;t see the effect.</li>
            <li> This product is ok sometimes, but other times it stung a little going on.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have said -- on the first application you will most likely squeeze too hard and have a few weeks worth on your finger.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry facial skin</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s Friday, the patches are significantly reduced and softened though still healing, and the itching/peeling only happens on a relatively small scale when the product completely dries up.</li>
            <li> Now they are just little creases when I smile.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a strange looking applicator type tip that really works well only</li>
            <li> and then I saw this one, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Eye Cream, and decided that it couldn&#x27;t hurt anymore than anything else, and since it was only $10 on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (apparently) do, this is the stuff.  </li>
            <li> This product (Sensitive) totally worked.</li>
            <li> I do have really sensitive skin, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Even worse, when I pull off the top cap, the cream can already be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a big difference, maybe a little less puffiness, but giving it 4 stars anyway since I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive skin care line.</li>
            <li> I think if you stick a little pin in the tip and break it up before squeezing you might be able to keep the mess to a minimum.</li>
            <li> First time I used it half the bottle erupted all over my hand.</li>
            <li> Not good at all for those with true sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it, there was a little sting because my skin was so sore</li>
            <li> Dark circles have been lessened, but the real kicker was my crow&#x27;s feet at the corner of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Does seem to gently moisturize, minimize dark circles, &amp; puffiness.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened it I wasted the product.  </li>
            <li> It dried almost instantly so I could put my regular night cream right over it without standing around waiting.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I went out and bought this because I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding eye creams that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and most of the reviews on here seemed positive; however, after only a few applications, I realized I&#x27;d wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Instructions say to squeeze a little out then dab a dot on your skin; some reviews mention difficulty with the product squirting out but that only happened to me first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even been a week and the dry skin on my upper lash line is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is the only positive thing I can say about it), but it completely dried out the skin under my eyes, worsening my wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet and making me look older--something I&#x27;m obviously trying to avoid by using eye creams!</li>
            <li> I have very temperamental skin -- sometimes it&#x27;s dry and flaky, other times it feels greasy and porous.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use the eye cream or moisturizers because it made my eyelids turn red and raw and the moisturizers left my face a bright red.  </li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin, but is not as moisturizing as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> After extended regular use (daily for 3-4 weeks) I developed little bumps under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin under my left eye only, This product helped me get rid of the the redness and puffyness,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> my sensitive skin and a liking to Burt&#x27;s Bees products I bought a tube of this for half price/$7.50 at a local store.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream because I was feeling a bit sensitive about my dark undereye circles and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely sensitive and it helps with the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try for a week and had the same dry results each day.</li>
            <li> So I ditched this, and I definitely, definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone over the age of 30 or anyone who&#x27;s already prone to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a few minutes after applying the cream, my skin around my eyes get chapped with white skin flakes and dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes and always stay up late!</li>
            <li> I enjoy Burts Bees products but this one really irritated my eyes. :-(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start using it until almost a month after I received it because I was still finishing another product I had that I&#x27;d been using for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I IMMEDIATELY discontinued use of the product and bought another tube of my old eye cream and by the Friday a few days after, the effects of the reaction had subsided.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s long time before I got this product, as they were shipped by a forwarder to China after Amazon delivered it to the warehouse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has lasted me so long!  </li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried because I have weird dry patches in the outer corners of my eyes and some dry skin above my upper lash line.</li>
            <li> I carry this in my bag so that I could apply whenever I feel dry.</li>
            <li> the dry skin is almost gone too.  </li>
            <li> But if you suffer from dry skin in the eye area I would consider something else.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes, and that includes my eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that hydrates my delicate and sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> , I went to the doctor they put me on a round of steroids that helped for a bit and as soon as I was done with them the red patches came back around my eyes!</li>
            <li> considering I had an allergic reaction to it and was only a few days outside of their 30 day window.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using this product to help with the dark circles under my eyes and I have yet to see any changes.</li>
            <li> It would not absorb into the skin around my eyes and left a white film around my eyes that dried into little white flakes when I was sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have used much more expensive creams from $25 to $75...with no better results than this one.  </li>
            <li> I always read about how much product we waste because we can&#x27;t force out what remains by squeezing the tube when it is small or made of material that does not squeeze well.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes can be very dry and irritated from blepharitis, bought this hoping for relief.</li>
            <li> The puffiness is reducing, which is slowly helping with the appearance of the dark circles&#x27; starting points near my nose.</li>
            <li> I have pronounced grey/dark circles under my eyes, and only a few lines...</li>
            <li> I just do both until I think it is closed.  </li>
            <li> Just a few days later now, the redness is all gone and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say confirm it was eczema, but my undereye/eyelid had pink, rough patches that were peeling and itchy.</li>
            <li> For my first tube I give this product an average rating, not great effectiveness but feels soothing to use.</li>
            <li> Feels strange for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> Friends, I am certain I rescued over a month of twice-a-day applications of Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream by cutting the tube in half and removing the trapped material with a finger especially from the cap end.</li>
            <li> You need only very little.  </li>
            <li> Finally, no more red eyes and swelling.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it literally caused a burning sensation that was so uncomfortable that I wanted to remove it, but decided to leave it on and give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I began using it because I had EXTREME dryness on my eyelids as a result of an allergic reaction from another eye cream.</li>
            <li> The vasoline would burn though when I put it on as did EVERY other moisturizer I used.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Burt&#x27;s Bees products with no issues, so not sure why this one posed such a problem.</li>
            <li> As a contact lens user, I have to be very careful of eye products.</li>
            <li> I have used other creams that claimed to be for sensitive skin, yet ended up irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small amount of product; but you only need a little...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t correct dark circles or show improvement over time...</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;reduces dark circle&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t like the feeling when put it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> No decrease in puffiness or dark circles, no reduction in crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> my skin is softer, but the dark circles are still there.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say if this product helps with puffiness or dark circles</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember a time of when I didn&#x27;t have dark</li>
            <li> the area under my eyes never felt like it was moisturized enough, even though I put it on thickly.  </li>
            <li> Hold it between your thumb and forefinger about a 1/2\\&quot; down the tube.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, it squirts all over the place!</li>
            <li> However, it did help with some slight eczema I had on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Just putting this out there because previous reviews helped me.</li>
            <li> Keeps everything moisturized and youthful looking, doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup routine, and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> am not usually a person who gets \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; by products and am always skeptical of advertising, but I have to say, if you have super-sensitive eyelids like I</li>
            <li> I got the product in my eye on one occasion and it felt like it burned a little; it might have been because I wear contacts and it got on my lens.</li>
            <li> and I had been dabbing a little vasoline on those areas to help keep it moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I woke up after only one day and washed my face, the weird dry skin in the corners of my eyes was gone!</li>
            <li> I was using my Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream like five times a day to help, but that seemed only to make it worse.</li>
            <li> So, I gave up until I hit my grad program, which only made the problem MUCH worse.</li>
            <li> Upset, I stopped using it, but my eyes only continued to get worse</li>
            <li> but then after a few nights, as the soreness went away, the sting went away as well.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with moisterizers that made my eye puffy overnight.</li>
            <li> It actually made things worse.</li>
            <li> Do this for any cream, ointment, heavy lotion with a problem tube.</li>
            <li> It probably wasted about 5 days of applications since I didn&#x27;t have a way to save it.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having this crazy time with my eyelids and undereye areas lately--they were itchy, red, dry...</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure if this product specifically has helped with under eye darkness, because it is still there</li>
            <li> And no more itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I wanted to be prepared with a gentler than usual eye cream.</li>
            <li> I had to squeeze hard to get it started and half the tube squirted out!</li>
            <li> I usually use expensive/high quality skin care products.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was used and returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using morning and night for the past month</li>
            <li> I thought about using one before, but ever other one was at least $20!</li>
            <li> My mind automatically stresses me out, and with the combo of bruxism, insomnia, and waking up with headaches on and off for the past 10 years...</li>
            <li> Skin around eyes became painful, red, puffy and flaky dry.</li>
            <li> Miserable enough situation - this product has given me gentle relief and comfort for weeks now - won&#x27;t be without it again - even when Chemo is finished.  </li>
            <li> am however taking away one star because I hate the bottle, if you squeeze it just a bit too hard practically the whole bottle comes out and wastes product.</li>
            <li> Tiny stabbing pain, is not suitable for</li>
            <li> Off course I squeezed it WAY to hard trying to get it took work that it squirted all over the mirror.</li>
            <li> at least not for me.  </li>
            <li> #34;what are you using - your circles are gone?&amp;#34; I think some of the heavy creams can make those circles under your eyes even worse.  </li>
            <li> Slowly squeeze it/increase pressure until you feel it might burst on you with anymore pressure.</li>
            <li> : although the tube is small, it lasts!</li>
            <li> I have tried Lancome and other expensive eye creams from the department store and none have come close to this.  </li>
            <li> Plus I did not like the ingredients in the other way too expensive eye</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams even very expensive ones, and they all made my eyes burn and swell.  </li>
            <li> My affliction was at its worst on Monday when I first started.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> For me it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend trying to loosen up the tip with a thin object, like a finger nail.</li>
            <li> Stings my eyes just like every other eye cream I&#x27;ve tried :(</li>
            <li> I woke up one morning with puffy red eyes and horrible looking scales</li>
            <li> I looked exhausted and a little insane because my eyelids were this red-gray under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Winter has killed my skin this year and dredged up the worst bout of eczema I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid.</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Desperate, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and</li>
            <li> the cream was very difficult to squeze out and It shot out on my floor...</li>
            <li> Also, it is very difficult to control the output on this tube design.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> The tip was clogged and it smelled bad to use.</li>
            <li> Am always disappointed in their products.</li>
            <li> This one just really disappointed me, I wound up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with the results of this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a terrible eyelid eczema which I didn&#x27;t even know existed and it hurt sooo bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At the age of 29, I had my first bout of eczema- on my eye-lid!!  I had never had eczema before, and tried so many different creams (evening doing nothing).  This is the only thing that contains it.  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all. I have sensitive skin and a few minutes after applying the cream, my skin around my eyes get chapped with white skin flakes and dryness. Under my eyes, my skin was so chapped that I had more wrinkles that I never seen before. I looked like I haven&#x27;t slept for days even though I would have a full nights rest. I gave this product a try for a week and had the same dry results each day. Not good at all for those with true sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my sensitive skin, but is not as moisturizing as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Tiny stabbing pain, is not suitable for</li>
            <li> I carry this in my bag so that I could apply whenever I feel dry. Works fine for me so farCnot very hydrating for my purpose but still a good product</li>
            <li> So soothing and non-irritating around the eyes just like I had hoped!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a big difference, maybe a little less puffiness, but giving it 4 stars anyway since I love the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive skin care line.</li>
            <li> good ...  the second one</li>
            <li> I enjoy Burts Bees products but this one really irritated my eyes. :-(</li>
            <li> This is my first with this product ... the cream was very difficult to squeze out and It shot out on my floor... there is no instruction how to open this tube -I would like a refund as I lost almost all of it.  Thank you!  I think it was old, I suggest you should think about buying it.  I see others had the same experience!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;San Diego&lt;br /&gt;6-21-15</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that hydrates my delicate and sensitive eye area. I&#x27;ve tried numerous eye creams and this is the only one that does it. Brava Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> As a contact lens user, I have to be very careful of eye products. This product is perfect, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I have my contact lens on and it&#x27;s true the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; eyes  description. It has no fragrance and goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty thinner than I expected. I am not sure how effective this will be. It is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought this because I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding eye creams that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, and most of the reviews on here seemed positive; however, after only a few applications, I realized I&#x27;d wasted my money. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is the only positive thing I can say about it), but it completely dried out the skin under my eyes, worsening my wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet and making me look older--something I&#x27;m obviously trying to avoid by using eye creams! So I ditched this, and I definitely, definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone over the age of 30 or anyone who&#x27;s already prone to dry skin. It does the very opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Have become a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products for skin and facial care.  Good price, the products work, and not spending a fortune on &amp;#34;prestidge&amp;#34; products.  These all work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> Great product and quality. Ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin, most products that say sensitive, still burn my eyes.  This does not, even if I accidentally get some in my eye.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream for sensitive skin/eyes.  I have tried several eye creams even very expensive ones, and they all made my eyes burn and swell.  Finally, no more red eyes and swelling.  I even put on my eye lids.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used other creams that claimed to be for sensitive skin, yet ended up irritating my skin.  This one glides on smoothly and does not cause any redness or other irritation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this eye cream because I love Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I really didn&#x27;t like it. It would not absorb into the skin around my eyes and left a white film around my eyes that dried into little white flakes when I was sleeping. I woke up with really irritated eyes. Bummer.</li>
            <li> good product reasonable priced :)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this eye cream as normally Burts Bees products are excellent.  However, this was a very runny lotion, not creamy like I was looking for. It actually irritated my eyelids, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Very good eye cream for the price.  Brightens, soothes, softens lines.  I have used much more expensive creams from $25 to $75...with no better results than this one.  I have pronounced grey/dark circles under my eyes, and only a few lines...this brightens the area temporarily.  It doesn&#x27;t correct dark circles or show improvement over time...at least not for me.  But it was plenty soothing.  You need only very little.  It absorbs almost immediately...tap it on with ring finger.  The container could be better designed.  Still can&#x27;t tell if the cap is twist on or push on...I just do both until I think it is closed.  It&#x27;s a small amount of product; but you only need a little...so I think it will last a few months before needing more.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!  With most I wake up with puffy and irritated eyes.  Not with this stuff!  I love their whole line of sensitive skin products.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes, very nice</li>
            <li> Really works well. Very smooth and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> good  i will buy it ain！&lt;br /&gt;very good</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product to help with the dark circles under my eyes and I have yet to see any changes. I have been using it for several weeks, so I may just need to continue using it. I have seen a decrease in puffiness though if I use it in the morning before work. It smells good and I have not had any break-outs from using it. I believe I will continue to use it until it runs out but I am not sure if I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The cream is just not working as it described that &amp;#34;reduces dark circle&amp;#34;, and I don&#x27;t like the feeling when put it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> so very easy to squeeze out, works wonderfully on my eye lids, very good price, will buy from again next time.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this cream because I was feeling a bit sensitive about my dark undereye circles and eye puffiness. I have very sensitive, dry skin - I have allergic reactions easily. I am not entirely sure if this product specifically has helped with under eye darkness, because it is still there and it varies from day to day. However, it did help with some slight eczema I had on my eyelid. That DID clear up beautifully. I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again, but maybe it&#x27;s worth trying if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Roc, Neutrogena, Clinique, Estee Lauder, Mary Kay - you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it!  This $8 bottle (thank you, Amazon!) beats them all!  I use it am and pm (am under spf moisturizer) and have only been using it two weeks, but I have better, softer, smoother skin around my eyes.  Dark circles have been lessened, but the real kicker was my crow&#x27;s feet at the corner of my eyes.  They haven&#x27;t gone away totally, but have been dramatically reduced.  Now they are just little creases when I smile.  So happy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a stickler about ingredients and the product description here cuts off some of the ingredients, so I&#x27;ve listed them here:  aqua (water, eau), cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, olea europaea (olive) fruit oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, CI 77947 (zinc oxide), alcohol denat., kaolin, coco-glucoside, gossypium herbaceum (cotton) flower extract, oryza sativa (rice) extract, beta vulgaris (beet, extrait de racine de betterave) root extract, artemisia umbelliformis extract, euphrasia officinalis extract, butyrospermum parkii (shea) butter, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane, extrait de canne &amp;agrave; sucre) extract, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, chondrus crispus (carrageenan), ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, sucrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, citric acid, benzoic acid, lactic acid, trehalose, xanthan gum, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, sodium PCA, phenoxyethanol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have tried all of Burt&#x27;s Bees eye creams, and I think i like this one best.  It sinks right into the skin.  I have used it for two weeks, and actually had one of my friends to ask &amp;#34;what are you using - your circles are gone?&amp;#34; I think some of the heavy creams can make those circles under your eyes even worse.  But not this one.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having this crazy time with my eyelids and undereye areas lately--they were itchy, red, dry...nothing like I&#x27;d ever experienced before, and I was freaking out a little.  I was using my Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream like five times a day to help, but that seemed only to make it worse. I looked exhausted and a little insane because my eyelids were this red-gray under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking at all these super-expensive eye creams (that I can&#x27;t afford) to see what would be good for my problem, and then I saw this one, the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Skin Eye Cream, and decided that it couldn&#x27;t hurt anymore than anything else, and since it was only $10 on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing. I put it on before I went to bed the day I got it, and 1) it didn&#x27;t sting like the Radiance Cream, and 2) the NEXT MORNING my lids were already feeling 1000x better. Just a few days later now, the redness is all gone and the dry skin is almost gone too.  And no more itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a person who gets \\&quot;wowed\\&quot; by products and am always skeptical of advertising, but I have to say, if you have super-sensitive eyelids like I (apparently) do, this is the stuff.  And if you get it on Amazon, it&#x27;s not too expensive--bonus!</li>
            <li> Very good, very easy to use, right consistency, I will be buying this product again. Good price. The container could be bigger</li>
            <li> Winter has killed my skin this year and dredged up the worst bout of eczema I&#x27;ve had since I was a kid. I woke up one morning with puffy red eyes and horrible looking scales, I went to the doctor they put me on a round of steroids that helped for a bit and as soon as I was done with them the red patches came back around my eyes! So I did some research and saw wonderful reviews for Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot because I really didn&#x27;t want to continue using steroid cream on my eyes, anyhow I&#x27;m less than a week in and the tightness and the dry patches and the redness has improved drastically! I am a fan and will keep this product as part of my beauty regimen!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It does not work for me, not even feel moisturizing... not recommended. feel it cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple of weeks - the area under my eyes never felt like it was moisturized enough, even though I put it on thickly.  I also think it bothered my eyes - they seemed to burn more when I was using it.  I am trying just argan oil for now - it seems to work better, though it takes a while to soak in.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to reduce some of the fine lines I now have, though, so I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good...not as powerful as I expected which is why I put 4 stars. It serves as a nice under eye cream for sensitive skin for sure, but if you&#x27;re looking for lots of moisture I&#x27;d try the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; Burt&#x27;s Bees line.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream is the best cream I have sensitive skin and eye creams irritated me all this is different does not cause irritation and help with the bags and the berfalitis thanks is wonderful recommend it</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with the results of this eye cream. I purchased this in hopes of getting a cheaper less chemical version of kiehls rose artica(sp?) cream, which works wonders on the skin around my eyes. All it did was leave the area very dry and lines were more apparent. I have pretty dry facial skin and it needs ample moisturizing especially in the winter months. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t do enough research to find something comparable to kiehls and that&#x27;s my fault. But if you suffer from dry skin in the eye area I would consider something else. No offense burts bees but this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin - not heavy or greasy - and it doesn&#x27;t cause redness or breakouts. It moisturizes, which is great, but there&#x27;s no great benefits to using this eye cream. No decrease in puffiness or dark circles, no reduction in crow&#x27;s feet. It&#x27;s just a basic moisturizer. Honestly, I would just use the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Night Cream on the eye area and get more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This has lasted me so long!  it&#x27;s very light,  not greasy.  the only reason I gave it four stars is I actually need something just a little more emollient,  but it works great for day to day,  and price was good.</li>
            <li> Feels strange for about half an hour.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes because I like Burt&#x27;s products. My sister recommended this for me since we&#x27;ve both tried a lot of eye creams that caused a sensitivity problem. The first time I tried it, it literally caused a burning sensation that was so uncomfortable that I wanted to remove it, but decided to leave it on and give it a chance. After two more applications (the next day) the skin around my eyes was so irritated from the cream that I had to discontinue using it. I called my sister to tell her and she apologized... she had only used it intermittently prior to recommending it to me. After telling me about it, she used it two days in a row and experienced the same problems I was having. She threw hers away and I&#x27;m just going to use mine on my neck. Never again around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using many Eye creams but this product doesn&#x27;t have a high quality. I couldn&#x27;t feel I put eye cream. It&#x27;s just a cream nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love this because it&#x27;s not greasy, has no aggravating scent and rubs in completely. Great product, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this because allergy season has set in and I wanted to be prepared with a gentler than usual eye cream. This has not worked out for me. It makes the skin under my eyes feel tight, and not in a good way. I suspect the \\&quot;anti-inflammatory\\&quot; ingredients in it are to blame for that. It also makes my eyes and the surrounding area burn until I wash it off. I&#x27;m using Clinique moisture surge under my eyes now. It causes no irritation and it&#x27;s not even made for use around the eyes specifically. This product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The product might be great, but I&#x27;m still struggling with the cap.  It;s a two in one combo that&#x27;s not working for me. The first time I opened it I wasted the product.  A simpler cap would be more effective.</li>
            <li> New edit: I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from Amazon for quite some time now but this last order was different. If you look at the picture, the containers are different. The one on the right is the old one &amp; the one on the left is the one I just received-different! I&#x27;ve used it for some time now &amp; it seems to be working but it&#x27;s thicker like a paste instead of a cream. I cannot account for the difference. Just an FYI.   Old review: Since I was a young teenager, I&#x27;ve always had under eye rings. I&#x27;ve tried MANY a product to help this situation but ultimately, they all failed. So, I gave up until I hit my grad program, which only made the problem MUCH worse. Desperate, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and wow! It works!  However, you need to give it time to work. I put it on every night before I went to sleep for a week and there were no results. Upset, I stopped using it, but my eyes only continued to get worse (grad programs are stressful!). So I tried it again, and this time used it faithfully for 3 weeks (applying once every day) and than BAM! Under eye rings-gone! Puffiness-vanished!!  So my advice is that this product is well worth your time and money, because my under eyes have NEVER looked this good! But you do need to give it some time to work-don&#x27;t give up! It&#x27;s worth it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Plus, one little bottle lasts a long time and once I&#x27;ve run out, I will purchase more enthusiastically :D</li>
            <li> I have used this several times since I received it and I really like it. It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well it works, but it feels great on.</li>
            <li> I started buying this after reading labels of most eye creams and deciding I wanted to use something a bit simpler.  It doesn&#x27;t do the best job of eliminating wrinkles or fine lines, but it does keep the tissue around my eyes soft and keeps them from becoming dry and haggard looking.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn, feels like a nice, moisturizing cream, doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Here it is almost a year later and this product is still going strong.  I use about 1/4&amp;#34;  twice daily.  Amazing that it has lasted this long.  It is a non&#x3D;scented, very light weight cream that keeps the skin around my eyes moist and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a strange looking applicator type tip that really works well only applied to finger tip first.</li>
            <li> There was a blockage in the end of the tube. I had to squeeze hard to get it started and half the tube squirted out!</li>
            <li> During the winter the area under my eyes and the area on top of my eyes (eyelids) get very sore and itchy. I tried dozens of eye creams but none of them worked because they were really meant for anti-aging purposes. This product (Sensitive) totally worked. When I first applied it, there was a little sting because my skin was so sore but then after a few nights, as the soreness went away, the sting went away as well. Then the areas around my eyes were beautiful - no itch and no soreness.</li>
            <li> my wife use it 20 days, i haven&#x27;t see any effect.or the effect was too tiny,my wife will use for more time, then survey the effect</li>
            <li> The effect is very general, I can&#x27;t see the effect.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It stings my eyes.  Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be able to rub it all over your eyes?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream. this is my second time buying it because i ran out. it&#x27;s definitely sensitive and it helps with the dark circles around my eyes. i also like to keep it in the fridge and apply it cool.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect lightweight eye cream and it&#x27;s sensitive as well which is an extra bonus because we all know how sensitive the eye area can be! I am going to continue using this eye cream!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with moisterizers that made my eye puffy overnight. I bought the burts bees sensitive eye cream and the puffiness went away. Definately will buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products in general, but my skin reacted to this particular line, Sensitive Skin With Cotton Extract.  I was unable to use the eye cream or moisturizers because it made my eyelids turn red and raw and the moisturizers left my face a bright red.  I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> Several of the reviews I read said that this product relieved eczema around the eye area and on the eyelids.  That was not my experience.  For me it made it worse.  I may have had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.  I switched to another product and my eczema is gone.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge Burt&#x27;s Bees fan. Am always disappointed in their products. But, I saw that this was one of Allure&#x27;s top rated eye creams under $20, so I wanted to give it a try. It&#x27;s great for sensitive eyes (I am prone to millia with lots of eye creams), and I really like it for the price. I usually use expensive/high quality skin care products. This one makes the cut.</li>
            <li> No itching or redness, seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This really was too good for me.</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone with a lot of dry skin around the eyes and with sensitive skin. My daughter&#x27;s skin was so much improved after only using this product for a few days.</li>
            <li> Does seem to gently moisturize, minimize dark circles, &amp; puffiness. I use it daily to look more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34; at work.</li>
            <li> I use this all around my eyes. It&#x27;s very soothing and absorbs quickly. I will buy this again, and again.</li>
            <li> The tip of the tube is soft so that I can squeeze the cream near my eyes directly. Very convinient!</li>
            <li> I do have really sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. I use a lot of Burt&#x27;s products. This one just really disappointed me, I wound up throwing it away. It burned my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> i have not noticed any real difference in the skin around my eyes from using this. my skin is softer, but the dark circles are still there. i think that&#x27;s true of any eye product at this point, but i do like keeping that sensitive skin soft! bonus: although the tube is small, it lasts! i&#x27;m going over 6 months on the same tube.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this eye cream. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my eyes feeling greasy. And it makes a great primer for under make up. I am not too fond of the packaging (the squeeze tube can be tricky and sometimes squeezes out too much, thus wasting the product). I got the product in my eye on one occasion and it felt like it burned a little; it might have been because I wear contacts and it got on my lens. Once I took out my contact and washed both it and my eye, it was fine.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my eyes. I also purchased the Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive face lotion in this line and it works great for my face and eyes.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this product and while I do not know a lot about skin care products this seems to work as she has really beautiful skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A lot of lotions and eye creams make my skin react, but this was a great purchase for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on every night, and it doesn&#x27;t reduce my dark circles as much as I&#x27;d like it to, but it moisturizes my skin really well, which is a problem for me on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Works well for sensative skin.</li>
            <li> This is for younger skins, but its gentle with your eyes</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes, and that includes my eyelids. This product is ok sometimes, but other times it stung a little going on. 2 stars for that. &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; should be Sensitive. Instructions say to squeeze a little out then dab a dot on your skin; some reviews mention difficulty with the product squirting out but that only happened to me first time. I found Eucerin Original Healing cream to use instead and it has been perfect with the sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li> After extended regular use (daily for 3-4 weeks) I developed little bumps under and around my eyes. I&#x27;m not disputing that it works for other people, I&#x27;m sure it does, but I bought this stuff specifically because I have sensitive skin, and it didn&#x27;t help much. It actually made things worse. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to friends/family, but I&#x27;m happy to hear that it seems to be working for most people.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and thought this would be a good product for me.  I had none of the results that were posted-did not see any difference in the skin around my eyes, nor did the puffiness underneath look any different.  My eyelids got red and started to peel.  I discontinued use and contacted the manufacturer-they did refund my money, which was probably the only thing I liked about product.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin around my eyes and had an allergic reaction to this product!  I would give it 0 stars if I could!  I didn&#x27;t start using it until almost a month after I received it because I was still finishing another product I had that I&#x27;d been using for a long time.  I started using it on a Friday and by Monday afternoon my eyes started swelling and I got a rash on my eyelids and surrounding areas where I had used it!  I IMMEDIATELY discontinued use of the product and bought another tube of my old eye cream and by the Friday a few days after, the effects of the reaction had subsided.  Then I went into my Amazon account to try to return this product and I cannot - it says my return window expired!  I only had 30 days to return it.  I guess lesson learned not to buy things until I&#x27;m almost out so I don&#x27;t get stuck paying for something I can never use!  It really doesn&#x27;t seem fair considering I had an allergic reaction to it and was only a few days outside of their 30 day window.  BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I love it -- and one of the few eye creams I can actually use and wear all day without it getting into my eyes (from sweating or whatever) and burning them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product!</li>
            <li> A huge relief to find this product.  Chemotherapy destroys the moisture in your sensitive skin, and most skin moisturizers cause my eyes to run.  Miserable enough situation - this product has given me gentle relief and comfort for weeks now - won&#x27;t be without it again - even when Chemo is finished.  I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> For my first tube I give this product an average rating, not great effectiveness but feels soothing to use. I always read about how much product we waste because we can&#x27;t force out what remains by squeezing the tube when it is small or made of material that does not squeeze well. Friends, I am certain I rescued over a month of twice-a-day applications of Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream by cutting the tube in half and removing the trapped material with a finger especially from the cap end. (Granted I don&#x27;t use a lot.) Do this for any cream, ointment, heavy lotion with a problem tube.</li>
            <li> Soooooo grateful for this product!  I&#x27;ve been battling eczema on my eyelids for weeks and nothing was helping. In 2 days of using it twice a day my eczema is 90% better!</li>
            <li> It took a minute to get the applicator to work. Off course I squeezed it WAY to hard trying to get it took work that it squirted all over the mirror. But this product is awesome, as you can expect from Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had eczema before, but got it for the first time after misusing a cheap toner by smearing it all over my face (including eyelids and undereye area) due to laziness. I can&#x27;t say confirm it was eczema, but my undereye/eyelid had pink, rough patches that were peeling and itchy. Read Amazon reviews, found out there were people with my problems who claimed that it worked, took a chance, and it does work!! There might be other products out there that are better, but this did the job for me. My affliction was at its worst on Monday when I first started. Now it&#x27;s Friday, the patches are significantly reduced and softened though still healing, and the itching/peeling only happens on a relatively small scale when the product completely dries up. Hopefully at this rate I&#x27;ll make full recovery and can once again use cosmetics! Just putting this out there because previous reviews helped me. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and found that it should be good for my dry skin around eyes in the winter. Its price is cheaper than many high-price eye creams I have had, but the worth quality. I never felt allergy at all.</li>
            <li> Quality of a material is exquisite, delicate taste, expecting that it bring a surprise to me!</li>
            <li> Helped some, mostly a moisturizer to use in winter.  Some other 4.5 star products may shrink bags or lighten circles better</li>
            <li> I like burts bees stuff but this is not for sensitive skin around the eyes. The skin around my eyes can be very dry and irritated from blepharitis, bought this hoping for relief. but it just burns. Dissappointed</li>
            <li> Unlike the Royal Jelly Eye Cream I bought in the same order, this item&#x27;s seal is removed on one side of the paper package.&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s no seal on the product itself. Even worse, when I pull off the top cap, the cream can already be squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it was used and returned. This is the first time I encounter such situation.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there&#x27;s long time before I got this product, as they were shipped by a forwarder to China after Amazon delivered it to the warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the product itself, it&#x27;s of good quality to be frank.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Eye Cream for about 2 weeks now and I really like it. I began using it because I had EXTREME dryness on my eyelids as a result of an allergic reaction from another eye cream. I have very temperamental skin -- sometimes it&#x27;s dry and flaky, other times it feels greasy and porous. My skin is by no means PH balanced, but using this twice a day for a few days really did give it the moisture it needed. I use this in conjunction with my Oil of Olay spf moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if this product helps with puffiness or dark circles but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer. The package is really iffy when you first open it so beware -- as other reviewers have said -- on the first application you will most likely squeeze too hard and have a few weeks worth on your finger. I would recommend trying to loosen up the tip with a thin object, like a finger nail.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream because I have very sensitive skin under my eyes. This cream is so smooth and coats under my eyes so easily.</li>
            <li> This particular tube must have been old as it wasn&#x27;t creamy at all. The tip was clogged and it smelled bad to use. Perhaps a fresher tube may work for you. I won&#x27;t give it a 2nd try.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, inoffensive, cream that lightly moisturizes. I bought it as a nighttime alternative to a more expensive eye cream with SPF. No complaints, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I adore this eye cream with cotton extract!!  this is the first time ever that i&#x27;ve used a cream for my eyes and I love the way this stuff smooths the fine wrinkles by my eyebrow and best of all this stuff does NOT break out my skin like most face creams do....Now that I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s I figured it&#x27;s time to start using a fine wrinkle remover and this stuff works pretty good...</li>
            <li> This may be for sensitive skin, but it is not for sensitive eyes. Stings my eyes just like every other eye cream I&#x27;ve tried :(</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes and always stay up late! This is so far the BEST eye product for me!</li>
            <li> I have dry flaky skin under my left eye only, This product helped me get rid of the the redness and puffyness,&lt;br /&gt;but I still feel the flakiness under the eye. I do like it because my eye does look a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye product I have ever used.  I have tried Lancome and other expensive eye creams from the department store and none have come close to this.  I developed some sort of eczema on my right eyelid and right under my left eye (which was strange b/c I am 32) and I had been dabbing a little vasoline on those areas to help keep it moisturized.  The vasoline would burn though when I put it on as did EVERY other moisturizer I used.  However, this one did not, it was great, it leaves my entire eye area feeling moisturized.  It did not burn or irritate at all.  I am so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction to this \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; product. Skin around eyes became painful, red, puffy and flaky dry. I have used other Burt&#x27;s Bees products with no issues, so not sure why this one posed such a problem. I&#x27;ve used many other eye creams, from cheap generic to top of the line expensive and never had a reaction before. Also, it is very difficult to control the output on this tube design. First time I used it half the bottle erupted all over my hand. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! I&#x27;ve been using morning and night for the past month and I love it! Keeps everything moisturized and youthful looking, doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup routine, and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Be super careful when using this the first time. Like the other reviews say, it squirts all over the place! I think if you stick a little pin in the tip and break it up before squeezing you might be able to keep the mess to a minimum. I went at it really cautiously and it still squirted all over the place! (The product is so great that I still give it 5 stars though!)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use to date.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried because I have weird dry patches in the outer corners of my eyes and some dry skin above my upper lash line. I thought about using one before, but ever other one was at least $20! Plus I did not like the ingredients in the other way too expensive eye creams.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this one at the grocery store on sale for $7 and grabbed the last tube, lucky me. I tried it out that night before going to bed and immediately loved the light silky smooth feeling of it on my skin. It dried almost instantly so I could put my regular night cream right over it without standing around waiting.&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up after only one day and washed my face, the weird dry skin in the corners of my eyes was gone! I was so happy, that had plagued me for MONTHS. So I kept using it, kept using it. It&#x27;s not even been a week and the dry skin on my upper lash line is almost completely gone. I can wear eye make up again!&lt;br /&gt;I am however taking away one star because I hate the bottle, if you squeeze it just a bit too hard practically the whole bottle comes out and wastes product. I&#x27;d maybe suggest squeezing into a jar.</li>
            <li> I got my moneys worth out of it that&#x27;s for sure. I broke out in a terrible eyelid eczema which I didn&#x27;t even know existed and it hurt sooo bad. I had tennis ball sized red inflamed skin all around my eyes and globs of this for a couple days and now it&#x27;s all gone. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 4 weeks now. My mind automatically stresses me out, and with the combo of bruxism, insomnia, and waking up with headaches on and off for the past 10 years... I can&#x27;t remember a time of when I didn&#x27;t have dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seeing a real difference, which amazes me every morning. The puffiness is reducing, which is slowly helping with the appearance of the dark circles&#x27; starting points near my nose. Basically, I&#x27;m already noticing about a 30% improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my sensitive skin and a liking to Burt&#x27;s Bees products I bought a tube of this for half price/$7.50 at a local store. The fact that I&#x27;m still using the same tube makes a $12 price seem fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE first timers. Don&#x27;t force the lotion out. My first time I kept squeezing until it burst out of the tip. It probably wasted about 5 days of applications since I didn&#x27;t have a way to save it. Hold it between your thumb and forefinger about a 1/2\\&quot; down the tube. Slowly squeeze it/increase pressure until you feel it might burst on you with anymore pressure. Keep this pressure and wait for it to come out at its own pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this if it stops improving and I find an alternate product, but I don&#x27;t think I can ask much more of such an affordable, all-natural product.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes and this is the first cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate them!</li>
