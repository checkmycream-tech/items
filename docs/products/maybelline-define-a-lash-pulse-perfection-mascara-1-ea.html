            <li>This mascara is great the vibration seems to help it go on better and makes my lashes longer, but it will clump.</li>

            <li>I love this mascara!</li>

            <li>and i can honestly say i don&#x27;t understand how anyone can like this mascara..</li>
            <li>I just asked her how she liked it</li>
            <li>This the best mascara and such a great price.  </li>
            <li>t&#x27;s better to spend more and to get qualitative mascara!</li>
            <li>, It goes on easily, comes off easily, and looks great on.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, I have found this mascara to be one of the best around and at a fraction of the cost of department store brands.</li>
            <li>My lashes are very fine</li>
            <li>:) I Loved that because i was so excited to try this product because i have heard they don&#x27;t have it on the shelves anymore as often as it use to be.</li>
            <li>best mascara ever Love this mascara truly like no other</li>
            <li>It now goes on very smooth</li>
            <li>Then when I wrote to seller they refund me money, so I can say mascara is OK</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>I love the Vibrating Mascara</li>
            <li>There should be an interesting ink, and has come without a brush though all works, but from it to me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchase 3 of these things already just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>untill i find one that impresses me better</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love This Product.</li>
            <li>:)  Separates your lashes from the root to the tip while covering them.  </li>
            <li>Favorite mascara forsure</li>
            <li>After trying more than 50, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I am sooooooo glad that I found it</li>
            <li>those wanted a more \\&quot;thickened and filled-in\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>Though, I still love it and will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I devoted more time to the project....</li>
            <li>and i think everyone would have to try it out for themselves since we all have diffrent lashes :)</li>
            <li>The mascara does vibrate allowing for better delivery to your lashes.</li>
            <li>Fabulously!</li>
            <li>I swear by this product to so many people...</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>This mascara is the best I have used in a very long time.</li>
            <li>It separates each lash so my lashes always look full, long, healthy, and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Good product, cheap and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This lengthened my lashes IMMEDIATELY on the first coat and separated them super nice!</li>
            <li>and i will continue until i cant find it anymore easy to use and easy to remove</li>
            <li>Good Buy Decent price the package was seal upon arrival</li>
            <li>I am in love with this mascara I am so happy to have found it on the internet for such a cheap price</li>
            <li>It tickles when your applying the mascara and its vibrating, but its not hard at all to apply and it does a good job in one sweep.</li>
            <li>The vibrating part of the mascara works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, not very clumpy, dark, noticeable, wonderful mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the vibrations make a difference or what, but after reading the tips on the back mine looked great.</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t beat the price for how great it actually is.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Mascara.</li>
            <li>Only mascara that works great for me..  </li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t clump up and the battery life seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li>The second best I found was Almays intense which goes on thicker</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s very fun to feel it against your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I first bought this mascara because it was the most affordable one for me.</li>
            <li>i bought this at big lots for $3 after reading good reviews on here</li>
            <li>For those of you that like the look of full, separated, VIBErant (yah, I went there) eyelashes</li>
            <li>but I definitely got a good use out of it before it did.</li>
            <li>i havent had a problem with flaking my absolute favorite mascare</li>
            <li>Creates good length, solid color, lasts well.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints for this mascara and have been loyal to it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>Super product that does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>get more compliments on this formula of mascara than ANY other kind I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes noise, its fun to use, but you better already have a steady hand</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to live w out it.</li>
            <li>but overall I would say its pretty good</li>
            <li>Okay so first of all the shipping was FAST</li>
            <li>Wow, what a HUGE dissappointment!  </li>
            <li>Lol,  I&#x27;m so impatient.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>As for the vibrating feature, I didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li>so far this is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The vibrating feature is cool, but doesn&#x27;t help as much as you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li>Perfect every time, long lasting battery in the vibrating mechanism, makes lashes longer, fuller and natural!  </li>
            <li>I am writing this right after my first attempt with this mascara.</li>
            <li>and the shipping was quick and fast</li>
            <li>Has received these goods rejected though very much for it waited.</li>
            <li>I did get clumping on the first try though</li>
            <li>The first thing I think of is ....ghetto vibrator</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this device can vibrate strongly enough to still be safe, and do exactly what its telling you it</li>
            <li>So, first, the vibrating function.</li>
            <li>Primary reason why I use a mascara is to get some volume and curling effect while having a natural look.</li>
            <li>I am glad because it was only $3.88</li>
            <li>Got this, it works amazingly, really makes my lashes stand out, and makes my eyes just pop!</li>
            <li>which is what I was looking for in the first place with this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely buy more and recommend them.</li>
            <li>it vibrates when you push a button and gets more lashes than regular mascara!</li>
            <li>At first we thought the vibrating brush was a gimmick</li>
            <li>My wife has been an avid user of the product</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this mascara, I would say absolutely go for it!</li>
            <li>I love the product and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll where.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the actual mascara great, but the vibrating feature really makes it all around the whole package.</li>
            <li>This one has good finish but does not do either job and does not really look natural.</li>
            <li>Little did I know that I would fall in LOVE with it!</li>
            <li>It did coat my lashes nicely and make them look full and thick, but</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken them, but it really defined them and if thats what your going for then</li>
            <li>If it were legal, I&#x27;d marry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does vibrate and coat my eyelashes very well</li>
            <li>, they looked much longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much like work.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Also u can hear it vibrating haha.</li>
            <li>a very uniue mascara</li>
            <li>that much</li>
            <li>what good is that if there are icky clumps?</li>
            <li>With one or two applications you get long lashes without clumps and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>But other then that it does work really well for what i paid for :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only recently decided I&#x27;m a Revlon girl for mascaras, and while I&#x27;ve found the best results with them in the past, NOTHING compared to the formula for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The waterproof version definitely is waterproof - you&#x27;ll need a makeup remover to thoroughly clean it from your lashes</li>
            <li>it does make ur lashes a bit hard but that honestly depends on how much you put.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and makes my lashes extremely long without any clumps!</li>
            <li>With this mascara I only have to swipe over them twice to give them super length and even a bit of curl.</li>
            <li>This particular color I think is out of stock</li>
            <li>and I often would need a tissue to wipe the excess amount of mascara on my eyelashs, other wise it would smear on my face when I closed my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>That is supposed to emit little vibrations as you apply it to your lashes and that is supposed to make them more defined?</li>
            <li>You have to pull off the little gold sticky tab at the top</li>
            <li>i love this, the package was a little bent up</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>The product was well packaged and in new working condition.</li>
            <li>It dried pretty fast, but will smudge at first.</li>
            <li>Not able to find it anywhere in stores anymore - so was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>the mascara itself is nothing new, but the vibration of the brush really helps to pull my lashed apart, highlighting individual strands.</li>
            <li>or else your gonna be cleaning up a mess, and its not going to be a nice wet spot.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to completely remove the mascara and reapply on two separate occasions because of this.</li>
            <li>I have to end up using my old mascara brush to seperate the lashes.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive but worth the additional buck.</li>
            <li>Subtle vibrating helps get to corner lashes, easier to place color at roots of lashes and gives better lash definition: no clumps.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations feel funny, and actually hurt my first eye lid a little</li>
            <li>When I asked him to look at my lashes he agreed that was the major difference!</li>
            <li>I am HUGE on mascara because unfortunately I don&#x27;t have very much lashes!</li>
            <li>the only thing i was a little hesitant about was the button used to make it vibrate however the product itself makes full luscious lashes an anything that achieves that is 5 starts in my book.</li>
            <li>This mascara barely bleeds when you&#x27;re bawling--it vibrates and separates your lashes--it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a raccoon or a model gone rogue.</li>
            <li>No clumping and my husband even asked me what I was doing different as far as applying my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I just want to help those who are skeptical about buying it online.</li>
            <li>so when you&#x27;re pushing it it is a little tricky , and it also feels funny .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it does go on quite thick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is perfect- dramatic, thick, very black.</li>
            <li>hardly used the vibrating button because it made more of a mess on my eyelashes (maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it properly)  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only mascara that works great for me..  </li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t clump up and the battery life seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li> The second best I found was Almays intense which goes on thicker</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s very fun to feel it against your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I first bought this mascara because it was the most affordable one for me.</li>
            <li> i bought this at big lots for $3 after reading good reviews on here</li>
            <li> For those of you that like the look of full, separated, VIBErant (yah, I went there) eyelashes</li>
            <li> but I definitely got a good use out of it before it did.</li>
            <li> i havent had a problem with flaking my absolute favorite mascare</li>
            <li> Creates good length, solid color, lasts well.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints for this mascara and have been loyal to it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Super product that does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> get more compliments on this formula of mascara than ANY other kind I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes noise, its fun to use, but you better already have a steady hand</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to live w out it.</li>
            <li> but overall I would say its pretty good</li>
            <li> Okay so first of all the shipping was FAST</li>
            <li> Wow, what a HUGE dissappointment!  </li>
            <li> Lol,  I&#x27;m so impatient.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> As for the vibrating feature, I didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li> so far this is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The vibrating feature is cool, but doesn&#x27;t help as much as you&#x27;d think.</li>
            <li> Perfect every time, long lasting battery in the vibrating mechanism, makes lashes longer, fuller and natural!  </li>
            <li> I am writing this right after my first attempt with this mascara.</li>
            <li> and the shipping was quick and fast</li>
            <li> Has received these goods rejected though very much for it waited.</li>
            <li> I did get clumping on the first try though</li>
            <li> The first thing I think of is ....ghetto vibrator</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this device can vibrate strongly enough to still be safe, and do exactly what its telling you it</li>
            <li> So, first, the vibrating function.</li>
            <li> Primary reason why I use a mascara is to get some volume and curling effect while having a natural look.</li>
            <li> I am glad because it was only $3.88</li>
            <li> Got this, it works amazingly, really makes my lashes stand out, and makes my eyes just pop!</li>
            <li> which is what I was looking for in the first place with this mascara.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely buy more and recommend them.</li>
            <li> it vibrates when you push a button and gets more lashes than regular mascara!</li>
            <li> At first we thought the vibrating brush was a gimmick</li>
            <li> My wife has been an avid user of the product</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this mascara, I would say absolutely go for it!</li>
            <li> I love the product and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll where.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the actual mascara great, but the vibrating feature really makes it all around the whole package.</li>
            <li> This one has good finish but does not do either job and does not really look natural.</li>
            <li> Little did I know that I would fall in LOVE with it!</li>
            <li> It did coat my lashes nicely and make them look full and thick, but</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken them, but it really defined them and if thats what your going for then</li>
            <li> If it were legal, I&#x27;d marry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does vibrate and coat my eyelashes very well</li>
            <li> , they looked much longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much like work.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Also u can hear it vibrating haha.</li>
            <li> a very uniue mascara</li>
            <li> that much</li>
            <li> what good is that if there are icky clumps?</li>
            <li> With one or two applications you get long lashes without clumps and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> But other then that it does work really well for what i paid for :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently decided I&#x27;m a Revlon girl for mascaras, and while I&#x27;ve found the best results with them in the past, NOTHING compared to the formula for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The waterproof version definitely is waterproof - you&#x27;ll need a makeup remover to thoroughly clean it from your lashes</li>
            <li> it does make ur lashes a bit hard but that honestly depends on how much you put.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and makes my lashes extremely long without any clumps!</li>
            <li> With this mascara I only have to swipe over them twice to give them super length and even a bit of curl.</li>
            <li> This particular color I think is out of stock</li>
            <li> and I often would need a tissue to wipe the excess amount of mascara on my eyelashs, other wise it would smear on my face when I closed my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> That is supposed to emit little vibrations as you apply it to your lashes and that is supposed to make them more defined?</li>
            <li> You have to pull off the little gold sticky tab at the top</li>
            <li> i love this, the package was a little bent up</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> The product was well packaged and in new working condition.</li>
            <li> It dried pretty fast, but will smudge at first.</li>
            <li> Not able to find it anywhere in stores anymore - so was glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the mascara itself is nothing new, but the vibration of the brush really helps to pull my lashed apart, highlighting individual strands.</li>
            <li> or else your gonna be cleaning up a mess, and its not going to be a nice wet spot.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to completely remove the mascara and reapply on two separate occasions because of this.</li>
            <li> I have to end up using my old mascara brush to seperate the lashes.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive but worth the additional buck.</li>
            <li> Subtle vibrating helps get to corner lashes, easier to place color at roots of lashes and gives better lash definition: no clumps.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations feel funny, and actually hurt my first eye lid a little</li>
            <li> When I asked him to look at my lashes he agreed that was the major difference!</li>
            <li> I am HUGE on mascara because unfortunately I don&#x27;t have very much lashes!</li>
            <li> the only thing i was a little hesitant about was the button used to make it vibrate however the product itself makes full luscious lashes an anything that achieves that is 5 starts in my book.</li>
            <li> This mascara barely bleeds when you&#x27;re bawling--it vibrates and separates your lashes--it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a raccoon or a model gone rogue.</li>
            <li> No clumping and my husband even asked me what I was doing different as far as applying my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I just want to help those who are skeptical about buying it online.</li>
            <li> so when you&#x27;re pushing it it is a little tricky , and it also feels funny .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it does go on quite thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is perfect- dramatic, thick, very black.</li>
            <li> hardly used the vibrating button because it made more of a mess on my eyelashes (maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it properly)  </li>
            <li> product first hit the shelves in 2009 (In Canada at least) and was phased-out 2 years later.  </li>
            <li> It has the potential to make you look like you are wearing false lashes, which could be really cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting, it does add a whole lot of length and volume to my lashes, so much so that it appears as if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> For nighttime I will use 3 or more coats and have very dramatic eyes.</li>
            <li> There is a definite lash boost, and not much in terms of clumping.</li>
            <li> but I will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market, and when it no longer is, I&#x27;ll be on here, fighting the rest of you for it.</li>
            <li> It is long since finished now</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had mascara on for a long time</li>
            <li> I am 33 and have short straight lashes that are very hard to curl or lengthen.</li>
            <li> but once it does dry</li>
            <li> no  good stuff, actually it&#x27;s normal, when cost is so low!</li>
            <li> lashes are dark &amp; naturally long somewhat thick but not too much)</li>
            <li> Not highly recommended but not blacklisted</li>
            <li> It deprecate lashes very well and the black is actually a very dark black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particular ecstatic about the product</li>
            <li> I admit it, I was curious.</li>
            <li> Because I had too mich trouble ordering it,and when my shipment came in it was the wring type of mascara, i wanted regular mascara,I was sent waterproof</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation to PerfumeWorldWide, Inc…- Open and test a few of these, and do Not Sell your remaining inventory.</li>
            <li> However, by the time you manage to work out the clumps, you&#x27;ve wasted so much time that you actually could have put on false lashes.</li>
            <li> All in all, no better or worse that what I would normally buy around the same price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that when I continue to apply to the mascara, in hopes of smoothing out those clumps, it starts to harden, sticking my eyelashes to each other.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look fuller and longer than any other mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried TONS of other mascaras --</li>
            <li> so I will try the other ones</li>
            <li> I got it the other day I like the packing and</li>
            <li> However, if you suffer from hand tremors or other issues which affect your motor skills, I would recommend not using the vibrating option.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very wet and &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; it causes your lashes to stick together.  </li>
            <li> The previous purchase was a little dry, but this one was solid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was only a little disappointed that the mascara didn&#x27;t curl my straight eyelashes enough (it did help though).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame this mascara to be the cause of a small rash I got under my left eye after using this, however once I stopped using it for a few days</li>
            <li> This is hands down my fav.</li>
            <li> It has beat out all of my other mascara&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Love this product, too bad it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It is like wearing black shoe polish on your lashes.      </li>
            <li> previously rated this item a 3 star but after using it for some months now, I give it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> In regards to the clumping issue I previously had, this is no longer so.</li>
            <li> Less retailers selling this product than a year ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In about an hour it looks like I ran into a pepper mill as there is black flakes all under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> ( a little clumpier, which is sometimes good)for</li>
            <li> is a little too wet/watery</li>
            <li> This mascara is not available everywhere</li>
            <li> just with a few clicks order it if need be.</li>
            <li> No. 841, Very Black by Maybelline, 0.22 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I actually had to remove it and start over with a different mascara--it was THAT BAD.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally at a loss as to what to use now that L&#x27;oreal Panoramic curl has apparently been discontinued.  :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I could care less about the vibratory functions (at least in my mascara, wink wink nudge nudge say no more) -</li>
            <li> The product goes on all clumpy and uneven and never dries!  </li>
            <li> My lashes were no more defined by vibrating them, then not.</li>
            <li> Sorry to see that it was taken off the market and can be bought online only.</li>
            <li> it vibrates a small amount to separte the lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are extremly blonde and relatively thin, this mascara works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s way too thick, and it&#x27;s hard to distribute on your lashes.</li>
            <li> but it really works and keep the lashes separated and the mascara evenly distributed from base to end.  </li>
            <li> Seriously I might have well ordered something else.</li>
            <li> though I am unhappy with the results of my eye lid and the amount of times I had to fix the mess it made, it still does its job and holds on to make my lashes look darker and longer.</li>
            <li> It just needed to be broken in.</li>
            <li> when I tired it  on</li>
            <li> When I recieved this mascara I was a little disappointed because pulsing do not work.</li>
            <li> Very weak vibrations.</li>
            <li> so I guess I did something wrong.</li>
            <li> The vibration during application does not make it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I did however take off one star because the button is awkwardly place at then end of the wand</li>
            <li> Maybelline was crazy for discontinuing this product.  </li>
            <li> Bad thinking on my part.</li>
            <li> I hate that I&#x27;m going to have to get a curler, but I think that I will use this mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> I am angry!!!</li>
            <li> with or without the vibrating feature it clumped, probally one of the worst mascaras i have ever used.</li>
            <li> However, it does clump, and awfully at that!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mascara is great the vibration seems to help it go on better and makes my lashes longer, but it will clump. Dont think I will buy again</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to. The 1st time I used it I got a big glop on my eye lid, so I started over and took my time.  Two coats and my stubby lashes look almost like I have falsies on. For nighttime I will use 3 or more coats and have very dramatic eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues. Very inexpensive.  Quick shipping as well. And doesn&#x27;t clump up and the battery life seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial on TiVo for this mascara and I could not wait to try it.  Wow, what a HUGE dissappointment!  The product goes on all clumpy and uneven and never dries!  It is like wearing black shoe polish on your lashes.      I actually had to remove it and start over with a different mascara--it was THAT BAD.      I&#x27;m totally at a loss as to what to use now that L&#x27;oreal Panoramic curl has apparently been discontinued.  :(</li>
            <li> I am writing this right after my first attempt with this mascara. The vibrating feature is cool, but doesn&#x27;t help as much as you&#x27;d think. Still, it&#x27;s very fun to feel it against your eyelashes. There is a definite lash boost, and not much in terms of clumping. It dried pretty fast, but will smudge at first. All in all, no better or worse that what I would normally buy around the same price.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so clumpy.  I end up looking like a hooker...which is NOT the look I&#x27;m going for!  It&#x27;s yucky!</li>
            <li> This mascara barely bleeds when you&#x27;re bawling--it vibrates and separates your lashes--it doesn&#x27;t make you look like a raccoon or a model gone rogue. I have no complaints for this mascara and have been loyal to it for 3 years now. I promise it works and is the same quality as the lancome $42 version it copies.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow. It makes my lashes look long and full. I was iffy about using it because of the vibration but it is perfect Love it.</li>
            <li> For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t really lengthen or thicken them, but it really defined them and if thats what your going for then this is for you. It tickles when your applying the mascara and its vibrating, but its not hard at all to apply and it does a good job in one sweep. I did get clumping on the first try though but overall I would say its pretty good</li>
            <li> This thing is taking literally a year and a day to come .. ugh. Lol,  I&#x27;m so impatient.  Seriously I might have well ordered something else.</li>
            <li> i bought this at big lots for $3 after reading good reviews on here and i can honestly say i don&#x27;t understand how anyone can like this mascara..with or without the vibrating feature it clumped, probally one of the worst mascaras i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I admit it, I was curious. A mascara that vibrates? That is supposed to emit little vibrations as you apply it to your lashes and that is supposed to make them more defined? The first thing I think of is ....ghetto vibrator...&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I think is ..I hope no one actually uses this elsewhere and hurts themselves...although then they might have well defined lady parts to counterbalance the wand being lost \\&quot;up there\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen...its mascara...and I have used a lot in my lifetime. Been wearing makeup since I was 12 and that&#x27;s 26 years of hits, misses, trials and errors. The vibrations did nothing different than a regular wand. My lashes were no more defined by vibrating them, then not. I don&#x27;t think this device can vibrate strongly enough to still be safe, and do exactly what its telling you it can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes noise, its fun to use, but you better already have a steady hand or else your gonna be cleaning up a mess, and its not going to be a nice wet spot.</li>
            <li> So, first, the vibrating function. Who cares. I see no difference whatsoever whether I use it or don&#x27;t use it- and frankly, that&#x27;s alright with me, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara. Dear god, the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get more compliments on this formula of mascara than ANY other kind I&#x27;ve ever worn. I&#x27;ve only recently decided I&#x27;m a Revlon girl for mascaras, and while I&#x27;ve found the best results with them in the past, NOTHING compared to the formula for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect- dramatic, thick, very black. It lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump, and doesn&#x27;t run or get sticky. If it were legal, I&#x27;d marry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I could care less about the vibratory functions (at least in my mascara, wink wink nudge nudge say no more) - but I will buy this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market, and when it no longer is, I&#x27;ll be on here, fighting the rest of you for it.</li>
            <li> When I recieved this mascara I was a little disappointed because pulsing do not work. Then when I wrote to seller they refund me money, so I can say mascara is OK and the seller is good.</li>
            <li> I had big hopes for this inexpensive mascara based on the reviews, but the bottom line is that I found it too clumpy, even with just one coat. It did coat my lashes nicely and make them look full and thick, but what good is that if there are icky clumps? I&#x27;m considering buying an eyelash comb and using it to even things out after applying the mascara; maybe that will help.  As for the vibrating feature, I didn&#x27;t find it useful. I got clumps with or without the vibration.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0022PIKEO Pulse Perfection by Define-A-Lash Vibrating Mascara No. 841, Very Black by Maybelline, 0.22 Ounce]] For me, this was just an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; purchase. I&#x27;m not particular ecstatic about the product but, there wasn&#x27;t any need to return it. The vibrating part of the mascara works just fine for me. However, it does clump, and awfully at that! I&#x27;ve also found that when I continue to apply to the mascara, in hopes of smoothing out those clumps, it starts to harden, sticking my eyelashes to each other. That&#x27;s definitely NOT what was advertised. I&#x27;ve had to completely remove the mascara and reapply on two separate occasions because of this. All in all, it&#x27;s just OK. Not highly recommended but not blacklisted either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously rated this item a 3 star but after using it for some months now, I give it a 5 star. It&#x27;s long lasting, it does add a whole lot of length and volume to my lashes, so much so that it appears as if I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. In regards to the clumping issue I previously had, this is no longer so. It just needed to be broken in. It now goes on very smooth and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it drying out. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I got this mascara yesterday and immediatey tried it out. The vibrations feel funny, and actually hurt my first eye lid a little (I don&#x27;t know why), but the second eye didn&#x27;t do that so I guess I did something wrong. It looks beautiful, not very clumpy, dark, noticeable, wonderful mascara. I don&#x27;t know if the vibrations make a difference or what, but after reading the tips on the back mine looked great. I was only a little disappointed that the mascara didn&#x27;t curl my straight eyelashes enough (it did help though). I hate that I&#x27;m going to have to get a curler, but I think that I will use this mascara from now on. You just can&#x27;t beat the price for how great it actually is.</li>
            <li> Primary reason why I use a mascara is to get some volume and curling effect while having a natural look. This one has good finish but does not do either job and does not really look natural. I will continue to purchase estee lauder sumptuous instead. It is more expensive but worth the additional buck.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! It is the best mascara I have ever used, It goes on easily, comes off easily, and looks great on. It makes my lashes look fuller and longer than any other mascara. I can&#x27;t find it any where in the stores, so thank god for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. I just asked her how she liked it and she said it is the best mascara she has ever used &amp; now her favorite. I am glad because it was only $3.88 as opposed to the MAC mascara I was buying for her for $19.00. Looks like I have to report an A+++++</li>
            <li> I love the Vibrating Mascara i use it daily. I will buy again and give it as a gift to my friends.</li>
            <li> Has received these goods rejected though very much for it waited. There should be an interesting ink, and has come without a brush though all works, but from it to me it is not easier...I am angry!!!</li>
            <li> I am HUGE on mascara because unfortunately I don&#x27;t have very much lashes! It does wonders!! The vibration during application does not make it difficult to use. I&#x27;ve purchase 3 of these things already just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;ve tried TONS of other mascaras -- Dior Show, Buxom, Sephora Collection, Lancome, Too Faced, Laura Mercier, etc. This is hands down my fav.</li>
            <li> Got this, it works amazingly, really makes my lashes stand out, and makes my eyes just pop! I love it excellent product would recommend!!</li>
            <li> so far this is my favorite mascara. its for a very good price shipping included and everytime i order it, it comes on time. untill i find one that impresses me better i will continue to use this one</li>
            <li> A friend turned me to this mascara and I haven&#x27;t been able to live w out it. The pulse gives you the motion you need to extend and thicken your lashes. I tried to go back to a non-pulse mascara. Not the same results!</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best I have used in a very long time. I am 33 and have short straight lashes that are very hard to curl or lengthen. With this mascara I only have to swipe over them twice to give them super length and even a bit of curl. No clumping and my husband even asked me what I was doing different as far as applying my eye makeup. When I asked him to look at my lashes he agreed that was the major difference! Super product that does what it is supposed to. It does take some getting used to when applying pressure to the button that makes the wand vibrate but even if you do not use the vibrating feature you get great results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame this mascara to be the cause of a small rash I got under my left eye after using this, however once I stopped using it for a few days the rash is now almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;I hardly used the vibrating button because it made more of a mess on my eyelashes (maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it properly)  However I decided this mascara is too liquifying and I often would need a tissue to wipe the excess amount of mascara on my eyelashs, other wise it would smear on my face when I closed my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am unhappy with the results of my eye lid and the amount of times I had to fix the mess it made, it still does its job and holds on to make my lashes look darker and longer.</li>
            <li> Perfect every time, long lasting battery in the vibrating mechanism, makes lashes longer, fuller and natural!  Love this product, too bad it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not able to find it anywhere in stores anymore - so was glad to find it on Amazon.  Take a bit of getting used to if you&#x27;re a fist time user of the vibrating application handle, but let me reiterate...I Love This Product. :)  Separates your lashes from the root to the tip while covering them.  For those of you that like the look of full, separated, VIBErant (yah, I went there) eyelashes then this is the mascara for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: The waterproof version definitely is waterproof - you&#x27;ll need a makeup remover to thoroughly clean it from your lashes</li>
            <li> Favorite mascara forsure</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t known why Maybelline discontinue this marvelous mascara. After trying more than 50, this is my favorite. With one or two applications you get long lashes without clumps and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> I bought this awhile back but forgot to review it. It is long since finished now but I definitely got a good use out of it before it did. It does vibrate and coat my eyelashes very well, they looked much longer which is what I was looking for in the first place with this mascara. This particular color I think is out of stock so I will try the other ones but I will definitely buy more and recommend them.</li>
            <li> Because I had too mich trouble ordering it,and when my shipment came in it was the wring type of mascara, i wanted regular mascara,I was sent waterproof</li>
            <li> This mascara is not available everywhere and I am sooooooo glad that I found it here~ and this is cheaper than the store  Free shipping!! Perfect!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Very weak vibrations. I can&#x27;t even feel or see it moving.. don&#x27;t care for it and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried dozens! To be honest, I just want to help those who are skeptical about buying it online. I just checked to see if Amazon would have it in case I didn&#x27;t want to go out to the store and just with a few clicks order it if need be. Anyway, I bought this in the waterproof vibrating formula and it is awesome. The extension and length it gives your lashes without clumping is maaaaarvelous. And trust me, I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert on applying mascara. I just want a great tool that will do most of the work for me. The second best I found was Almays intense which goes on thicker ( a little clumpier, which is sometimes good)for those wanted a more \\&quot;thickened and filled-in\\&quot; look. But all in all, this vibrating mascara is awesome!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I did not realize that it a vibrating mascara. It does not seperate the lashes and it ends up sticking my lashes together. I have to end up using my old mascara brush to seperate the lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and makes my lashes extremely long without any clumps! I only gave it four stars because I wish the button that makes it vibrate was easier to click and keep vibrating without constantly having to hold it in. Though, I still love it and will continue to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product three days before Christmas and received it on Christmas day. The product was well packaged and in new working condition. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Mascara. Can no longer find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> This was on sale at a bargain store, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I should have passed it up. I suppose it&#x27;s a good thing that the vibration gizmo didn&#x27;t work. Now that I think about it, why would I want to put a vibrator on my eye? Bad thinking on my part. As for the cosmetic, itself -- I&#x27;m not a fan. It&#x27;s true that it does go on quite thick. However, it&#x27;s way too thick, and it&#x27;s hard to distribute on your lashes. It has the potential to make you look like you are wearing false lashes, which could be really cool. However, by the time you manage to work out the clumps, you&#x27;ve wasted so much time that you actually could have put on false lashes. Maybe if I devoted more time to the project.... However, after a while I just didn&#x27;t care any longer. It&#x27;s just too much like work.</li>
            <li> Ive used this mascara from the time it came out and i will continue until i cant find it anymore easy to use and easy to remove i havent had a problem with flaking my absolute favorite mascare</li>
            <li> Okay so first of all the shipping was FAST i got this in 2 days! :) I Loved that because i was so excited to try this product because i have heard they don&#x27;t have it on the shelves anymore as often as it use to be. You have to read the back for instructions and trust me it will work wonders! You have to pull off the little gold sticky tab at the top and then you&#x27;re good to go! This lengthened my lashes IMMEDIATELY on the first coat and separated them super nice! I&#x27;ve never tried a mascara like it haha. I did however take off one star because the button is awkwardly place at then end of the wand so when you&#x27;re pushing it it is a little tricky , and it also feels funny . Also u can hear it vibrating haha. But other then that it does work really well for what i paid for :)&lt;br /&gt;Also i would like to add the formula is a little too wet/watery but once it does dry it does make ur lashes a bit hard but that honestly depends on how much you put.&lt;br /&gt;But like i said, thi sis a very uniue mascara and i think everyone would have to try it out for themselves since we all have diffrent lashes :)&lt;br /&gt;(My lashes are dark &amp; naturally long somewhat thick but not too much)</li>
            <li> i love this, the package was a little bent up but what else can you expect with shipping? it vibrates when you push a button and gets more lashes than regular mascara! best for a first coat i think!</li>
            <li> The best mascara in town!</li>
            <li> Only mascara that works great for me..  Sorry to see that it was taken off the market and can be bought online only.</li>
            <li> This the best mascara and such a great price.  Maybelline was crazy for discontinuing this product.  All of my girlfriends used it.  At first we thought the vibrating brush was a gimmick but it really works and keep the lashes separated and the mascara evenly distributed from base to end.  We are sooooo happy to see this product in stock at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I should have known better!&lt;br /&gt;This product first hit the shelves in 2009 (In Canada at least) and was phased-out 2 years later.  My wife has been an avid user of the product and I found her some online.  This was my second purchase in the last 16 months.  The previous purchase was a little dry, but this one was solid.&lt;br /&gt;First sign :  No expiry date on the package.&lt;br /&gt;Second sign: Mascara has a shelf life of 12 to 15 months.&lt;br /&gt;Third sign:  Less retailers selling this product than a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation to PerfumeWorldWide, Inc…- Open and test a few of these, and do Not Sell your remaining inventory.</li>
            <li> I got it the other day I like the packing and when I tired it  on I didnt like it that much I guess I gotta get use to wearing mascara again I haven&#x27;t had mascara on for a long time so thank u again and the shipping was quick and fast thank u again</li>
            <li> best mascara ever Love this mascara truly like no other</li>
            <li> Good Buy Decent price the package was seal upon arrival it was cheaper then buying it at a store and it worked just fine. it vibrates a small amount to separte the lashes.</li>
            <li> I first bought this mascara because it was the most affordable one for me. Little did I know that I would fall in LOVE with it! Not only is the actual mascara great, but the vibrating feature really makes it all around the whole package. It separates each lash so my lashes always look full, long, healthy, and beautiful! If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this mascara, I would say absolutely go for it! You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> no  good stuff, actually it&#x27;s normal, when cost is so low! t&#x27;s better to spend more and to get qualitative mascara!</li>
            <li> Thicker longer ashes instantly!! great product!</li>
            <li> This mascara is very wet and &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; it causes your lashes to stick together.  I am still trying to figure out what purpose the vibrating feature serves.  In about an hour it looks like I ran into a pepper mill as there is black flakes all under my eyes.  I would not reccoment.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, I have found this mascara to be one of the best around and at a fraction of the cost of department store brands. Pair the mascara with MAC&#x27;s lash primer and you&#x27;ll see the results- longer, thicker lashes! One word of caution. The mascara does vibrate allowing for better delivery to your lashes. However, if you suffer from hand tremors or other issues which affect your motor skills, I would recommend not using the vibrating option.</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER! My eyelashes are extremly blonde and relatively thin, this mascara works wonders for me! I would reccomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Good product, cheap and fast delivery! Have always been using this mascara. The vibrating part is so awesome that it works on my eyelash well. Fabulously!</li>
            <li> I love the product and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll where.  My lashes are very fine and it&#x27; the only one that separates my lashes.  I wish I could still buy it in stores. I&#x27;ll keep buying it. Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> Subtle vibrating helps get to corner lashes, easier to place color at roots of lashes and gives better lash definition: no clumps.  Creates good length, solid color, lasts well.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara I am so happy to have found it on the internet for such a cheap price I saw it at Walmart for $12 and I only paid around 3 on Amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good product.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! This is my second time ordering. I swear by this product to so many people... It has beat out all of my other mascara&#x27;s! It deprecate lashes very well and the black is actually a very dark black. Makes lashes look wonderful. I ordered this a couple days ago and already got it! I got it almost two weeks before the delivery estimate! So happy!</li>
            <li> product is great. shipped pretty quickly. the only thing i was a little hesitant about was the button used to make it vibrate however the product itself makes full luscious lashes an anything that achieves that is 5 starts in my book. love it</li>
            <li> the mascara itself is nothing new, but the vibration of the brush really helps to pull my lashed apart, highlighting individual strands. the finished look is amazing when you see no clumping of your lashes. its easier than used an eyelash comb!</li>
