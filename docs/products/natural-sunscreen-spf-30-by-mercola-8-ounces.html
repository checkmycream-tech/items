    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>While the ingredients are excellent, something in the mixture does not work well.    </li>
            <li>Based on the recommendation of the wonderful person who does my facials, I use this product.</li>
            <li>I tested this thoroughly and it really is great!</li>
            <li>For a couple years now I have been on the hunt for the best sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful.</li>
            <li>and it has been great!!!  </li>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and have wanted to use zinc oxide products, but didn&#x27;t need to look any fairer at the beach.  </li>
            <li>but it still a great product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, too.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of protecting me from the sun.</li>
            <li>but if you dont care about that then its great.</li>
            <li>Great for me, not so great for him.</li>
            <li>Well I am fair skinned</li>
            <li>It goes into the garbage and another lesson learned, not all products from Mercola are good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, I have not used it a lot yet</li>
            <li>and spend you money on good quality sunscreen and then use it all of the time.</li>
            <li>sunscreen smells great, kind of like a coconut</li>
            <li>If you go to Dr. Mercola&#x27;s website, he does explain that sun exposure is good for you though.  </li>
            <li>My wife loved it, in fact, she wanted to TASTE it (not a joke)</li>
            <li>For me personally, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>We love the Mercola Lip protection too!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out easily when I take a shower, but it&#x27;s a great choice if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I feel good using this because its safe.</li>
            <li>Just kind of shimmery.  </li>
            <li>downside to this wonderful and apparently pretty safe stuff is that it turns your skin a pasty white/grey.</li>
            <li>It gave me great protection, but I looked white as a ghost, and I already have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I burn very easily, and this sunscreen does the job.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a safe sunscreen lotion that goes on easily and is not greasy like so many of the zinc oxide based sunscreens.</li>
            <li>An unexpected bonus - this is also a great oil-control/shine-control make-up primer!  </li>
            <li>Since then I have discovered ThinkBaby/ThinkSport sunscreen and am very happy so far.</li>
            <li>i have tried many natural/physical sunscreens and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>OK, this stuff is natural, that is awesome.  </li>
            <li>and she is more exotic</li>
            <li>I am a big believer in Dr. Mercola and buy his excellent supplements all the time.</li>
            <li>It reduces the appearance of pores and smoothes the appearance of skin - my make-up looks better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than toxic cancer causing sunscreens :)</li>
            <li>After the pinkness and heat were gone from that burn, I tried again, making sure I coated the lotion on, to the point that the zinc oxide was still somewhat visible.</li>
            <li>The reason why most of us look for lotions like this is because we want to make the healthiest decisions for our family.  </li>
            <li>It also allows you to spread it more evenly</li>
            <li>and it even goes on more transparent.  </li>
            <li>Plus you get more product and it lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the fewer ingredients the better.</li>
            <li>Love Mercola, need i say more ???</li>
            <li>LOVE Mercola&#x27;s spf face stick too.</li>
            <li>40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, done preaching. :-)</li>
            <li>No clay smell as with many titanium / zinc oxide</li>
            <li>I have scoured the Environmental Working Groups website to find safe sunscreens that are not harmful to my family.  </li>
            <li>I put a lot on my baby and reapplied many times.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did since I didn&#x27;t want to burn.</li>
            <li>I feel better using this that the others with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li>I now know it was one of the best things I could do for my little love bug!</li>
            <li>but when I have used it it has been just fine, nice to have a product without all the junk in it, one of the better choices right here!</li>
            <li>Trukids Sunny Days (very good, also $$), Coppertone Waterbabies Pure &amp; Simple (works good, inexpensive, not as safe as others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff sure is helping to prevent getting more and the original ones are fading.</li>
            <li>Number one is that is is free of all the junk ingredients found on so many cosmetic labels.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is non-greasy and gave me great protection for far longer than non zinc oxide products.  </li>
            <li>All natural sun screen that I am happy to use on my kids  with peace of mind.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to see if Amazon carried this sunscreen, and some reviewers gave great tips on how to apply it: Shake the bottle first, put some on your hand, and apply very fast on your body.</li>
            <li>Good for natural product certainly better than plastering chemicals all your body.</li>
            <li>I was happy to take the time to research my sunscreen this year and after doing so, I selected Dr. Mercola&#x27;s Broad Spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that Mercola tries his best to come out with clean, non toxic products.</li>
            <li>I was a nervous wreck as a new mom exposing my fair haired sweetie to the sun with a &amp;#34;non mainstream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, the natural scent of Mercola 30-SPF is light and the cream absorbs into the skin with no trace and no slick or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Why anyone would use a chemical filled sunscreen is beyond my comprehension.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat it for chemical free sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>sunscreen goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like that better than having harmful ingredients absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>You do have to shake it up good first, not use too much</li>
            <li>Need constant re-applying, which is probably good and should be done anyway.</li>
            <li>so I think it just didnt get rubbed in good enough.  </li>
            <li>I had good luck with this product by using the following methods (just sort of fell into doing this and</li>
            <li>This is the first time we have tried this type of sunscreen and so far so good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very nice white, not beige or tan like most natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>yes all these criticisms are true, however if you want invisible, even, convenient sunblock, then go by the spray-ons from a super chain store and soak up your benzene.  </li>
            <li>this one comes out really clean looking, fresh, wholesome and rubs / spreads great!&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>cause im a loyal costumer and fan.  </li>
            <li>but that goes away quickly as you rub it in.  </li>
            <li>I studied lotions far &amp; wide and found Mercola&#x27;s ingredients to be some of the best on the market.  </li>
            <li>They never got burnt, and it washes off quickly in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It has to soak in, which it will do quite quickly if you have not smeared some sort of moisturizer on beforehand which would block anything else from soaking</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide, the active ingredient, is very effective and, from all that I can find, the safest ingredient.</li>
            <li>it is nice to find a product that actually works well.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily and acne-prone, so I&#x27;m loving that extra benefit.</li>
            <li>But when we are in the sun all day I try to use a more natural sunscreen and this one works well.  </li>
            <li>Most natural sunscreens run you between $4-$6 an ounce.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also love Mercola&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>but we are pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li>I have not yet decided if I think it is worth it, but I have not yet worn it again.</li>
            <li>Our entire family uses this ..... while I am olive complexion and tan easily, my husband and daughter are both fair skin and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>test it first for allergic reaction, then test it by applying the sunblock, put a bracelet on your/their wrist or a fun sticker on an area of the body that will be exposed to the sun and check periodically for sun exposure on the skin ....</li>
            <li>It still leaves a white film, but it&#x27;s not embarrassing to go out in public, and the protection is great.</li>
            <li>I balked a bit at the price at first</li>
            <li>I put this on my face neck and ears on top of my regular moisturizer on days that I run outdoors.</li>
            <li>If you are using this in the same application as me be sure to check yourself after a run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure reapplying would be necessary after an hour or two.</li>
            <li>thinner consistency than most and does not leave your skin white.</li>
            <li>His shins and forearms got burned but he didnt get burned to a crisp</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I might use a sunscreen with a higher spf.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what this sunscreen did for me.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast!  </li>
            <li>OH .... remember to shake the bottle really well before applying the sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>If you are trying this for the first time ....</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s pretty evently smeared around I wait a minute or two, then apply my make-up.</li>
            <li>There was no green tea extract, no titanium dioxide, however there is a great deal of other stuff I&#x27;d prefer not to have in my sunscreen!</li>
            <li>It can take a little bit to rub in but It&#x27;s worth it to have better ingredients!</li>
            <li>The sun protection provided by Dr. Mercola Natural Sunscreen with Green Tea is great.</li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You get 8 ounces where most others give 4 ounces for around $15 or so.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m ok with letting some sun through, as long as I don&#x27;t get burned.  </li>
            <li>There are no reviews on the website, which can be very helpful, and I didn&#x27;t like it at all the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you value sunscreen that really works!</li>
            <li>i really wish i could give it 4/5 stars</li>
            <li>This non-toxic sunscreen works very well,</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It does need to be rubbed in VERY well and leaves a sorta purply cast to skin.  </li>
            <li>thank Mercola for making this great product because most everything else on the market contains nasty chemicals and/or costs MUCH more.</li>
            <li>almost as if they didn&#x27;t want you to see what&#x27;s really in it)</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much for it</li>
            <li>Was just diagnosed with some pre skin cancer, so I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li>You really need to rub it in, but it does work well as a primer under your makeup.</li>
            <li>I also used it but not as much as I put on my baby.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and relatively fair skin that nearly always burns and then gradually tans to a moderate level.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white residue until you figure out to put it on your fingertips first or the center of your palm, lightly rub together, and then rub on your face or body quickly!  </li>
            <li>Apparently the founder of the company has some weird philosophies, but I ignore that and use this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, my face seems better looking, I know that sounds funny, but maybe it is the green tea in it?  </li>
            <li>I was outside between 2:30 and 5:30 in the full sun and no sunburn.  </li>
            <li>The two main problems are:    </li>
            <li>My husband in particular has this problem when he has stubble on his face and can&#x27;t blend that area as well</li>
            <li>just have to apply and rub in quickly for no white appearance.</li>
            <li>This is the first time Ive been on a vacation to the beach and havent come back burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are exactly the same (although the Tropical sands has a higher percent of Titanium Dioxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommended.</li>
            <li>I just felt like I had a little more protection.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen so far.</li>
            <li>far I really like the Mercola Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>If I really wanted complete burn protection</li>
            <li>It says it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes, but first contact with water takes away all the white particles from it.</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit white at first</li>
            <li>If you apply a glob directly to skin, you are prone to look ghostly!  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for a long time - a good value.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, totally non-greasy and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all have at least a little odor even if they say &#x27;odor free&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I look like a real live human being again(giggle).</li>
            <li>I was out in direct sunlight on a cloudless day for about 6-7 hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ironic because she wanted total block</li>
            <li>I ordered it directly from Mercola along with the bug spray.</li>
            <li>I picked this because it is all natural and naturally waterproof.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen for my child because they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very white film, but, will use it on the beach because it really blocks the sun.</li>
            <li>I wish someone had told me this when I was young.</li>
            <li>Very white and chalky no matter how much rubbing in you do.  </li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t really leave much of a white cast at all.  </li>
            <li>I also did not break out in any way, although I do not have sensitive</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve only tried it once, so I really should use it again and on my kids to re-evaluate.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 month old baby for our trip to Colombia.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t completely rub in just like</li>
            <li>In the early morning I put on a coat and re-applied at lunch time.  </li>
            <li>The stuff naturally soaks into your skin without any smearing or rubbing.</li>
            <li>Really, after it turned my skin a white or grey color, I thought OK it will soak in in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>It DOES have the tendency to turn a little white or lighten your face if you use too much or do not rub it in quickly.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers mentioned &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; and they were right.</li>
            <li>I mean really, some of the things we put on ourselves is really full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Was really excited when saw Dr. mercola had a natural product so ordered it along with my usual supplements.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve purchased many: thinkbaby (one of my favorites, but expensive), aubrey organics (works good, not a great smell, also somewhat $$),</li>
            <li>The zinc oxide in this lotion does provide a good sunblock but it was a little hard to rub in</li>
            <li>It probably keeps you from burning but who wants to go out in public looking like a white dork.</li>
            <li>I tried it out for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li>During sweating the white comes back a little where your sweat accumulates but is wiped away easily.</li>
            <li>My husband works outside a lot &amp; found his face did not burn like it did with another natural sunscreen he used.</li>
            <li>so, I would recommend, as with any new product, test it on a small area first.  </li>
            <li>Especially young people - forget all the other stuff they tell you to buy (foundation, etc.)</li>
            <li>Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes but after application my skin had a pinkish grey tint to it that several people commented on.</li>
            <li>and I generally use it only for my face.</li>
            <li>I am not afraid of the sun and usually don&#x27;t use sunscreen but instead just avoid the hottest part of the day.  </li>
            <li>if you happen to put a little too much in one place, no problem, just spreads around.</li>
            <li>This one does leave my skin looking a little whitish, but I use it for when I&#x27;m playing golf, yard work or cycling, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>This did not work plus we kept her out of the sun as much as possible which is good because she would have been as bad as me.</li>

            <li> We love the Mercola Lip protection too!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out easily when I take a shower, but it&#x27;s a great choice if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I feel good using this because its safe.</li>

            <li> and she is more exotic</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in Dr. Mercola and buy his excellent supplements all the time.</li>
            <li> It reduces the appearance of pores and smoothes the appearance of skin - my make-up looks better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than toxic cancer causing sunscreens :)</li>
            <li> After the pinkness and heat were gone from that burn, I tried again, making sure I coated the lotion on, to the point that the zinc oxide was still somewhat visible.</li>
            <li> The reason why most of us look for lotions like this is because we want to make the healthiest decisions for our family.  </li>
            <li> It also allows you to spread it more evenly</li>
            <li> and it even goes on more transparent.  </li>
            <li> Plus you get more product and it lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the fewer ingredients the better.</li>
            <li> Love Mercola, need i say more ???</li>
            <li> LOVE Mercola&#x27;s spf face stick too.</li>
            <li> 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, done preaching. :-)</li>
            <li> No clay smell as with many titanium / zinc oxide</li>
            <li> I have scoured the Environmental Working Groups website to find safe sunscreens that are not harmful to my family.  </li>
            <li> I put a lot on my baby and reapplied many times.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did since I didn&#x27;t want to burn.</li>
            <li> I feel better using this that the others with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> I now know it was one of the best things I could do for my little love bug!</li>
            <li> but when I have used it it has been just fine, nice to have a product without all the junk in it, one of the better choices right here!</li>
            <li> Trukids Sunny Days (very good, also $$), Coppertone Waterbabies Pure &amp; Simple (works good, inexpensive, not as safe as others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff sure is helping to prevent getting more and the original ones are fading.</li>
            <li> Number one is that is is free of all the junk ingredients found on so many cosmetic labels.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is non-greasy and gave me great protection for far longer than non zinc oxide products.  </li>
            <li> All natural sun screen that I am happy to use on my kids  with peace of mind.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to see if Amazon carried this sunscreen, and some reviewers gave great tips on how to apply it: Shake the bottle first, put some on your hand, and apply very fast on your body.</li>
            <li> Good for natural product certainly better than plastering chemicals all your body.</li>
            <li> I was happy to take the time to research my sunscreen this year and after doing so, I selected Dr. Mercola&#x27;s Broad Spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that Mercola tries his best to come out with clean, non toxic products.</li>
            <li> I was a nervous wreck as a new mom exposing my fair haired sweetie to the sun with a &amp;#34;non mainstream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> Best of all, the natural scent of Mercola 30-SPF is light and the cream absorbs into the skin with no trace and no slick or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Why anyone would use a chemical filled sunscreen is beyond my comprehension.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for chemical free sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> sunscreen goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like that better than having harmful ingredients absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> You do have to shake it up good first, not use too much</li>
            <li> Need constant re-applying, which is probably good and should be done anyway.</li>
            <li> so I think it just didnt get rubbed in good enough.  </li>
            <li> I had good luck with this product by using the following methods (just sort of fell into doing this and</li>
            <li> This is the first time we have tried this type of sunscreen and so far so good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very nice white, not beige or tan like most natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> yes all these criticisms are true, however if you want invisible, even, convenient sunblock, then go by the spray-ons from a super chain store and soak up your benzene.  </li>
            <li> this one comes out really clean looking, fresh, wholesome and rubs / spreads great!&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> cause im a loyal costumer and fan.  </li>
            <li> but that goes away quickly as you rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I studied lotions far &amp; wide and found Mercola&#x27;s ingredients to be some of the best on the market.  </li>
            <li> They never got burnt, and it washes off quickly in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It has to soak in, which it will do quite quickly if you have not smeared some sort of moisturizer on beforehand which would block anything else from soaking</li>
            <li> Titanium dioxide, the active ingredient, is very effective and, from all that I can find, the safest ingredient.</li>
            <li> it is nice to find a product that actually works well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily and acne-prone, so I&#x27;m loving that extra benefit.</li>
            <li> But when we are in the sun all day I try to use a more natural sunscreen and this one works well.  </li>
            <li> Most natural sunscreens run you between $4-$6 an ounce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also love Mercola&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> but we are pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> I have not yet decided if I think it is worth it, but I have not yet worn it again.</li>
            <li> Our entire family uses this ..... while I am olive complexion and tan easily, my husband and daughter are both fair skin and blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> test it first for allergic reaction, then test it by applying the sunblock, put a bracelet on your/their wrist or a fun sticker on an area of the body that will be exposed to the sun and check periodically for sun exposure on the skin ....</li>
            <li> It still leaves a white film, but it&#x27;s not embarrassing to go out in public, and the protection is great.</li>
            <li> I balked a bit at the price at first</li>
            <li> I put this on my face neck and ears on top of my regular moisturizer on days that I run outdoors.</li>
            <li> If you are using this in the same application as me be sure to check yourself after a run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure reapplying would be necessary after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> thinner consistency than most and does not leave your skin white.</li>
            <li> His shins and forearms got burned but he didnt get burned to a crisp</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I might use a sunscreen with a higher spf.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what this sunscreen did for me.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast!  </li>
            <li> OH .... remember to shake the bottle really well before applying the sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> If you are trying this for the first time ....</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s pretty evently smeared around I wait a minute or two, then apply my make-up.</li>
            <li> There was no green tea extract, no titanium dioxide, however there is a great deal of other stuff I&#x27;d prefer not to have in my sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It can take a little bit to rub in but It&#x27;s worth it to have better ingredients!</li>
            <li> The sun protection provided by Dr. Mercola Natural Sunscreen with Green Tea is great.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You get 8 ounces where most others give 4 ounces for around $15 or so.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m ok with letting some sun through, as long as I don&#x27;t get burned.  </li>
            <li> There are no reviews on the website, which can be very helpful, and I didn&#x27;t like it at all the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you value sunscreen that really works!</li>
            <li> i really wish i could give it 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> This non-toxic sunscreen works very well,</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It does need to be rubbed in VERY well and leaves a sorta purply cast to skin.  </li>
            <li> thank Mercola for making this great product because most everything else on the market contains nasty chemicals and/or costs MUCH more.</li>
            <li> almost as if they didn&#x27;t want you to see what&#x27;s really in it)</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much for it</li>
            <li> Was just diagnosed with some pre skin cancer, so I was really looking forward to this product.</li>
            <li> You really need to rub it in, but it does work well as a primer under your makeup.</li>
            <li> I also used it but not as much as I put on my baby.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and relatively fair skin that nearly always burns and then gradually tans to a moderate level.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white residue until you figure out to put it on your fingertips first or the center of your palm, lightly rub together, and then rub on your face or body quickly!  </li>
            <li> Apparently the founder of the company has some weird philosophies, but I ignore that and use this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my face seems better looking, I know that sounds funny, but maybe it is the green tea in it?  </li>
            <li> I was outside between 2:30 and 5:30 in the full sun and no sunburn.  </li>
            <li> The two main problems are:    </li>
            <li> My husband in particular has this problem when he has stubble on his face and can&#x27;t blend that area as well</li>
            <li> just have to apply and rub in quickly for no white appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the first time Ive been on a vacation to the beach and havent come back burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are exactly the same (although the Tropical sands has a higher percent of Titanium Dioxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just felt like I had a little more protection.  </li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen so far.</li>
            <li> far I really like the Mercola Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> If I really wanted complete burn protection</li>
            <li> It says it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes, but first contact with water takes away all the white particles from it.</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit white at first</li>
            <li> If you apply a glob directly to skin, you are prone to look ghostly!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for a long time - a good value.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, totally non-greasy and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all have at least a little odor even if they say &#x27;odor free&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I look like a real live human being again(giggle).</li>
            <li> I was out in direct sunlight on a cloudless day for about 6-7 hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ironic because she wanted total block</li>
            <li> I ordered it directly from Mercola along with the bug spray.</li>
            <li> I picked this because it is all natural and naturally waterproof.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my child because they have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very white film, but, will use it on the beach because it really blocks the sun.</li>
            <li> I wish someone had told me this when I was young.</li>
            <li> Very white and chalky no matter how much rubbing in you do.  </li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t really leave much of a white cast at all.  </li>
            <li> I also did not break out in any way, although I do not have sensitive</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve only tried it once, so I really should use it again and on my kids to re-evaluate.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 month old baby for our trip to Colombia.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t completely rub in just like</li>
            <li> In the early morning I put on a coat and re-applied at lunch time.  </li>
            <li> The stuff naturally soaks into your skin without any smearing or rubbing.</li>
            <li> Really, after it turned my skin a white or grey color, I thought OK it will soak in in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It DOES have the tendency to turn a little white or lighten your face if you use too much or do not rub it in quickly.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; and they were right.</li>
            <li> I mean really, some of the things we put on ourselves is really full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Was really excited when saw Dr. mercola had a natural product so ordered it along with my usual supplements.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased many: thinkbaby (one of my favorites, but expensive), aubrey organics (works good, not a great smell, also somewhat $$),</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide in this lotion does provide a good sunblock but it was a little hard to rub in</li>
            <li> It probably keeps you from burning but who wants to go out in public looking like a white dork.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for the first time the other day.  </li>
            <li> During sweating the white comes back a little where your sweat accumulates but is wiped away easily.</li>
            <li> My husband works outside a lot &amp; found his face did not burn like it did with another natural sunscreen he used.</li>
            <li> so, I would recommend, as with any new product, test it on a small area first.  </li>
            <li> Especially young people - forget all the other stuff they tell you to buy (foundation, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes but after application my skin had a pinkish grey tint to it that several people commented on.</li>
            <li> and I generally use it only for my face.</li>
            <li> I am not afraid of the sun and usually don&#x27;t use sunscreen but instead just avoid the hottest part of the day.  </li>
            <li> if you happen to put a little too much in one place, no problem, just spreads around.</li>
            <li> This one does leave my skin looking a little whitish, but I use it for when I&#x27;m playing golf, yard work or cycling, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> This did not work plus we kept her out of the sun as much as possible which is good because she would have been as bad as me.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I had several people ask me if I was OK because I was so pale.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I really needed the second application</li>
            <li> When I took a shower at night, the zinc was a little hard to get off, but since it is not bad for your skin, I didn&#x27;t worry about it and the next day it came off.  </li>
            <li> Mercola&#x27;s sunscreen is white, but stays on for a very long time when the kids are in the pool for hours.  </li>
            <li> Went to the Dry Tortugas for an entire day.  </li>
            <li> This year, my family took a trip to a location much closer to the equator than we live, and I was disappointed that although I coated the lotion on, I still got pretty burned within the four hours I was on a boat (in the shade, but with water reflecting the sun).</li>
            <li> Just have to rub it in for a long time.</li>
            <li> It did keep my face from burning and seem to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as pasty white as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> You will want to allow it to dry a bit longer before jumping in the pool so it has time to dry thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I wore it to a baseball game sitting in the hot sun for 5 hours.</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to rub this stuff in if you have hairy arms and legs, so for most men this could pose a problem.</li>
            <li> I have skin cancer and the very dangerous kind</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how it is when wet.</li>
            <li> and when I got wet it seemed to drip off.</li>
            <li> It lasted the whole game without reapplying.</li>
            <li> Kinda curious why EWG will not write a review of this product on their website???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the ingredients listed above: &amp;#34;Inactive Ingredients: Deionized Water, Sunflower Oil, Lecithin, Coconut Oil, Glycerine, Xanthan Gum, Green Tea Extract, Jojoba Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Shea Butter, Eucalyptus Oil.</li>
            <li> But have to be careful as you may think you need alot but</li>
            <li> No pilling or flaking like other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> She will be 5 soon and we have used this at endless soccer games, water activities, we have traveled from Georgia, to Florida, to California</li>
            <li> The other reviewers are right--trying to rub it into your skin won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Reapplied often, still was a little pink.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it cakes on their skin and is visible after application.</li>
            <li> AND it really does disappear so you dont feel a &#x27;weight&#x27; on the skin or that clammy, uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> This does cut down quite a bit on streaking.  </li>
            <li> it just doesnt feel or look right - seems to come out &#x27;dirty&#x27; looking AND makes the skin change color.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> and I wanted just a little bit of a tan.</li>
            <li> I have tried other zinc oxide products in the past and they were gloppy, runny and separated in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> just a little goes</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is hard to squeeze out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not in my everyday routine</li>
            <li> Looks like a dead person&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with this stuff is that it makes the skin look like you are dead.  </li>
            <li> Looks like zombie pale skin.</li>
            <li> NOT COOL!  </li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand did not fair so well.</li>
            <li> It is however difficult to apply and leaves white marks.</li>
            <li> unfortunately when i used this product the oil ingredients made made me produce some white headed pimples.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I returned from a short two-hour beach trip with sunburn again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say I won&#x27;t buy this product a second time</li>
            <li> I will say, a friend used it on her daughter and she broke out with small bumps ....</li>
            <li> I usually reapply every couple of hours if she is in the water a lot.  </li>
            <li> but nobody wants to walk around on the beach looking sick.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to get it to rub in and not show though--had a whitish cast as long as it was on.</li>
            <li> The product turns your skin white and as other reviewers said sickly looking.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind that when my little one was an infant, at least I knew I didn&#x27;t miss any spots!  </li>
            <li> so I have to use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Not a good look on the beach...</li>
            <li> Not sure what was wrong but had to go buy another sunscreen.</li>
            <li> no matter how thinly I apply it.  </li>
            <li> Not charming!</li>
            <li> ashy, grey, SICKLY!    </li>
            <li> It is almost water insoluble and is difficult to remove from your skin and clothing.</li>
            <li> but I hate looking dead.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to say it .....</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> (this seems to help re-mix the titantium oxide which is what blocks the bad rays of the sun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed as I had bought 2 for myself and 2 as gifts -- and now it won&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does not work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> The product protects from sun well and I never had any allergic reaction. It is however difficult to apply and leaves white marks. It says it is water resistant for up to 80 minutes, but first contact with water takes away all the white particles from it. Need constant re-applying, which is probably good and should be done anyway.</li>
            <li> I usually only review a product to praise it or to trash it.  This sunscreen gets PRAISE. In a world where everything seems to be bull#$%^ it is nice to find a product that actually works well.  I tried it out for the first time the other day.  I was out in direct sunlight on a cloudless day for about 6-7 hours.  I only re-applied once and it was really just a few drops here and there.  The next day I had zero burn.  Why anyone would use a chemical filled sunscreen is beyond my comprehension.  FYI, this sunscreen is made by Mexitan and is marketed under several different names.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that Mercola tries his best to come out with clean, non toxic products. My only complaint is that it is hard to squeeze out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Number one is that is is free of all the junk ingredients found on so many cosmetic labels. Titanium dioxide, the active ingredient, is very effective and, from all that I can find, the safest ingredient. My wife and I went to Hawaii for our honey moon. She used her commercial 100-SPF and I used my Mercola 30-SPF. Well I am fair skinned and she is more exotic and she is the one who got the tan while I got nothing. It&#x27;s ironic because she wanted total block and I wanted just a little bit of a tan. The point is, anything labeled over 40-SPF is marketing bunk: If it takes 20 minutes to start a burn then \\&quot;100 SPF\\&quot; would protect you for over 33 hours! That means if you stayed out in the sun for 8 hours, according to the rating, it would be the same theoretical exposure as 4 minutes and 48 seconds. Nonsense.    Best of all, the natural scent of Mercola 30-SPF is light and the cream absorbs into the skin with no trace and no slick or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I am very fair, and have wanted to use zinc oxide products, but didn&#x27;t need to look any fairer at the beach.  This sunscreen is non-greasy and gave me great protection for far longer than non zinc oxide products.  I did not go into the water, so I can&#x27;t comment on how it is when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of mercola for years.  i have used his b-16 spray, krill oil, vitamins. etc.  i was pumped for this sunscreen because mercola takes care in his ingredients. unfortunately when i used this product the oil ingredients made made me produce some white headed pimples.  NOT COOL!  i do have some what sensative skin so if you tend to breakout, pass on this item.  I had pimples on my face and even two came up on my arms.  watch out for the oilness, read the labels.  i really wish i could give it 4/5 stars cause im a loyal costumer and fan.  my mom and sister tried it and they had some pimples too.  so maybe it just runs in our family.</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in Dr. Mercola and buy his excellent supplements all the time. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this sunscreen. While the ingredients are excellent, something in the mixture does not work well.    The two main problems are:    It stained my skin white and it would not come off even after a thorough scrub-down in the shower. Not a good look on the beach...ashy, grey, SICKLY!    When I rubbed it onto my skin, it created rolls or peels of the product. I.e., it would not rub in, it rubbed off!    Too bad.</li>
            <li> This non-toxic sunscreen works very well, no matter how thinly I apply it.  It goes on a bit white at first but that goes away quickly as you rub it in.  An unexpected bonus - this is also a great oil-control/shine-control make-up primer!  It reduces the appearance of pores and smoothes the appearance of skin - my make-up looks better and lasts longer.  My skin is oily and acne-prone, so I&#x27;m loving that extra benefit. I balked a bit at the price at first but it is now the only sunscreen I use.  A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts for a long time - a good value.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you value sunscreen that really works!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. I ordered it directly from Mercola along with the bug spray. When applied, this sunscreen makes you look like a ghost, all whitewashed as if you painted yourself with white paint. It probably keeps you from burning but who wants to go out in public looking like a white dork. It is almost water insoluble and is difficult to remove from your skin and clothing. It goes into the garbage and another lesson learned, not all products from Mercola are good.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not in my everyday routine and I generally use it only for my face. I picked this because it is all natural and naturally waterproof. I put this on my face neck and ears on top of my regular moisturizer on days that I run outdoors. It protects my body from the damaging rays and stands up to my sweating during the run. It DOES have the tendency to turn a little white or lighten your face if you use too much or do not rub it in quickly. My husband in particular has this problem when he has stubble on his face and can&#x27;t blend that area as well but it still a great product. If you are using this in the same application as me be sure to check yourself after a run. During sweating the white comes back a little where your sweat accumulates but is wiped away easily. This also doesn&#x27;t leave me any problems with clogging my pores or giving me any breakouts or allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for my child because they have sensitive skin. My only complaint is that it cakes on their skin and is visible after application.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have been in the sun at the lake during this heat wave and have just tanned, no sunburn at all. Usually byrn the first 2 or 3 times in the sun at the beginning of summer. Would highly recommend it for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of traditional sunscreen.  I am not afraid of the sun and usually don&#x27;t use sunscreen but instead just avoid the hottest part of the day.  But when we are in the sun all day I try to use a more natural sunscreen and this one works well.  Just have to rub it in for a long time.</li>
            <li> The zinc oxide in this lotion does provide a good sunblock but it was a little hard to rub in and when I got wet it seemed to drip off.</li>
            <li> I have tried other zinc oxide products in the past and they were gloppy, runny and separated in the bottle.  Not this one.  Smells great, too.  Protected me for 2 weeks in the Caribbean sun.  HIghly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen so far. I wore it to a baseball game sitting in the hot sun for 5 hours. It lasted the whole game without reapplying. It can take a little bit to rub in but It&#x27;s worth it to have better ingredients! If you&#x27;re in the water or sweating a lot I&#x27;m sure reapplying would be necessary after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for chemical free sunscreen.  It does need to be rubbed in VERY well and leaves a sorta purply cast to skin.  Oh well! It&#x27;s better than toxic cancer causing sunscreens :)</li>
            <li> Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;Had high hopes but after application my skin had a pinkish grey tint to it that several people commented on.</li>
            <li> I was happy to take the time to research my sunscreen this year and after doing so, I selected Dr. Mercola&#x27;s Broad Spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen. I have blonde hair and relatively fair skin that nearly always burns and then gradually tans to a moderate level. This year, my family took a trip to a location much closer to the equator than we live, and I was disappointed that although I coated the lotion on, I still got pretty burned within the four hours I was on a boat (in the shade, but with water reflecting the sun). After the pinkness and heat were gone from that burn, I tried again, making sure I coated the lotion on, to the point that the zinc oxide was still somewhat visible. Unfortunately, I returned from a short two-hour beach trip with sunburn again. I&#x27;m sorry to say I won&#x27;t buy this product a second time and I won&#x27;t be recommending it to family/friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews about how this lotion goes on white, clumpy, streaky, etc...  The reason why most of us look for lotions like this is because we want to make the healthiest decisions for our family.  After my daughter&#x27;s chemo, I was militant about protecting her from future skin cancers which can be a bi-product of her treatments.  I studied lotions far &amp; wide and found Mercola&#x27;s ingredients to be some of the best on the market.  Kinda curious why EWG will not write a review of this product on their website???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my experience is . . . yes all these criticisms are true, however if you want invisible, even, convenient sunblock, then go by the spray-ons from a super chain store and soak up your benzene.  Mercola&#x27;s sunscreen is white, but stays on for a very long time when the kids are in the pool for hours.  They never got burnt, and it washes off quickly in the shower.  I usually mix it with a small amount of distiller water to help it spread more evenly.  This does cut down quite a bit on streaking.  It also allows you to spread it more evenly and it even goes on more transparent.  You will want to allow it to dry a bit longer before jumping in the pool so it has time to dry thoroughly.  Plus you get more product and it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thank Mercola for making this great product because most everything else on the market contains nasty chemicals and/or costs MUCH more.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Dr. Mercola but this product fell short.  The product turns your skin white and as other reviewers said sickly looking. It took a while before you could remove it as well.  It did it&#x27;s job of protecting your skin from sunburn but nobody wants to walk around on the beach looking sick.  I was disappointed as I had bought 2 for myself and 2 as gifts -- and now it won&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Only used this a couple times. It did keep my face from burning and seem to go a long way. Good for natural product certainly better than plastering chemicals all your body.</li>
            <li> I like the thinner consistency and appreciate the non-chemical quality ingredients. I was unable to get it to rub in and not show though--had a whitish cast as long as it was on. However-- if you don&#x27;t mind looking whiteish it works well. My husband is using it for surfing-- in water for 90 minutes and it was still coating his skin (water beaded off). I have not found a non-chemical sunscreen yet that leaves no whitish cast, perhaps it is just the nature of the beast. Am trying several others-will report back after we try them out.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very white film, but, will use it on the beach because it really blocks the sun.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the ingredients listed above: &amp;#34;Inactive Ingredients: Deionized Water, Sunflower Oil, Lecithin, Coconut Oil, Glycerine, Xanthan Gum, Green Tea Extract, Jojoba Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Shea Butter, Eucalyptus Oil. Active Ingredients: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide.&amp;#34; When I received it, I noticed completely different ingredients listed on the back of the bottle (in the tinest print I&#x27;ve ever seen... almost as if they didn&#x27;t want you to see what&#x27;s really in it) There was no green tea extract, no titanium dioxide, however there is a great deal of other stuff I&#x27;d prefer not to have in my sunscreen! It also has a chemical smell to it and gave me a headache. Definitely not something I want to slather on my skin every day. Returned! Here are the actual ingredients: Zinc Oxide 20%, Aqua, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Helanthus Annuus(Sunflower) Seed Oil, Lecithin, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Olivate, Glycerin, Simmonds Chinensia(Jojoba) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii(Shea) Butter, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera(Coconut) Oil, Glucurolactone, Potassium Sorbate, Xanthan Gum, Punica Granalum Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Rubus Idaeus(Raspberry) Seed Oil, Astaxanthain Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil. I specifically didn&#x27;t like seeing that there is Lecithin or Potassium Sorbate in this sunscreen. In my opinion, the fewer ingredients the better. Since then I have discovered ThinkBaby/ThinkSport sunscreen and am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Disappointed..used at the beach. Reapplied often, still was a little pink. Was hoping because of the price this would work.</li>
            <li> Was really excited when saw Dr. mercola had a natural product so ordered it along with my usual supplements. Went to the Caribbean a couple weeks after it arrived and my son and I tried to use it. We couldn&#x27;t seem to get it to rub in without looking like we rubbed our skin off...left us looking flaky all over. Not sure what was wrong but had to go buy another sunscreen. Expiration was 2 years out. Product will be going back.</li>
            <li> Love Mercola, need i say more ??? thanks.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I have not used it a lot yet so I can&#x27;t say much for it but when I have used it it has been just fine, nice to have a product without all the junk in it, one of the better choices right here!</li>
            <li> i have tried many natural/physical sunscreens and this one is by far the best. thinner consistency than most and does not leave your skin white. just have to apply and rub in quickly for no white appearance. LOVE Mercola&#x27;s spf face stick too.</li>
            <li> Based on the recommendation of the wonderful person who does my facials, I use this product. Apparently the founder of the company has some weird philosophies, but I ignore that and use this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, no matter what sunscreen you ultimately choose, please do use sunscreen. I didn&#x27;t use any for years and regret it. Especially young people - forget all the other stuff they tell you to buy (foundation, etc.) and spend you money on good quality sunscreen and then use it all of the time. I wish someone had told me this when I was young. If you&#x27;re like me and are outside all of the time, you&#x27;ll appreciate what I&#x27;m saying when you turn 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, done preaching. :-)</li>
            <li> (I am writing a review under my husband&#x27;s name)I have mixed feelings about this sunscreen. For me personally, I LOVE IT! This is the first time Ive been on a vacation to the beach and havent come back burnt to a crisp. I feel good using this because its safe. It did a great job of protecting me from the sun. It does seem to leave a white pasty look when you put it on but if you dont care about that then its great. My husband on the other hand did not fair so well. Its very difficult to rub this stuff in if you have hairy arms and legs, so for most men this could pose a problem. His shins and forearms got burned but he didnt get burned to a crisp so I think it just didnt get rubbed in good enough.  Great for me, not so great for him.</li>
            <li> Very white and chalky no matter how much rubbing in you do.  Looks like zombie pale skin. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I tested this thoroughly and it really is great! Nice texture, totally non-greasy and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all have at least a little odor even if they say &#x27;odor free&#x27;. Not this product!&lt;br /&gt;Truly odor free.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS it&#x27;s a very nice white, not beige or tan like most natural sunscreens. So when you put that stuff on your skin it just doesnt feel or look right - seems to come out &#x27;dirty&#x27; looking AND makes the skin change color.&lt;br /&gt;But this one comes out really clean looking, fresh, wholesome and rubs / spreads great!&lt;br /&gt;Most seem to have a bit of &#x27;sandpaper&#x27; feel to them when rubbing on the skin. This one knows how to spread evenly without &#x27;bunching up&#x27; in one place on the skin or causing friction.&lt;br /&gt;So if you happen to put a little too much in one place, no problem, just spreads around. AND it really does disappear so you dont feel a &#x27;weight&#x27; on the skin or that clammy, uncomfortable feeling. No clay smell as with many titanium / zinc oxide products.&lt;br /&gt;NOT sticky at all. But have to be careful as you may think you need alot but just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;You get 8 ounces where most others give 4 ounces for around $15 or so.</li>
            <li> Was just diagnosed with some pre skin cancer, so I was really looking forward to this product. Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I don&#x27;t care for the smell and it seems to leave a sticky white residue when applied. Not at all what I had hoped it would be....will continue to search for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; sunscreen.........</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned &amp;#34;white face&amp;#34; and they were right. You really need to rub it in, but it does work well as a primer under your makeup. It also has a smell that reminds me of Nozema.</li>
            <li> For a couple years now I have been on the hunt for the best sunscreen.  I have scoured the Environmental Working Groups website to find safe sunscreens that are not harmful to my family.  We&#x27;ve purchased many: thinkbaby (one of my favorites, but expensive), aubrey organics (works good, not a great smell, also somewhat $$), Trukids Sunny Days (very good, also $$), Coppertone Waterbabies Pure &amp; Simple (works good, inexpensive, not as safe as others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I really like the Mercola Sunscreen.  It&#x27;s not on the EWG as \\&quot;Mercola\\&quot;, but I&#x27;ve heard it is the same suncreen as Tropical Sands ([...]) which is rated as a 1.  The ingredients are exactly the same (although the Tropical sands has a higher percent of Titanium Dioxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen goes on smooth.  No pilling or flaking like other reviewers mentioned. Not nearly as pasty white as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.  This one didn&#x27;t really leave much of a white cast at all.  Just kind of shimmery.  I also did not break out in any way, although I do not have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen smells great, kind of like a coconut mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is relatively inexpensive.  8 ounces for $15.97, that&#x27;s under $2 an ounce!  Most natural sunscreens run you between $4-$6 an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.  Now, I&#x27;ve only tried it once, so I really should use it again and on my kids to re-evaluate.  I was outside between 2:30 and 5:30 in the full sun and no sunburn.  I definitely can tell I was in the sun though, but I did not get sunburn. If I really wanted complete burn protection I might use a sunscreen with a higher spf.  If you go to Dr. Mercola&#x27;s website, he does explain that sun exposure is good for you though.  So I&#x27;m ok with letting some sun through, as long as I don&#x27;t get burned.  This is exactly what this sunscreen did for me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. All natural sun screen that I am happy to use on my kids  with peace of mind. Just remember to rub it in all the way!!!</li>
            <li> My husband works outside a lot &amp; found his face did not burn like it did with another natural sunscreen he used. Also love Mercola&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 month old baby for our trip to Colombia. So it doesn&#x27;t completely rub in just like the other reviews stated. I did notice it did drip off us when we got out of the water. I put a lot on my baby and reapplied many times. I also used it but not as much as I put on my baby. We are both burnt. This did not work plus we kept her out of the sun as much as possible which is good because she would have been as bad as me. I would not recommend this because it didn&#x27;t protect us</li>
            <li> Went to the Dry Tortugas for an entire day.  In the early morning I put on a coat and re-applied at lunch time.  I never burned!  I have olive skin, and the only sun I get is walking my dog.  When I took a shower at night, the zinc was a little hard to get off, but since it is not bad for your skin, I didn&#x27;t worry about it and the next day it came off.  I just felt like I had a little more protection.  Not sure if I really needed the second application but I am glad I did since I didn&#x27;t want to burn.</li>
            <li> I have used this Sunscreen since the day my daughter was born.  I am afraid to say it ..... (without knocking on some wood)  but she has never ever, not 1 time had a sunburn.  She will be 5 soon and we have used this at endless soccer games, water activities, we have traveled from Georgia, to Florida, to California and it has been great!!!  Our entire family uses this ..... while I am olive complexion and tan easily, my husband and daughter are both fair skin and blue eyes.  I will say, a friend used it on her daughter and she broke out with small bumps .... so, I would recommend, as with any new product, test it on a small area first.  It does leave a white residue until you figure out to put it on your fingertips first or the center of your palm, lightly rub together, and then rub on your face or body quickly!  It dries really fast!  If you apply a glob directly to skin, you are prone to look ghostly!  I didn&#x27;t mind that when my little one was an infant, at least I knew I didn&#x27;t miss any spots!  I usually reapply every couple of hours if she is in the water a lot.  We love the Mercola Lip protection too! OH .... remember to shake the bottle really well before applying the sunscreen!  If you are trying this for the first time .... test it first for allergic reaction, then test it by applying the sunblock, put a bracelet on your/their wrist or a fun sticker on an area of the body that will be exposed to the sun and check periodically for sun exposure on the skin .... I was a nervous wreck as a new mom exposing my fair haired sweetie to the sun with a &amp;#34;non mainstream&amp;#34; product.  I now know it was one of the best things I could do for my little love bug!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a safe sunscreen lotion that goes on easily and is not greasy like so many of the zinc oxide based sunscreens. This one does leave my skin looking a little whitish, but I use it for when I&#x27;m playing golf, yard work or cycling, so I don&#x27;t really care. I like that better than having harmful ingredients absorbed into my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face because I use a 60, but I may try this. Also hoping it doesn&#x27;t end up staining my clothes, if that is the case I will update to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The product does work but I would not use it anywhere but at home.  It stays on the surface of my skin &amp; makes it look blue.  I am not a fashion plate but I hate looking dead.</li>
            <li> I got this sunscreen at the Mercola website, as I trust his products and was looking for a sunscreen without toxic ingredients. There are no reviews on the website, which can be very helpful, and I didn&#x27;t like it at all the first time I used it. It gave me great protection, but I looked white as a ghost, and I already have very fair skin. I looked like I had a coat of white paint on my body, and my boyfriend said I was going to scare the children at the swimming pool. Then I decided to see if Amazon carried this sunscreen, and some reviewers gave great tips on how to apply it: Shake the bottle first, put some on your hand, and apply very fast on your body. You don&#x27;t need a lot. It still leaves a white film, but it&#x27;s not embarrassing to go out in public, and the protection is great. I burn very easily, and this sunscreen does the job. It doesn&#x27;t come out easily when I take a shower, but it&#x27;s a great choice if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t have toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I had good luck with this product by using the following methods (just sort of fell into doing this and it worked):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I shake up the bottle vigorously for about 5 seconds. (this seems to help re-mix the titantium oxide which is what blocks the bad rays of the sun)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Then I squeeze a big glob onto my hand and smear it on my face and neck. Once it&#x27;s pretty evently smeared around I wait a minute or two, then apply my make-up. The stuff naturally soaks into your skin without any smearing or rubbing. The other reviewers are right--trying to rub it into your skin won&#x27;t work. It has to soak in, which it will do quite quickly if you have not smeared some sort of moisturizer on beforehand which would block anything else from soaking in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  There will be two or three white bits (I assume it&#x27;s the titanitum) remaining on your skin which you just wipe off with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at that age where I&#x27;m getting those brown spots from the sun. Ugh! This stuff sure is helping to prevent getting more and the original ones are fading. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside to this wonderful and apparently pretty safe stuff is that it turns your skin a pasty white/grey. Not charming! Looks like a dead person&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution is that I apply foundation powder (I like L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s powder...I know, it&#x27;s got chemicals in it...the purists might want Jane Iredale&#x27;s powder). Voila! I look like a real live human being again(giggle). This solution, obviously, won&#x27;t work too well for the men though (sigh).</li>
            <li> This is the first time we have tried this type of sunscreen and so far so good. Two days in the sun at the beach and no burning. You have to reapply about every 2 hrs but we are pleased with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Also, my face seems better looking, I know that sounds funny, but maybe it is the green tea in it?  You do have to shake it up good first, not use too much and it&#x27;s fine.  I feel better using this that the others with chemicals.  I have skin cancer and the very dangerous kind so I have to use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My wife loved it, in fact, she wanted to TASTE it (not a joke) b/c it smelled so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen protected my 2 yo daughter in Hawaii in July. It don&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> OK, this stuff is natural, that is awesome.  I mean really, some of the things we put on ourselves is really full of chemicals.  The sun protection provided by Dr. Mercola Natural Sunscreen with Green Tea is great. The problem with this stuff is that it makes the skin look like you are dead.  Really, after it turned my skin a white or grey color, I thought OK it will soak in in a few minutes.  Hours later, I still looked like a ghost.  Seriously, I had several people ask me if I was OK because I was so pale.  I have not yet decided if I think it is worth it, but I have not yet worn it again.</li>
