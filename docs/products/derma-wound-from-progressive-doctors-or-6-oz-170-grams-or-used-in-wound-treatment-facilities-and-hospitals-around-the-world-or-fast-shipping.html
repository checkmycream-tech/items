    <ol>
            <li>but this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li>So my review here is to praise the excellent customer service I received when I started the process for a return.</li>
            <li>We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>Good Luck and happy healing!</li>
            <li>He commented on how great this cream worked compared to another brand I had shipped him.</li>
            <li>It works, though, and I know if I ever need it again, I will have a great way to start the healing process.</li>
            <li>product may work great for you.  </li>
            <li>A very effective product</li>
            <li>The Dr said to use this product after seeing the remarkable inprovment in just 10 days.</li>
            <li>but I am very happy to say it does look like his leg will be ok.</li>
            <li>I can say it is the most wonderful product I have used on his wound.  </li>
            <li>If you or a loved one is going through chemo and rashes or ulcers are a problem</li>
            <li>Remember all good things take time</li>
            <li>so I have passed along the good news to her.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Best of all, there is no bad reaction.[[ASIN</li>
            <li>So, I am very glad I found this product on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it.</li>
            <li>Nice and works well has worked well to close up wounds and quicken healing.</li>
            <li>The hole in the wound began to fill in nicely.</li>
            <li>After contact with the seller I even commented on the nice earthy smell and teased \\&quot;what&#x27;s in that stuff ground up angel wings?\\</li>
            <li>I am so grateful for Derma Wound and happy I can send everyone right to amazon to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Mine all showed improvement within a week after many weeks or months of worsening.  </li>
            <li>I anticipate a couple more weeks and they will be gone.</li>
            <li>Most products help keep it in check but didn&#x27;t cure it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will not regret it.</li>
            <li>His foot gets better every day and its all because of Derma Wound.  </li>
            <li>so I started applying the ointment more diligently.  </li>
            <li>Im sure I didnt put tubes in my testimonial 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>yes, great, great product which lost a star due to wasteful packaging.</li>
            <li>first it seemed to work good but upon continued use the wound&lt;br /&gt;began</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and safe.</li>
            <li>It was amazing how quickly it started to debreed his wounds, he had 8 all together</li>
            <li>Best $40 bucks I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I know the original formula worked great, and Im supposing the new formula will to if you don&#x27;t develop the itching.  </li>
            <li>I read a review on this product and decided to try it because the reviewer had such great things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I conviced him to try Dermawound, and we filled the ulcers with the stuff,</li>
            <li>He is sending me, free of charge, another formula specifically designed for my type of wound.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed, as I have been in the customer service business for many years and can easily gauge the extra-mile service that I only occasionally receive as a customer.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original formula.</li>
            <li>If the results are like the original, I will reorder.</li>
            <li>It caused severe pain just like the original formula that could not be conquered with 4 Advils.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product works very well on deep wounds and bed sores, a bit pricy for just 6oz</li>
            <li>It can make life so much easier for you, and maybe even safe your life.</li>
            <li>problem with the packaging of the item is that the tube form results in incredible waste of product .</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the product and the instructions, I quickly realized that since this product involved taping a piece of gauze over the wound and product, that it just would not work on my cat unless I had a head cone which I did not have.</li>
            <li>&quot; I really meant that, it was  a miracle from heaven!!</li>
            <li>This morning I had a very informative and pleasant phone conversation with the owner of the company lasting 41 minutes.  </li>
            <li>You really have to know what you are doing with this ointment, you have to be very cautious when using this treatment so you dont damage the healthy skin surrounding it.</li>
            <li>I did email and ask if the original formula was available but again no reply,  Order only one tube till you try it.  </li>
            <li>The second is getting better</li>
            <li>We have tried many different things to heal it.  </li>
            <li>My husband found Derma Wound on the computer after 5 years of doctors and many  different antibiotics and that was 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>and I had to get off the Toe as much as possible but in time I feel it made the most difference of anything I had put on it up until then.</li>
            <li>The pain from this formula equaled the pain from the first formula.  </li>
            <li>My best friend was bedridden for over 7 months due to an auto accident, and despite the  best efforts of all involved, he developed some very deep and ugly pressure and bed sores.</li>
            <li>I did have major burning with the first application, longer than 45 minutes, but with peripheral neuropathy and other problems, can&#x27;t always be sure if this would be true for others.</li>
            <li>- I was ready to quit before I saw any improvement.</li>
            <li>Your results will be faster if you put this much on.  </li>
            <li>I had cellulitus about three years ago, went into septic shock before I could get to a hospital, and came very close to checking out of my life.</li>
            <li>You have to use it as directed, which is to say you have to really put a lot of it on your wound.</li>
            <li>end and ready to try anything the pain in my toe</li>
            <li>To me it smells like a combination of cookie dough and clean fresh garden dirt with the heavy rain ozone smell right before a springtime shower.</li>
            <li>I ordered in total 8 jars of the original derma wound VS.  </li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t go on evenly like most other wound gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This latest version is causing the severe pain just like the other two formulas.  </li>
            <li>Two years ago I developed a HUGE stasis ulcer on my left leg.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks and me purchasing a second tube they had to stop using it because it works too well and was starting to damage the healthy skin surrounding the wounds.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>what to the new formula and whether to try and use it again.  </li>
            <li>Both of these new formulas were sent at the company&#x27;s expense.  </li>
            <li>I got smart and ordered extra, so I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I had gotten of all things an infected Callus from a wet environment, Niagara Falls which had resulted in a huge deep hole forming.</li>
            <li>Early in March I bought \\&quot;Dermawound\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for anything that could help with the diabetic sores I developed on my foot.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 6 weeks and one of two sores on my foot has completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I suggest buying several tubes, it goes fast.  </li>
            <li>Since then I can control and completely close up my wound with Derma Wound and a support sock.  </li>
            <li>By the time I got to my wound care appt., they checked my leg and said it had completely healed.  </li>
            <li>I didnt use the ointment all that time because it developed a crust the meds couldnt get through.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly about my problem.  </li>
            <li>I had a pressure sore on my right ankle which was roughly the size of a dime</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got serious health problems it might take more than one tube, but I suspect that when something STARTS if you hit it with Dermawound immediately you&#x27;ll stop the nightmare that was beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on this action I raised my evaluation from one star to three stars and I will further update this when I see the reaction to the new products he is sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and the purple infected area cleared to a healthy pink in less than three days.  </li>
            <li>I had tried Polysporin, and New Skin, neither did anything with the ongoing infection which was causing the sore to get even larger.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a artificial toe and much nicer than crying over losing a very important part of my foot!</li>
            <li>Now, I have developed the another ulcer in the same spot.  </li>
            <li>I cut my leg on an old peice of wood when cleaning my back yard, and like a dummy I was wearing shorts.</li>
            <li>I immediatly started using the dermawound, and my deep cut is almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After another phone conversation with the doctor that developed this product, he sent me a fourth formula.  </li>
            <li>It did get a little bigger at first as DermaWound debreaded the wound.  </li>
            <li>Within a month I found the wound closing and new pink skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 78 yr old Dad who was about to lose his right leg due to multiple diabetic wounds, due to his severe cardiac condition they were not able to amputate his right leg and put him on hospice.</li>

            <li> I purchased this for my 78 yr old Dad who was about to lose his right leg due to multiple diabetic wounds, due to his severe cardiac condition they were not able to amputate his right leg and put him on hospice.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new improved dermawound that is now in tubes, a different color, and not so messy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Addendum No.2 4-29-12&lt;br /&gt;I received the Venous Stasis formula after a long discussion with the owner of the company as mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me since I could not use it long enough because of the pain.</li>
            <li> It took some time, but he is now way passed the half way part of complete healing.</li>
            <li> Apparently not an allergic reaction by taking so long to start.  </li>
            <li> But, after trying various other so called healing ointments and gels, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> Only a few minutes after I had entered my request on amazon.com, Joe at Markit called me and told me that a refund had already been processed on my credit card and I hadn&#x27;t even yet mailed back the product!</li>
            <li> With the next visit in less than 2 weeks, I think they&#x27;ll be healed--and up until the Dermawound</li>
            <li> The leg had been badly infected and I did get a strong antibiotic from a clinic who warned me of losing a leg without proper care.  </li>
            <li> The lesion closed to the size of a pencil eraser before the end of three weeks.  </li>
            <li> and you have to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> and was not nearly as intense.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going to a wound care center after all the aggravation</li>

            <li> This has worked for me several times on persistent infected wounds that did not respond to anything else including internal antibiotics and a $75 tube of prescription topical antibiotic.  You do need to be diligent with application and dressings and expect it to take time.  Mine all showed improvement within a week after many weeks or months of worsening.  I don&#x27;t think doctors know about this stuff or consider it \\&quot;medical\\&quot; enough but this is a shame.</li>
            <li> I had a pressure sore on my right ankle which was roughly the size of a dime and the bone was visible.  I had tried Polysporin, and New Skin, neither did anything with the ongoing infection which was causing the sore to get even larger.  Early in March I bought \\&quot;Dermawound\\&quot;.  It arrived promptly and the purple infected area cleared to a healthy pink in less than three days.  The lesion closed to the size of a pencil eraser before the end of three weeks.  Its closure rate has slowed but it continues to heal uninfected at this writing. (I am being given steroids which is slowing the closure rate.)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother, a diabetic, after he discovered ulcers on his legs. He commented on how great this cream worked compared to another brand I had shipped him. I would definitely order this for him again if needed.</li>
            <li> If you or a loved one is going through chemo and rashes or ulcers are a problem then THIS WILL HEAL THOSE WOUNDS. I was flat-out amazed after just 3 days how well- healed my honey&#x27;s joints on his fingers were. Folks, you need not look any further for relief from pain from wounds that won&#x27;t heal. This product will do it and I thank God that this vendor is with Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product works but must be patient - I was ready to quit before I saw any improvement.</li>
            <li> Due to severe allergies I lost the skin on my leg from the foot to the knee. This is the only product that has helped it to heal. It is easy to use and safe. Best of all, there is no bad reaction.[[ASIN:B001R1H1MQ DermaWound® from Progressive Doctors Used in Wound Care Clinics Around the World]]</li>
            <li> This procuct is for human use but I have used it twice on my dogs with prior experience when I worked in a nursing home. One dog had a bite wound and the other a difficult area to heal resulting from a broken bone. I had guidance from my veterinarian.</li>
            <li> I was looking for anything that could help with the diabetic sores I developed on my foot.  I read a review on this product and decided to try it because the reviewer had such great things to say about it. They posted that you have to be patient with Dermawound - it will work.  I have been using it for 6 weeks and one of two sores on my foot has completely healed.  The second is getting better and I hope another 2-3 weeks will heal it. I apply it twice a day when I wash and change the wrappings on my foot.  You need to put a lot on - the producer of Dermawound says it should be 1/4 an inch deep. Your results will be faster if you put this much on.  I have had no side effects or problems with Dermawound.  I suggest buying several tubes, it goes fast.  So, I am very glad I found this product on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m handicapped and sit almost all the time - as a result-pressure sores that two years of very expensive woundcare doctors could only maintain. After three weeks of this product the sores are about 75% gone! I anticipate a couple more weeks and they will be gone. I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but this stuff is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product works very well on deep wounds and bed sores, a bit pricy for just 6oz</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 78 yr old Dad who was about to lose his right leg due to multiple diabetic wounds, due to his severe cardiac condition they were not able to amputate his right leg and put him on hospice. I did tons of research and found Dermawound on Amazon and read all the reviews, especially the one from the gentleman whos wife was in the same situation as my Dad. I purchased the original formula. It was amazing how quickly it started to debreed his wounds, he had 8 all together and it was tried on 2 of them to start. Within two days the two wounds showed remarkable improvment so my sister who is an LPN and my other sister who is a CNA started using it on all of the worst ones. He had two dressing changes a day 12 hrs apart. After a couple of weeks and me purchasing a second tube they had to stop using it because it works too well and was starting to damage the healthy skin surrounding the wounds. The Dr said to use this product after seeing the remarkable inprovment in just 10 days. after approximately 3 1/2 weeks he said to stop using it and switched the twice daily dressing changes to denkins and after another 3 weeks wet to dry dressings. You really have to know what you are doing with this ointment, you have to be very cautious when using this treatment so you dont damage the healthy skin surrounding it. I think using this ointment was the turning point to healing his terrible wounds, but it was not the cure all and you have to be careful with it. He also has had an IV pic line with twice daily antiobiotic treatment. We will never know if the antibiotics or the dermawound by itself created the healing but I am very happy to say it does look like his leg will be ok.</li>
            <li> An online vet recommended this product for a bite wound on the topside of my cat&#x27;s ear. Upon receiving the product and the instructions, I quickly realized that since this product involved taping a piece of gauze over the wound and product, that it just would not work on my cat unless I had a head cone which I did not have. So my review here is to praise the excellent customer service I received when I started the process for a return. Only a few minutes after I had entered my request on amazon.com, Joe at Markit called me and told me that a refund had already been processed on my credit card and I hadn&#x27;t even yet mailed back the product! I was very impressed, as I have been in the customer service business for many years and can easily gauge the extra-mile service that I only occasionally receive as a customer.</li>
            <li> My diabetic husband had an abcess on the back of his knee for over two years.  We have tried many different things to heal it.  Most products help keep it in check but didn&#x27;t cure it.  After reading what other people said about this product we gave it a try.  I can say it is the most wonderful product I have used on his wound.  It did get a little bigger at first as DermaWound debreaded the wound.  It has gotten smaller every day and has no more drainage.  We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Nice and works well has worked well to close up wounds and quicken healing.I really hate having to add extra works&lt;br /&gt;to meet some quota of words.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with a leg ulcer for years. My husband found Derma Wound on the computer after 5 years of doctors and many  different antibiotics and that was 5 years ago. Since then I can control and completely close up my wound with Derma Wound and a support sock.  I am so grateful for Derma Wound and happy I can send everyone right to amazon to purchase it. Ulcers are scary stuff but give Derma Wound a try and I&#x27;m sure you will not regret it. If you do have a problem contact Derma Wound they have a formula for everyone. I did change once in the beginning. Good Luck and happy healing! I remember being at wits end and now it&#x27;s just bothersome. Remember all good things take time but you should see results in less then a week.</li>
            <li> My husband had a blister on his foot.  Then he popped the blister and peeled the dead skin.  Since he is diabetic the wound wouldn&#x27;t heal.  Since he is stubborn he continued to trim the dead skin and refused to go to the doctor.  After 6 months he went to the doctor and was immediately referred to a Wound Care Specialist to attend to the gaping hole in the bottom of his foot.  He conveniently missed the appointment with the Wound Care Specialist.  I purchased Derma Wound which he agreed to apply to his foot.  After 1 week the wound began to heal and after a month of use he no longer needs to see the Wound Care Specialist.  His foot gets better every day and its all because of Derma Wound.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for a wound from poor circulation in a leg.&lt;br /&gt;At first it seemed to work good but upon continued use the wound&lt;br /&gt;began to regress so had to stop using it.  Haven&#x27;t tried it since&lt;br /&gt;but since it said guaranteed it was disappointing.  Gave it&lt;br /&gt;the middle star since that is where the progress stopped at.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I developed a HUGE stasis ulcer on my left leg.  With no insurance, I couldn&#x27;t afford a wound clinic.  Doing online research I found the progressivedoctors.com site.  I ordered in total 8 jars of the original derma wound VS.  My wound drained heavily for 3 mos.  Using the medicine before the draining quits is a waste, imo.  Around Thanksgiving the wound seemed to be drier so I started applying the ointment more diligently.  Within a month I found the wound closing and new pink skin.  The wound heals from the inside so it shrinks in size instead of growing over.  I finally got medicare in May and got an appt. at a wound clinic.  The leg had been badly infected and I did get a strong antibiotic from a clinic who warned me of losing a leg without proper care.  By the time I got to my wound care appt., they checked my leg and said it had completely healed.  That was a total 10 mos.  I didnt use the ointment all that time because it developed a crust the meds couldnt get through.  That allowed me to finally sleep in a bed again.  Now, I have developed the another ulcer in the same spot.  I ordered the new improved dermawound that is now in tubes, a different color, and not so messy.  Using it 2 brought on intense itching so bad I had to remove the product.  I called Progressive Doctors and left a message but no one called back.  I don&#x27;t know if I have an allergy or what to the new formula and whether to try and use it again.  I reread some of the testimonials and mine was there, only jars had been replaced with tubes.  Im sure I didnt put tubes in my testimonial 2 yrs. ago because the product came in jars.  Makes me go hmmmm.  I did email and ask if the original formula was available but again no reply,  Order only one tube till you try it.  There are nonallergic formulas.  I know the original formula worked great, and Im supposing the new formula will to if you don&#x27;t develop the itching.  Editing to say that the third time I used the product the itching didnt start for 7 hrs. and was not nearly as intense.  Apparently not an allergic reaction by taking so long to start.  If the results are like the original, I will reorder.</li>
            <li> After trying several creams on our mom to heal the bed sores caused by the nursing home staff, we found this.  This cream started showing improvement in 3 days!  A miracle!</li>
            <li> I chose 1 star because it does not work....I ended up going to a wound care center after all the aggravation&lt;br /&gt;With this product.  Just save your money folks and go see a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;I was put on an antibiotics and Santyl for debriding..and wraps..my wound was infected..&lt;br /&gt;Derma wound did not help!!</li>
            <li> I had cellulitus about three years ago, went into septic shock before I could get to a hospital, and came very close to checking out of my life. Since that time, and due to poor circulation in my lower left leg, I have to be very careful about getting cuts or scrapes. When that does happen, I use dermawound. My Dr. recommended it to me, and it has been a virtual life saver. As some have mentioned, it works slowly. But, after trying various other so called healing ointments and gels, I decided to try this. I cut my leg on an old peice of wood when cleaning my back yard, and like a dummy I was wearing shorts. I immediatly started using the dermawound, and my deep cut is almost completely healed. My best friend was bedridden for over 7 months due to an auto accident, and despite the  best efforts of all involved, he developed some very deep and ugly pressure and bed sores. I conviced him to try Dermawound, and we filled the ulcers with the stuff, I mean we slathered in, on and around the wounds. It took some time, but he is now way passed the half way part of complete healing. I got smart and ordered extra, so I always have it on hand. You have to use it as directed, which is to say you have to really put a lot of it on your wound. It works, though, and I know if I ever need it again, I will have a great way to start the healing process. If you are diabetic or bedridden, do yourself a favor and order a few tubes of this stuff. It can make life so much easier for you, and maybe even safe your life.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff as a Podiatrist was threatening to lop off my big Toe. I had gotten of all things an infected Callus from a wet environment, Niagara Falls which had resulted in a huge deep hole forming. I nursed it along with all manner of other things but it only got worse. I was at my wits end and ready to try anything the pain in my toe was just terrible. This stuff began the healing in earnest, yes it took some time and I had to get off the Toe as much as possible but in time I feel it made the most difference of anything I had put on it up until then. The hole in the wound began to fill in nicely. After contact with the seller I even commented on the nice earthy smell and teased \\&quot;what&#x27;s in that stuff ground up angel wings?\\&quot; I really meant that, it was  a miracle from heaven!! To me it smells like a combination of cookie dough and clean fresh garden dirt with the heavy rain ozone smell right before a springtime shower. I have a dear friend battling pressure sores too so I have passed along the good news to her. I have every idea that this stuff will save her hiney. Literally. Thank you Derma Wound folks! Best $40 bucks I ever spent. Much cheaper than a artificial toe and much nicer than crying over losing a very important part of my foot!</li>
            <li> Updated 5-19-12.  See Three Addendums and Conclusion below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 75 years I have never experienced that much pain.  It started as soon as this product was applied and continued while it also increased until I washed the wound and applied some Biolex after about a day.  Pain stopped immediately when the Biolex was applied and re-bandaged.  I don&#x27;t know what this product is made of or made for but it definitely was not made for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product made it extremely difficult to apply.  I can&#x27;t describe it verbally.  It just won&#x27;t go on evenly like most other wound gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum No.1 4-17-12&lt;br /&gt;After receiving some helpful advice from a commenter (see below) I contacted the company directly about my problem.  This morning I had a very informative and pleasant phone conversation with the owner of the company lasting 41 minutes.  We discussed the entire history of my problems with the leg involved.  He is sending me, free of charge, another formula specifically designed for my type of wound. He is also sending some pain spray to assist with another problem on the leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this action I raised my evaluation from one star to three stars and I will further update this when I see the reaction to the new products he is sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum No.2 4-29-12&lt;br /&gt;I received the Venous Stasis formula after a long discussion with the owner of the company as mentioned above. It caused severe pain just like the original formula that could not be conquered with 4 Advils.  I had another discussion with the owner and he sent me the Venus Stasis Hypo Allergenic formula with benzocaine.  Both of these new formulas were sent at the company&#x27;s expense.  This latest version is causing the severe pain just like the other two formulas.  It is now going on 3 a.m. and I cannot sleep because of the pain even after 3 Advils. Perhaps I am the only one in the entire world that has such a reaction to their products. If you want totry it, you will need to take the chance.  Good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am reducing the rating to one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum No.3 5-19-12&lt;br /&gt;After another phone conversation with the doctor that developed this product, he sent me a fourth formula.  The pain from this formula equaled the pain from the first formula.  It pulsed in irregular pulses and I could only stand it for about 2 hours.  I called the doctor the next morning and he stated that I was in about less than 1% of the patients that have an allergy to the ingredients.  He said he would call me back with a solution.  I never heard from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion 5-19-12:&lt;br /&gt;This product may work great for you.  It did not work for me since I could not use it long enough because of the pain. If my problem is because of an allergy as the doctor stated then the product should not be faulted.</li>
            <li> A very effective product and I&#x27;d buy it again if we had a need for wound or bedsore dressing.&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the packaging of the item is that the tube form results in incredible waste of product . Once 3/4 of the way through the tube, it just doesn&#x27;t want to come out without brute force. And this is a problem if you are dressing the wound when this happens.&lt;br /&gt;So yes, great, great product which lost a star due to wasteful packaging.</li>
            <li> Ordered after months of suffering with diabetic feet that would not heal though I did what the MD prescribed (literally). These were really bad, infected wounds. After using Dermawound, the healing started--something I&#x27;d not seen with the prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;I told my MD about it and he&#x27;s monitoring the results. With the next visit in less than 2 weeks, I think they&#x27;ll be healed--and up until the Dermawound it was MONTHS where they just got worse.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got serious health problems it might take more than one tube, but I suspect that when something STARTS if you hit it with Dermawound immediately you&#x27;ll stop the nightmare that was beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical from the ingredients that it would do what it said it would, but when you&#x27;re desperate, you will try things. This time instead of being irritated that I&#x27;d been taken by another product that didn&#x27;t deliver, I found something that actually WORKS. It&#x27;s also not loaded with things that will have bad side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Especially if you&#x27;re diabetic, because we go infected and take longer to heal, take the leap of faith and try it. I did have major burning with the first application, longer than 45 minutes, but with peripheral neuropathy and other problems, can&#x27;t always be sure if this would be true for others. Left it on from that afternoon application and when I got up in the morning, it was not burning and there was visible improvement.</li>
