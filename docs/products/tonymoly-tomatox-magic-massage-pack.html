            <li>I thought for sure it would start bleeding or have a scab.</li>

            <li>I would love to buy this again.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better if you use it at night (</li>
            <li>as most masks are supposed to be used)</li>
            <li>I love tony moly tomatox...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I received a sample with my Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder order.  </li>
            <li>The container is really cute as well.</li>
            <li>I wish it has a more &#x27;drying&#x27; effect and not creamy-like.</li>
            <li>absolutely love the packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the container.</li>
            <li>, this product is SO CUTE, and you get A LOT of product.  </li>
            <li>I love having it in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I also love the application spoon.  </li>
            <li>I imagine this won&#x27;t be an issue once I use more of the product.</li>
            <li>and the results have not disappointed me!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was packaged in a nice translucent plastic box.</li>
            <li>i feel that it helps a lot with making my tone more even and smooth making it seem like i had already applied makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, it came super fast, so I was really happy when I received it. ^^</li>
            <li>actual product smells really nice (in my opinion), and is a good texture for a mask.</li>
            <li>This is a very useful mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My computer was originally turned off but I decided that this review could not wait until tomorrow.</li>
            <li>It is so useful for a lighter exfoliant that delivers!</li>
            <li>The shipping, first of all, was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I really like this product and plan to buy more again.</li>
            <li>Love this mask, it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Masks are a quick shot of hydration to your skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see any results that do not go away quickly ...</li>
            <li>I  love this product can&#x27;t get enough of using the tomatox Magic.</li>
            <li>After its rinsed skin is super supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Baby smooth skin and followed by an ampoule really made my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that although this was a popular item, there was only 5 reviews on the 80g and 45 reviews on the 70g.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You are not supposed to wash it off with soap, so it leaves a kind of white layer on your skin.</li>
            <li>I have some powerful ones, (not that this isn&#x27;t), but I can&#x27;t apply them as often.</li>
            <li>I like to have something I can use a couple times a week to feel fresh.</li>
            <li>and i was able to scratch the dry skin off leaving smooth skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first use, my face was noticeably brighter and seemed fresh.</li>
            <li>feels great, skin is lighter after application, but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s gon</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have long term experience with it, but I had a couple of samples of the Tomatox massage pack and the results were astounding.</li>
            <li>and the packaging is cute, it&#x27;s definitely evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>but my entire complexion is more even</li>
            <li>At first I got this as samples from another Korean product I bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to use once a week and a little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase and will certainly buy again in the future!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it was, and I really do feel like I got a lot more for my money.</li>
            <li>really fast shipping .thanks</li>
            <li>once I sat around too much and sweat around that area.</li>
            <li>The next morning my face was so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t want you to rub your face to much when you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>it really fits my skin and</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Green Appletox way before it got popular.</li>
            <li>I use it aling with my other weekly skin treatments and my skin havs never looked better.</li>
            <li>but seriously I don&#x27;t think the residue is good for your skin</li>
            <li>I wiped my face clean with the washcloth and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>After i use it i can really tell the difference, it has some sort of brightening effect and also it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>and I really like how completely nonirritating it is.</li>
            <li>Wash fash as you normally would with</li>
            <li>Carry on with normal skin routine afterwards</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin dewy and very soft.</li>
            <li>The first day I noticed the bites I had only used tea tree oil cream</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes my skin feel so amazingly soft and brightens mr skin tone!</li>
            <li>I love the cream, it leaves my face soft and less red.</li>
            <li>When removed my skin was indeed soft, though, it felt as though there was a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li>I probably use it too often, but it just makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>My skin feels soooooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this 3 times so far</li>
            <li>I was so shocked to see my all of a sudden super lighten complexion, indeed magic!  </li>
            <li>Turns out the 70g has red specks and is the older formula and the 80g, which is the one I received was the upgraded version with white beads.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face in the evening and after 10-15 minutes I put a hot wet washcloth on my face for several seconds.</li>
            <li>it lighten the skin and never dry&#x27;s your skin.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little lid and spatula inside, which was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My other old scars are still there, but no redness at all remained on my face and the bumps are smoother.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, but unfortunately after the first use it&#x27;s a definitely a return.  </li>
            <li> one of the other orders of the stuff I got didn&#x27;t even have the spoon), there were no black specks.  </li>
            <li> na last long term</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a creamy white mask that has tiny black pearl beads</li>
            <li> I currently use Black Pearl facial masks twice a week</li>
            <li> All that was left was one little white dot to prove that it even existed.</li>
            <li> Dry your face</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry, but it does become tacky.  </li>
            <li> I have dark scars from recent basil cell removal</li>
            <li> On the third day, none of the bites are swollen anymore and a few have disappeared.</li>
            <li> the item also arrived just in time as i expected it.</li>
            <li> The product was as described and as i have seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was a little disappointed when i found out otherwise, but it&#x27;s better than I expected</li>
            <li> However, I have been suffering from dark scars from acne for years</li>
            <li> I just started using this, so i&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s whitening effects but it has helped me with the minor break outs I have.  </li>
            <li> The amount  of mask are in half less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask just once less than half an hour ago.</li>
            <li> (black pearl helps whiten skin).</li>
            <li> and I use a lot less foundation.</li>
            <li> After doing research, I found that this product should have little black specks in it.  </li>
            <li> for the green tea essence mask.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t use my green concealer</li>
            <li> A few acne spots on my face had dried up</li>
            <li> (over 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this just after toner, massage it into the skin for a few minutes, then wait about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> then usually I used to receive .  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product because there were mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this for a few days and the scars are fading away!</li>
            <li> your usual cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

            <li> The amount  of mask are in half less then usually I used to receive .  I&#x27;m very disappointed. It looks like somebody have  already  tried it.</li>
            <li> It is very nice. It was well delivered. The product feels good on my skin and smells really good. I would buy more from tony moly.</li>
            <li> really fast shipping .thanks for the green tea essence mask. I love it.will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so Great and the packaging is cute, it&#x27;s definitely evened out my skin tone</li>
            <li> Two star. it was a bad packaging</li>
            <li> My computer was originally turned off but I decided that this review could not wait until tomorrow. I&#x27;ve used this mask just once less than half an hour ago. I was so skeptical about this product because there were mixed reviews. I also noticed that although this was a popular item, there was only 5 reviews on the 80g and 45 reviews on the 70g. Turns out the 70g has red specks and is the older formula and the 80g, which is the one I received was the upgraded version with white beads. This product looked authentic, came in a box, had a lid and spoon so I decided to test it on areas that I would have to cover up and use concealer on during my morning makeup routine. I followed the instructions, massaging the cream on my face for a minute only on my problem areas with pimples or redness: my chin, nose, and forehead - in which one pimple was beginning to form (not fully emerged yet) and was extremely red from scratching. I thought for sure it would start bleeding or have a scab. Anyway, I rinsed my face before the 10 minutes was up. Then when I looked in the mirror, 90% of that pimple was gone. All that was left was one little white dot to prove that it even existed. My other old scars are still there, but no redness at all remained on my face and the bumps are smoother. I guess I can&#x27;t use my green concealer tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I had gotten multiple bites around my knee area. These bites were bumpy and itchy. I was miserable. The first day I noticed the bites I had only used tea tree oil cream and I would still itch at night. Then I used tea tree oil cream during the day and this Tomatox mask at night for two days. Each night, after the Tomatox mask, the itching would go away. Of course I would itch again at work once I sat around too much and sweat around that area. On the third day, none of the bites are swollen anymore and a few have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Excelent product... i´ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I love the cream, it leaves my face soft and less red. Also, it came super fast, so I was really happy when I received it. ^^</li>
            <li> As always is a pleasure to do bussiness with you, the shipping was super fast, excellent item and seller, great price! Definetly i will buy again in your store! 100% guaranteed, Thanks for all, have an excellent week, regards.</li>
            <li> I love this product! One of my favorite youtubers recommended it and I&#x27;m really glad I was able to purchase this. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes my skin feel so amazingly soft and brightens mr skin tone!</li>
            <li> It really whitens your face but it fades away after a few hours. However, I have been suffering from dark scars from acne for years and I have been using this for a few days and the scars are fading away! I love this product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> THIS MASK IS AMAZING it smells so good and leaves your skin amazingly bright and soft! Buy it it will be the best purchase you make on this site I guarantee ❤️</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long term experience with it, but I had a couple of samples of the Tomatox massage pack and the results were astounding. I put it on my face in the evening and after 10-15 minutes I put a hot wet washcloth on my face for several seconds. I wiped my face clean with the washcloth and let it air dry.  The next morning my face was so smooth and moisturized. A few acne spots on my face had dried up and i was able to scratch the dry skin off leaving smooth skin underneath.  My painful acne spots no longet hurt.  Of course there are still red spots, but I believe it has sped up the healing process of my breakouts dramatically. I&#x27;m definitely getting the 80g pack with my next Amazon order.</li>
            <li> does nothing to my face!! No effect whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this makes my skin feel. After i use it i can really tell the difference, it has some sort of brightening effect and also it makes your skin so soft.I would love to buy this again.</li>
            <li> It works very well! The product was as described and as i have seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are not supposed to wash it off with soap, so it leaves a kind of white layer on your skin. I think it&#x27;s better if you use it at night (as most masks are supposed to be used) so the product can work during the night, wash it off with soap in the morning, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with the white layer in your make up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomended! It works!</li>
            <li> This review is for the Tomatox Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Green Appletox way before it got popular. Both my mom (45) and I (20) use it 1-2 time per week. I haven&#x27;t tried the Red Appletox yet because I already use Chia Seed brand moisturizers but I definitely want to give it a try when my current ones run out. I will gift it to my mom to try as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I used the Tomatox last night and for those of you who didn&#x27;t have directions on how to use or couldn&#x27;t read Korean or Japanese on the packaging box, these are the instructions for use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash fash as you normally would with your usual cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry your face&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply an ample amount of Tomatox on your face and spread out evenly&lt;br /&gt;4. Massage for 1 to 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;5. Wait 5 to 10 minutes with mask on&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash mask off with lukewarm water&lt;br /&gt;7. Use 1-2 times per week&lt;br /&gt;8. Carry on with normal skin routine afterwards (toner, emulsion/lotion, essence/serum, moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use, my face was noticeably brighter and seemed fresh. It doesn&#x27;t smell like tomatoes at all and it&#x27;s a creamy white mask that has tiny black pearl beads (black pearl helps whiten skin). This mask also helps with redness and skin irritation as well. I currently use Black Pearl facial masks twice a week but I&#x27;m thinking about adding in the Tomatox as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just an FYI these &amp;#34;masks&amp;#34; are NOT supposed to last forever. Masks are a quick shot of hydration to your skin. They are only supposed to last 1 to 2 days. Whereas moisturizers are 24/7 hydration to your skin. You should be using moisturizers DAILY and masks WEEKLY.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend as a gift. She said that she liked it.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results that do not go away quickly ...</li>
            <li> I bought this product as an add on to something else I bought. It came quickly and was packaged in a nice translucent plastic box. It had both Korean and English directions.  The directions are simple : wash face, apply and massage for 1-2 minutes leave on for up to 10 minutes and was off. They don&#x27;t want you to rub your face to much when you wash it off.  During the 10 minutes on my face I noticed what I could only describe as an acidic feel on my face. It didn&#x27;t sting/tingle/burn it merely felt like I had put an acidic material on my face.  When removed my skin was indeed soft, though, it felt as though there was a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; on it. I think I might try a different scent next time i order.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, but unfortunately after the first use it&#x27;s a definitely a return.  It leaves a white waxy residue after washing it off.  I was so shocked to see my all of a sudden super lighten complexion, indeed magic!  No but seriously I don&#x27;t think the residue is good for your skin, I basically washed my face again to get rid of the whiteness on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how brightening it is, but it is great and moisturizing! I probably use it too often, but it just makes my skin feel so soft and I really like how completely nonirritating it is.</li>
            <li> i like to keep my complextion very pale and this product definetly helps with it. i feel that it helps a lot with making my tone more even and smooth making it seem like i had already applied makeup.</li>
            <li> I love tony moly tomatox...it really fits my skin and no itchy feeling fo me..the item also arrived just in time as i expected it.</li>
            <li> I have dark scars from recent basil cell removal and I have noticed that not only are they lightening up but my entire complexion is more even and I use a lot less foundation. It&#x27;s smells very clean and fresh. It leaves my skin dewy and very soft. I&#x27;m so glad that I received a sample with my Skinfood Peach Sake Silky Finish Powder order.  The container is really cute as well. Excellent seller. I plan on reordering.</li>
            <li> nice mask. use it twice daily and within two weeks you would see the difference. just don&#x27;t take sun baths.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying..&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with the item.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the excellent product</li>
            <li> At first I got this as samples from another Korean product I bought. I loved it!! I had to buy a bigger container! I have very red skin and it basically takes it all away. Also, it erases all of my pores. My skin feels soooooo soft. Plus tonymoly has the cutiest packaging ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have been using this for about 2 days already and I really like it. It claims what it says. Made my face brighten a bit. And I&#x27;m starting to notice the acne on my face going away as well. I really like this product and plan to buy more again.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and clean. Arrived within four  days!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell if it works or not. I like how it feels on my skin. I wish it has a more &#x27;drying&#x27; effect and not creamy-like.</li>
            <li> It is so useful for a lighter exfoliant that delivers! I have some powerful ones, (not that this isn&#x27;t), but I can&#x27;t apply them as often. I like to have something I can use a couple times a week to feel fresh. I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice mask/exfoliator for the face. Put in on, wait 10-15 minutes and rinse off. Baby smooth skin and followed by an ampoule really made my skin glow. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The shipping, first of all, was fantastic! I received my product four days prior to when it was supposed to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the packaging of this product. It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it was, and I really do feel like I got a lot more for my money. It comes with a little lid and spatula inside, which was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product smells really nice (in my opinion), and is a good texture for a mask. After using it, my face is more moisturized, brighter, and I think over time this could lighten some acne scars I have! It&#x27;s wonderful to use once a week and a little really does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase and will certainly buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a very useful mask. I have used this 3 times so far and the results have not disappointed me! My face is very bright and soft too. I definitely recommended this~~</li>
            <li> Love this mask, it really does what it says. I use it aling with my other weekly skin treatments and my skin havs never looked better.</li>
            <li> CHECK THE EXP DATE! I read one of the reviews saying they got an expired one so i checked to see if mine was expired as well it expired a month before i even got it.</li>
            <li> This stuff brightened my skin after one application of it. I love it. Do it once a week or sometimes a month. Cause it can break u out if u use it like crazy</li>
            <li> This product left a white, drying film over my face.  I followed the instructions, and washed this off as instructed.  I woke up the next morning with a horrible white film over my face.  After doing research, I found that this product should have little black specks in it.  While it did come with a spoon (one of the other orders of the stuff I got didn&#x27;t even have the spoon), there were no black specks.  And if it helps, my jar smells like cold cream.  IDK.  I won&#x27;t buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Saw effects after one treatment of a ten minute mask. Love the container. Directions in multiple languages which is ver helpful but only on box</li>
            <li> I  love this product can&#x27;t get enough of using the tomatox Magic. it lighten the skin and never dry&#x27;s your skin. will buy again</li>
            <li> brightening mask works and gets job done&lt;br /&gt;clears skin and pores</li>
            <li> feels great, skin is lighter after application, but i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s gonna last long term</li>
            <li> I just started using this, so i&#x27;m not sure of it&#x27;s whitening effects but it has helped me with the minor break outs I have.  It immediately reduced the size and redness of a pimple I had on my cheek after just 2 applications (over 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You apply this just after toner, massage it into the skin for a few minutes, then wait about 10 minutes.  It doesn&#x27;t dry, but it does become tacky.  After its rinsed skin is super supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason i thought this would be an exfoliant.  So I was a little disappointed when i found out otherwise, but it&#x27;s better than I expected so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is SO CUTE, and you get A LOT of product.  I love having it in my bathroom, I want to use it all the time.  I also love the application spoon.  Though it does get....messy at times trying to keep everything separate and sanitary.  I imagine this won&#x27;t be an issue once I use more of the product.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I apply this to my face, rinse, then put toner, and use The Etude house Skin brightening sleeping pack with it THEN. The next morning you can already see that your scars (acne scars) lightened!!!</li>
