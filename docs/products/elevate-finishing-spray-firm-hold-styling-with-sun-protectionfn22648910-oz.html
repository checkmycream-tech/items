            <li>Nobody can believe that my hair product smells this amazing.  </li>
            <li>I used Sebastian Shaper Plus for many years and loved the hold and smell.</li>
            <li>bought it since I liked the scent when my hair stylist used it at salon.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It stays in my hair the whole day, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Never feels sticky &amp; combs out nicely.</li>
            <li>This one is quite pleasant and the smell dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the hold, you can build on it each day --I</li>
            <li>I have used this hair spray and love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but has an amazing hold.</li>
            <li>I love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>and you should for sure get it</li>
            <li>I have tried many sprays over the years, but none have worked as well as this.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>It holds but you can lightly brush through and it gives nice support and shine.</li>
            <li>Love the smell (pez candy?) and the hold.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the hold this finishing spray gives.  </li>
            <li>I love Eufora products.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.</li>
            <li>Love to order it on line as the price at my hairdresser is much more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great on days when the air is dry and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite hairspray for my fine hair</li>
            <li>Great hold and soft to to touch.</li>
            <li>It can comb out easily.</li>
            <li>I have curly, but fine hair and the spray holds my hair in place without looking or feeling like there is any on my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>So happy to finally find this product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>but it can also be light if you use a light touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The also purchase the smaller size which is great for travel and to keep in car or bag.</li>
            <li>This product is light, smells fresh and holds!  </li>
            <li>There is no other hair spray on this planet that smells as good as Eufora.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended it, and although it is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it!  </li>
            <li>BUT so worth it!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different hairsprays in my lifetime, but this product by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Does not weight down my baby fine hair and gives great hold</li>
            <li>no heavy smell, and it holds nicely.</li>
            <li>This product does not have a strong smell, I enjoy the hold it gives your hair, while it still is easy brushed.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains sunscreen, it&#x27;s alcohol free, and this is the only hairspray I will use.</li>
            <li>Fast!!</li>
            <li>Works great as both a styling and finishing spray.&lt;br /&gt;Holds without being stiff and leaves your hair shinny.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Great hairspray, scent is very subtle (and I, like many others, don&#x27;t like/use perfumes).  </li>
            <li>First time using this product and like it very much!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and gives it just the right amount of shine &amp; hold</li>
            <li>And this morning, I only had like bare bones tiny speck of it to spray out and did the best i could at 8:00 this morning, and my hair is still wavy and holding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Eufora Finishing Hairspray for several years, absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Would post 5, but it&#x27;s very costly!</li>
            <li>It looked shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and only spray I use.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and worth every penny as I don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.</li>
            <li>but it smells better and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair, and not a ton of it, and this is the only hairspray I have found that really adds volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>That said, I really like Eufora&#x27;s Finishing Spray.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of hair sprays, they compete with perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it says.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very fine hair, doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>It holds hair very well, but can be easily brushed out leaving hair feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li>Until recently I was only able to purchase it from a salon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few things I will indulge in buying, because it works so well:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but doesn&#x27;t give you &amp;#34;helmut head.&amp;#34; One can last for a long time if you don&#x27;t over spray too often.</li>
            <li>This is fun to use on long hair.</li>
            <li>This is light, I use less than from any pump spray.  </li>
            <li>It is not stiff and yet it keeps your style in your hair when you comb it.</li>
            <li>so I dont use everyday always use for special occasions or if I am curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Lets just say when I spray with anything else, my fine hair goes flat in less than five miutes.</li>
            <li>Get the big bottle, it&#x27;s twice the price of the little ones for five times as much.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The finishing spray works wonders and I have long layers that tend to frizz in humidity.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist at the Local Spa and Resort has been using this product on my hair for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all other hair spray brands, except Eufora.</li>
            <li> have very long hair and don&#x27;t wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it made my curles last all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or leave it feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like moroccan does, which is supposed to be the number one hair product out there.</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey</li>
            <li> Lasts all day with just a little spray in the AM.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty control if you spray a lot</li>
            <li> but is a little stiff and drying.</li>
            <li> It holds without being stiff and leaves your hair shiny as well.</li>
            <li> No more heavy spray for me to try and hold my curls together.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray ill use.</li>
            <li> I usually love Aveda products but that hairspray was awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 6 years &amp; would not use any other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for months for a new hair spray  and was very frustrated, and had spent tons of money on brands that didn&#x27;t pan out.</li>
            <li> started using this product at my stylist&#x27;s salon, but it is hard to get in there to purchase it when I am out.</li>
            <li> have used this hair spray for at least 5 years and I will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li> little expensive</li>
            <li> It turned out to be quite heavy and made my hair too dirty.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray is pricey, but it works well on my thin hair?</li>
            <li> Makes hair stiff :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Splurge on this hair care item -- you will not be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray.  </li>

            <li> I used Sebastian Shaper Plus for many years and loved the hold and smell. In the last year the formula was changed and it is a completely different product. I&#x27;ve searched for months for a new hair spray  and was very frustrated, and had spent tons of money on brands that didn&#x27;t pan out. So happy to finally find this product. My hair stylist recommended it, and although it is a bit pricey, it is definitely worth it!  I love the hold, you can build on it each day --I have very long hair and don&#x27;t wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair spray and love it. It is not stiff and yet it keeps your style in your hair when you comb it. It smells great. AND, this is the best price that I have ever found. I will order it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eufora Finishing Hairspray for several years, absolutely love it.  It has amazing hold but you can still get a brush or comb through your hair.  It smells wonderful and is just a super product. Until recently I was only able to purchase it from a salon.  Being able to purchase it through Amazon is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray, scent is very subtle (and I, like many others, don&#x27;t like/use perfumes).  This is the only hairspray I will use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It volumizes the hair, but doesn&#x27;t make it crunchy!! And it holds a curl well!!! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product.  I have used just this hair spray for years now and the only affordable place to buy it is on Amazon!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used. It holds without being stiff and leaves your hair shiny as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for years, and used to buy it at my salon.  They recently stopped stocking it, so I&#x27;ve turned to Amazon.  It&#x27;s light, but has an amazing hold.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray.I have thick hair and it made my curles last all day. The smell is amazing and if you like to go out side alot it is the only hair spray i have seen that has suncreen in it. This is one of the best hair sprays ever and you should for sure get it</li>
            <li> Works great as both a styling and finishing spray.&lt;br /&gt;Holds without being stiff and leaves your hair shinny.&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive BUT so worth it!</li>
            <li> It is one the best hair sprays I have ever use. I have been using this product for three years now in fact all of Eufora products.</li>
            <li> I hate hairspray.  That said, I really like Eufora&#x27;s Finishing Spray.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my very fine hair, doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  The best part is the fragrance.  I really don&#x27;t like the smell of hair sprays, they compete with perfumes.  This one is quite pleasant and the smell dissipates quickly.  If you have to use hair spray, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sprays over the years, but none have worked as well as this.  I have curly, but fine hair and the spray holds my hair in place without looking or feeling like there is any on my hair at all.  Very natural looking and worth every penny as I don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.</li>
            <li> Makes hair stiff :(&lt;br /&gt;I bought it since I liked the scent when my hair stylist used it at salon.</li>
            <li> Would post 5, but it&#x27;s very costly! Love the product. Not sticky, but holds well. It&#x27;s all I will use!</li>
            <li> This is fun to use on long hair. It holds but you can lightly brush through and it gives nice support and shine.</li>
            <li> Lets just say when I spray with anything else, my fine hair goes flat in less than five miutes. Using redken, bumble and bumble, on and on.....grrrr! My friend gave me a bottle of eufora, for an emergency \\&quot;try-it\\&quot;.  My hair held all night, ALL NIGHT, and didn&#x27;t get all gross later. It looked shiny and pretty. That&#x27;s saying a lot for me. And this morning, I only had like bare bones tiny speck of it to spray out and did the best i could at 8:00 this morning, and my hair is still wavy and holding. Get the big bottle, it&#x27;s twice the price of the little ones for five times as much.  Flipping awesome spray.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray ill use. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue if you run your fingers through your hair</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different hairsprays in my lifetime, but this product by far is the best. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or leave it feeling sticky. It holds the hair in place and has a pleasant smell. This is my only hairspray and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this and I really liked it.So brought it for home.&lt;br /&gt;There is no stiffiness. No residue.</li>
            <li> This hairspray did not work for those days when it was humid and rainy. I prefer a stronger hold on those days.&lt;br /&gt;It works great on days when the air is dry and it has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would buy again. Great seller. Fast!!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I like the fragrance of a sample I had been given by a hairdresser.  It turned out to be quite heavy and made my hair too dirty.  I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> great hold and scent!</li>
            <li> This hairspray is pricey, but it works well on my thin hair?</li>
            <li> Love the smell (pez candy?) and the hold.  Recently tried the Aveda Air Hold Hairspray when my Eufora ran out.  I usually love Aveda products but that hairspray was awful! Sent me running back to the Eufora spray.</li>
            <li> no heavy smell, and it holds nicely.</li>
            <li> This smells SO good!&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product at my stylist&#x27;s salon, but it is hard to get in there to purchase it when I am out. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon with free shipping. It is the same price as the salon and delivered to the door. This spray provides a medium hold and another layer can be added to harden the hold. A great hair spray!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, and not a ton of it, and this is the only hairspray I have found that really adds volume to my hair. It stays in my hair the whole day, and smells great! It&#x27;s one of the few things I will indulge in buying, because it works so well:)</li>
            <li> Good but is a little stiff and drying. But works well if you&#x27;re hair can handle that.  I use sparingly.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and like it very much! Great hold and soft to to touch. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Great product, good service</li>
            <li> Love it. The best one I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> There is no other hair spray on this planet that smells as good as Eufora.  Anyone who hugs me thinks I&#x27;m wearing perfume--I&#x27;m not, it&#x27;s just my hair spray.  Nobody can believe that my hair product smells this amazing.  My husband hates hair spray because of the smell but even he likes Eufora.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the hold, too.  It&#x27;s heavy duty control if you spray a lot but it can also be light if you use a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this hair spray for at least 5 years and I will never use anything else.  I used to have to go to a salon to get it but now that I can buy it on Amazon, I can get it delivered to my home and it&#x27;s cheaper than the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, it&#x27;s definitely more expensive than the ones you can buy at the grocery store but it smells better and lasts a long time.  Splurge on this hair care item -- you will not be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all other hair spray brands, except Eufora. The also purchase the smaller size which is great for travel and to keep in car or bag. It holds hair very well, but can be easily brushed out leaving hair feeling and looking clean. It&#x27;s my favorite and only spray I use. I&#x27;ve even given it for gifts</li>
            <li> This product does not have a strong smell, I enjoy the hold it gives your hair, while it still is easy brushed.&lt;br /&gt;It also contains sunscreen, it&#x27;s alcohol free, and this is the only hairspray I will use.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works great and smells great too. Its a little pricey so I dont use everyday always use for special occasions or if I am curling my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hairspray, however the one we ordered is not this one, in a purple bottle, that we received. We ordered the one in the white and orange bottle, maybe they&#x27;ve just updated the bottle design. It&#x27;s still a great product, but I like to know what I&#x27;m ordering and get what I think I&#x27;m supposed to get and not some surprise.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist at the Local Spa and Resort has been using this product on my hair for a few years now. I finally decided to buy it to use at home and now I will never go back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, adds body, and does not clump or get greasy...and you can resuse again with out washing your hair every day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Smells nice and the hold is perfect , not too much! I have curly hair and somedays I don&#x27;t want to straighten it so this hairspray helps a great deal.</li>
            <li> I do switch up every now and then, but onley for a week or so. Eufora is my mainstay in hair products.  The finishing spray works wonders and I have long layers that tend to frizz in humidity.  That is why this is only a 4-star in my book, because I have yet to find a finishing spray that eliminates humidity frizz.  This product is light, smells fresh and holds!  No more heavy spray for me to try and hold my curls together.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 6 years &amp; would not use any other.  Works well on my fine hair. Never feels sticky &amp; combs out nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the hold this finishing spray gives.  Does not weight down my baby fine hair and gives great hold</li>
            <li> The only hair spray for me!!!  Once I found it I well never replace it with anything else.  It holds but doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky.  It can comb out easily.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.  It really does what it says.  Although it&#x27;s pricey, I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I love Eufora products. They are the only products I use on my hair. I&#x27;ve been using them for years now. This is the best hair spray out on the market for wavy/curly hair. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like moroccan does, which is supposed to be the number one hair product out there. I like this much better. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and gives it just the right amount of shine &amp; hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  It&#x27;s strong but doesn&#x27;t give you &amp;#34;helmut head.&amp;#34; One can last for a long time if you don&#x27;t over spray too often.</li>
            <li> This is light, I use less than from any pump spray.  Lasts all day with just a little spray in the AM.  Love to order it on line as the price at my hairdresser is much more.</li>
