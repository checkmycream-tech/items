            <li>I paid way more.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and we did and love it.</li>
            <li>he made me order 3 more tubes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got a refreshing after-taste.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite for years....</li>
            <li>It works and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, the taste is better than most gel toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so well I wanted more</li>
            <li>This toothpaste tastes great and doesn&#x27;t make our teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Awesome, way less then what you&#x27;ll pay at the dentist</li>
            <li>I love the cool mint flavor of the original flavor</li>
            <li>EVERYBODY both liked and appreciated the thought.</li>
            <li>Everything went smooth, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li>Enjoying this toothpaste, works well for whitening maintenance, I rarely bleach while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>so I found it on line- great taste and keeps your white!</li>
            <li>very fresh.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for a bright smile</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get too excited</li>
            <li>I originally got this from my dentist after a whitening treatment</li>
            <li>It is a very fresh, not overly sweet taste and works well to brighten your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothpaste I found for keeping your teeth white.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my teeth feel totally clean in addition to the gradual whitening and removal of stains.</li>
            <li>The only toothpaste I liked more was 15 dollars a tube.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using this toothpaste for a while because I do drink a lot of coffee and this toothpaste is good to keep you teeth white.</li>
            <li>Have use this for more than a year and my teeth are much whiter</li>
            <li>He gave me a sample size Opalescence toothpaste and love it so much went on the search to buy some.</li>
            <li>okay i bought this toothpaste just because i was looking for something better i can get enough of it even my husband who was a colgate guy all the way ...</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>I was born with a high level of fluoride so that I won&#x27;t be able to have white-white smile even after seeing my dentist; however, after using this paste, I started to see the difference</li>
            <li>The 3 tubes I ordered came in a plastic wrap, fresh product, exp date november 2016.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>My teeth have become far more whiter than when I was using Rembrant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too strong and minty like Altoids which are too strong for me, it&#x27;s just enough to leave my mouth feeling refreshed without &amp;#34;mint burn&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As a 54 year old daily coffee drinker, I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>There are no over-the-counter brand toothpastes in the local stores that will do any better.</li>
            <li>My teeth have always been on the yellowish side, now they&#x27;re more to the white side....</li>
            <li>Dental hygiene is so important it&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more money on a high quality toothpaste and care products to keep the dentist at bay and preserve your teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is great for you can actually see a difference in your color after using it a few times.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again, P.R. - Georgia</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell that much</li>
            <li>it really works.  </li>
            <li>This works well to help make and keep teeth clean and white.</li>
            <li>Sweet Candy Spa sold the toothpaste for a much lesser price than my dentist had charged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>fantastic as expected</li>
            <li>Have used it for a few years and love it</li>
            <li>Items arrived quickly, new and sealed, and just as described.  </li>
            <li>my new go to toothpaste</li>
            <li>As usual, this the 3 or 4th time I order , I love it</li>
            <li>Whitens teeth better than any product I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses it and gave me a tube, wow!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, and in a bigger size than I expected/</li>
            <li>I think my Sonicare is partially to blame for the quick whitening.</li>
            <li>absolutely the same as I purchased in my dentist office</li>
            <li>It really keeps my teeth white.</li>
            <li>it keeps your teeth extra white and your breath extra fresh.</li>
            <li>My dentist swears by this toothpaste and recommended that I use it, several years ago, after my gums started being sensitive to &#x27;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>

            <li> I really like the winter green taste and came with an expiration date!</li>
            <li> a long way.</li>
            <li> I know it may not be a conventional gag gift, but &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; toothpaste may be something someone wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy for themselves.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other toothpaste after finding this one!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I switched from my regular whitening toothpaste to this one.</li>
            <li> It surpasses all the other whitening toothpaste on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and none can compare</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the taste of the old standby toothpastes when I found this one in my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased 6 tubes for me, because we have previously used it and purchased it from our dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed previously.</li>
            <li> These three will last me probably at least half the year!</li>
            <li> We wanted to see about obtaining it a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I like the narrow strwma to apply to the brush.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> in the past.</li>
            <li> This t/paste was given to me by my dentist in a small trial size along with a whitening</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is a must at least in my opinion and should be sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and would hate to live without it!</li>
            <li> I am not seeing dramatic results</li>
            <li> my dental office sells it but its too expensive there so found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is expensive but it will whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> but I felt like my teeth were dirty</li>
    </ol>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t remove coffee stains well</li>
            <li> the best! As usual, this the 3 or 4th time I order , I love it</li>
            <li> Loooove this toothpaste! Best whitening toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product for a couple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) I was born with a high level of fluoride so that I won&#x27;t be able to have white-white smile even after seeing my dentist; however, after using this paste, I started to see the difference and how it actually worked for me whitening my teeth&lt;br /&gt;2) the taste is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I use it with my sonicare electric toothbrush to get even better results , so if you have an electric brush, use it for getting even faster and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> tastes great and works!  have had 3 people ask if I had my teeth whitened after 3 weeks of use</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. You can see the difference when using this toothpaste compared to a standard one. Highly recommend for a bright smile</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used! Whitens teeth better than any product I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Thank you !!!!</li>
            <li> I bought two orders of this toothpaste to wrap up as gag gifts. EVERYBODY both liked and appreciated the thought. This toothpaste tastes great and doesn&#x27;t make our teeth sensitive. I know it may not be a conventional gag gift, but &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; toothpaste may be something someone wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy for themselves. I have used this toothpaste for several years, I drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, drink wine, and I have white teeth. And my dentist always gives me a good report!</li>
            <li> Loved it! The 3 tubes I ordered came in a plastic wrap, fresh product, exp date november 2016. Thank you</li>
            <li> absolutely the same as I purchased in my dentist office I paid way more. Great deal through Amazon</li>
            <li> Items arrived quickly, new and sealed, and just as described.  I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about two years since my dentist recommended I utilize it as a follow-up to the Opalescence whitening system.  I love the cool mint flavor of the original flavor it&#x27;s not too strong and minty like Altoids which are too strong for me, it&#x27;s just enough to leave my mouth feeling refreshed without &amp;#34;mint burn&amp;#34;.  These three will last me probably at least half the year!</li>
            <li> This works well to help make and keep teeth clean and white. Does not burn.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It surpasses all the other whitening toothpaste on the shelves. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive whitening process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste!! Don&#x27;t get too excited</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothpaste I found for keeping your teeth white. My daughter uses it and gave me a tube, wow! I can not believe the difference. I have tried others, they can not come close to this. I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I really like the winter green taste and came with an expiration date!</li>
            <li> fantastic as expected</li>
            <li> great toothpaste. my dental office sells it but its too expensive there so found it on amazon. wouldn&#x27;t go back to any other toothpaste after finding this one! love it. very fresh.</li>
            <li> This product has 0.25% sodium fluoride. I made a phone call to Ultradent Products and was told that the fluoride should be 1.01% I believe this is a copied product.</li>
            <li> I originally got this from my dentist after a whitening treatment and I believe it works. As a 54 year old daily coffee drinker, I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s pretty good. It tastes good too! You have to realize that everyone gets different results based on age and food/drink habits but it&#x27;s worth a try. There are no over-the-counter brand toothpastes in the local stores that will do any better.</li>
            <li> I been using this toothpaste for a while and it&#x27;s a really good toothpaste. I plan on using this toothpaste for a while because I do drink a lot of coffee and this toothpaste is good to keep you teeth white. This toothpaste has a good minty flavor to it. This toothpaste is a must at least in my opinion and should be sold in stores.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased 6 tubes for me, because we have previously used it and purchased it from our dentist. We wanted to see about obtaining it a little cheaper and we did and love it. Thanks again, P.R. - Georgia</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, great whitener but pricey.</li>
            <li> great gradual whitener recommended by our dentist.</li>
            <li> Awesome, way less then what you&#x27;ll pay at the dentist</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this stuff! It makes your teeth really white!</li>
            <li> okay i bought this toothpaste just because i was looking for something better i can get enough of it even my husband who was a colgate guy all the way ... he made me order 3 more tubes my new go to toothpaste</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of the taste of the old standby toothpastes when I found this one in my dentist&#x27;s office. It&#x27;s great! And I think it helps keep my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed previously. This has now become the dentist-recommended family toothpaste. Toothpaste is mild and whitens teeth subtly. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The best ever , thank u</li>
            <li> That  toothpaste is the best paste I have ever had!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is great for you can actually see a difference in your color after using it a few times.  The&lt;br /&gt;flavor is great and the tube is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My dentist swears by this toothpaste and recommended that I use it, several years ago, after my gums started being sensitive to &#x27;whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste. I even tried others which claim to not be irritating/damaging, but the dentist recommended against them....and Opalescence is more expensive, but my entire family uses this brand, now. It&#x27;s also got a refreshing after-taste. The price of the seller was great and came delivered in perfect condition and quick. I also buy 1OZ size for travels.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite for years.... it keeps your teeth extra white and your breath extra fresh.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become far more whiter than when I was using Rembrant. I think my Sonicare is partially to blame for the quick whitening.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and none can compare Have use this for more than a year and my teeth are much whiter</li>
            <li> best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and would hate to live without it!</li>
            <li> everything as promised.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever after having my teeth bleached at the dentist...this is the only toothpaste I use!!!</li>
            <li> I like the narrow strwma to apply to the brush.  Good flavor.  I am not seeing dramatic results but I like the product.</li>
            <li> It works and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and in a bigger size than I expected/</li>
            <li> Everything went smooth, nothing to complain about</li>
            <li> Awesome does the job! White teeth!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth feel totally clean in addition to the gradual whitening and removal of stains. I have used this&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste in the past. Sweet Candy Spa sold the toothpaste for a much lesser price than my dentist had charged. However,&lt;br /&gt;the shipping price for just one tube was rather pricey so I ordered three tubes for about the same shipping price.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I switched from my regular whitening toothpaste to this one. I use the tubes of Opalescence overnight whitening gel and have seen great results with that so I decided to try the toothpaste. So far it has been a complete waste of money. On the plus side, the taste is better than most gel toothpastes.</li>
            <li> works great. Tried to go back to Colgate but I felt like my teeth were dirty I can not change back.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is one of the best I&#x27;ve found.  The only toothpaste I liked more was 15 dollars a tube.  It is a very fresh, not overly sweet taste and works well to brighten your teeth.  Dental hygiene is so important it&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more money on a high quality toothpaste and care products to keep the dentist at bay and preserve your teeth.</li>
            <li> I started to use this after having my teeth whitened by the doctor. It really keeps my teeth white. I do not like the smell that much but I think this is personal preference. It smells like &amp;#34;Bengay&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Tiger Balm&amp;#34;  whose smell I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;It workssssss</li>
            <li> I love it and I requested it 3 times and plan to request aging of finish... Nice and very refreshing smell</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!  I had a sample from the dentist and was hooked.  I use it everyday.  I like the whitening properties.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Best tooth paste on the market and very well priced on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I work in a dental office. Have used it for a few years and love it and it works great</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the whitening kit at my dentist office.  He gave me a sample size Opalescence toothpaste and love it so much went on the search to buy some.</li>
            <li> Enjoying this toothpaste, works well for whitening maintenance, I rarely bleach while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It works well on stains and has a great taste. I would defiantly be again. Leaves your teeth white and shinny</li>
            <li> My teeth have always been on the yellowish side, now they&#x27;re more to the white side....thank you!</li>
            <li> This t/paste was given to me by my dentist in a small trial size along with a whitening&lt;br /&gt;kit. I liked it so well I wanted more so I found it on line- great taste and keeps your white!</li>
            <li> Great product and great taste !</li>
            <li> We have been using this for several weeks now and it did not get me or my husbands teeth white at all. I think it just over priced toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just use on the weekends.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is expensive but it will whiten your teeth. I do use every day.</li>
            <li> Great product, value and service.  it really works.  A++++++ Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Excellent product</li>
