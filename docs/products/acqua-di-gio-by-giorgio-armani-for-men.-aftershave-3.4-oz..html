            <li>Perfect for summer.&lt;br /&gt;Light smell of ocean and such.&lt;br /&gt;pours</li>
            <li>very happy with the product</li>
            <li>This is a wIn win for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I made that mistake thinking I was getting an awesome deal on cologne, and ended up giving it to my brother as a gift before purchasing more cologne.  </li>
            <li>Choose wisely as it is non-refundable.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Choose wisely as it is non-refundable.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find after shave as easily any more...and from all I tried, Acqua Di Gio is by far the best...</li>
            <li>I aboslutely love this scent, and have been using it for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not saying that this aftershave is all I use at all, but it&#x27;s safe and unoffensive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alcohol-based aftershave liquid (better described as \\&quot;aftershave splash\\&quot; or \\&quot;diluted</li>
            <li>My dad loves this cologne, but what else would set it off better than having the after shave to go with, he puts this on like a women thats going out on the town to pick up a man!!Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>return to buy more when its needed</li>
            <li>a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;still, loved it very much. . .</li>
            <li>The product was fine</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;ve used this product for about five years now and keep going back to it.</li>
            <li>aftershave I had in the past was more of a lotion, this one was more of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;bummer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very masculine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S REALLY A LOTION YOU MUST PURCHASE THE AFTERSHAVE BALM.</li>
            <li>absolutely loves this colonge.just</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S REALLY A LOTION YOU MUST PURCHASE THE AFTERSHAVE BALM.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve borrowed it from him multiple times, and it still has the same exact scent as the cologne, though not as strong because of the nature of aftershave.</li>
            <li>There are several others in my cupboard like  Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue, a couple by Tommy, and three versions of Polo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product description was not match with actual picture and everything else was confusing.etter described as &amp;#34;aftershave splash&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;diluted cologne&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>but my wife loves it, saying it&#x27;s not too heavy and smells clean.</li>
            <li>all, we all are different and see and smell things slightly different, but this is my favorite everyday aftershave.</li>
            <li>The DOLCE &amp; GABBANA Light Blue is another of my favorites as is Attitude, but for everyday this has become my standard in aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But apparently \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; isn&#x27;t lotion to Giorgio Armani</li>

            <li> It is not the product I was looking for. I did not notice until I opened the package and was unable to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;The aftershave I had in the past was more of a lotion, this one was more of a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;bummer....&lt;br /&gt;Kip-Ja</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it and the girl likes it when I wear it.  This is a wIn win for me.</li>
            <li> I aboslutely love this scent, and have been using it for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning, this is aftershave, not cologne.  I made that mistake thinking I was getting an awesome deal on cologne, and ended up giving it to my brother as a gift before purchasing more cologne.  I&#x27;ve borrowed it from him multiple times, and it still has the same exact scent as the cologne, though not as strong because of the nature of aftershave.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find after shave as easily any more...and from all I tried, Acqua Di Gio is by far the best...</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer.&lt;br /&gt;Light smell of ocean and such.&lt;br /&gt;pours a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;still, loved it very much. . .</li>
            <li> Image on product page is of Acqua Di Gio aftershave balm with milky white look. The product I received says aftershave lotion on the box. Product description was not match with actual picture and everything else was confusing.etter described as &amp;#34;aftershave splash&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;diluted cologne&amp;#34;). IF YOU WANT ACQUA DI GIO THAT&#x27;S REALLY A LOTION YOU MUST PURCHASE THE AFTERSHAVE BALM. Choose wisely as it is non-refundable. Guess I&#x27;ll have to spend another $50 to get the lotion, I mean balm, that I intended to purchase the first time.</li>
            <li> I used to wear a Nautica aftershave, I like this product as well and the wife likes it too. Smells good.</li>
            <li> it would seem that the aftershave is &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;....fragrance is not very strong...disappointed with the product...would not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Pay attention, this product is the aftershave lotion, not the aftershave balm displayed in the picture. Furthermore, it is not possible to return it.</li>
            <li> After having made my purchase on-line I noticed the product did not arrive three days after expected delivery date.  I emailed seller for tracking information on item when he FINALLY tells me he has run out of the item.  Disappointing as this was, asking for an immediate refund!!!</li>
            <li> very happy with the product</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the receiver said he loves it.  I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> husband has not stopped wearing since christmas. absolutely loves this colonge.just bought another scent so it may last a little longer.</li>
            <li> my bad tho i wanted the toilette spray not aftershave.should have read the advertisement better.&lt;br /&gt;no one to blame but myself</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;ve used this product for about five years now and keep going back to it. I know this is subjective but my wife loves it, saying it&#x27;s not too heavy and smells clean. The other Armani products I have are Code, Emporio and Attitude. There are several others in my cupboard like  Dolce &amp; Gabbana Light Blue, a couple by Tommy, and three versions of Polo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying that this aftershave is all I use at all, but it&#x27;s safe and unoffensive. The DOLCE &amp; GABBANA Light Blue is another of my favorites as is Attitude, but for everyday this has become my standard in aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, we all are different and see and smell things slightly different, but this is my favorite everyday aftershave.</li>
            <li> Image on product page is of Acqua Di Gio aftershave balm.  The product I received says aftershave lotion on the box.  But apparently \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; isn&#x27;t lotion to Giorgio Armani it&#x27;s alcohol-based aftershave liquid (better described as \\&quot;aftershave splash\\&quot; or \\&quot;diluted cologne\\&quot;).  IF YOU WANT ACQUA DI GIO THAT&#x27;S REALLY A LOTION YOU MUST PURCHASE THE AFTERSHAVE BALM.  Choose wisely as it is non-refundable.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to spend another $50 to get the lotion, I mean balm, that I intended to purchase the first time.</li>
            <li> This is not the cologne, only the after shave.  This was my fault but still, read carefully as I did not.  That&#x27;s not what bothers me though.  This was an amazon prime item however it took over 2 weeks to get it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY SLOW processing and shipping.  The product was fine and I did eventually get it.  Still very poor handling of the product.</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne, but what else would set it off better than having the after shave to go with, he puts this on like a women thats going out on the town to pick up a man!!Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This site was the cheapest place to find this&lt;br /&gt;will return to buy more when its needed</li>
