            <li>Works great, but most of all smells great.  </li>
            <li>For not having sulfates, or chemicals, this did a really good job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>also so much good conditioning I get from this</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>My hair smells good and it has a shine to it when I&#x27;m washing it.</li>
            <li>Besides smelling good.</li>
            <li>Besides that... it smells good, and seems to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff works just OK as a sulfate free shampoo, but I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>But when I straightened my hair omg it was Sooo smooth and shiny! !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO GLAD they did!  </li>
            <li>Now! :) Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Great for curly fine hair</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine how this shampoo gets so many good reviews, I just have medium brunette hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m not in love with shea moisture&#x27;s smell, but this is a great sulfate free shampo.</li>
            <li>Perfect For Natural Hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WONDERFUL also, but the kid&#x27;s shampoo scent is natural (orange blossom?)</li>
            <li>On the bright side it does clean well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much to strong to even try, even if it was incredible, I can&#x27;t handle that much scent.</li>
            <li>I mostly bought it because of the coconut in the shampoo ..</li>
            <li>I cut my hair about once every four to six months, and the longer I wait to trim it, the more it sheds.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it at Walgreen &#x27;s with the buy</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li>The best shampoo I have every used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>and I believe that it works much better for her hair type than mine.</li>
            <li>Also, I absolutely love the smell of this though and we get a lot of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>but to my surprize I love it.</li>
            <li>Diluted sulfate shampoos are just better for my scalp, in all honesty.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo when I want to go curly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and was relieved to find out</li>
            <li>Great for thick curly hair; and it smells great, too!</li>
            <li>and I could not find anything that personally worked for me, well this shampoo is definitely it, it is so perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit picky with smells, but even so, this was just over the top (</li>
            <li>I must use a conditioner to be able to detangle .</li>
            <li>So I guess we both like it :).</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with the results and will keep using SM.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I Love it.</li>
            <li>My 3c curls LOVE to be detangled by my fingers in this shampoo-</li>
            <li>: Pleased.</li>
            <li>Top of the line stuff</li>
            <li>but this wouldn&#x27;t stop me from repurchasing. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I have the most unruly curls ever..</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have a mixed baby and this works perfect for his hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this, but I did get the leave in one with yucca to use once a week, and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great product, I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>it smells pretty good doesn&#x27;t hurt, either.</li>
            <li>Love this shampo, made my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>fast delivery good  product</li>
            <li>But it does change the texture of your hair and makes working with it so easy.</li>
            <li>They clean better and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li>I need more time, but so far it is good.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s sweet, and It lasts in my hair.</li>
            <li>It detangles and suds up just fine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think anything fantastic about it, it feels like a shampoo.</li>
            <li>one get one free sale they had.</li>
            <li>With this i dont and my legs feel incredibly smooth for about a day.</li>
            <li>it leaves my legs so silky smooth and the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li>Like all the SM shampoos, it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li>I also like the SM clarifying shampoo (also sulfate free)</li>
            <li>That is probably why my hair is so light and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>When you smell it in the bottle, it&#x27;s kind of nice and tropical, but it&#x27;s a lot stronger once you actually use the product.  </li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews and wondered what was the the big deal  and thought \\&quot;chill people</li>
            <li>I have a good hair day nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>I Loved it through transitioning, and now I am natural.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, but doesn&#x27;t have a rich lather, so you need to use more and it did not make my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle from amazon the top came off during shipping so the refunded my money right away</li>
            <li>Enhancing Smoothie  and the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk for very nice braid outs and the soap in the same scent smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>If we want a light cowash like clean this may work for you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light perfume, exactly how I like it. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with loads of different products to see what will work best on my new 3b/3c moisture starved curly hair.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more, it does exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Aint worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this line, but I&#x27;ll be returning everything I bought.  </li>
            <li>I was originally going to try the moisture retention shampoo, but I could tell off the bat with that one that the fragrance was going to be an issue.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling very soft, very shiny and smelling great and clean.</li>
            <li>Will wash out having your hair feel like you just used conditioner and yet still clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my scalp as well as it once did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not clarifying, but it does clean my scalp and hair quite well.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the shampoo, and it felt pretty gentle on my hair, but the smell was so over powering.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and works as expected.</li>
            <li>The lather that I get is amazing, which surprised  me because it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>I thought coconut was supposed to good for your hair and scalp ESPECIALLY in an organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, smells nice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately, so I was very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>This product really goes with my 2 4 and 7 year olds hair makes it soft easy to comb smell so good and grows there hair when I use it consistently</li>
            <li>allows me to be able to detangle my hair so well that I double checked the label to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is such a better choice for anyone in so many ways.</li>
            <li>Us curly girls need a highly moisturizing shampoo, as our hair is more prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think the shampoo had any noticeable effect on the wave, it did leave my hair very shiny, strong and full of body.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>However I am a product junkie, so I love trying new things for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good, lasts for a long time, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>Honestly i got this for 10 bucks at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find more natural products for my body.</li>
            <li>I like even  more that it is a natural product,</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this product and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, plus you get your money worth.</li>
            <li>May be slightly overwhelming to those with sensitive noses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;ve rinsed this shampoo out of my hair, it is soft and smooth as if I had just conditioned it, and I always, always, always notice significantly fewer strands on my hands as I am styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I typically do not need to use more than a nickel to quarter sized amount per section[I wash my hair in sections]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not dry out my very curly-coily, dense hair at all-in fact I was able to finger detangle my hair with the shampoo still in it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very long lasting and has a mild and great scent.</li>
            <li>This line is affordable, works really well, is natural, organic and also very accessible.</li>
            <li>I have salt and pepper hair, no color or dye and usually loose nice curls.</li>
            <li>Very, very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything.</li>
            <li>This is most definitely not a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice it drying out my hair since I focus on my scalp, but it isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>considering I&#x27;d washed/conditioned 2 more times with a different shampoo.  </li>
            <li>, it smells pretty loaded with perfume (?).  </li>
            <li>After the first shampoo with this product, my hair seemed greasy.</li>
            <li>I have since tried Shea Moisture Curling Control Shampoo three more times with the same result.</li>
            <li>this is the first shampoo I came across which</li>
            <li>You can order this exact shampoo online at walgreens.com for $9.99</li>
            <li>First washing and my hair is frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this shampoo after reading some online reviews.  </li>
            <li>First of all this product can eve bought st Walmart, cvs, and target.</li>
            <li>This shampoo also lathers like a sulfate shampoo without actually having sulfates, which I love.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but is too thick to pour out of the pop-up cap easily.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my curls shiny and clean!</li>
            <li>The smell is somewhat strong, but I find it really lovely and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really associate the smell with anything other than it smells kind of like coconut.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, along with the Curl and Shine conditioner, leaves my hair soft and shiny and full of bounce.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price: Not bad for an all natural hair product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also fine and low porosity</li>
            <li>works fine, but not lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair and love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really nice, you don&#x27;t need a lot ( I have very long hair ) of product and unlike most natural shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a wet bird&#x27;s nest!</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery,</li>
            <li>I try not to shampoo her hair too often, but when I do and use this, it works very well and keeps her unruly hair tamed (but doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz).</li>
            <li>I have used a clarifing shampoo without this much tangles.</li>
            <li>Very tropical/beachy.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing but cleansing, not so much.</li>
            <li>Like the smell Of this better than the other line.</li>
            <li>this stuff helps more than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It leaves my naturally curly hair feeling fresh and new after every use, and I swear it strengthens my strands.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t handle the strong smell left behind in my hair, so I washed and conditioned 2 MORE times with my regular shampoo to try get rid of the fragrance, and though it diminished it, it was still pretty strong</li>
            <li>It smells really good and still doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as much as other shampoos (i.e., with sulfates).</li>
            <li>the Jamaican Black Castor Oil formula with apple cider vinegar (it smells really fresh and clean).  </li>
            <li>, I get flakes back in my hair rather quickly after I use this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best shampoo for me to use for my scalp (because I have bad dandruff)</li>
            <li>Which is much safer and seems to work so far...</li>
            <li>It did not do any real favors for my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I am trying to find something useful for the product I have left and can think of nothing.</li>
            <li>At least the smell was nice for this one (unlike the MR shampoo).</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between this and the &#x27;moisture retention&#x27; shampoo, just know that this one smells natural, like coconut desserts and the other smells very much NOT natural and extremely strongly like one of those folks who puts on TOO MUCH perfume.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d add a new shampoo</li>
            <li>But I live the way it makes my hair feels</li>
            <li>A bit more drying than the shea moisture raw shea retention shampoo</li>
            <li>Very  natural scent (</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and soft and detangled!  </li>
            <li>and I recommend this to all my natural or curly sisters!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchase the small sample from Target.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time and money on many different products that were deemed natural for my sensitive skin and allergies, as well as my concern for safer beauty products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m newly natural, but even during my transition I noticed how soft it made both my natural and relaxed hair feel.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 7 year old ...</li>
            <li>so I switched to an all natural coconut shampoo instead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% natural 4a 3c.</li>
            <li>but when I do decide to wear it naturally curly-</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair feeling so soft that you could probably start detangling without even using a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my hair feel, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft after washing and repeating a couple of times.</li>
            <li>It has the added benefit of being free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this formula because I have been trying to encourage the natural wave in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I suggest if your hair is protein sensitive, try not to use it too frequently.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li>my curls feel so soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell can get old, after repeated use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of irritating my nasal passages and making me feel like</li>
            <li>My order arrived on time, and this is my favorite shampoo for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that this product last a long time because you only have to use a small palm full.</li>
            <li>The first product of this brand which I tried was the kids shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My little girl also has a very thick long curly hair and the shampoos also been great on her hair and leaves it soft and manageable...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and it seems to enhance my curls a little.</li>
            <li>I was use tea tree drops in her shampoo before but was afraid this wasn&#x27;t good for her ( but it worked well )</li>
            <li>Slip factor was awesome but hated the reconstruting conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a replacement for the old Creme of Nature shampoo formula in the red and white bottle, please try this!</li>
            <li>It lathers very well so it only takes a little and my hair feels soft while I&#x27;m washing it.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this shampoo and her hair always looks thick and full after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past few months and I love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair as much as the African black soap line</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I also have the sugar scrub that is also wonderful.</li>

            <li> Great product for girls with waves and curls.</li>
            <li> works great and shipping was on point</li>
            <li> However, the reviewer was Caucasian and she raved about how great the SM products were.  </li>
            <li> This product  helps moisturize my hair and it doesn&#x27;t strip or Matt my hair while I&#x27;m washing it either, A great detangler.</li>

            <li> I love the product and the store has excellent service UNPLUGGED ....</li>
            <li> Works great, but most of all smells great.  </li>
            <li> For not having sulfates, or chemicals, this did a really good job cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> also so much good conditioning I get from this</li>
            <li> good stuff</li>
            <li> My hair smells good and it has a shine to it when I&#x27;m washing it.</li>
            <li> Besides smelling good.</li>
            <li> Besides that... it smells good, and seems to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just OK as a sulfate free shampoo, but I&#x27;m not that impressed.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> But when I straightened my hair omg it was Sooo smooth and shiny! !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO GLAD they did!  </li>
            <li> Now! :) Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for curly fine hair</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine how this shampoo gets so many good reviews, I just have medium brunette hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m not in love with shea moisture&#x27;s smell, but this is a great sulfate free shampo.</li>
            <li> Perfect For Natural Hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WONDERFUL also, but the kid&#x27;s shampoo scent is natural (orange blossom?)</li>
            <li> On the bright side it does clean well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much to strong to even try, even if it was incredible, I can&#x27;t handle that much scent.</li>
            <li> I mostly bought it because of the coconut in the shampoo ..</li>
            <li> I cut my hair about once every four to six months, and the longer I wait to trim it, the more it sheds.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got it at Walgreen &#x27;s with the buy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have every used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> and I believe that it works much better for her hair type than mine.</li>
            <li> Also, I absolutely love the smell of this though and we get a lot of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> but to my surprize I love it.</li>
            <li> Diluted sulfate shampoos are just better for my scalp, in all honesty.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo when I want to go curly.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and was relieved to find out</li>
            <li> Great for thick curly hair; and it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> and I could not find anything that personally worked for me, well this shampoo is definitely it, it is so perfect.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit picky with smells, but even so, this was just over the top (</li>
            <li> I must use a conditioner to be able to detangle .</li>
            <li> So I guess we both like it :).</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with the results and will keep using SM.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> and I Love it.</li>
            <li> My 3c curls LOVE to be detangled by my fingers in this shampoo-</li>
            <li> : Pleased.</li>
            <li> Top of the line stuff</li>
            <li> but this wouldn&#x27;t stop me from repurchasing. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I have the most unruly curls ever..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have a mixed baby and this works perfect for his hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this, but I did get the leave in one with yucca to use once a week, and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great product, I highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> it smells pretty good doesn&#x27;t hurt, either.</li>
            <li> Love this shampo, made my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> fast delivery good  product</li>
            <li> But it does change the texture of your hair and makes working with it so easy.</li>
            <li> They clean better and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all.</li>
            <li> I need more time, but so far it is good.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s sweet, and It lasts in my hair.</li>
            <li> It detangles and suds up just fine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think anything fantastic about it, it feels like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> one get one free sale they had.</li>
            <li> With this i dont and my legs feel incredibly smooth for about a day.</li>
            <li> it leaves my legs so silky smooth and the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Like all the SM shampoos, it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
            <li> I also like the SM clarifying shampoo (also sulfate free)</li>
            <li> That is probably why my hair is so light and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> When you smell it in the bottle, it&#x27;s kind of nice and tropical, but it&#x27;s a lot stronger once you actually use the product.  </li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews and wondered what was the the big deal  and thought \\&quot;chill people</li>
            <li> I have a good hair day nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> I Loved it through transitioning, and now I am natural.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, but doesn&#x27;t have a rich lather, so you need to use more and it did not make my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle from amazon the top came off during shipping so the refunded my money right away</li>
            <li> Enhancing Smoothie  and the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk for very nice braid outs and the soap in the same scent smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> If we want a light cowash like clean this may work for you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a light perfume, exactly how I like it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with loads of different products to see what will work best on my new 3b/3c moisture starved curly hair.</li>
            <li> Will purchase more, it does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Aint worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this line, but I&#x27;ll be returning everything I bought.  </li>
            <li> I was originally going to try the moisture retention shampoo, but I could tell off the bat with that one that the fragrance was going to be an issue.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling very soft, very shiny and smelling great and clean.</li>
            <li> Will wash out having your hair feel like you just used conditioner and yet still clean.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my scalp as well as it once did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clarifying, but it does clean my scalp and hair quite well.  </li>
            <li> I liked the feel of the shampoo, and it felt pretty gentle on my hair, but the smell was so over powering.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and works as expected.</li>
            <li> The lather that I get is amazing, which surprised  me because it&#x27;s sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I thought coconut was supposed to good for your hair and scalp ESPECIALLY in an organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately, so I was very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> This product really goes with my 2 4 and 7 year olds hair makes it soft easy to comb smell so good and grows there hair when I use it consistently</li>
            <li> allows me to be able to detangle my hair so well that I double checked the label to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is such a better choice for anyone in so many ways.</li>
            <li> Us curly girls need a highly moisturizing shampoo, as our hair is more prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think the shampoo had any noticeable effect on the wave, it did leave my hair very shiny, strong and full of body.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> However I am a product junkie, so I love trying new things for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells good, lasts for a long time, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Honestly i got this for 10 bucks at my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find more natural products for my body.</li>
            <li> I like even  more that it is a natural product,</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, plus you get your money worth.</li>
            <li> May be slightly overwhelming to those with sensitive noses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;ve rinsed this shampoo out of my hair, it is soft and smooth as if I had just conditioned it, and I always, always, always notice significantly fewer strands on my hands as I am styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I typically do not need to use more than a nickel to quarter sized amount per section[I wash my hair in sections]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not dry out my very curly-coily, dense hair at all-in fact I was able to finger detangle my hair with the shampoo still in it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long lasting and has a mild and great scent.</li>
            <li> This line is affordable, works really well, is natural, organic and also very accessible.</li>
            <li> I have salt and pepper hair, no color or dye and usually loose nice curls.</li>
            <li> Very, very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything.</li>
            <li> This is most definitely not a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice it drying out my hair since I focus on my scalp, but it isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;d washed/conditioned 2 more times with a different shampoo.  </li>
            <li> , it smells pretty loaded with perfume (?).  </li>
            <li> After the first shampoo with this product, my hair seemed greasy.</li>
            <li> I have since tried Shea Moisture Curling Control Shampoo three more times with the same result.</li>
            <li> this is the first shampoo I came across which</li>
            <li> You can order this exact shampoo online at walgreens.com for $9.99</li>
            <li> First washing and my hair is frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered this shampoo after reading some online reviews.  </li>
            <li> First of all this product can eve bought st Walmart, cvs, and target.</li>
            <li> This shampoo also lathers like a sulfate shampoo without actually having sulfates, which I love.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but is too thick to pour out of the pop-up cap easily.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my curls shiny and clean!</li>
            <li> The smell is somewhat strong, but I find it really lovely and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really associate the smell with anything other than it smells kind of like coconut.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, along with the Curl and Shine conditioner, leaves my hair soft and shiny and full of bounce.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Price: Not bad for an all natural hair product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also fine and low porosity</li>
            <li> works fine, but not lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really nice, you don&#x27;t need a lot ( I have very long hair ) of product and unlike most natural shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a wet bird&#x27;s nest!</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery,</li>
            <li> I try not to shampoo her hair too often, but when I do and use this, it works very well and keeps her unruly hair tamed (but doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz).</li>
            <li> I have used a clarifing shampoo without this much tangles.</li>
            <li> Very tropical/beachy.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing but cleansing, not so much.</li>
            <li> Like the smell Of this better than the other line.</li>
            <li> this stuff helps more than any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It leaves my naturally curly hair feeling fresh and new after every use, and I swear it strengthens my strands.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the strong smell left behind in my hair, so I washed and conditioned 2 MORE times with my regular shampoo to try get rid of the fragrance, and though it diminished it, it was still pretty strong</li>
            <li> It smells really good and still doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as much as other shampoos (i.e., with sulfates).</li>
            <li> the Jamaican Black Castor Oil formula with apple cider vinegar (it smells really fresh and clean).  </li>
            <li> , I get flakes back in my hair rather quickly after I use this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best shampoo for me to use for my scalp (because I have bad dandruff)</li>
            <li> Which is much safer and seems to work so far...</li>
            <li> It did not do any real favors for my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find something useful for the product I have left and can think of nothing.</li>
            <li> At least the smell was nice for this one (unlike the MR shampoo).</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between this and the &#x27;moisture retention&#x27; shampoo, just know that this one smells natural, like coconut desserts and the other smells very much NOT natural and extremely strongly like one of those folks who puts on TOO MUCH perfume.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d add a new shampoo</li>
            <li> But I live the way it makes my hair feels</li>
            <li> A bit more drying than the shea moisture raw shea retention shampoo</li>
            <li> Very  natural scent (</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny and soft and detangled!  </li>
            <li> and I recommend this to all my natural or curly sisters!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchase the small sample from Target.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time and money on many different products that were deemed natural for my sensitive skin and allergies, as well as my concern for safer beauty products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newly natural, but even during my transition I noticed how soft it made both my natural and relaxed hair feel.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 7 year old ...</li>
            <li> so I switched to an all natural coconut shampoo instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% natural 4a 3c.</li>
            <li> but when I do decide to wear it naturally curly-</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair feeling so soft that you could probably start detangling without even using a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft after washing and repeating a couple of times.</li>
            <li> It has the added benefit of being free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this formula because I have been trying to encourage the natural wave in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I suggest if your hair is protein sensitive, try not to use it too frequently.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li> my curls feel so soft afterward.  </li>
            <li> Also, the smell can get old, after repeated use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of irritating my nasal passages and making me feel like</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, and this is my favorite shampoo for my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that this product last a long time because you only have to use a small palm full.</li>
            <li> The first product of this brand which I tried was the kids shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My little girl also has a very thick long curly hair and the shampoos also been great on her hair and leaves it soft and manageable...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, soft, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and it seems to enhance my curls a little.</li>
            <li> I was use tea tree drops in her shampoo before but was afraid this wasn&#x27;t good for her ( but it worked well )</li>
            <li> Slip factor was awesome but hated the reconstruting conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a replacement for the old Creme of Nature shampoo formula in the red and white bottle, please try this!</li>
            <li> It lathers very well so it only takes a little and my hair feels soft while I&#x27;m washing it.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this shampoo and her hair always looks thick and full after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past few months and I love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair as much as the African black soap line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for like 4 years now and no other shampoo will come before it because unlike alot of other shampoos this does not dry my hair and strip it of moisture</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very concentrated so you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference from my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> I get just as much lather, if not more, as I do with a sulfate shampoo.</li>
            <li> It left me with a dry, itchy scalp after two shampoos in four days.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t AS stripping as the Moisture Retention Shampoo, but still left my hair feeling very dry and tangly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to why the price is so exorbitant when you can buy this same size at Target or Walgreens (retail and online) for $9.99 per bottle?!  </li>
            <li> As I Am&amp;#34;so that stretched this product too</li>
            <li> This product goes a [long] way.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after long giving up on finding control for them, and to my surprise it brought control to them.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few months but it didn&#x27;t wow me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo be so uncomfortably perfumey, though for the past few years I&#x27;ve gotten used to using more natural products with essential oils for fragrance, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t feel like that at all</li>
            <li> and I have thick, coarse, long naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> i expected this to be gentle but again, like the shampoo in Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw Shea Butter line (Moisture Retention Shampoo), it was stripping!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair smelling like the product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for some time because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally soft and I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with detangling in the shower with just shampoo but this shampoo strip my hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, the frizz associated with my curls on hot or humid days was much worse.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, but alas I gave it a few tries and had symptoms of an itchy dry scalp, oily looking hair, weighted down natural curls and a lack of shine.  </li>
            <li> It was not as expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived timely and was as expected.</li>
            <li> This product I was hesitant to try due to the other product in this line causing my hair to become very dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that I wear natural half the time and blow dry the other half.</li>
            <li> It works well after you have sweated your hair from working out, swimming or other activities, without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> I have not had frizz like this with other shampoos for curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I also want to try the other formulas.  </li>
            <li> and I just went out and bought this product the other</li>
            <li> It did not curl my hair like other curling products I have tried before.</li>
            <li> The formula really hit that &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34; adequately; not too thin where you feel you&#x27;re not using enough product yet not too thick where it may prove to be a challenge to massage the product in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i just have no success with Shea Moisture&#x27;s shampoos.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, thin hair or frizzy hair -- this is your shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a dime sized amount to do one leg</li>
            <li> but there is a slight dryness to my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> In general, I am not happy.</li>
            <li> My hair was a tangled mess even after using a rinse out conditioner and a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> but a little too perfumed for me.  </li>
            <li> I needed something safe for pregnancy that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This product dries my hair out and leaving it course and heavy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I understand from the reviewer that SM products do not contain heavy silicone.  </li>

            <li> and it was an expensive $12.50 mistake.</li>

            <li> but  it makes my head itch badly.  </li>

            <li> Awesome Product! Perfect For Natural Hair! Fast Delivery, Just As Pictured And Described, Thank You</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I needed something safe for pregnancy that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive and this fits the bill. I have thin, wavy hair and using this every other day smoothed and enhanced the curl. I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this, but I did get the leave in one with yucca to use once a week, and so far so good! The smell is somewhat strong, but I find it really lovely and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Works great, but most of all smells great.  Will purchase more, it does exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Aint worth the price!</li>
            <li> Like the smell Of this better than the other line. Don&#x27;t think anything fantastic about it, it feels like a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle from amazon the top came off during shipping so the refunded my money right away (I found it at Walmart and Walgreens for a lot cheaper than Amazon ).. I mostly bought it because of the coconut in the shampoo .. I use it on my 7 year old ...lice has been going around her class and she hasn&#x27;t gotten it ... I was use tea tree drops in her shampoo before but was afraid this wasn&#x27;t good for her ( but it worked well ) so I switched to an all natural coconut shampoo instead. Which is much safer and seems to work so far... My little girl also has a very thick long curly hair and the shampoos also been great on her hair and leaves it soft and manageable... I bought the coconut detangler also which will use every morning before school</li>
            <li> Item arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> Excellent conditions, excellent product, I am very satisfied 5 stars :)</li>
            <li> I need more time, but so far it is good.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  I have used the product for some time because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  Had to stop using it - whether it is the fragrance, or foaming agent or ? dont&#x27; know, but  it makes my head itch badly.  I had truly hoped to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% natural 4a 3c. I&#x27;m also fine and low porosity so my hair is buildup prone. This shampoo is not cleansing enough for me to get the product out of my hair and not cleansing enough for my scalp which can get itchy and flacky at times. I need teatree or peppermint type ingredients. If we want a light cowash like clean this may work for you but it&#x27;s a no go for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is officially my go-to. Nothing else will do, unless I have run out of this stuff. It leaves my naturally curly hair feeling fresh and new after every use, and I swear it strengthens my strands. I cut my hair about once every four to six months, and the longer I wait to trim it, the more it sheds. By the time I&#x27;ve rinsed this shampoo out of my hair, it is soft and smooth as if I had just conditioned it, and I always, always, always notice significantly fewer strands on my hands as I am styling my hair. This stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact it smells pretty good doesn&#x27;t hurt, either. It&#x27;s got a light perfume, exactly how I like it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m not in love with shea moisture&#x27;s smell, but this is a great sulfate free shampo. It detangles and suds up just fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, curly and frizzes up when dry. This shampoo left my curls shiny and clean! For not having sulfates, or chemicals, this did a really good job cleaning my hair. But when I straightened my hair omg it was Sooo smooth and shiny! ! I love this shampoo I&#x27;m so glad I got it at Walgreen &#x27;s with the buy one get one free sale they had. The best shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and believe me I&#x27;ve tried them all for my hair, this one did the job the best.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, blonde, highlighted hair, that is semi curly.  I absolutely love this shampoo and the conditioner. I usually straighten my hair but when I do decide to wear it naturally curly- this stuff helps more than any other product I have ever used. It moisturizes without weighing it down or making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells.  It works well after you have sweated your hair from working out, swimming or other activities, without stripping it.  It is silky but cleansing, and leaves your hair smelling &#x27;good enuf to eat!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that much difference from my usual shampoo. Also I didn&#x27;t care for the scent it left in my hair. Neither did anyone else!</li>
            <li> fast delivery good  product</li>
            <li> Honestly i got this for 10 bucks at my local pharmacy. I wanted to find more natural products for my body. I tried this for about two weeks washing my hair every third day which is my norm. I was careful and it didnt tangle any worse than usual (i have very thick long hair). It smells incredible! Very  natural scent (im sensitive to most artificial parfumes).  After two weeks my hair seemed oily and the last straw was when it would no longer hold curl from my curling iron. However, this stuff is great for shaving. I used to itch and have to use jojoba on my legs after shaving. With this i dont and my legs feel incredibly smooth for about a day. It takes less than a dime sized amount to do one leg and i also use it on bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;update- two years later this is still the only thing i use to shave with. it leaves my legs so silky smooth and the smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past few months and I love it. I&#x27;m newly natural, but even during my transition I noticed how soft it made both my natural and relaxed hair feel. It leaves my hair clean, soft, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and it seems to enhance my curls a little. This is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I have every used in my entire life. Will wash out having your hair feel like you just used conditioner and yet still clean. Smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and love this shampoo.  Very, very hydrating.  This is most definitely not a clarifying shampoo.  I did not even need a leave-in conditioner after using it.  My hair was shiny and soft and detangled!  Bonus...it springs your curls up immediately giving them definition.  If you are looking for a replacement for the old Creme of Nature shampoo formula in the red and white bottle, please try this!</li>
            <li> This product really goes with my 2 4 and 7 year olds hair makes it soft easy to comb smell so good and grows there hair when I use it consistently and I Lovee it on my permed hair also so much good conditioning I get from this I just wish it was cheaper but good stuff</li>
            <li> The best moisturizing shampoo without stripping my hair of needed oils.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, thin hair or frizzy hair -- this is your shampoo.  Don&#x27;t expect a big lather.  It doesn&#x27;t do that.  But it does change the texture of your hair and makes working with it so easy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent! It does not define curls, but rather unravels them. I like that. No detangler is necessary since this shampoo detangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Shea Moisture line of products are $9.99 a piece at Target.</li>
            <li> I never had a shampoo that detangles my 2c/3b hair like this one. Actually, no shampoo that I know straightens the curl unless its a conditioner, so I give this 5 stars. Plus, I like the fact that there are no chemicals or minerals that will hurt my hair. I am very impressed and I recommend this to all my natural or curly sisters!</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, wavy, thin hair and I have thick, coarse, long naturally curly hair. We&#x27;ve both tried it and I believe that it works much better for her hair type than mine. I try not to shampoo her hair too often, but when I do and use this, it works very well and keeps her unruly hair tamed (but doesn&#x27;t eliminate all the frizz). Also, I absolutely love the smell of this though and we get a lot of compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this shampoo because I didn&#x27;t like the Curling Gel Souffle...but to my surprize I love it. My hair smells good and it has a shine to it when I&#x27;m washing it. It lathers very well so it only takes a little and my hair feels soft while I&#x27;m washing it. Love it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0038TXGL0 Shea Moisture ORGANIC Coconut &amp; Hibicus Curl &amp; Shine Shampoo]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was shipped rapidly and arrived as promised.  Shea products work well, but the smell of coconuts lingers all day.  Office workers may not like that.  I did not like it myself, since even the wearer can smell product all day. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. This stuff works just OK as a sulfate free shampoo, but I&#x27;m not that impressed. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my scalp as well as it once did. Diluted sulfate shampoos are just better for my scalp, in all honesty. They clean better and don&#x27;t irritate my scalp at all. I ended up tossing this out.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice it drying out my hair since I focus on my scalp, but it isn&#x27;t exactly moisturizing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It retails $9.99 at Target or similar stores.</li>
            <li> Great product, I highly reccomend it. It&#x27;s very long lasting and has a mild and great scent. Would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Besides smelling good. This product dries my hair out and leaving it course and heavy.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, but alas I gave it a few tries and had symptoms of an itchy dry scalp, oily looking hair, weighted down natural curls and a lack of shine.  I noted after the second wash cycle there still was no lather.  Can&#x27;t imagine how this shampoo gets so many good reviews, I just have medium brunette hair.  I thought I&#x27;d add a new shampoo and it was an expensive $12.50 mistake.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that I wear natural half the time and blow dry the other half. This is my favorite shampoo when I want to go curly. I love the smell and was relieved to find out it didn&#x27;t smell like Shea butterI</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing! I have curly/frizzy mixed hair. This product leaves your hair feeling so soft that you could probably start detangling without even using a conditioner. I definitely recommend to anyone with mixed hair. This is my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampo, made my hair feel silky and smooth. Slip factor was awesome but hated the reconstruting conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel, soft and silky.  I like even  more that it is a natural product,</li>
            <li> Great product, great value.  Delivered before date promised.</li>
            <li> Great for thick curly hair; and it smells great, too!</li>
            <li> It was not as expected. I thought coconut was supposed to good for your hair and scalp ESPECIALLY in an organic shampoo. I was wrong. It left me with a dry, itchy scalp after two shampoos in four days. I felt that this product had stripping qualities rather than conditioning properties. It did not do any real favors for my natural curls. In fact, the frizz associated with my curls on hot or humid days was much worse.  It smells nice but is too thick to pour out of the pop-up cap easily. In general, I am not happy. I will not buy again. I am trying to find something useful for the product I have left and can think of nothing. I wouldn&#x27;t even use this stuff on my dog!</li>
            <li> I have very very very thick, long, curly, hair and I could not find anything that personally worked for me, well this shampoo is definitely it, it is so perfect.  It conditions, moisturizes, leaves shine and bounce with volume, and detangles.  It makes my hair feel so soft after washing and repeating a couple of times.</li>
            <li> If you like your head smelling like a yankee candle, well then this is the shampoo for you!  I liked the feel of the shampoo, and it felt pretty gentle on my hair, but the smell was so over powering.  When you smell it in the bottle, it&#x27;s kind of nice and tropical, but it&#x27;s a lot stronger once you actually use the product.  I couldn&#x27;t handle the strong smell left behind in my hair, so I washed and conditioned 2 MORE times with my regular shampoo to try get rid of the fragrance, and though it diminished it, it was still pretty strong considering I&#x27;d washed/conditioned 2 more times with a different shampoo.  I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo be so uncomfortably perfumey, though for the past few years I&#x27;ve gotten used to using more natural products with essential oils for fragrance, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t feel like that at all, it smells pretty loaded with perfume (?).  I am a bit picky with smells, but even so, this was just over the top (and it&#x27;s kind of irritating my nasal passages and making me feel like a head ache is coming on).  I was excited to try this line, but I&#x27;ll be returning everything I bought.  I was originally going to try the moisture retention shampoo, but I could tell off the bat with that one that the fragrance was going to be an issue.  Oh well, the search continues.  You can buy cheaper too at target and walgreens.</li>
            <li> A bit more drying than the shea moisture raw shea retention shampoo but I like it nonetheless. It smells really good and still doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out as much as other shampoos (i.e., with sulfates).</li>
            <li> I am newly natural after cutting off my relaxed ends almost 3 months ago. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with loads of different products to see what will work best on my new 3b/3c moisture starved curly hair. After the first shampoo with this product, my hair seemed greasy. After rinsing, I lathered up again and still greasy. I had to use another shampoo to get rid of the oily feeling. I have since tried Shea Moisture Curling Control Shampoo three more times with the same result. I use both the Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie  and the Coconut and Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk for very nice braid outs and the soap in the same scent smells heavenly. I will say that this bottle of shampoo has been sitting around for about 6 months so that could have affected the end result. But I just can&#x27;t keep wasting my time with it so out it goes.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos strip my hair so badly that I can&#x27;t detangle while they are in my hair I must use a conditioner to be able to detangle . this is the first shampoo I came across which allows me to be able to detangle my hair so well that I double checked the label to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a conditioner.I read so many good reviews and wondered what was the the big deal  and thought \\&quot;chill people it&#x27;s just a shampoo\\&quot;,now I understand it is heaven in a bottle.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this shampoo and her hair always looks thick and full after use.</li>
            <li> Great product for girls with waves and curls.</li>
            <li> works great and shipping was on point</li>
            <li> My husband uses this, and loves it. It got rid of his frizz and, in my opinion, his curls are clarified and stronger. So I guess we both like it :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for like 4 years now and no other shampoo will come before it because unlike alot of other shampoos this does not dry my hair and strip it of moisture even while im washing it i can feel the moisture. It also smells great!! Great for curly fine hair</li>
            <li> Smells great and works as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a rip off. You can order this exact shampoo online at walgreens.com for $9.99 or you can buy it from target for $7.99</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never look for another shampoo. Done and done. Makes my hair soft, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! This shampoo, as well as the curl enhancing smoothie and the shine &amp; hold mist, are my holy grail products. This shampoo is very concentrated so you only need a small amount. I take about a quarter-sized amount in my palm, mix it with water, and apply to my hair. The lather that I get is amazing, which surprised  me because it&#x27;s sulfate-free. I get just as much lather, if not more, as I do with a sulfate shampoo. I leave the  product in my hair to absorb, then follow with my conditioner. I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since using this. The difference is noticeable. I can&#x27;t wait to try the moisture retention shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes my hair feel and smell wonderful.  It has the added benefit of being free of parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, just to name a few.  I&#x27;m curious as to why the price is so exorbitant when you can buy this same size at Target or Walgreens (retail and online) for $9.99 per bottle?!  ETA-The question re: price is related to the seller that has this product listed for over $30.</li>
            <li> First washing and my hair is frizzy.  I have not had frizz like this with other shampoos for curly/wavy hair. I have salt and pepper hair, no color or dye and usually loose nice curls. Not today. What a waste of money. Got as a gift from my daughter and gift receipt says it can be reurned if unopened. How would it be possible to know it dries and and frizzes my hair without opening</li>
            <li> This shampoo, along with the Curl and Shine conditioner, leaves my hair soft and shiny and full of bounce.  It lathers great and smells wonderful.  Like all the SM shampoos, it&#x27;s sulfate free so it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair.  I first discovered this shampoo after reading some online reviews.  The SM products are in the African American section in the drugstore so I hadn&#x27;t given them a second look.  However, the reviewer was Caucasian and she raved about how great the SM products were.  I decided to try this formula because I have been trying to encourage the natural wave in my hair.  While I don&#x27;t think the shampoo had any noticeable effect on the wave, it did leave my hair very shiny, strong and full of body.  I&#x27;m a convert!  I also like the SM clarifying shampoo (also sulfate free) the Jamaican Black Castor Oil formula with apple cider vinegar (it smells really fresh and clean).  I go back and forth between these two formulas.  I understand from the reviewer that SM products do not contain heavy silicone.  That is probably why my hair is so light and bouncy.  I have a good hair day nearly every day.  I wash my hair two to three times a week and use the Jamaican formula every third or fourth shampoo to remove product buildup.  I&#x27;m really pleased with the results and will keep using SM.  I also want to try the other formulas.  I heartily recommend this shampoo and the conditioner too.</li>
            <li> Not the same product as what I have purchased in CVS. It&#x27;s a lighter color and doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> I Loved it through transitioning, and now I am natural. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now. First of all this product can eve bought st Walmart, cvs, and target. I usually get mine s from target for $9.99. But if you are for the convince and don&#x27;t want to go to the store, then buy it from here. But I live the way it makes my hair feels and I am 4a hair texture grade. I also love the fact that this product last a long time because you only have to use a small palm full. I have been transitioning since January2014 this year and I just went out and bought this product the other day.(well I was also using the &amp;#34;co wash As I Am&amp;#34;so that stretched this product too I guess). This product  helps moisturize my hair and it doesn&#x27;t strip or Matt my hair while I&#x27;m washing it either, A great detangler. The smell too is wonderful. I will keep buying this product and it&#x27;s definitely worth the money, plus you get your money worth. I just love it.</li>
            <li> i expected this to be gentle but again, like the shampoo in Shea Moisture&#x27;s Raw Shea Butter line (Moisture Retention Shampoo), it was stripping! It wasn&#x27;t AS stripping as the Moisture Retention Shampoo, but still left my hair feeling very dry and tangly. CANNOT use this without lots of oil in my hair. *sigh* i just have no success with Shea Moisture&#x27;s shampoos. At least the smell was nice for this one (unlike the MR shampoo).</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, but doesn&#x27;t have a rich lather, so you need to use more and it did not make my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product I was hesitant to try due to the other product in this line causing my hair to become very dry. ( curl enhancing smoothie) However I am a product junkie, so I love trying new things for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this shampoo, it&#x27;s sweet, and It lasts in my hair. I can&#x27;t really associate the smell with anything other than it smells kind of like coconut. This shampoo also lathers like a sulfate shampoo without actually having sulfates, which I love. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair as much as the African black soap line but there is a slight dryness to my hair after washing. It&#x27;s not the best shampoo for me to use for my scalp (because I have bad dandruff), I get flakes back in my hair rather quickly after I use this but if you don&#x27;t have any pressing scalp issues then I recommend this product. I suggest if your hair is protein sensitive, try not to use it too frequently. (like twice in one week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years. Absolutely love it! Us curly girls need a highly moisturizing shampoo, as our hair is more prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> It did not curl my hair like other curling products I have tried before.</li>
            <li> works fine, but not lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a relative and I Love it.</li>
            <li> My 3b/c hair did not like this at all. My hair is naturally soft and I usually don&#x27;t have a problem with detangling in the shower with just shampoo but this shampoo strip my hair. My hair was a tangled mess even after using a rinse out conditioner and a leave in conditioner. I have used a clarifing shampoo without this much tangles. I&#x27;m glad I purchase the small sample from Target. On the bright side it does clean well.</li>
            <li> My order arrived on time, and this is my favorite shampoo for my thick, curly hair. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores lately, so I was very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Excellent condition! It came very fast and it didn&#x27;t leak or anything. It leaves your hair smelling like the product for a very long time. I have very thick hair and I&#x27;m surprised that I still have not run out.</li>
            <li> Target had samples of this in their travel section- and I&#x27;m SO GLAD they did!  The first product of this brand which I tried was the kids shampoo for dry hair.  It&#x27;s WONDERFUL also, but the kid&#x27;s shampoo scent is natural (orange blossom?) but a little too perfumed for me.  This smells like coconuts and is GREAT.  My 3c curls LOVE to be detangled by my fingers in this shampoo- it has great &#x60;slip&#x27; and my curls feel so soft afterward.  It&#x27;s not clarifying, but it does clean my scalp and hair quite well.  Five stars!   PS- if you&#x27;re wondering about the difference between this and the &#x27;moisture retention&#x27; shampoo, just know that this one smells natural, like coconut desserts and the other smells very much NOT natural and extremely strongly like one of those folks who puts on TOO MUCH perfume. It&#x27;s much to strong to even try, even if it was incredible, I can&#x27;t handle that much scent.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the store has excellent service UNPLUGGED ....</li>
            <li> Smell: Very tropical/beachy. May be slightly overwhelming to those with sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture and quality: Pleased. The formula really hit that &amp;#34;middle ground&amp;#34; adequately; not too thin where you feel you&#x27;re not using enough product yet not too thick where it may prove to be a challenge to massage the product in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: Got rid of the basic build up. Did not dry out my very curly-coily, dense hair at all-in fact I was able to finger detangle my hair with the shampoo still in it! Hair was looking defined and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Top of the line stuff and I can pronounce everything labeled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Not bad for an all natural hair product. This product goes a [long] way. I typically do not need to use more than a nickel to quarter sized amount per section[I wash my hair in sections]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product weren&#x27;t so perfumey I would rate it five stars but this wouldn&#x27;t stop me from repurchasing. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but I wanted to spread the word about how wonderful this product line is. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time and money on many different products that were deemed natural for my sensitive skin and allergies, as well as my concern for safer beauty products. This line is affordable, works really well, is natural, organic and also very accessible. This shampoo smells amazing!!! I also have the sugar scrub that is also wonderful. This is such a better choice for anyone in so many ways. You will not be disappointed. It lathers really nice, you don&#x27;t need a lot ( I have very long hair ) of product and unlike most natural shampoos, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like a wet bird&#x27;s nest! I use the conditioning treatment after the shower. I don&#x27;t even need conditioner anymore. it leaves my hair feeling very soft, very shiny and smelling great and clean. Get it. Now! :) Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have the most unruly curls ever.. I tried this product after long giving up on finding control for them, and to my surprise it brought control to them. Besides that... it smells good, and seems to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It arrived timely and was as expected.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have thick, somewhat wavy hair. I have a couple of allergies that make me picky about my shampoo and have been using this regularly for 2 years. My hair has never been healthier. Of course, I use the conditioner with it as well.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift. It smells good, lasts for a long time, and it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have a mixed baby and this works perfect for his hair</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing but cleansing, not so much. I used this for a few months but it didn&#x27;t wow me. Also, the smell can get old, after repeated use. Would not repurchase, but it is not the worst shampoo.</li>
