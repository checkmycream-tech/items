            <li>Great shaver!</li>
            <li>The best shaver Norelco has manufactured to date.  </li>
            <li>Best electric razor I have used</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaver and washer and he loves it!</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give Norelco&#x27;s best a try, and let me tell you it is a world of difference.</li>
            <li>This product is very good</li>
            <li>Very good razor.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product, great shave.</li>
            <li>Gave to my husband for Christmas, loved it!</li>
            <li>The shaver is awesome; nice close shave and works wonderfully, the cleaning system needs a redesign.  </li>
            <li>The SmartClean system works great.  </li>
            <li>A great piece of machinery.  </li>
            <li>The 9300 is a great value.</li>
            <li>The fact that this comes with a detachable trimmer/sculpter and a nice, high-quality travel pouch is awesome.</li>
            <li>the plus side, the cleaning system is great, and the attachments work well.</li>
            <li>Tugs just a bit at the hair, but after you get used to it, gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I gave this brand another chance.    </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>This is absolutely great shaver.</li>
            <li>Works great if you shave every day.</li>
            <li>Very nice option if it is offered when you order.  </li>
            <li>Now I spend more money to get the &#x27;best&#x27; and guess what.  </li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>if it as any good or not.</li>
            <li>ask me again after 2yrs for this amount of money it should still be a good razor .then</li>
            <li>Razor is good, but system sensate work well</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>it just isn&#x27;t giving me a good shave.</li>
            <li>Buy send one, quite good</li>
            <li>Shaving is very clean, very good</li>
            <li>The shaver works awesome but the clean dock doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>In fact, and greatly to my surprise, it&#x27;s like a light massage on my head that feels great.</li>
            <li>The batter latest around 2 weeks with about a 5 min shave every morning which was great.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy for its outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>I moved on, per thousands of 5 star reviews, to the Braun 790cc top of the line foil type shaver which I got here on Amazon, also for a great price.    </li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>Man, am I glad I did!    </li>
            <li>I have always liked them, and they have always done the job for which they were designed.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaver providing a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is also nice to have and use it every time it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li>The most fundamental thing as one ages is the appreciation of good things after seeing all the competition..</li>
            <li>and it is just as good (maybe better) with this razor.  </li>
            <li>I liked that on the 3D it was built in</li>
            <li>I think it will be nice to have the cleaning</li>
            <li>a try, as it looked like more advanced technology and was an unbelievably gorgeous shaver.    </li>
            <li>Perfectly smooth skin is the result after using this wonderful new shaver.  </li>
            <li>I decided after many years of reliable use to replace my still working Norelco 9160XL shaver with a Norelco with the 3D heads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I think Braun makes a better shaver.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband he love the self cleaning</li>
            <li>I use the trimmer guard on the lowest setting to shave my head, and use the trimmer without the guard to shave everything else (skipping the precious bits).</li>
            <li>Most of all I like the feel of the shaver and the self cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; Feel a lot cheaper than the senso touch 3D for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>The easiest way to love shaving with a â€‹shaver.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the cleaning system is a bit of a gimmick and a way for Philips to sell more consumables (to have another revenue stream), and cleaning the head is much more of a pain than my 7810xl.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a rotary shavers (Norelco) for many years, replacing heads along the way.  </li>
            <li>This shaver by far provides the best and most comfortable shave and that is what it is all about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better shave from an electric razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made sure to go in circular motions, which become rather rhythmic.</li>
            <li>I work my way up  to the sides of my head and then to the top.</li>
            <li>It seems to perform better with 2 or 3 days of growth, but more than that</li>
            <li>I even have the snap on cutter top and that works ok, but not like a pop-out edger.</li>
            <li>Braun shaves better but irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to a friend. :-)</li>
            <li>This style of mounting of the 3 cutters allows for much more freedom in the angle and direction while shaving, which helps to get hairs from all angles.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s wonderful design, but back to the store it went for a full refund (love BBandB!).    </li>
            <li>It wins vs. Braun with Pulsonic Technology.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has an excellent price, $40 less compared to  the Philips Website and this is great</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush is not yet available, I think it&#x27;s a supply and demand issue, but these \\&quot;attachments\\&quot; make this 9500 one of the most usable, diverse, effective, convenient, efficient, and FUN tools to own.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth shave, easy to use the razor.  </li>
            <li>I first started using Norelco shavers because they were reliable and saved time even though the quality of their shaves were not as good as Gillete.</li>
            <li>The shaving/cleaning station did not work and I was able to communicate failry easily with Philps about the process required to return and obain a replacement station.  </li>
            <li>Shave is adequate but nothing amazing</li>
            <li>very good replacement for my old philips shaver, good close shave, nice product and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li>The shaver is very comfortable however it is designed for light beards.  </li>
            <li>I was able to pull the head off this one and put it on my 3D and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>I think time is a more accurate portrayal or description.</li>
            <li>After using one from costco for about a year, I was ready to try another brand (like Philips) because I was not getting a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easier to clean!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say other than the best combination shaver, trimmer and razor cleaner</li>
            <li>It is a gift for my husband, and he really likes it; the shaver itself is very light, feels like no battery inside,the shaver head is exquisite; now my husband uses it everyday, very glad we have it</li>
            <li>The extra value pack is the best deal out right now - look for it if you didn&#x27;t land on it immediately.</li>
            <li>Hands down this was one of my best purchases yet.</li>
            <li>The shave is close, clean, quick, and comfortable - very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The SmartClean system will not run if the light is on.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer and clippers that come with it are versatile and worth making sure you get them.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is fantastic and the cleaner works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply smooth skin for a couple of hours...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s comfortable though.</li>
            <li>Smooth on the skin, no noticeable hair tugging or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>My wife even noticed how smooth it shaved</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that the cheap models that you can get at Costco are anything like this.</li>
            <li>Nice razor better than the other  one I had nice changes to the trimmers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it everyday to clean it for about 14 days and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>You spend $200 on a new electric shaver and should expect a nice shave, not the case.</li>
            <li>To extend the life of the cartridge, I thought about topping off the cleaning solution with Norelco&#x27;s NQ200 Jet Clean solution.  </li>
            <li>For a shave that is as close as two hours away from a blade, more comfortable, and much quicker; I&#x27;m wishing I asked for a razor years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like I said, I shave wet using a animal free brush and the Bigelow shave cream (great stuff).  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and it is very light..  </li>
            <li>The 9300 I bought had a special packaging that also included the Beard Styler/Trimmer -</li>
            <li>a great shave - I shave wet using a Bigelow shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the cleaning system works good solid also when you register razor Phillips extends your warranty</li>
            <li>an additional 6 months cool</li>
            <li>It keeps the shaver clean and lubed and fresh for each shave.  </li>
            <li>Any of the 3D series is a worthy upgrade  in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>And that couple of hours is as close as this electric razor gets me which is tremendous in my opinion.</li>
            <li>With no fear of cuts or scrapes, I create quick circles and listen to the blades cut.</li>
            <li>This may be their top of the line shaver, but it just doesn&#x27;t warrant the high price in terms of shave quality.  </li>
            <li>Then they gave me 50 % off 3 more solutions  which I paid 8.99 normally 16.99 for registering my shaver.  </li>
            <li>This one is great and it does cut closer than my previous razor.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a lot better than a year old 3D!  </li>
            <li>I got an amazing deal on the new Philips Norelco 9500,and with the advanced \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The new V track precision blades really are better and the video on the Philips Norelco site of the head of development in the Netherlands who is describing it is clearly so proud of their new technology, you can&#x27;t help but realize they really did put a lot of research and development into this new model.    </li>
            <li>I get a much better shave out of my 10 year old Braun.</li>
            <li>So far I love it and the carrying case that came with it.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you must know is that if you have never used an electric and this is your first one, you really won&#x27;t find one much better.  </li>
            <li>Got this razor last week as a gift for my birthday, per my request after my own research.</li>
            <li>It really is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has lots of nice features, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it should on one or two passes over the same spot.  </li>
            <li>I spent a good amount of money on this and it should be working.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fairly good razor, very worth buying, although little expensive, but the price is high, the function is all ready, enough to meet all the needs, it is worth mentioning is that the amazon customer service, after-sales service is I&#x27;ve seen the best of the network shopping, is very good.</li>
            <li>I think the 3 speeds are a gimmick, but the high speed works fine.  </li>
            <li>Both attachments simply pop on the body of the shaver and are very easy to remove and reattach, yes you have to put the parts where you won&#x27;t lose them, but, so what?    </li>
            <li>The main body shape is nearly identical and is incredibly comfortable in the hand and maneuvers easily along all the contours of the face.    </li>
            <li>I wish it had a clean only option or a quick clean option.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t continue to enjoy the gorgeous tool, because it was not a good match for my skin type, and I knew I would miss the 3D head</li>
            <li>I rinse the shaving heads in hot water  before using the system.  </li>
            <li>I want to return it and am willing to buy a cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t have this junk with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, but with this, not anymore.</li>
            <li>First timers must use this for about 4 weeks to train your beard.  </li>
            <li>After that it is pretty close shave all the time.  </li>
            <li>On the neck, there was virtually no irritation, but it consistently left many visible hairs (although trimmed to the skin)</li>
            <li>I use the slowest speed on my neck and the middle speed on the rest of my face.. and there is NO irritation at all and gives a more even and also a closer shave</li>
            <li>First here is why I bought this</li>
            <li>I just use the fastest speed for my thick stubble and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Now that was a razor that shaved well, edged well, and did so on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>I had always wanted an electric shaver since I was a young man, but my skin was sensitive and an old dermatologist said wet shaving with a razor was the best way to go for me.  </li>
            <li>and then I really fell in love with the somewhat utilitarian sturdy design of the German masterpiece.    </li>
            <li>My first electric razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1290/42x, which I bought this past May, was the most modern, sleek and advanced razor I had ever seen.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer to dry shave, be sure to rinse the shaver and heads each time and let them air</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got a Philips Norelco Bodygroom which works GREAT at less than half the price, and I&#x27;ve taken to using it to clean up missed hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s told me 4 times so far how much he absolutely loves it!!....</li>
            <li>This razor has the the trimmer as an attachment, like one of the earlier Norelco&#x27;s, it works ok, and does a better job than the 8xxx Sensor 3D little pop-up trimmer that was built in.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a much closer razor-like shave.  </li>
            <li>Gave as a gift and my husband says he really likes it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and price.</li>
            <li>The 7810XL had a great spring-loaded system that worked well, and made sure you never put the shaving heads back in the wrong orientation.  </li>
            <li>Really well made and cleaning is automatic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with the trimming than the shaving.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a sideburn trimmer/shaver as the circles don&#x27;t do so well, but it works really well on the 99% of the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The shave is really close with no scratches or cuts.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t want to shave, I sort of have to shave and I am going to shave.  </li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t do much trimming.  </li>
            <li>That is very upsetting.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak with expertise on the battery life, but the same number of &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; are still showing after a number of shaves, so it is looking ok so far.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t  think it was any better than his 8 yr old basic electric razor.</li>
            <li>The cleaning dock is not just a gimmick as I had first suspected, but rather it return the razor to factory new each day.  </li>
            <li>The container was still half full of CLEAN solution.  </li>
            <li>I got it in the special pack which came with the cleaning system, length adjustable clipper head, and two extra cleaning tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe someone will make a decent razor again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>On one day of growth, it takes so many passes over the same spot to get a decent shave that I&#x27;m back to using my old Braun on those days.  </li>
            <li>Overall, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>After shaving with a blade for many years and nicking myself for about as long, I went back to electric.  </li>
            <li>the 9700 is way more expensive and offers, quite literally, nothing more in terms of value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a necessary system to maintain the shaver and keep it as enjoyable to use everyday as it was right out the box... and, in theory, a well maintained tool lasts longer, no matter what it is.    </li>
            <li>The new 9500 isn&#x27;t as solid feeling as the 8800 was, which had the smooth flat power button and the chrome accents and had a die cast body under the plastic which you could feel the additional weight of while using, but I do feel that the new 9500 is very well made and with the added features of speed control and ability to charge the unit directly via the port more than make up for the things it did not carry over from the previous model.  </li>
            <li>Great shave and far less noisy than my previous razer.</li>
            <li>There is also a facial cleansing brush attachment that is currently not available, but as a former skin care specialist, it is a great additional tool to use frequently to keep you skin</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver.</li>
            <li>Now, on to the new  Contour Detect shaver head assembly.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s replacement head to &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; buyers to get a new razor.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even tell her about the new razor.  </li>
            <li>My father needed a new razor and he wanted a washer with it.</li>
            <li>; light came on after only 20 days of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Phillips razor for a few years and it was time to upgrade to a better one.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, because I really appreciated the prior 3D movement, but have to admit that this is better and easier to use with less pressure applied while shaving which allows for a more comfortable experience.    </li>
            <li>actual razor is great - It&#x27;s just terribly frustrating to have to send back a product that should have worked in the first place...and then have to follow up...and follow up again...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is better then a new 3D</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor for anyone looking for a new razor, but if you have an 8xxx Sensor 3D you might just try the these replacement heads first.  </li>
            <li>I called and they sent a new unit with different heads that flipped open to clean.  </li>
            <li>Blunt the thoughtful and careful in place service, I like the amazon, deep thanks again</li>
            <li>what impress me is that the shaver provides me a even closer shave than a regular blade with no irritating at all!</li>
            <li>This should be an easy design problem to solve with a little thought around the design of the removable tripod piece.    </li>
            <li>Finally, with the 9500 \\&quot;special pack\\&quot; there are two different attachments included!  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe how quiet it is and the closeness of shave after going over my face one time I got the special package because it comes with 3 cartridges 42.00 greener and trimmer and beard attachment I also bought facial accessory from factoryshopoutlet.com for 29.00</li>
            <li>Lastly, the charging cord is exactly the same as my older Norelco, so now I have a travel set and a home set - bonus!</li>
            <li>only my right and simply adjust the razors position in my hand depending on if I&#x27;m shaving the right or left side of my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re definitely paying extra for the whiz-bang digital controls that look cool but don&#x27;t really enhance the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; clearly lists two additional cartridges.</li>
            <li>Unlike my old shaver which snags hairs from my nose and face, this razor never pull hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li>It does take about 4 hours to complete the drying cycle.  </li>
            <li>I had a Phillips Norelco advantage shaver that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>I found that the round heads were spaced too far apart on the razor head and missed more hairs using a similar circular motion on my face.  </li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of Philips Norelco shavers and this is my least favorite:</li>
            <li>far as the hair on my head, it doesn&#x27;t feel as close as a razor blade...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of razors including the Head Blade, nearly every Gillette ever invented, two or three types of Schick,  Harry&#x27;s Razor, and a multitude of disposables and after shaving with a razor blade there&#x27;s no doubt</li>
            <li>As far as seeing it, with out a microscope there&#x27;s no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>It was a toss up between the Braun and the Philips Norelco last May, but I did research and really wanted to give the Series 8000</li>
            <li>The benefits far outweigh that learning curve to remember to keep track of attachments.  </li>
            <li>I may get the SH90/52 replacement head and put it on my old 3D as my travel razor.  </li>
            <li>I am truly surprised on the quality of shaving.</li>
            <li>The cleaning station is complete junk.  </li>
            <li>Even after weeks of use, freshly cleaned, shaving slowly, it just skips right over some hairs.</li>
            <li>But I did get my original purchase price back from them minus tax and what it cost me to ship it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, he has had other norelco shavers this one gives the closest shave</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, other people are having much better results, but... not me.</li>
            <li>Generally, I haven&#x27;t really used my left hand</li>
            <li>Describing how I hold the 9300 is pointless, just know that it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really think the key was for them to have both the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; on a micro hinge as well as the comb shells as well as the entire head itself.  </li>
            <li>I needed to go back over my face with my old foil shaver to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and had a lot of cuts when I used blades on a very short hairs.</li>
            <li>Not sure if you need to clean and lubricate every day.  </li>
            <li>The head falls off when using; no more flip up heads to clean; but now they jack up the price and pawn off a cleaner to &#x27;soak&#x27; the razor in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m liberal with the gel, though that may change as it&#x27;s habit to protect my head from razor scrapes, but the amount I used with a regular razor is what I&#x27;ve used so far with the 9300.</li>
            <li>The entire thing, all parts together, including the SmartClean system are what make this product the complete package of form and function.  </li>
            <li>if the shave was exceptionally better than my old razor, but I actually found it to be WORSE after a few weeks of using it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Charger portion of the base works great, as does the cleaning action itself.  </li>
            <li>Had used Norelco long ago; the new design is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li>They told me they were having trouble with the first one.  </li>
            <li>My only negative comment is if you clean it using tap water some water travels through the razor</li>
            <li>but mine only worked right about one in four tries and often left the razor wet.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great shaver!</li>
            <li> The best shaver Norelco has manufactured to date.  </li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have used</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver and washer and he loves it!</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give Norelco&#x27;s best a try, and let me tell you it is a world of difference.</li>
            <li> This product is very good</li>
            <li> Very good razor.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, great shave.</li>
            <li> Gave to my husband for Christmas, loved it!</li>
            <li> The shaver is awesome; nice close shave and works wonderfully, the cleaning system needs a redesign.  </li>
            <li> The SmartClean system works great.  </li>
            <li> A great piece of machinery.  </li>
            <li> The 9300 is a great value.</li>
            <li> The fact that this comes with a detachable trimmer/sculpter and a nice, high-quality travel pouch is awesome.</li>
            <li> the plus side, the cleaning system is great, and the attachments work well.</li>
            <li> Tugs just a bit at the hair, but after you get used to it, gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I gave this brand another chance.    </li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great if you shave every day.</li>
            <li> Very nice option if it is offered when you order.  </li>
            <li> Now I spend more money to get the &#x27;best&#x27; and guess what.  </li>
            <li> Good shaver.</li>
            <li> if it as any good or not.</li>
            <li> ask me again after 2yrs for this amount of money it should still be a good razor .then</li>
            <li> Razor is good, but system sensate work well</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> it just isn&#x27;t giving me a good shave.</li>
            <li> Buy send one, quite good</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean, very good</li>
            <li> The shaver works awesome but the clean dock doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> In fact, and greatly to my surprise, it&#x27;s like a light massage on my head that feels great.</li>
            <li> The batter latest around 2 weeks with about a 5 min shave every morning which was great.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy for its outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> I moved on, per thousands of 5 star reviews, to the Braun 790cc top of the line foil type shaver which I got here on Amazon, also for a great price.    </li>
            <li> Love this razor!</li>
            <li> Man, am I glad I did!    </li>
            <li> I have always liked them, and they have always done the job for which they were designed.  </li>
            <li> Excellent shaver providing a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is also nice to have and use it every time it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> The most fundamental thing as one ages is the appreciation of good things after seeing all the competition..</li>
            <li> and it is just as good (maybe better) with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I liked that on the 3D it was built in</li>
            <li> I think it will be nice to have the cleaning</li>
            <li> a try, as it looked like more advanced technology and was an unbelievably gorgeous shaver.    </li>
            <li> Perfectly smooth skin is the result after using this wonderful new shaver.  </li>
            <li> I decided after many years of reliable use to replace my still working Norelco 9160XL shaver with a Norelco with the 3D heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I think Braun makes a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband he love the self cleaning</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer guard on the lowest setting to shave my head, and use the trimmer without the guard to shave everything else (skipping the precious bits).</li>
            <li> Most of all I like the feel of the shaver and the self cleaning unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Feel a lot cheaper than the senso touch 3D for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to love shaving with a â€‹shaver.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the cleaning system is a bit of a gimmick and a way for Philips to sell more consumables (to have another revenue stream), and cleaning the head is much more of a pain than my 7810xl.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary shavers (Norelco) for many years, replacing heads along the way.  </li>
            <li> This shaver by far provides the best and most comfortable shave and that is what it is all about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better shave from an electric razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made sure to go in circular motions, which become rather rhythmic.</li>
            <li> I work my way up  to the sides of my head and then to the top.</li>
            <li> It seems to perform better with 2 or 3 days of growth, but more than that</li>
            <li> I even have the snap on cutter top and that works ok, but not like a pop-out edger.</li>
            <li> Braun shaves better but irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to a friend. :-)</li>
            <li> This style of mounting of the 3 cutters allows for much more freedom in the angle and direction while shaving, which helps to get hairs from all angles.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wonderful design, but back to the store it went for a full refund (love BBandB!).    </li>
            <li> It wins vs. Braun with Pulsonic Technology.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has an excellent price, $40 less compared to  the Philips Website and this is great</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush is not yet available, I think it&#x27;s a supply and demand issue, but these \\&quot;attachments\\&quot; make this 9500 one of the most usable, diverse, effective, convenient, efficient, and FUN tools to own.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, easy to use the razor.  </li>
            <li> I first started using Norelco shavers because they were reliable and saved time even though the quality of their shaves were not as good as Gillete.</li>
            <li> The shaving/cleaning station did not work and I was able to communicate failry easily with Philps about the process required to return and obain a replacement station.  </li>
            <li> Shave is adequate but nothing amazing</li>
            <li> very good replacement for my old philips shaver, good close shave, nice product and would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> The shaver is very comfortable however it is designed for light beards.  </li>
            <li> I was able to pull the head off this one and put it on my 3D and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> I think time is a more accurate portrayal or description.</li>
            <li> After using one from costco for about a year, I was ready to try another brand (like Philips) because I was not getting a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easier to clean!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say other than the best combination shaver, trimmer and razor cleaner</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my husband, and he really likes it; the shaver itself is very light, feels like no battery inside,the shaver head is exquisite; now my husband uses it everyday, very glad we have it</li>
            <li> The extra value pack is the best deal out right now - look for it if you didn&#x27;t land on it immediately.</li>
            <li> Hands down this was one of my best purchases yet.</li>
            <li> The shave is close, clean, quick, and comfortable - very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The SmartClean system will not run if the light is on.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer and clippers that come with it are versatile and worth making sure you get them.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fantastic and the cleaner works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply smooth skin for a couple of hours...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s comfortable though.</li>
            <li> Smooth on the skin, no noticeable hair tugging or discomfort.  </li>
            <li> My wife even noticed how smooth it shaved</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that the cheap models that you can get at Costco are anything like this.</li>
            <li> Nice razor better than the other  one I had nice changes to the trimmers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday to clean it for about 14 days and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> You spend $200 on a new electric shaver and should expect a nice shave, not the case.</li>
            <li> To extend the life of the cartridge, I thought about topping off the cleaning solution with Norelco&#x27;s NQ200 Jet Clean solution.  </li>
            <li> For a shave that is as close as two hours away from a blade, more comfortable, and much quicker; I&#x27;m wishing I asked for a razor years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I said, I shave wet using a animal free brush and the Bigelow shave cream (great stuff).  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and it is very light..  </li>
            <li> The 9300 I bought had a special packaging that also included the Beard Styler/Trimmer -</li>
            <li> a great shave - I shave wet using a Bigelow shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I just tried the cleaning system works good solid also when you register razor Phillips extends your warranty</li>
            <li> an additional 6 months cool</li>
            <li> It keeps the shaver clean and lubed and fresh for each shave.  </li>
            <li> Any of the 3D series is a worthy upgrade  in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> And that couple of hours is as close as this electric razor gets me which is tremendous in my opinion.</li>
            <li> With no fear of cuts or scrapes, I create quick circles and listen to the blades cut.</li>
            <li> This may be their top of the line shaver, but it just doesn&#x27;t warrant the high price in terms of shave quality.  </li>
            <li> Then they gave me 50 % off 3 more solutions  which I paid 8.99 normally 16.99 for registering my shaver.  </li>
            <li> This one is great and it does cut closer than my previous razor.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot better than a year old 3D!  </li>
            <li> I got an amazing deal on the new Philips Norelco 9500,and with the advanced \\&quot;sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The new V track precision blades really are better and the video on the Philips Norelco site of the head of development in the Netherlands who is describing it is clearly so proud of their new technology, you can&#x27;t help but realize they really did put a lot of research and development into this new model.    </li>
            <li> I get a much better shave out of my 10 year old Braun.</li>
            <li> So far I love it and the carrying case that came with it.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you must know is that if you have never used an electric and this is your first one, you really won&#x27;t find one much better.  </li>
            <li> Got this razor last week as a gift for my birthday, per my request after my own research.</li>
            <li> It really is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has lots of nice features, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it should on one or two passes over the same spot.  </li>
            <li> I spent a good amount of money on this and it should be working.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fairly good razor, very worth buying, although little expensive, but the price is high, the function is all ready, enough to meet all the needs, it is worth mentioning is that the amazon customer service, after-sales service is I&#x27;ve seen the best of the network shopping, is very good.</li>
            <li> I think the 3 speeds are a gimmick, but the high speed works fine.  </li>
            <li> Both attachments simply pop on the body of the shaver and are very easy to remove and reattach, yes you have to put the parts where you won&#x27;t lose them, but, so what?    </li>
            <li> The main body shape is nearly identical and is incredibly comfortable in the hand and maneuvers easily along all the contours of the face.    </li>
            <li> I wish it had a clean only option or a quick clean option.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t continue to enjoy the gorgeous tool, because it was not a good match for my skin type, and I knew I would miss the 3D head</li>
            <li> I rinse the shaving heads in hot water  before using the system.  </li>
            <li> I want to return it and am willing to buy a cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t have this junk with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, but with this, not anymore.</li>
            <li> First timers must use this for about 4 weeks to train your beard.  </li>
            <li> After that it is pretty close shave all the time.  </li>
            <li> On the neck, there was virtually no irritation, but it consistently left many visible hairs (although trimmed to the skin)</li>
            <li> I use the slowest speed on my neck and the middle speed on the rest of my face.. and there is NO irritation at all and gives a more even and also a closer shave</li>
            <li> First here is why I bought this</li>
            <li> I just use the fastest speed for my thick stubble and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Now that was a razor that shaved well, edged well, and did so on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> I had always wanted an electric shaver since I was a young man, but my skin was sensitive and an old dermatologist said wet shaving with a razor was the best way to go for me.  </li>
            <li> and then I really fell in love with the somewhat utilitarian sturdy design of the German masterpiece.    </li>
            <li> My first electric razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1290/42x, which I bought this past May, was the most modern, sleek and advanced razor I had ever seen.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer to dry shave, be sure to rinse the shaver and heads each time and let them air</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got a Philips Norelco Bodygroom which works GREAT at less than half the price, and I&#x27;ve taken to using it to clean up missed hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s told me 4 times so far how much he absolutely loves it!!....</li>
            <li> This razor has the the trimmer as an attachment, like one of the earlier Norelco&#x27;s, it works ok, and does a better job than the 8xxx Sensor 3D little pop-up trimmer that was built in.  </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a much closer razor-like shave.  </li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and my husband says he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and price.</li>
            <li> The 7810XL had a great spring-loaded system that worked well, and made sure you never put the shaving heads back in the wrong orientation.  </li>
            <li> Really well made and cleaning is automatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with the trimming than the shaving.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a sideburn trimmer/shaver as the circles don&#x27;t do so well, but it works really well on the 99% of the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The shave is really close with no scratches or cuts.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to shave, I sort of have to shave and I am going to shave.  </li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t do much trimming.  </li>
            <li> That is very upsetting.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak with expertise on the battery life, but the same number of &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; are still showing after a number of shaves, so it is looking ok so far.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t  think it was any better than his 8 yr old basic electric razor.</li>
            <li> The cleaning dock is not just a gimmick as I had first suspected, but rather it return the razor to factory new each day.  </li>
            <li> The container was still half full of CLEAN solution.  </li>
            <li> I got it in the special pack which came with the cleaning system, length adjustable clipper head, and two extra cleaning tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe someone will make a decent razor again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> On one day of growth, it takes so many passes over the same spot to get a decent shave that I&#x27;m back to using my old Braun on those days.  </li>
            <li> Overall, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> After shaving with a blade for many years and nicking myself for about as long, I went back to electric.  </li>
            <li> the 9700 is way more expensive and offers, quite literally, nothing more in terms of value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a necessary system to maintain the shaver and keep it as enjoyable to use everyday as it was right out the box... and, in theory, a well maintained tool lasts longer, no matter what it is.    </li>
            <li> The new 9500 isn&#x27;t as solid feeling as the 8800 was, which had the smooth flat power button and the chrome accents and had a die cast body under the plastic which you could feel the additional weight of while using, but I do feel that the new 9500 is very well made and with the added features of speed control and ability to charge the unit directly via the port more than make up for the things it did not carry over from the previous model.  </li>
            <li> Great shave and far less noisy than my previous razer.</li>
            <li> There is also a facial cleansing brush attachment that is currently not available, but as a former skin care specialist, it is a great additional tool to use frequently to keep you skin</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver.</li>
            <li> Now, on to the new  Contour Detect shaver head assembly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s replacement head to &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; buyers to get a new razor.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even tell her about the new razor.  </li>
            <li> My father needed a new razor and he wanted a washer with it.</li>
            <li> ; light came on after only 20 days of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Phillips razor for a few years and it was time to upgrade to a better one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, because I really appreciated the prior 3D movement, but have to admit that this is better and easier to use with less pressure applied while shaving which allows for a more comfortable experience.    </li>
            <li> actual razor is great - It&#x27;s just terribly frustrating to have to send back a product that should have worked in the first place...and then have to follow up...and follow up again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is better then a new 3D</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor for anyone looking for a new razor, but if you have an 8xxx Sensor 3D you might just try the these replacement heads first.  </li>
            <li> I called and they sent a new unit with different heads that flipped open to clean.  </li>
            <li> Blunt the thoughtful and careful in place service, I like the amazon, deep thanks again</li>
            <li> what impress me is that the shaver provides me a even closer shave than a regular blade with no irritating at all!</li>
            <li> This should be an easy design problem to solve with a little thought around the design of the removable tripod piece.    </li>
            <li> Finally, with the 9500 \\&quot;special pack\\&quot; there are two different attachments included!  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe how quiet it is and the closeness of shave after going over my face one time I got the special package because it comes with 3 cartridges 42.00 greener and trimmer and beard attachment I also bought facial accessory from factoryshopoutlet.com for 29.00</li>
            <li> Lastly, the charging cord is exactly the same as my older Norelco, so now I have a travel set and a home set - bonus!</li>
            <li> only my right and simply adjust the razors position in my hand depending on if I&#x27;m shaving the right or left side of my head</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re definitely paying extra for the whiz-bang digital controls that look cool but don&#x27;t really enhance the experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; clearly lists two additional cartridges.</li>
            <li> Unlike my old shaver which snags hairs from my nose and face, this razor never pull hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> It does take about 4 hours to complete the drying cycle.  </li>
            <li> I had a Phillips Norelco advantage shaver that was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> I found that the round heads were spaced too far apart on the razor head and missed more hairs using a similar circular motion on my face.  </li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Philips Norelco shavers and this is my least favorite:</li>
            <li> far as the hair on my head, it doesn&#x27;t feel as close as a razor blade...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of razors including the Head Blade, nearly every Gillette ever invented, two or three types of Schick,  Harry&#x27;s Razor, and a multitude of disposables and after shaving with a razor blade there&#x27;s no doubt</li>
            <li> As far as seeing it, with out a microscope there&#x27;s no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> It was a toss up between the Braun and the Philips Norelco last May, but I did research and really wanted to give the Series 8000</li>
            <li> The benefits far outweigh that learning curve to remember to keep track of attachments.  </li>
            <li> I may get the SH90/52 replacement head and put it on my old 3D as my travel razor.  </li>
            <li> I am truly surprised on the quality of shaving.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is complete junk.  </li>
            <li> Even after weeks of use, freshly cleaned, shaving slowly, it just skips right over some hairs.</li>
            <li> But I did get my original purchase price back from them minus tax and what it cost me to ship it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, he has had other norelco shavers this one gives the closest shave</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, other people are having much better results, but... not me.</li>
            <li> Generally, I haven&#x27;t really used my left hand</li>
            <li> Describing how I hold the 9300 is pointless, just know that it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really think the key was for them to have both the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; on a micro hinge as well as the comb shells as well as the entire head itself.  </li>
            <li> I needed to go back over my face with my old foil shaver to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and had a lot of cuts when I used blades on a very short hairs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if you need to clean and lubricate every day.  </li>
            <li> The head falls off when using; no more flip up heads to clean; but now they jack up the price and pawn off a cleaner to &#x27;soak&#x27; the razor in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liberal with the gel, though that may change as it&#x27;s habit to protect my head from razor scrapes, but the amount I used with a regular razor is what I&#x27;ve used so far with the 9300.</li>
            <li> The entire thing, all parts together, including the SmartClean system are what make this product the complete package of form and function.  </li>
            <li> if the shave was exceptionally better than my old razor, but I actually found it to be WORSE after a few weeks of using it consistently.  </li>
            <li> Charger portion of the base works great, as does the cleaning action itself.  </li>
            <li> Had used Norelco long ago; the new design is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li> They told me they were having trouble with the first one.  </li>
            <li> My only negative comment is if you clean it using tap water some water travels through the razor</li>
            <li> but mine only worked right about one in four tries and often left the razor wet.  </li>
            <li> The Braun shave was much less irritating to my skin but never did an outstanding job all over my face, especially on my jawline, where it frequently, even with several passes over the same area, missed hairs and left a slightly prickly feeling to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange to me that Philip&#x27;s premium line seems to have been less well designed than their older mid-level to low-end line, of which the 7810xl was a member.  </li>
            <li> I had irritations every time I shaved prior to switching to wet and the Bigelow shave cream with the 3D</li>
            <li> I long for the days of Sunbeam and the Shavemaster Groomer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it really never worked properly</li>
            <li> Obviously the time may vary slightly for you an hour in either direction, but for me it&#x27;s 2 hours close to a blade shave; and for the convenience, that&#x27;s close enough in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The on-off switch on the cleaning base seems to be very touchy; easy to turn it on by accident.</li>
            <li> My issue with the cleaning system is that it does not always dry the shaver off after it cleans it.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t always dry off between uses.</li>
            <li> Wont dry, wont charge the shaver.</li>
            <li> If you are a dry shaver and get irritations try using this razor and that cream.  </li>
            <li> In particular, I was also bothered by the underside of one of the razor heads consistently \\&quot;catching\\&quot; on my chin as I used a circular motion around the chin area, causing a very uncomfortable experience.    </li>
            <li> I never really considered it before, but bought the neutrogena sensitive skin shaving cream that uses very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I bought it in march 2015 and less than 5 months later the washer doesnÂ´t work anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very embarrassing to say the least!    </li>
            <li> Even though I do not move the system the SmartClean system does leak a little fluid inside the case and on the counter.</li>
            <li> The razor is just about the same size and weight of the 8xxx sensor 3D - it even fits in the little stand for the 3D but not for charging.  </li>
            <li> Great product but terrible customer service at Philips.  </li>
            <li> I like that it can get wet too, because after I shave, I&#x27;ll rinse off in the shower and just take it in there with me to hit any spots I missed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still soaking wet after sitting for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Although this shaver is expensive, it seems to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I realized that the blades on the RQ12 head were too aggressive for my skin even after the 21 day adjustment period too often left me with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> To understand what what I mean, shave your head with a razor blade, wait two hours, and then run run hand over your head back and forth from the back of your neck to your forehead.</li>
            <li> Edging next to sideburns is not easy either.  </li>
            <li> Every 4-5 times it fails to dry the shaver properly and I go to use it the next day and the head is still wet with cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> And other cleaning systems were messier and harder to use...</li>
            <li> The thought behind making this new model versatile was genius!  </li>
            <li> The motor is not powerful enough for heavy beards.  </li>
            <li> The reason I use the cleaning system everyday is because I found I like to use this razor wet instead of dry.  </li>
            <li> but it will only happen once or twice a month for me and based on past experience with one of Norelco&#x27;s cleaners</li>
            <li> Be prepared to replace heads after one year and spend an extra 50.00 at least.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m saving at least 5 minutes every shave when including the time it takes to shave my face and my head.</li>
            <li> Most mornings I take it off the base and go to use it</li>
            <li> I emailed them (3) times with the receipt while including the required information in the subject line.  </li>
            <li> I can shave from head to toe on just half a charge.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll make a mess.</li>
            <li> and I fear that will have a long term negative impact on the shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband was so excited to get this and was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> I still have trouble in the tight spots around my nose, and no method of shaving will resolve that, but this shaver gives a shave as close or closer than a blade with no discomfort and no bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one&#x27;s just not worth the money, especially with the expensive cleaning and more expensive head consumables when compared to Philip&#x27;s mid-range shavers.  </li>
            <li> If you check the questions for this razor, I asked the customer base about what it&#x27;s like shaving your head with this, their responses were accurate</li>
            <li> Depending on the flow of your hair it can sometimes have difficulty getting few spots close.</li>
            <li> The Braun also took a few weeks getting used to</li>
            <li> the unit itself is dead.</li>
            <li> This has 3 speeds - slow, sort slow and regular - I call them</li>
            <li> My 17 year old Norelco took a crap on me finally</li>
            <li> smart cleaner went bad</li>
            <li> and unfortunately you will have to pay the shipping to send it back to them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really slick looking and is not that noisy.  </li>
            <li> Still works but did not feel like paying 50 bucks for replacement blades that were hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Package was 5 days late.</li>
            <li> High humidity seem to turn on the cleaner -- weird!!</li>
            <li> such a bad razor burn around my neck, it looked as if had tried to hang myself and got rope burn on my neck...</li>
            <li> disappointed, I would buy a Braun if I could go back in time.</li>
            <li> but my husband thought maybe that&#x27;s the way it was suppose to work very slow when turned on...</li>
            <li> So basically it appears that the drier either doesn&#x27;t work well or is broken.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning unit is broken, Philips issued a replacement and now the replacement doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> The SmartClean base is big, but, again, so</li>
            <li> This system is a complicated waste of time and unnecessarily time consuming and expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for an upgrade from my 7810xl which doesnt do wet shaving, but I was disappointed in this razor.  </li>
            <li> Mildly disappointed that you have to change trimming heads to trim sideburns; that was a built-in feature of my previous Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I hate to give this less than 5 stars</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it is a saying that what you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> This can get expensive.  </li>
            <li> To expensive for what you get&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It seems expensive</li>
            <li> And it performs very poorly on the neck area.  </li>
            <li> I picked out this bad boy</li>
            <li> and so I sprung for this bad boy.</li>
            <li> The replacement was about $60 and had tons of bad reviews, so I fell pray to their marketing plan.  </li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used the shaver head yet, I can&#x27;t speak to the cleaning base, but I can say that if you load a cleaning cartridge in there, keep the base level when you move it</li>
            <li> we checked the base and the charger</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The one before this purchase was awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This thing caused my face to break out so I had to send it back. I contacted Philips for the money back guarantee and unfortunately you will have to pay the shipping to send it back to them. But I did get my original purchase price back from them minus tax and what it cost me to ship it.</li>
            <li> Az an excellent choice I recommend for everyone. It is expensive but it is a saying that what you get what you pay.</li>
            <li> Great product but terrible customer service at Philips.  The shaving/cleaning station did not work and I was able to communicate failry easily with Philps about the process required to return and obain a replacement station.  I emailed them (3) times with the receipt while including the required information in the subject line.  I never received a response or an acknowldgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently on hold with Philps AGAIN while they look through the notes.  I have been without a cleaning station for weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual razor is great - It&#x27;s just terribly frustrating to have to send back a product that should have worked in the first place...and then have to follow up...and follow up again...</li>
            <li> I decided after many years of reliable use to replace my still working Norelco 9160XL shaver with a Norelco with the 3D heads.  I immediately noticed a much closer razor-like shave.  Unlike my old shaver which snags hairs from my nose and face, this razor never pull hairs on my face.  Any of the 3D series is a worthy upgrade  in my opinion.  The SmartClean system works great.  I use it after every shave.  I rinse the shaving heads in hot water  before using the system.  It does take about 4 hours to complete the drying cycle.  The &amp;#34;replace cartridge&amp;#34; light came on after only 20 days of daily use.  The SmartClean system will not run if the light is on.  The container was still half full of CLEAN solution.  The solution is suppose to last 2 months.  This can get expensive.  Not sure if you need to clean and lubricate every day.  To extend the life of the cartridge, I thought about topping off the cleaning solution with Norelco&#x27;s NQ200 Jet Clean solution.  Even though I do not move the system the SmartClean system does leak a little fluid inside the case and on the counter.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, easy to use the razor.  Mildly disappointed that you have to change trimming heads to trim sideburns; that was a built-in feature of my previous Norelco.  The on-off switch on the cleaning base seems to be very touchy; easy to turn it on by accident.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend gift good!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I think Braun makes a better shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband he love the self cleaning</li>
            <li> Fairly good razor, very worth buying, although little expensive, but the price is high, the function is all ready, enough to meet all the needs, it is worth mentioning is that the amazon customer service, after-sales service is I&#x27;ve seen the best of the network shopping, is very good. Blunt the thoughtful and careful in place service, I like the amazon, deep thanks again</li>
            <li> This product is very good</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers for over 50 years.  I have always liked them, and they have always done the job for which they were designed.  I don&#x27;t know how, but they always manage to improve the product.  This one is the best yet.  It shaves very close for an electric shaver, and it is very light..  I have yet to try the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Great shave and far less noisy than my previous razer.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for over 50 years.  The one before this purchase was awful.  The head in the wonderful plastic part kept on falling off.  I called and they sent a new unit with different heads that flipped open to clean.  It solved the problem.  They told me they were having trouble with the first one.  Now I spend more money to get the &#x27;best&#x27; and guess what.  The head falls off when using; no more flip up heads to clean; but now they jack up the price and pawn off a cleaner to &#x27;soak&#x27; the razor in.  I want to return it and am willing to buy a cheaper model that doesn&#x27;t have this junk with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had (I don&#x27;t use the shaver head). It has a lot of power (and it&#x27;s adjustable) and holds one heck of a charge. I use the trimmer guard on the lowest setting to shave my head, and use the trimmer without the guard to shave everything else (skipping the precious bits). I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, but with this, not anymore. I can shave from head to toe on just half a charge. I like that it can get wet too, because after I shave, I&#x27;ll rinse off in the shower and just take it in there with me to hit any spots I missed. Since I haven&#x27;t used the shaver head yet, I can&#x27;t speak to the cleaning base, but I can say that if you load a cleaning cartridge in there, keep the base level when you move it or you&#x27;ll make a mess. Overall, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Shaving is very clean, very good</li>
            <li> The picture showing (2) additional cartridges is not what I received. There is no way to handle a problem like this without returning product, agreeing to have your credit card charged again. Just gave up and accepted losing around $ 11.33. \\&quot;What&#x27;s in the box\\&quot; clearly lists two additional cartridges.</li>
            <li> I like what it does and all the extras it has. Good shaver.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment. You spend $200 on a new electric shaver and should expect a nice shave, not the case. I get a much better shave out of my 10 year old Braun. Just threw away $200.</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips Norelco advantage shaver that was 15 years old.  Still works but did not feel like paying 50 bucks for replacement blades that were hard to find.  I picked out this bad boy and I like how it shaves.  Most of all I like the feel of the shaver and the self cleaning unit.  It was a plus it came with 3 extra solutions that you change every 90 days.  Then they gave me 50 % off 3 more solutions  which I paid 8.99 normally 16.99 for registering my shaver.  So far I love it and the carrying case that came with it.  Will update further if I run into any issues.</li>
            <li> The package was leaking when I opened it, so I don&#x27;t know if it as any good or not.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and my husband says he really likes it.</li>
            <li> Nice razor better than the other  one I had nice changes to the trimmers</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great shave. Fast shipping and price. One thing -may want to keep charger / cleaner in different room that shower. High humidity seem to turn on the cleaner -- weird!!</li>
            <li> ask me again after 2yrs for this amount of money it should still be a good razor .then it would be a 5 star</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Easy to use, easier to clean!</li>
            <li> To expensive for what you get&lt;br /&gt; Feel a lot cheaper than the senso touch 3D for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> A great piece of machinery.  I appreciate the close shaves with no damage to my face.</li>
            <li> I hate to give this less than 5 stars but I have to.  The shaver is awesome; nice close shave and works wonderfully, the cleaning system needs a redesign.  My issue with the cleaning system is that it does not always dry the shaver off after it cleans it.  This feature worked perfectly for about a month and now it only works intermittently.  So basically it appears that the drier either doesn&#x27;t work well or is broken.  Most mornings I take it off the base and go to use it and it&#x27;s still soaking wet after sitting for 24 hours.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to rinse off the shaver head twice every time I use it (it cleans with an alcohol solution, not water).  Charger portion of the base works great, as does the cleaning action itself.  Just doesn&#x27;t always dry off between uses.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to love shaving with a â€‹shaver.</li>
            <li> After shaving with a blade for many years and nicking myself for about as long, I went back to electric.  Had used Norelco long ago; the new design is a vast improvement.  I still have trouble in the tight spots around my nose, and no method of shaving will resolve that, but this shaver gives a shave as close or closer than a blade with no discomfort and no bleeding.  Have not used the cleaning system yet.</li>
            <li> Razor is good, but system sensate work well</li>
            <li> Package was 5 days late. The shaver works awesome but the clean dock doesn&#x27;t work at all. Wont dry, wont charge the shaver. 2 star because the shaver does work.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for an upgrade from my 7810xl which doesnt do wet shaving, but I was disappointed in this razor.  In my opinion the cleaning system is a bit of a gimmick and a way for Philips to sell more consumables (to have another revenue stream), and cleaning the head is much more of a pain than my 7810xl.    I would&#x27;ve tolerated all of that if the shave was exceptionally better than my old razor, but I actually found it to be WORSE after a few weeks of using it consistently.  I found that the round heads were spaced too far apart on the razor head and missed more hairs using a similar circular motion on my face.  In particular, I was also bothered by the underside of one of the razor heads consistently \\&quot;catching\\&quot; on my chin as I used a circular motion around the chin area, causing a very uncomfortable experience.    Lastly, I found that cleaning the razor, despite the cleaning system, was actually quite a pain compared to my 7810xl.  The 7810XL had a great spring-loaded system that worked well, and made sure you never put the shaving heads back in the wrong orientation.  The 9000 series heads seem to lack this, and demand that you remember the orientation of the removable circular shaving head tripod when you take it off and replace it.  Failing to replace it in the correct orientation is somewhat obvious as the springs don&#x27;t leave the heads in the proper position, but then you have to guess again which way to rotate the head.  This should be an easy design problem to solve with a little thought around the design of the removable tripod piece.    It&#x27;s very strange to me that Philip&#x27;s premium line seems to have been less well designed than their older mid-level to low-end line, of which the 7810xl was a member.  Unfortunately, this one&#x27;s just not worth the money, especially with the expensive cleaning and more expensive head consumables when compared to Philip&#x27;s mid-range shavers.  I might give the Braun 7 series a go next in my quest for an electric razorupgrade.</li>
            <li> after two months I had to contact Philips for warranty  smart cleaner went bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been puting off the review for about 6 months now.  The first thing you must know is that if you have never used an electric and this is your first one, you really won&#x27;t find one much better.  First timers must use this for about 4 weeks to train your beard.  After that it is pretty close shave all the time.  If you have used electric razors before like me, it may take about 3 weeks like it did for me to it shaving well.  The trimmer and clippers that come with it are versatile and worth making sure you get them.  This comes with the cleaning stand but mine only worked right about one in four tries and often left the razor wet.  It also dripped fluid everywhere.  It got to the point that I stopped trying to use it and figured it was just a crappy design.  Eventually it just kept cycling and I finally called norelco.  Turns out I was wrong.  The one I got was just defective because they immediately replaced it and even gave me the upgraded version with the timer lights.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday to clean it for about 14 days and it works perfectly.  The reason I use the cleaning system everyday is because I found I like to use this razor wet instead of dry.  I never really considered it before, but bought the neutrogena sensitive skin shaving cream that uses very little to get the job done.  It glides well with the razor and doesn&#x27;t clog it. Gives me a smooth shave. You can also use regular foams and even just water in the shower.  Works well either way.  If you prefer to dry shave, be sure to rinse the shaver and heads each time and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent razor.  It seems expensive but you get what you pay for as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I bought it in march 2015 and less than 5 months later the washer doesnÂ´t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It just make noise but doesnÂ´t wash the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the water deposits as often as it requieres.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to replace heads after one year and spend an extra 50.00 at least. Otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The extra value pack is the best deal out right now - look for it if you didn&#x27;t land on it immediately. the 9700 is way more expensive and offers, quite literally, nothing more in terms of value. The 9300 is a great value. My 17 year old Norelco took a crap on me finally and so I sprung for this bad boy. The shave is close, clean, quick, and comfortable - very comfortable. The cleaning system looks legit too. The fact that this comes with a detachable trimmer/sculpter and a nice, high-quality travel pouch is awesome. Lastly, the charging cord is exactly the same as my older Norelco, so now I have a travel set and a home set - bonus!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver. Although this shaver is expensive, it seems to be worth the money. My husband said it gives him the closest shave next to a razor!</li>
            <li> very good replacement for my old philips shaver, good close shave, nice product and would definitely recommend it, this is 3rd philips product</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver providing a very close shave. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> what impress me is that the shaver provides me a even closer shave than a regular blade with no irritating at all!</li>
            <li> I had an old Phillips razor for a few years and it was time to upgrade to a better one. This one is great and it does cut closer than my previous razor. The batter latest around 2 weeks with about a 5 min shave every morning which was great. The cleaning station is also nice to have and use it every time it needs to be charged. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary shavers (Norelco) for many years, replacing heads along the way.  This shaver by far provides the best and most comfortable shave and that is what it is all about.  My only negative comment is if you clean it using tap water some water travels through the razor and I fear that will have a long term negative impact on the shaver.  I know I should use the cleansing stand but sometimes it is just easier not to deal with the extra equipment.</li>
            <li> When I bought this razor I was extremely happy for its outstanding quality. Now, after only 9 months the razor lost efficacy and I used it almost every day with shaving cream. The cleaning unit is broken, Philips issued a replacement and now the replacement doesn&#x27;t work anymore. The razor also lost efficacy, I have to shave with this razor followed by a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, I would buy a Braun if I could go back in time., because you don&#x27;t need your shaver after you finish your shaving routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT 10/10 Shaving Razor. It wins vs. Braun with Pulsonic Technology.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has an excellent price, $40 less compared to  the Philips Website and this is great</li>
            <li> The Norelco will only produce &amp;#34;More of the same&amp;#34; until it gets in contact w the optics folk and get lasers into it&#x27;s design mill, nuf said.</li>
            <li> Really well made and cleaning is automatic. Depending on the flow of your hair it can sometimes have difficulty getting few spots close.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Braun series 7 which was so noisy I chose to wear earplugs while using it as a shaver.  It made my face break out enough to send me to the doctor twice. No idea why.  I have used the Philips for about 10 shaves.  I&#x27;ve never had a better shave from an electric razor and I&#x27;ve been using them for about 30 years.  The Philips is very quiet, shaves closer and does not cause my face to break out.  The trimmer is fantastic and the cleaner works well.  I don&#x27;t know what to say other than the best combination shaver, trimmer and razor cleaner I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Philips Norelco shavers and this is my least favorite: it just isn&#x27;t giving me a good shave. Even after weeks of use, freshly cleaned, shaving slowly, it just skips right over some hairs. Based on other reviews, other people are having much better results, but... not me. I&#x27;ve also got a Philips Norelco Bodygroom which works GREAT at less than half the price, and I&#x27;ve taken to using it to clean up missed hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re definitely paying extra for the whiz-bang digital controls that look cool but don&#x27;t really enhance the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the cleaning system is great, and the attachments work well. I&#x27;m much happier with the trimming than the shaving. And other cleaning systems were messier and harder to use... this one is a snap.</li>
            <li> Tugs just a bit at the hair, but after you get used to it, gives a great shave. I would recommend a sideburn trimmer/shaver as the circles don&#x27;t do so well, but it works really well on the 99% of the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> Got this razor last week as a gift for my birthday, per my request after my own research. I got it in the special pack which came with the cleaning system, length adjustable clipper head, and two extra cleaning tubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m transitioning from blade shaving both my face and my head. If you check the questions for this razor, I asked the customer base about what it&#x27;s like shaving your head with this, their responses were accurate but I will review further on that topic here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, on closeness:&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, I&#x27;ve found that this razor shaves my upper lip and chin area closer than my regular 5 blade razor. It might just be the way the 9300 leaves the hairs, but that area seems smoother than when I shave with the razor blade systems I&#x27;ve tried. It must be the way it&#x27;s cuts on the grain of my hair there as it&#x27;s never been an area I&#x27;ve shaved against the grain with a regular razor. Again, those tricky areas for me are closer with this razor than with a blade. Each face is different though and that&#x27;s my experience with the 9300.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the hair on my head, it doesn&#x27;t feel as close as a razor blade...but it&#x27;s close enough. Often people speak in terms of millimeters and what not when talking about closeness, but to us guys who shave our heads I think time is a more accurate portrayal or description. I&#x27;ve tried the gamut of razors including the Head Blade, nearly every Gillette ever invented, two or three types of Schick,  Harry&#x27;s Razor, and a multitude of disposables and after shaving with a razor blade there&#x27;s no doubt a blade is the closest shave I can get on my head. After blade shaving, my head has no felt &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s simply smooth skin for a couple of hours... And that couple of hours is as close as this electric razor gets me which is tremendous in my opinion. To understand what what I mean, shave your head with a razor blade, wait two hours, and then run run hand over your head back and forth from the back of your neck to your forehead. That length you feel two hours after shaving with a blade is the length you will feel immediately after shaving with this razor. As far as seeing it, with out a microscope there&#x27;s no noticeable difference. It might be .2mm or something, I have no idea, but it&#x27;s 2 hours away from a blade shave. Obviously the time may vary slightly for you an hour in either direction, but for me it&#x27;s 2 hours close to a blade shave; and for the convenience, that&#x27;s close enough in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I shave my head with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;In the shower with Gillete ProGlide Gel. I&#x27;m liberal with the gel, though that may change as it&#x27;s habit to protect my head from razor scrapes, but the amount I used with a regular razor is what I&#x27;ve used so far with the 9300. Describing how I hold the 9300 is pointless, just know that it&#x27;s comfortable. You will find your grip depending on the area of your head you are shaving. Generally, I haven&#x27;t really used my left hand only my right and simply adjust the razors position in my hand depending on if I&#x27;m shaving the right or left side of my head, it&#x27;s comfortable though. In fact, and greatly to my surprise, it&#x27;s like a light massage on my head that feels great. I&#x27;ve made sure to go in circular motions, which become rather rhythmic. I start at the back of my head at the bottom of my neck and work my way up. With no fear of cuts or scrapes, I create quick circles and listen to the blades cut. I work my way up  to the sides of my head and then to the top. The area around the ears that were troublesome for me with a regular razor is now a snap as well. Overall, I&#x27;m saving at least 5 minutes every shave when including the time it takes to shave my face and my head. For a shave that is as close as two hours away from a blade, more comfortable, and much quicker; I&#x27;m wishing I asked for a razor years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy that shaves his head and is considering switching to electric, know that for the guy writing this comment this shaving system is awesome and you should pull the trigger and get this. It really is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to search the comments when doing my research and couldn&#x27;t find any hits for reviews from people who shave their heads with this so I&#x27;m adding some meta/keywords to aid bald dudes in the future:&lt;br /&gt;bald head scalp neck ears crown forehead templesis shaving system is awesome and you should pull the trigger and get this.

            <li> Gave to my husband for Christmas, loved it! Worth the money, he has had other norelco shavers this one gives the closest shave</li>
            <li> You must remember this  A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.  The fundamental things apply  As time goes by.    Perfectly smooth skin is the result after using this wonderful new shaver.  No scratchy stubble to interfere with those kisses!  Whew!  The most fundamental thing as one ages is the appreciation of good things after seeing all the competition.. one often looks for the best!    My first electric razor, the SensoTouch 3D 1290/42x, which I bought this past May, was the most modern, sleek and advanced razor I had ever seen.  I had always wanted an electric shaver since I was a young man, but my skin was sensitive and an old dermatologist said wet shaving with a razor was the best way to go for me.  It was the one toy I couldn&#x27;t have.    It was a toss up between the Braun and the Philips Norelco last May, but I did research and really wanted to give the Series 8000 (Sensotouch 3D) a try, as it looked like more advanced technology and was an unbelievably gorgeous shaver.    Within a few weeks, I realized that the blades on the RQ12 head were too aggressive for my skin even after the 21 day adjustment period too often left me with such a bad razor burn around my neck, it looked as if had tried to hang myself and got rope burn on my neck... very embarrassing to say the least!    I couldn&#x27;t continue to enjoy the gorgeous tool, because it was not a good match for my skin type, and I knew I would miss the 3D head and it&#x27;s wonderful design, but back to the store it went for a full refund (love BBandB!).    I moved on, per thousands of 5 star reviews, to the Braun 790cc top of the line foil type shaver which I got here on Amazon, also for a great price.    The Braun also took a few weeks getting used to and then I really fell in love with the somewhat utilitarian sturdy design of the German masterpiece.    The Braun shave was much less irritating to my skin but never did an outstanding job all over my face, especially on my jawline, where it frequently, even with several passes over the same area, missed hairs and left a slightly prickly feeling to the touch.  On the neck, there was virtually no irritation, but it consistently left many visible hairs (although trimmed to the skin) and I didn&#x27;t feel it got as close as I hoped it would.    I got an amazing deal on the new Philips Norelco 9500,and with the advanced \\&quot;sensitive skin friendly\\&quot; design, I took another chance with a rotary.    Man, am I glad I did!    The new 9500 isn&#x27;t as solid feeling as the 8800 was, which had the smooth flat power button and the chrome accents and had a die cast body under the plastic which you could feel the additional weight of while using, but I do feel that the new 9500 is very well made and with the added features of speed control and ability to charge the unit directly via the port more than make up for the things it did not carry over from the previous model.  The main body shape is nearly identical and is incredibly comfortable in the hand and maneuvers easily along all the contours of the face.    Now, on to the new  Contour Detect shaver head assembly.  It&#x27;s fan-friggin&#x27;-tastic!  Smooth on the skin, no noticeable hair tugging or discomfort.  I use the slowest speed on my neck and the middle speed on the rest of my face.. and there is NO irritation at all and gives a more even and also a closer shave that it&#x27;s predecessor or the Braun.  I really think the key was for them to have both the \\&quot;combs\\&quot; on a micro hinge as well as the comb shells as well as the entire head itself.  This was not a part of the SensoTouch 3D (no comb hinge) and is definitely a step up in terms of ease of use and effectiveness!  I was skeptical, because I really appreciated the prior 3D movement, but have to admit that this is better and easier to use with less pressure applied while shaving which allows for a more comfortable experience.    Finally, with the 9500 \\&quot;special pack\\&quot; there are two different attachments included!  The sideburn trimmer is a DIFFERENTattachment than the beard trimmer, which has a plastic hair guard and is length adjustable.  The thought behind making this new model versatile was genius!  Both attachments simply pop on the body of the shaver and are very easy to remove and reattach, yes you have to put the parts where you won&#x27;t lose them, but, so what?    The benefits far outweigh that learning curve to remember to keep track of attachments.  There is also a facial cleansing brush attachment that is currently not available, but as a former skin care specialist, it is a great additional tool to use frequently to keep you skin deep cleaned and exfoliated.  The cleansing brush is not yet available, I think it&#x27;s a supply and demand issue, but these \\&quot;attachments\\&quot; make this 9500 one of the most usable, diverse, effective, convenient, efficient, and FUN tools to own.  I am so happy that I gave this brand another chance.    The new V track precision blades really are better and the video on the Philips Norelco site of the head of development in the Netherlands who is describing it is clearly so proud of their new technology, you can&#x27;t help but realize they really did put a lot of research and development into this new model.    The SmartClean base is big, but, again, so what?  It keeps the shaver clean and lubed and fresh for each shave.  It&#x27;s also really slick looking and is not that noisy.  The entire thing, all parts together, including the SmartClean system are what make this product the complete package of form and function.  It&#x27;s a necessary system to maintain the shaver and keep it as enjoyable to use everyday as it was right out the box... and, in theory, a well maintained tool lasts longer, no matter what it is.    Have a great Holiday season everyone!</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my husband, and he really likes it; the shaver itself is very light, feels like no battery inside,the shaver head is exquisite; now my husband uses it everyday, very glad we have it</li>
            <li> Very good razor.  First here is why I bought this, I&#x27;ll review it below.  I had/have a 8xxx Sensor 3D and needed replacement blade.  Norelco discontinued the 3D model and changed it&#x27;s replacement head to &amp;#34;encourage&amp;#34; buyers to get a new razor.  The replacement was about $60 and had tons of bad reviews, so I fell pray to their marketing plan.  Now that I have this razor I do like, I think it gives a great shave - I shave wet using a Bigelow shave cream.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is better then a new 3D but it&#x27;s a lot better than a year old 3D!  If you are a 3D user looking for replacement blades, I think you can use the replacement blades for this razor (SH90/52) and save 20-30 bucks, that is what I am going to do.  I was able to pull the head off this one and put it on my 3D and it worked fine.  I may get the SH90/52 replacement head and put it on my old 3D as my travel razor.  The razor is just about the same size and weight of the 8xxx sensor 3D - it even fits in the little stand for the 3D but not for charging.  I do like that the charger does not require the stand.  That makes it easier for travel, just the razor and the charger - no extra stand to lug around.  I do wish it had protective cover for traveling.  Like I said, I shave wet using a animal free brush and the Bigelow shave cream (great stuff).  The shave is really close with no scratches or cuts.  If you are a dry shaver and get irritations try using this razor and that cream.  I had irritations every time I shaved prior to switching to wet and the Bigelow shave cream with the 3D and it is just as good (maybe better) with this razor.  My wife even noticed how smooth it shaved and I didn&#x27;t even tell her about the new razor.  This has 3 speeds - slow, sort slow and regular - I call them I really don&#x27;t want to shave, I sort of have to shave and I am going to shave.  I just use the fastest speed for my thick stubble and it works great.  I think the 3 speeds are a gimmick, but the high speed works fine.  This razor has the the trimmer as an attachment, like one of the earlier Norelco&#x27;s, it works ok, and does a better job than the 8xxx Sensor 3D little pop-up trimmer that was built in.  I liked that on the 3D it was built in but it really didn&#x27;t do much trimming.  The 9300 I bought had a special packaging that also included the Beard Styler/Trimmer - I don&#x27;t have a beard but it keeps my sideburns from getting to unruly.  Very nice option if it is offered when you order.  I haven&#x27;t used the cleaner yet, I don&#x27;t like to recharge batteries unless they are depleted and the 4 hour cleaning process also does the charging. I wish it had a clean only option or a quick clean option.  I think it will be nice to have the cleaning but it will only happen once or twice a month for me and based on past experience with one of Norelco&#x27;s cleaners, the solution does evaporate so I am guessing I will get 4-5 cleanings per solution.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days so I can&#x27;t speak with expertise on the battery life, but the same number of &amp;#34;bars&amp;#34; are still showing after a number of shaves, so it is looking ok so far.  I would definitely recommend this razor for anyone looking for a new razor, but if you have an 8xxx Sensor 3D you might just try the these replacement heads first.  I&#x27;ll update this review if I end up trying them.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat. I hope he continues to use it!</li>
            <li> Great shaver! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This may be their top of the line shaver, but it just doesn&#x27;t warrant the high price in terms of shave quality.  It has lots of nice features, but it just doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it should on one or two passes over the same spot.  I&#x27;ve used it after 24 hours, 48, 72, 96 and a week of growth.  It seems to perform better with 2 or 3 days of growth, but more than that and it starts pulling the hairs.  On one day of growth, it takes so many passes over the same spot to get a decent shave that I&#x27;m back to using my old Braun on those days.  Edging next to sideburns is not easy either.  I even have the snap on cutter top and that works ok, but not like a pop-out edger. Braun shaves better but irritates my skin.  I long for the days of Sunbeam and the Shavemaster Groomer.  Now that was a razor that shaved well, edged well, and did so on the first pass.  If I&#x27;m short on time in the morning, I just go without shaving now.  Maybe someone will make a decent razor again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it really never worked properly but my husband thought maybe that&#x27;s the way it was suppose to work very slow when turned on...then just recently it stopped working we checked the base and the charger and they both worked but the unit itself is dead. I looked into returning it but amazon denied that. So now I am going to try Norelco. I spent a good amount of money on this and it should be working. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband was so excited to get this and was really disappointed. He didn&#x27;t  think it was any better than his 8 yr old basic electric razor. We returned it.</li>
            <li> i gave this to my son for his mid dec. bday......he&#x27;s told me 4 times so far how much he absolutely loves it!!....that should answer all of your ????......LOL</li>
            <li> The shaver is very comfortable however it is designed for light beards.  The motor is not powerful enough for heavy beards.  I needed to go back over my face with my old foil shaver to complete the job.  Not worth the money!</li>
            <li> The best shaver Norelco has manufactured to date.  Works well shaving neck hairs without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have used</li>
            <li> Buy send one, quite good</li>
            <li> This is absolutely great shaver. I was using razor blades for recent 20 years and I just asked my wife to buy that as a gift for me on Valentines Day. I am truly surprised on the quality of shaving. My skin is very sensitive and had a lot of cuts when I used blades on a very short hairs. With this shaver I had no problems with skin at all so far.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend. :-)</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe how quiet it is and the closeness of shave after going over my face one time I got the special package because it comes with 3 cartridges 42.00 greener and trimmer and beard attachment I also bought facial accessory from factoryshopoutlet.com for 29.00 I just tried the cleaning system works good solid also when you register razor Phillips extends your warranty an additional 6 months cool</li>
            <li> My father needed a new razor and he wanted a washer with it. This is an excellent shaver and washer and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I first started using Norelco shavers because they were reliable and saved time even though the quality of their shaves were not as good as Gillete. This system is a complicated waste of time and unnecessarily time consuming and expensive to maintain.</li>
            <li> Works great if you shave every day. Does not handle a 2+ day beard.</li>
            <li> Shave is adequate but nothing amazing and it takes three times longer to get a close shave with this as it does with a blade.  And it performs very poorly on the neck area.  The cleaning station is complete junk.  Every 4-5 times it fails to dry the shaver properly and I go to use it the next day and the head is still wet with cleaning fluid.  That is very upsetting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that the cheap models that you can get at Costco are anything like this. After using one from costco for about a year, I was ready to try another brand (like Philips) because I was not getting a good close shave. However, I decided to give Norelco&#x27;s best a try, and let me tell you it is a world of difference. This style of mounting of the 3 cutters allows for much more freedom in the angle and direction while shaving, which helps to get hairs from all angles. The cleaning dock is not just a gimmick as I had first suspected, but rather it return the razor to factory new each day.  Hands down this was one of my best purchases yet. Worth the money.</li>
