    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great job!</li>
            <li>In theory, a stencil with a handle is a great concept, but this one has some design flaws.</li>
            <li>This tool would be great for someone who likes a thinner brow.  </li>
            <li>This is a very handy tool to assist someone in doing their brows.  </li>
            <li>the concept seems to be good however this doesn&#x27;t really fit my head?  </li>
            <li>One side snapped on second attempt to have perfect browns.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sturdy at all and can easily crack while placing any pressure on it.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work for me, plus the pencils didn&#x27;t really fit even though the edges were sharpened to a point</li>
            <li>Even so, when I placed the product on my face, handle leaning against my nose, and eyebrow stencil across my eyebrows, it was no way near what was a good shape for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I would love to see someone else take a crack at making a similar product and addressing these problems.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would make it easier for me to know exactly where I needed to place the stencil.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are sparse, but I have enough to follow the outline and free hand.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>It really save my time in the morning.</li>
            <li>If you use a eye brow pencil, it&#x27;s kind of messy and doesn&#x27;t line up very well.</li>
            <li>item was difficult to hold while using the eyebrow powder, unable to get a perfect shape, plus it did not look good.  </li>
            <li>product did not fit on my face, would recomend for a flatter wider face for sure.</li>
            <li>It was so far off from my eyebrows that I could.</li>
            <li>very dumb, don&#x27;t fit right and way to big on your face and if used don&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
            <li>It comes in only one shape/size, so if it&#x27;s not a good fit for your face or the type of arch you want, this product won&#x27;t work for you.</li>

            <li> The template does not lie flat enough to draw your pencil across without slicing the tip of your pencil off!</li>
            <li> When my product arrived I was quite excited, which was short-lived because I discovered it to be cracked broken on both ends.</li>
            <li> or I could not complete my review, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who has a dip in the center of their brows deep enough to allow this stencil to rest flush, but not I.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so hard and actually hurts your face when you put it next to your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> BUT IT&#x27;S WAY TOO WIDE.</li>
            <li> It sits entirely on the center with both brow stencils hovering over by a few milometers.</li>
            <li> I have to have my husband to hold it down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good stencil for your eyebrows, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> Template needs a little work.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my face</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money on the product and the delivery charges.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, my brow pencil did not fit in the open space of the tool.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me and were hard to use.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to use and doesn&#x27;t line up with your eyebrows at all.</li>
            <li> I was forced to give this product at least one star</li>
            <li> the brows are too thick!</li>
            <li> I prefer a thicker brow but would recommend this too anyone who prefers thin brows.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it was difficult to get the tip of the eyebrow pencil into the narrower part.</li>
            <li> This makes it move all around and nearly impossible to keep symmetrical.</li>
            <li> This template is horrible.  </li>
            <li> This product was terribly designed.</li>

            <li> The template does not lie flat enough to draw your pencil across without slicing the tip of your pencil off!</li>
            <li> very dumb, don&#x27;t fit right and way to big on your face and if used don&#x27;t look right at all.</li>
            <li> the concept seems to be good however this doesn&#x27;t really fit my head?  Maybe I have a big head but it didn&#x27;t work for me, plus the pencils didn&#x27;t really fit even though the edges were sharpened to a point</li>
            <li> In theory, a stencil with a handle is a great concept, but this one has some design flaws. It comes in only one shape/size, so if it&#x27;s not a good fit for your face or the type of arch you want, this product won&#x27;t work for you. To make matters worse, it doesn&#x27;t rest against your face, so you getting precise definition and avoiding fallout from powder are an issue; you can&#x27;t use a pencil with these either because it will slice into the tip and ruin it. I would love to see someone else take a crack at making a similar product and addressing these problems.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me and were hard to use. If you use a eye brow pencil, it&#x27;s kind of messy and doesn&#x27;t line up very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cumbersome. I have to have my husband to hold it down t the sides, and the brows are too thick! It&#x27;s smaller and looks nothing like pictured. Don&#x27;t buy it, just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This template is horrible.  It did not fit my face and i could not adjust it because of its construction</li>
            <li> product did not fit on my face, would recomend for a flatter wider face for sure. One side snapped on second attempt to have perfect browns.</li>
            <li> This product is so hard to use and doesn&#x27;t line up with your eyebrows at all. The plastic is so hard and actually hurts your face when you put it next to your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was starting chemo treatments and would be loosing my eyebrows.  I still had my eyebrows when I received it so I thought it would make it easier for me to know exactly where I needed to place the stencil.  It was so far off from my eyebrows that I could. Not use it.  I definately would not recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> WHEN I GOT MY PRODUCT IT WAS BORKEN I TRIED TO USE THE UNBROKEN \\&quot;SIDE\\&quot; BUT IT&#x27;S WAY TOO WIDE.</li>
            <li> I was forced to give this product at least one star or I could not complete my review, but the reality is I give it no stars. When my product arrived I was quite excited, which was short-lived because I discovered it to be cracked broken on both ends. I tried to glue it together before using the product. Even so, when I placed the product on my face, handle leaning against my nose, and eyebrow stencil across my eyebrows, it was no way near what was a good shape for my eyebrows. My eyebrows are sparse, but I have enough to follow the outline and free hand. My problem is equalizing the starting point and arch. This product was terribly designed. I feel I wasted my money on the product and the delivery charges. It isn&#x27;t sturdy at all and can easily crack while placing any pressure on it. Additionally, it was difficult to get the tip of the eyebrow pencil into the narrower part. Would NOT RECOMMEND buying this product. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t make these work at all - just tossed them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a couple of bucks but it really doesn&#x27;t work well. It&#x27;s not a good stencil for your eyebrows, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> item was difficult to hold while using the eyebrow powder, unable to get a perfect shape, plus it did not look good.  Would not use this again, or recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really save my time in the morning. It makes my eyebrow look even. Great job!</li>
            <li> This is a very handy tool to assist someone in doing their brows.  Unfortunately for me, my brow pencil did not fit in the open space of the tool.  This tool would be great for someone who likes a thinner brow.  I prefer a thicker brow but would recommend this too anyone who prefers thin brows.</li>
            <li> It sits entirely on the center with both brow stencils hovering over by a few milometers. This makes it move all around and nearly impossible to keep symmetrical. I&#x27;m not sure who has a dip in the center of their brows deep enough to allow this stencil to rest flush, but not I.</li>
            <li> I tried this eyebrow template immediately. Sorry I can draw my eyebrows better by hand. Template needs a little work.</li>
