            <li>This is the best product  ever.</li>
            <li>lol!</li>
            <li>Mint is a great choice!  </li>
            <li>Works great for guestsa!</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon at a great value and couldn&#x27;t pass it up!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!  </li>
            <li>It works splendidly.  </li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of poof and a bottle of just-a-drop, they both are just as effective.</li>
            <li>But if you do at your own risk - be advised: YOU CAN NOT RETURN this thing not for refund, not for &amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34; Hazardous stuff is not returnable.</li>
            <li>The mint fragrance is nice but</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way my bathroom smells after I go poo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product for about 1 year now.  </li>
            <li>Poof is definitely more fragrancy</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product because now no one knows what I just did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;And better yet, at home I put some in afterwards...</li>
            <li>I think the Porcelain product is much better.</li>
            <li>You will be able to travel in confidence again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t keep one for myself, but probably should go ahead and buy more.</li>
            <li>I think if you was to use 10 drops vs 1 you may get better results.</li>
            <li>Significant reduction of embarrassment!  </li>
            <li>It makes traveling so much more easily during those times when you have to go and dont want to embarrass yourself.</li>
            <li>I would truely recommend this product to anyone who has had gastric bypass surgery.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Great product to have when a guest in other peoples&#x27; homes and when traveling.  </li>
            <li>It smell so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Keeps bathroom spelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Aside from the hilarious product name, which I love, this simply works.</li>
            <li>This is especially useful when we travel and have to both use the same bathroom.  </li>
            <li>As for cost - I think it&#x27;s worth the price if you consider how embarassing it would be to be caught off guard without a courtesy flush.  </li>
            <li>Two drops in the bowl BEFORE sitting down to business and when you&#x27;re done, just a pleasant minty aroma.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good and is easy to carry in a small purse.</li>
            <li>I have tried many such products over the years &amp; have NEVER had the positive results that I&#x27;ve gotten with POOF!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a winner!</li>
            <li>Go for it ;-))</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough to block odors but still remains fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very discreet, convenient size to carry with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too much.   </li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it for everyone to keep in their purse and at home.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those awkward situations that&#x27;s occur when sharing a bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is a waste of some rather precious money for a product that doesn&#x27;t cover odor and barely has any odor at all itself.</li>
            <li>smell is fine , dispencer is very hard to squeez , compared to FRESH DROP .</li>
            <li>Get stuck with pretty mint drops that do nothing to the toilet odor.</li>
            <li>Thanks for finally making \\&quot;doing business a breeze!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Do not waste yours.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of these products and this one was the least effective of any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Who wants to go into a public restroom and of course do what comes natural, but then leave and have the next person need a gas mask....</li>
            <li>I like this particular brand over others because there really is NO residual odor if used correctly.</li>
            <li>but I suppose if you were a little more robust with use, it could still last at least 6 months.  </li>

            <li> Toilet Deodorizer!</li>
            <li> That and the average renuzit will run you about $3 - $4 anyway, and we know those are only to mask the same things.</li>
            <li> I wish I found this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> (And if you tend to have butterfingers, be careful lest you drop the tiny bottle into the bowl!)</li>
            <li> One drop, and a little mint smell when various products could achieve that same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> despite the few negative reviews, this really does work as stated.</li>
            <li> Minus one star for this.</li>
            <li> and I know other coworkers are purchasing it also.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the pinhole opening is soooo tiny, you gotta squeeze REAL HARD to get a drop out of it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle is hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> A few drops, and POOF.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing odor left behind for another to experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not by any means long lasting and very expensive for the amount.  </li>
            <li> I have traveled the world over, often in group situations, and I can categorically say that this little bottle contains &amp;#34;Magic in a Bottle&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, POOF is a regular product used throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to leave a bathroom or a stall &amp; feel sorry for the next person.  </li>
            <li> This thing is useless, and TINY for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted at least a year in my house</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I use 2 drops and there is no evidence of bad smell left.  </li>
            <li> it is very hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> but my doctor says this is the worst thing you can do to yourself.</li>

            <li> works like a charm.  This is especially useful when we travel and have to both use the same bathroom.  No more embarrassing odor left behind for another to experience.  I&#x27;ve put one in our guest bathroom, and even in our master bathroom.  I carry one with me in my purse as well.  I like this particular brand over others because there really is NO residual odor if used correctly.</li>
            <li> This is the best product  ever. It smell so clean and fresh I absolutely love the way my bathroom smells after I go poo.</li>
            <li> I wish I found this product a long time ago. It makes traveling so much more easily during those times when you have to go and dont want to embarrass yourself. Just a drop or two and go at it lol! The next person that uses the bathroom will not have a clue. A definitely buy in my book. By the way walter drake has it on sale for $4.99.</li>
            <li> My daughter recently arrived home for a visit from college with a bottle of \\&quot;POOF\\&quot; bathroom deodorizer for me to try. For anyone who has either IBD,Crohn&#x27;s Disease (ME!) or Ulcerative Colitis &amp; spends ALOT of time in the loo, this SPECIFIC product is a MUST! I have tried many such products over the years &amp; have NEVER had the positive results that I&#x27;ve gotten with POOF! It is invaluable for home,when traveling or using public restrooms. IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO! Kudos to the creators of POOF! Thanks for finally making \\&quot;doing business a breeze!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product...It doesn&#x27;t do what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is very hard to squeeze</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product for about 1 year now.  My 3-year-old always reminds me \\&quot;Daddy put the drops in ok?\\&quot;  Needless to say, POOF is a regular product used throughout the day.  It&#x27;s lasted at least a year in my house but I suppose if you were a little more robust with use, it could still last at least 6 months.  The scent is strong enough to block odors but still remains fresh.  Mint is a great choice!  Not medicinal, or chemical smelling at all.  As for cost - I think it&#x27;s worth the price if you consider how embarassing it would be to be caught off guard without a courtesy flush.  That and the average renuzit will run you about $3 - $4 anyway, and we know those are only to mask the same things.</li>
            <li> This product does what it claims. Convenient enough to carry in a brief case, purse, toiletries bag, etc. A must for hotel stays or out-of-town family visits.</li>
            <li> To the people who are writing reviews that this doesn&#x27;t work.. I&#x27;m worried about what you&#x27;re eating..</li>
            <li> It is a waste of some rather precious money for a product that doesn&#x27;t cover odor and barely has any odor at all itself. Just spray the room with Lysol instead.....and flush....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &#x27;odor proof&#x27; but does work for those stinky moments !  Significant reduction of embarrassment!  Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> This product does just as it claims. Very discreet, convenient size to carry with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li> This works!  I no longer have to leave a bathroom or a stall &amp; feel sorry for the next person.  My only complaint is that the bottle is hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> This product was dissapointing for me.  One drop, and a little mint smell when various products could achieve that same result.&lt;br /&gt;It is not by any means long lasting and very expensive for the amount.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  It works well!  I use 2 drops and there is no evidence of bad smell left.  Last along time! I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Works great for guestsa! i just placed on the back of the toilet &amp; they would use it as needed.</li>
            <li> Aside from the hilarious product name, which I love, this simply works. A few drops, and POOF. Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good and is easy to carry in a small purse.</li>
            <li> im giving this the same review as the just-a-drop. I bought a bottle of poof and a bottle of just-a-drop, they both are just as effective. Poof is definitely more fragrancy but it&#x27;s not too much.   our office found a solution to the smelly sprays that were drifting all though our office floor.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I found it on Amazon at a great value and couldn&#x27;t pass it up! I had no problem getting my order through and then the product shipped in a timely manner.  I will definitely replenish this product through Amazon in the future! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Toilet Deodorizer! Who would of thought of something like this. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I never want to relive myself in public restrooms becuase I am embarassed but my doctor says this is the worst thing you can do to yourself. I am so glad I found this product because now no one knows what I just did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And better yet, at home I put some in afterwards... in case my husband comes along and forgets... if you know what I mean. I really like this product and would recommend it for everyone to keep in their purse and at home.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! this is my second bottle and I don&#x27;t go to a public bathroom without it.  Must have!!</li>
            <li> This thing is useless, and TINY for the money. Do not waste yours. But if you do at your own risk - be advised: YOU CAN NOT RETURN this thing not for refund, not for &amp;#34;Thank you!&amp;#34; Hazardous stuff is not returnable. Get stuck with pretty mint drops that do nothing to the toilet odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these products and this one was the least effective of any I have tried.  I think the Porcelain product is much better.</li>
            <li> I would truely recommend this product to anyone who has had gastric bypass surgery.  It will take the fear of going to the bathroom in public places away!  No need to worry if you have Poof with you.  You will be able to travel in confidence again.</li>
            <li> But everyone I gave it to likes and uses it.  I didn&#x27;t keep one for myself, but probably should go ahead and buy more.</li>
            <li> I will swear by this deodorizer.  It works splendidly.  Who wants to go into a public restroom and of course do what comes natural, but then leave and have the next person need a gas mask....I use this at work and I know other coworkers are purchasing it also.  Thanks for a winner!</li>
            <li> Dose not work well at all as promised. The mint fragrance is nice but that it. I think if you was to use 10 drops vs 1 you may get better results. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have traveled the world over, often in group situations, and I can categorically say that this little bottle contains &amp;#34;Magic in a Bottle&amp;#34;! This is discrete and does as promised. I am here to reorder as my bottle is getting low after years of travel (5-7 years of extensive travel.) despite the few negative reviews, this really does work as stated. Go for it ;-))</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Two drops in the bowl BEFORE sitting down to business and when you&#x27;re done, just a pleasant minty aroma. Only negative is the pinhole opening is soooo tiny, you gotta squeeze REAL HARD to get a drop out of it. (And if you tend to have butterfingers, be careful lest you drop the tiny bottle into the bowl!) Perhaps if they enlarged the opening just a wee bit, it would be easier to get your two drops. Minus one star for this.</li>
            <li> smell is fine , dispencer is very hard to squeez , compared to FRESH DROP .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does. Perfect for those awkward situations that&#x27;s occur when sharing a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Great product to have when a guest in other peoples&#x27; homes and when traveling.  Keeps bathroom spelling fresh and clean.</li>
