            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works when it is warm out.</li>
            <li>This kind has a \\&quot;pastier\\&quot; or \\&quot;tackier\\</li>
            <li>It coats my hands with some kind of protectorant and makes them feel shielded from the elements.</li>
            <li>I was using different types of hand creams, but since I got this one was great choice very good cream.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hand cream/lotion that I have purchased without a prescription.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best discovery I have made!</li>
            <li>It also has a very light smell and not to overly fragrant like some hand creams can be.</li>
            <li>It penetrates easily but also keeps a nice barrier on the skin to trap in moisture.</li>
            <li>soft hand keeping for night and day very good products I will order more</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>So many, if not all say \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for adding moisture to hands, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is the most ungreasy lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, and i will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product I would buy it again</li>
            <li>He love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>This one has a flip cap which I think is better.</li>
            <li>This cream is more like my face cream and doesn&#x27;t seem to  moisturize as well.  </li>
            <li>Appearently it was recommended by many professionals who use their hand to deal with paper, cards, and anything that absorbs the moisture from their hands a lot.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t tolerate the medicinal or flowery smells they put in most hand cream, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>I have not found a product that works better for my uses and needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but I will not reorder.</li>
            <li>I used this magic lotion for two days.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite product and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>This cream is \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; but not like most hand creams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again though, because it&#x27;s one of the better lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have eczema, and to top it off, I work at a daycare</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply for many hours with this lotion.</li>
            <li>So glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>I put this on at the end of the day as I settle down for the nite and read until I drop off to sleep,,, For me it&#x27;s the best time to apply &amp; reapply as needed to help nourish, restore &amp; beautify your hands, elbows, knees &amp; feet - I love it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using gloves to clean the house, gloves to keep my hands warm in winter</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its not expensive and for the price lasts a while and works good.</li>
            <li>One of the best I&#x27;ve ever found for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>Most go on \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and wear off very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The best for dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li>Have finished the tube already and quite happy with the product - good hand moisturizer, a bit greasy but got absorbed quickly, definitely made my hands softer.  </li>
            <li>Smells lightly and ok for me.</li>
            <li>I really love it, it feels silky smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, not a lot is needed to cover your skin.</li>
            <li>Does not wash off easily as well.</li>
            <li>This is very good for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li>While this product is no cure, it is the best by far for keeping my skin moist and soft.  </li>
            <li>When I put it on my skin it kind of becomes thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and silky; not greasy.</li>
            <li>Husband appreciates the aroma free feature of this cream.</li>
            <li>Funny thing is it took me many months to try using it -</li>
            <li>Uncheap stiff but def worthy - great !!!!</li>
            <li>Great hand cream, removes a lot of irritation from dry skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry hands.</li>
            <li>Nice hand lotion... makes my hands look smooth and young</li>
            <li>Great product for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I was swayed by the many positive reviews of this product, but I now have a suspicious feeling they were all written by Avon representatives...</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant, and the formula has a wonderful consistency, absorbed SO well that it only takes a tiny bit to completely saturate your skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m good to go back to my computer keyboard in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for helping me find more.  </li>
            <li>Very effective for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>ABSORBS REALLY QUICK.</li>
            <li>My fingers quickly become cracked.</li>
            <li>I think why this cream lasts longer than most is because of the high glycerin content which is why the glycerin-Bay Rum mixture seemed to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>It gets absorbed in the skin really quickly and keeps my hands moisturized for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I am really happy with buying this hand lotion, you need just a little bit</li>
            <li>Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need much of the product or I would never have the patience to fight the packaging.</li>
            <li>It is more of an ointment, we slather it on before bed and have soft hands all winter..</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and is not strongly scented.</li>
            <li>There are so many lotions out there that are great for a few minutes, but they don&#x27;t alter the texture of your skin and they don&#x27;t have a lasting effect after handwashing.</li>
            <li>About two or three pea-sized drops is more than enough to moisturize my hands for hours.</li>
            <li>and my hands have been soft and fabulous for months.</li>
            <li>A Much needed lotion!</li>
            <li>I tried this product after going thru my Niece&#x27;s things after her sudden death and fell in love with this.  </li>
            <li>This item takes almost a month to get to me,i almost forget i even ordered it,not really sure if it works,because of the long wait for arrival i bought another hand theraphy.</li>
            <li>only reason I am not seeking a return is that it would cost me more to ship it back than what I originally paid for it (about $4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes which seem to dry out my hands even more.  </li>
            <li>I put this cream on the first thing I arrive at work and before noon, my fingers are back to feeling smooth again.</li>
            <li>Requires small amount and does an excellent job, especially for someone who washes their hands frequently at work.</li>
            <li>Avon claims to have made it &#x27;fragrance free&#x27;, but instead of having /no/ fragrance it smells like chemicals and, oddly enough, yeast.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hands silky smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li>Found the big tube on here and ounce for ounce it was as cheap as the flea market size I bought.</li>
            <li>He has found absolutely nothing that compares with this product.  </li>
            <li>Buy a tube and get ready to experience GREATNESS.</li>
            <li>Much cheeper through avon</li>
            <li>It really soaks in and stays with you.  </li>
            <li>I was given numerous doses of steriods to clear my skin which dehydrated my body even more.</li>
            <li>Of course, prescription ointments work better for my eczema spots, but for just &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; dry skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had  actually never used Avon products before and was very surprised to find this hand cream so good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to last most of the day with only one application per day.  </li>
            <li>I would say its more for &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; - but only for 3 hours tops - my hands &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; like they had renewed moisture, but then after that third hour the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; characteristics began to reappear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that is able to heal my finger cracks in short order.</li>
            <li>This is great, slightly greasy but I add a slight drop of lotion with it.  </li>
            <li>My family and I can&#x27;t live without this hand cream.</li>
            <li>Being a clean freak, I wash my hands a lot in addition to doing all the packing and handling rough boxes.</li>
            <li>By morning it is not really noticeable but the \\&quot;protective layer\\&quot; seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and last time I&#x27;ll buy the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried is soaked up within seconds and my hands are dry again immediately.</li>
            <li>Worked just ok though, and due to the odor, I simply couldn&#x27;t use it (ended up throwing it out).</li>
            <li>This lotion doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and after a few minutes it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery in my hands.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 20 years and  there is nothing better for callus feet or rough dry hands,  </li>
            <li>Ordered it last year and still have more than half the tube because I just don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li>This is a really good hand cream, not so expensive, but very useful, it&#x27;s pretty thick and recover your skin.</li>
            <li>This hand cream makes my hands feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This lotion seems to last a lot longer after just one application and it doesn&#x27;t require as much product with each application.</li>
            <li>The old formula had orange roughy fish oil.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands soft and sealed but not greasy.</li>
            <li>This cream is very rich and definitely helps my dry, dry hands.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is nothing short of supernatural.</li>
            <li>This hand lotion works very well on dry hands and has a soft, calming scent.</li>
            <li>Not to knock dear Avon, but it&#x27;s surprising that such an inexpensive brand has harnessed the sought-after secret of silky skin when no other moisturizer on Earth can compare (and, believe me, as a cosmetics junkie I have a VAST frame of reference).</li>
            <li>Incredibly moisturizing,especially in the bitter cold temps of winter.</li>
            <li>It does take a while to completely absorb into the skin, but I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I have never been complimented on soft hands in my entire life until I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with severly dry hands.</li>
            <li>This is the only hand cream that really helps with my excessively dry hands.</li>
            <li>Most lotions are thin and watery and don&#x27;t last, but not this lotion.</li>
            <li>traditional lotions absorbed within a few min, and this one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have little cracks on my thumbs right next to the nail bed</li>
            <li>A little sticky at first</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky in the first 30 seconds, but is not sticky at all after it dries.</li>
            <li>I live at 7,300 feet in the mountains and talk about dry skin!</li>
            <li>new formula doesn&#x27;t last as long after washing your hands, but is fragrance free and is still thick enough that you only need less than a pea-sized dollop to do your hands, so it&#x27;s going to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>This cream isn&#x27;t nearly as moisturising and does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently because of my baby, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>My hands get extremly dry during the winter and this is the only lotion that keeps my hands soft.</li>

            <li> I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li> I put this on at the end of the day as I settle down for the nite and read until I drop off to sleep,,, For me it&#x27;s the best time to apply &amp; reapply as needed to help nourish, restore &amp; beautify your hands, elbows, knees &amp; feet - I love it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gloves to clean the house, gloves to keep my hands warm in winter</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its not expensive and for the price lasts a while and works good.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve ever found for extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Most go on \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and wear off very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The best for dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Have finished the tube already and quite happy with the product - good hand moisturizer, a bit greasy but got absorbed quickly, definitely made my hands softer.  </li>
            <li> Smells lightly and ok for me.</li>
            <li> I really love it, it feels silky smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, not a lot is needed to cover your skin.</li>
            <li> Does not wash off easily as well.</li>
            <li> This is very good for extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li> While this product is no cure, it is the best by far for keeping my skin moist and soft.  </li>
            <li> When I put it on my skin it kind of becomes thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and silky; not greasy.</li>
            <li> Husband appreciates the aroma free feature of this cream.</li>
            <li> Funny thing is it took me many months to try using it -</li>
            <li> Uncheap stiff but def worthy - great !!!!</li>
            <li> Great hand cream, removes a lot of irritation from dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Nice hand lotion... makes my hands look smooth and young</li>
            <li> Great product for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the many positive reviews of this product, but I now have a suspicious feeling they were all written by Avon representatives...</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant, and the formula has a wonderful consistency, absorbed SO well that it only takes a tiny bit to completely saturate your skin.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m good to go back to my computer keyboard in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for helping me find more.  </li>
            <li> Very effective for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> ABSORBS REALLY QUICK.</li>
            <li> My fingers quickly become cracked.</li>
            <li> I think why this cream lasts longer than most is because of the high glycerin content which is why the glycerin-Bay Rum mixture seemed to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> It gets absorbed in the skin really quickly and keeps my hands moisturized for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with buying this hand lotion, you need just a little bit</li>
            <li> Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need much of the product or I would never have the patience to fight the packaging.</li>
            <li> It is more of an ointment, we slather it on before bed and have soft hands all winter..</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and is not strongly scented.</li>
            <li> There are so many lotions out there that are great for a few minutes, but they don&#x27;t alter the texture of your skin and they don&#x27;t have a lasting effect after handwashing.</li>
            <li> About two or three pea-sized drops is more than enough to moisturize my hands for hours.</li>
            <li> and my hands have been soft and fabulous for months.</li>
            <li> A Much needed lotion!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after going thru my Niece&#x27;s things after her sudden death and fell in love with this.  </li>
            <li> This item takes almost a month to get to me,i almost forget i even ordered it,not really sure if it works,because of the long wait for arrival i bought another hand theraphy.</li>
            <li> only reason I am not seeking a return is that it would cost me more to ship it back than what I originally paid for it (about $4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes which seem to dry out my hands even more.  </li>
            <li> I put this cream on the first thing I arrive at work and before noon, my fingers are back to feeling smooth again.</li>
            <li> Requires small amount and does an excellent job, especially for someone who washes their hands frequently at work.</li>
            <li> Avon claims to have made it &#x27;fragrance free&#x27;, but instead of having /no/ fragrance it smells like chemicals and, oddly enough, yeast.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hands silky smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> Found the big tube on here and ounce for ounce it was as cheap as the flea market size I bought.</li>
            <li> He has found absolutely nothing that compares with this product.  </li>
            <li> Buy a tube and get ready to experience GREATNESS.</li>
            <li> Much cheeper through avon</li>
            <li> It really soaks in and stays with you.  </li>
            <li> I was given numerous doses of steriods to clear my skin which dehydrated my body even more.</li>
            <li> Of course, prescription ointments work better for my eczema spots, but for just &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; dry skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had  actually never used Avon products before and was very surprised to find this hand cream so good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to last most of the day with only one application per day.  </li>
            <li> I would say its more for &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; - but only for 3 hours tops - my hands &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; like they had renewed moisture, but then after that third hour the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; characteristics began to reappear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that is able to heal my finger cracks in short order.</li>
            <li> This is great, slightly greasy but I add a slight drop of lotion with it.  </li>
            <li> My family and I can&#x27;t live without this hand cream.</li>
            <li> Being a clean freak, I wash my hands a lot in addition to doing all the packing and handling rough boxes.</li>
            <li> By morning it is not really noticeable but the \\&quot;protective layer\\&quot; seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I&#x27;ll buy the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried is soaked up within seconds and my hands are dry again immediately.</li>
            <li> Worked just ok though, and due to the odor, I simply couldn&#x27;t use it (ended up throwing it out).</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and after a few minutes it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery in my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years and  there is nothing better for callus feet or rough dry hands,  </li>
            <li> Ordered it last year and still have more than half the tube because I just don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> This is a really good hand cream, not so expensive, but very useful, it&#x27;s pretty thick and recover your skin.</li>
            <li> This hand cream makes my hands feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to last a lot longer after just one application and it doesn&#x27;t require as much product with each application.</li>
            <li> The old formula had orange roughy fish oil.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands soft and sealed but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream is very rich and definitely helps my dry, dry hands.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is nothing short of supernatural.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion works very well on dry hands and has a soft, calming scent.</li>
            <li> Not to knock dear Avon, but it&#x27;s surprising that such an inexpensive brand has harnessed the sought-after secret of silky skin when no other moisturizer on Earth can compare (and, believe me, as a cosmetics junkie I have a VAST frame of reference).</li>
            <li> Incredibly moisturizing,especially in the bitter cold temps of winter.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to completely absorb into the skin, but I would definitely recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I have never been complimented on soft hands in my entire life until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with severly dry hands.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream that really helps with my excessively dry hands.</li>
            <li> Most lotions are thin and watery and don&#x27;t last, but not this lotion.</li>
            <li> traditional lotions absorbed within a few min, and this one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have little cracks on my thumbs right next to the nail bed</li>
            <li> A little sticky at first</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky in the first 30 seconds, but is not sticky at all after it dries.</li>
            <li> I live at 7,300 feet in the mountains and talk about dry skin!</li>
            <li> new formula doesn&#x27;t last as long after washing your hands, but is fragrance free and is still thick enough that you only need less than a pea-sized dollop to do your hands, so it&#x27;s going to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> This cream isn&#x27;t nearly as moisturising and does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently because of my baby, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> My hands get extremly dry during the winter and this is the only lotion that keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this same hand cream with an older formula that would last after a few hand washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Corn Huskers as well as a few other well known types that worked with some success.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and especially during winter times, my hands get very dry.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hand and my hands have been extremely dry lately.</li>
            <li> But once i used it, i realized that it actually soaks up in the skin pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant stickiness or greasiness at all.</li>
            <li> that mixed with regular hand use, and they get all dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> This cream left my hands soft and has helped cut down on my cracking and dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Apply to callused, white flaking heels and dry toes every night after bathing.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY hand cream that after using for a week or so noticeably improved my hands&#x27; dry skin and thinning and cracking skin on the finger tips.</li>
            <li> the product is the ONLY thing that keeps my dry feet moisturized throughout the day!  </li>
            <li> The only other lotion I&#x27;ve found that rivals this is Avon Wintersoft, but that lotion was discontinued several  years ago.</li>
            <li> At that time the cream was much thicker, more like a Vaseline base and always worked well with my extremely dry hands.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands and/or using hand sanitizer, so my hands are very very very dry.</li>
            <li> This hand cream keeps my hands moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product since the late 70s, but the new formula is drastically different.</li>
            <li> I have put other creams over night and nothing helped -- I would still wake up in the morning and my fingers would still be chapped and coarse and they would hurt when I wash them.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hands at least 20 times a day (and I live in Ohio, brr!).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very long to sink in either</li>
            <li> K Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Hand Cream for Extremely Dry Skin]]</li>
            <li> I usually buy direct from Avon</li>
            <li> I usually use this cream before bed and 2-3 times during the day, and my hands are unbelievably soft all the time, despite all my handwashing and Purell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a dry crack in my hands all winter!</li>
            <li> I would reccommend this hand lotion to anyone who has extremely dry hands!</li>
            <li> It save my hands, my feet and even my face that was very dry.</li>
            <li> so my hands get very dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps with very dry hands.</li>
            <li> , I only wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> Because it WORKS on painfully dry hands due to work or weather wear.</li>
            <li> It feels like this lotion really sinks in and stays on your hands.</li>
            <li> All of the cleansing leaves my hands dry and hard, but no more than a pea size amount of this will completely replenish the moisture for my entire 6-8hr shift.</li>
            <li> The lotion is long lasting and thick like I want/need it to be as I wash my hands often throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is very thick and sticky and hard to spread comparing to other creams, but the stickiness is gone quickly.</li>
            <li> they get extremely cracked and sry</li>
            <li> I compare all other hand creams to this one.</li>
            <li> Someone had given me a small tube last yr</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that this is not the cream that I seem to remember from the days when I bought lots of Avon products.  </li>
            <li> Thick enough and does not leave my hands feeling sticky like a lot of other lotions do.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried other creams that have failed them.</li>
            <li> Gets a little iffy if you run your hands under water, but just re-apply it.</li>
            <li> at first it took so sticky and unpleasant to touch</li>
            <li> so I wash my hands probably 10 times per day with harsh liquid soap.</li>
            <li> It felt like Vaseline, and has no scent, but heavy.  </li>
            <li> and I usually get deep painful cuts in my right thumb especially, several times during the cold months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream because I have extremely dry hands, and during winter they are worse.  </li>
            <li> I bought a small purse size tube of this at a flea market.</li>
            <li> I miss the small travel size though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like using hand lotion because I&#x27;m a guy</li>
            <li> cream is very heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> My friend is a truck driver and was having a hard time finding lotion that would retain moister.</li>
            <li> I recommend for those hard work hands</li>
            <li> It has a thick texture that melts in your hands as you begin to rub it in.</li>
            <li> This one did NOT work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it will not work for you.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad round of cracked, bleeding dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Found it less expensive to order largest size through an Amazon distributor vs an Avon rep.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry, even the palms, in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> About five years ago, I started using this product because my hands would crack from cold weather, soap or other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product because the ingredients have changed since I last ordered it, quite awhile ago.  </li>
            <li> I work next to a loading dock so it is very cold</li>
            <li> Difficult to find these days.</li>

            <li> Terrible chemical &amp;#34;masking&amp;#34; type smell...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my fingertips and palms.  While this product is no cure, it is the best by far for keeping my skin moist and soft.  I have tried dozens of much more expensive lotions, and creams and none has come close to performing like this product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands especially in the winter. This hand cream absorbs well into my skin and softens and heals the cracks and redness in my hands.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the many positive reviews of this product, but I now have a suspicious feeling they were all written by Avon representatives...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very heavy and oily. When I put it on my skin it kind of becomes thicker and doesn&#x27;t absorb very well. The scent is very unpleasant. Smells a bit like a hospital room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am not seeking a return is that it would cost me more to ship it back than what I originally paid for it (about $4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended at all. And I suggest Amazon investigate all these glowing reviews. I just can&#x27;t imagine anyone would be so in love with this product. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and have tried numerous products over the years.  This is by far the best hand cream/lotion that I have purchased without a prescription.  It doesn&#x27;t have perfumes which seem to dry out my hands even more.  Of course, prescription ointments work better for my eczema spots, but for just &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; dry skin, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible chemical &amp;#34;masking&amp;#34; type smell... Worked just ok though, and due to the odor, I simply couldn&#x27;t use it (ended up throwing it out).</li>
            <li> About five years ago, I started using this product because my hands would crack from cold weather, soap or other chemicals.  I&#x27;ve been using gloves to clean the house, gloves to keep my hands warm in winter and I&#x27;ve been applying this daily all year.  It does a great job and is not strongly scented.</li>
            <li> This hand cream makes my hands feel soft and moisturized. But wish Avon would remove the undesirable ingredients from this product.</li>
            <li> worked really good on hands</li>
            <li> So many, if not all say \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot;    They use an \\&quot;alternate truth\\&quot;.  It might moisterize, but I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Apply to callused, white flaking heels and dry toes every night after bathing.  All your calluses will disappear within weeks. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for over 10 years. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Incredibly moisturizing,especially in the bitter cold temps of winter.My hands love it !!!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and especially during winter times, my hands get very dry. My job requires me to use sanitizing soap often, and that mixed with regular hand use, and they get all dry and cracked. this stuff is what my mother used to always use, and I remember growing up using this brand it it working well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not expensive and for the price lasts a while and works good.</li>
            <li> This is great, slightly greasy but I add a slight drop of lotion with it.  It&#x27;s perfect for adding moisture to hands, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I am constantly washing my hands and/or using hand sanitizer, so my hands are very very very dry. My hands would absorb regular lotion as if I hadn&#x27;t used any. About two or three pea-sized drops is more than enough to moisturize my hands for hours.</li>
            <li> My hands are constantly needing lotion during the winter months and pretty much everything I&#x27;ve tried is soaked up within seconds and my hands are dry again immediately. This lotion seems to last a lot longer after just one application and it doesn&#x27;t require as much product with each application. It is an excellent hand cream for the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hand cream because I have extremely dry hands, and during winter they are worse.  This cream left my hands soft and has helped cut down on my cracking and dry patches. It does take a while to completely absorb into the skin, but I would definitely recommend this product.  It also has a very light smell and not to overly fragrant like some hand creams can be.</li>
            <li> Avon claims to have made it &#x27;fragrance free&#x27;, but instead of having /no/ fragrance it smells like chemicals and, oddly enough, yeast. It is disgusting. I only just received my order today, and after one hesitant use will go about returning it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream.  Leaves your hands silky smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> The product I remembered it to be! The lotion is long lasting and thick like I want/need it to be as I wash my hands often throughout the day.  Most lotions are thin and watery and don&#x27;t last, but not this lotion. It&#x27;s smooth and silky; not greasy.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS ON HANDS FEET ETC. AND IS REALLY GREAT WHEN YOU NEED MORE THAN JUST EVERY DAY LOTION.  ABSORBS REALLY QUICK.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this on Amazon.  This is the only hand lotion that I like to use.  Thick enough and does not leave my hands feeling sticky like a lot of other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a dry crack in my hands all winter! I work next to a loading dock so it is very cold and I usually get deep painful cuts in my right thumb especially, several times during the cold months. I use this product every night before I go to bed and my hands have been soft and fabulous for months. I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from cracked chapped skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works when it is warm out. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My family and I can&#x27;t live without this hand cream. It is more of an ointment, we slather it on before bed and have soft hands all winter..Pittsburgh winter!! One by every bedside table. Great on heels as well.</li>
            <li> Have finished the tube already and quite happy with the product - good hand moisturizer, a bit greasy but got absorbed quickly, definitely made my hands softer.  Smells lightly and ok for me. The delivery was speedy. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream, removes a lot of irritation from dry skin. Gets a little iffy if you run your hands under water, but just re-apply it.</li>
            <li> Incredible hand cream. Since I tried it i don&#x27;t want to use anything else.Funny thing is it took me many months to try using it - at first it took so sticky and unpleasant to touch so i thought it would feel like putting vaseline on you hands - sticky and greasy. But once i used it, i realized that it actually soaks up in the skin pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant stickiness or greasiness at all. This is the ONLY hand cream that after using for a week or so noticeably improved my hands&#x27; dry skin and thinning and cracking skin on the finger tips.</li>
            <li> I bought a small purse size tube of this at a flea market. Loved it. Found the big tube on here and ounce for ounce it was as cheap as the flea market size I bought. It is the most ungreasy lotion I have ever used. It has fish oil in it so that must make the difference. I really love it, it feels silky smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> my mom is a floral designer and she is constantly washing her hands nad they get extremely cracked and sry this is the only thing that works for her because its not oily adn dosnt leave a  film behin when u put it on also you dont have to keep adding cream to your hands it does the job!</li>
            <li> I am in the process of moving. Being a clean freak, I wash my hands a lot in addition to doing all the packing and handling rough boxes. My fingers quickly become cracked. I have put other creams over night and nothing helped -- I would still wake up in the morning and my fingers would still be chapped and coarse and they would hurt when I wash them. Well. Not any more. I put this cream on the first thing I arrive at work and before noon, my fingers are back to feeling smooth again. This is truly magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is very thick and sticky and hard to spread comparing to other creams, but the stickiness is gone quickly. Hey, anything that helps with cracked fingers/hands, I don&#x27;t mind it being sticky for a while.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years and  there is nothing better for callus feet or rough dry hands,  Use it for a week and you will use nothing else!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This hand cream keeps my hands moisturized for a long time. it is mazing how my hands look after i apply it. I like this product a lot, and i will be ordering more of this product.</li>
            <li> Package was in good condition and delivery on time. This hand lotion works very well on dry hands and has a soft, calming scent. It also lasts a long time. Best hand lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love the product I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this same hand cream with an older formula that would last after a few hand washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new formula doesn&#x27;t last as long after washing your hands, but is fragrance free and is still thick enough that you only need less than a pea-sized dollop to do your hands, so it&#x27;s going to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Avon Moisture Therapy is the best cream I have ever use, it save my hands, my feet and even my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost the texture of Vaseline. I compare all other hand creams to this one. It&#x27;s the gold standard. It penetrates easily but also keeps a nice barrier on the skin to trap in moisture. I use it on my chest/decolettage and bottoms of my feet at nightas well.</li>
            <li> This is very good for extremely dry skin! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> A little sticky at first but so worh it, use it at bedtime. I highly recommend it to anyone with severly dry hands.</li>
            <li> It save my hands, my feet and even my face that was very dry. Has use it for years but my Avon lady retired, so for several months I was without it. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever! I have used this for years!</li>
            <li> This is a really good hand cream, not so expensive, but very useful, it&#x27;s pretty thick and recover your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve ever found for extremely dry skin. Husband appreciates the aroma free feature of this cream.</li>
            <li> I was using different types of hand creams, but since I got this one was great choice very good cream.</li>
            <li> My friend is a truck driver and was having a hard time finding lotion that would retain moister. Someone had given me a small tube last yr and he happened to try it. He love it. I ordered 2 tubes so I&#x27;d have 1 for my feet. Product lives up to it claim.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Excellent for your hands during the winter. It goes on easy, not a lot is needed to cover your skin. Does not wash off easily as well. Doesn&#x27;t smell &amp; does not feel greasy (not sure how they make it not feel funny either). I usually buy direct from Avon but I saw it on Amazon &amp; thought I would try this one. I&#x27;ve bought the tube with a screw cap. This one has a flip cap which I think is better. The sizes are the same too. I miss the small travel size though. Still can&#x27;t find them &amp; Avon is always out of them! -R</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product because the ingredients have changed since I last ordered it, quite awhile ago.  In the 70&#x27;s I was an Avon lady.  At that time the cream was much thicker, more like a Vaseline base and always worked well with my extremely dry hands.  This cream is more like my face cream and doesn&#x27;t seem to  moisturize as well.  Time will tell whether or not I will get good results.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hand and my hands have been extremely dry lately. I need to keep my skin moisturized in order to keep my eczema in check. I don&#x27;t usually like using hand lotion because I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t like my hands to smell like lavender or roses or whatever and I don&#x27;t like them to feel oily.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and after a few minutes it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery in my hands. It gets absorbed in the skin really quickly and keeps my hands moisturized for hours and hours.  I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I used to go the flea market for these, but now, no need!  Great price, delivered to my door and the product is the ONLY thing that keeps my dry feet moisturized throughout the day!  A Much needed lotion!</li>
            <li> GREAT lotion.  I had carpal tunnel release surgery and needed to do &#x27;massages&#x27;.  traditional lotions absorbed within a few min, and this one didn&#x27;t.  SO GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is the first and last time I&#x27;ll buy the new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product since the late 70s, but the new formula is drastically different. The old formula had orange roughy fish oil. I guess that got too costly so they replaced it with sticky, sticky glycerine. This cream isn&#x27;t nearly as moisturising and does not last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream that works on my husband&#x27;s hands.  He has found absolutely nothing that compares with this product.  It is not greasy at all.  Perfect consistancy!![[ASIN:B0025N244K Avon Moisture Therapy Intensive Hand Cream for Extremely Dry Skin]]</li>
            <li> Requires small amount and does an excellent job, especially for someone who washes their hands frequently at work.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is nothing short of supernatural. There are so many lotions out there that are great for a few minutes, but they don&#x27;t alter the texture of your skin and they don&#x27;t have a lasting effect after handwashing. This stuff keeps your hands moisturized even after washing, and it has a persistent effect on the quality of my skin. Ever felt the perfect, silky-smooth skin of a baby? That&#x27;s how my hands are when I use this product regularly. I&#x27;m in the healthcare field and I wash my hands at least 20 times a day (and I live in Ohio, brr!). I usually use this cream before bed and 2-3 times during the day, and my hands are unbelievably soft all the time, despite all my handwashing and Purell. Not to knock dear Avon, but it&#x27;s surprising that such an inexpensive brand has harnessed the sought-after secret of silky skin when no other moisturizer on Earth can compare (and, believe me, as a cosmetics junkie I have a VAST frame of reference). I&#x27;d pay $300 for a tube of this potion. The scent is light and pleasant, and the formula has a wonderful consistency, absorbed SO well that it only takes a tiny bit to completely saturate your skin. I wish I could sing a song in place of these typewritten words. Buy a tube and get ready to experience GREATNESS.</li>
            <li> Appearently it was recommended by many professionals who use their hand to deal with paper, cards, and anything that absorbs the moisture from their hands a lot.  Haven&#x27;t used it myself.</li>
            <li> Love this product - it helps keep my hands soft in cold weather.  Great moisturizing handcream.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Because it WORKS on painfully dry hands due to work or weather wear. I put this on at the end of the day as I settle down for the nite and read until I drop off to sleep,,, For me it&#x27;s the best time to apply &amp; reapply as needed to help nourish, restore &amp; beautify your hands, elbows, knees &amp; feet - I love it!  Works for my family, friends &amp; the fellas at work!</li>
            <li> I had  actually never used Avon products before and was very surprised to find this hand cream so good for dry skin. I keep it in my desk and use it throughout the day. I live at 7,300 feet in the mountains and talk about dry skin! It doesn&#x27;t take very long to sink in either, I&#x27;m good to go back to my computer keyboard in a couple minutes. Not greasy or sticky either, and the best feature to me is that there is  no smell. I just can&#x27;t tolerate the medicinal or flowery smells they put in most hand cream, it gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I put it on at night when I go to bed and it heels my hands and seals in moisture.  I work at a pet store and constantly wash my hands and have pets and cleaning at home so my hands get very dry.  I have not found a product that works better for my uses and needs.  It is a bit greasy so I only use it at night but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, nothing out of this world but it s a good hand cream for the price, hope will take me through the winter</li>
            <li> Softest hands I&#x27;ve had in the winter!</li>
            <li> soft hand keeping for night and day very good products I will order more I recommend for those hard work hands</li>
            <li> I feel like it is too greasy when I put a bit on my hands and I have to keep rubbing to have the product soak into my hands</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used . I use it all over and it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> Ordered it last year and still have more than half the tube because I just don&#x27;t like the texture. I keep it in my gym locker, and every time I use it I tell myself I&#x27;m going to bring in something else and throw it out, but keep forgetting to replace. I agree with other reviews that this is not the cream that I seem to remember from the days when I bought lots of Avon products.  Such a shame. I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> This product is the only cream that I have found to heal cracked heals, even the Avon foot cream.  I have been using this for 20+years.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with buying this hand lotion, you need just a little bit and it&#x27;s enough. Uncheap stiff but def worthy - great !!!!</li>
            <li> I have little cracks on my thumbs right next to the nail bed and they Hurt.  I used this magic lotion for two days.  The cracks are still there but the pain is GONE.  It was truly like a miracle.  Bottom line, my fingers still look like *^&amp;% , but I DON&#x27;T CARE.</li>
            <li> My hands get extremly dry during the winter and this is the only lotion that keeps my hands soft. It feels like this lotion really sinks in and stays on your hands. I would reccommend this hand lotion to anyone who has extremely dry hands!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best discovery I have made! I have never been complimented on soft hands in my entire life until I started using this product. I also use it on my feet and I have tried EVERYTHING on my feet including razors and ped egg. The only thing that has softened me up is this cream. It is my favorite product and I will continue to use. Nothing compares.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find these days. Very effective for very dry skin.  Manageable scent, not overpowering.  Good value for your money</li>
            <li> I have some sort of condition where my knuckles and elbows will crack and bleed in the winter (Midwest USA).  I have used all forms of hand cream.  Most go on \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and wear off very quickly.  Working outdoors/with my hands on a daily basis made these forms of creams unacceptable.  I&#x27;ve used Corn Huskers as well as a few other well known types that worked with some success.  One of the best is a homemade concoction of glycerin and Bay Rum both purchased from a drug store but nothing with real lasting results.  This stuff seems to last most of the day with only one application per day.  I do not like the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feel that these creams create including this one so what I do is apply it just before going to bed.  By morning it is not really noticeable but the \\&quot;protective layer\\&quot; seems to last most of the day.  I no longer have the \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; skin on my knuckles/elbows.  I think why this cream lasts longer than most is because of the high glycerin content which is why the glycerin-Bay Rum mixture seemed to do the trick.  This cream is \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; but not like most hand creams.  This kind has a \\&quot;pastier\\&quot; or \\&quot;tackier\\&quot; feel which is why I apply it just before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has tried other creams that have failed them.</li>
            <li> This cream is very rich and definitely helps my dry, dry hands. The problem is trying to get the cream out of the tube. It takes a lot of force to get it to dribble out. Fortunately, you don&#x27;t need much of the product or I would never have the patience to fight the packaging. I will not purchase this hand cream again.</li>
            <li> I bought and tried this stuff to try and heal the skin on my hands, but it just does not work.  Whatever its made out of is not conducive to skin re-moisturizing and reconditioning.  I would say its more for &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; - but only for 3 hours tops - my hands &amp;#34;appeared&amp;#34; like they had renewed moisture, but then after that third hour the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; characteristics began to reappear.  Can&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> This winter has been the coldest ever. The weather dehydrated my skin and some how I got a allergic reaction to something I put on my skin. I was given numerous doses of steriods to clear my skin which dehydrated my body even more. Now I&#x27;m just trying to heal my body and this lotion has been a miracle to me. I put it on everything my skin itches.</li>
            <li> Tried every kind of hand cream/ointment for my cold weather, salt water cracked fingertips. Nothing worked that well until I found this cream. It&#x27;s the only product that is able to heal my finger cracks in short order. Leaves hands soft and sealed but not greasy. I order several at a time. Found it less expensive to order largest size through an Amazon distributor vs an Avon rep.</li>
            <li> This is the only hand cream that really helps with my excessively dry hands. I use it on my heels also.</li>
            <li> Nice hand lotion... makes my hands look smooth and young, I only wish it lasted a little longer. I wash my hands frequently because of my baby, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d buy again though, because it&#x27;s one of the better lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Helps with very dry hands. One of the great products of all time.  What a gift to my hands.  A tinch too fragrant.</li>
            <li> The best for dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and to top it off, I work at a daycare so I wash my hands probably 10 times per day with harsh liquid soap. This lotion is a lifesaver. It has a thick texture that melts in your hands as you begin to rub it in. It is a little sticky in the first 30 seconds, but is not sticky at all after it dries. It coats my hands with some kind of protectorant and makes them feel shielded from the elements. I don&#x27;t have to reapply for many hours with this lotion. If I use it at night, when I wake up in the morning I can still feel it on my hands protecting my skin. The only other lotion I&#x27;ve found that rivals this is Avon Wintersoft, but that lotion was discontinued several  years ago. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry, even the palms, in this cold weather. This cream is just what I need.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after going thru my Niece&#x27;s things after her sudden death and fell in love with this.  The BEST</li>
            <li> I work at a Pharmacy and always use hand sanitizer and will constantly wash my hands. All of the cleansing leaves my hands dry and hard, but no more than a pea size amount of this will completely replenish the moisture for my entire 6-8hr shift. So glad I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> Omg!! THEE best lotion ever!! Much cheeper through avon though</li>
            <li> This item takes almost a month to get to me,i almost forget i even ordered it,not really sure if it works,because of the long wait for arrival i bought another hand theraphy.</li>
            <li> I had a bad round of cracked, bleeding dry hands.  I tried every product product on the market and nothing cured my problem until I found Avon Moisture Therapy.  It works!</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  It really soaks in and stays with you.  A great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best prodoct for cracked feet.  Avon needs to bring it back.  Thanks Amazon for helping me find more.  Thank you seller for having it.  Good Experence</li>
            <li> Not every hand cream works for every one.  This one did NOT work for me, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it will not work for you.  It felt like Vaseline, and has no scent, but heavy.  I don&#x27;t even know if it works because I was distracted by the heaviness of the product, and how I accidentally ordered two of them.</li>
