            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>they were very pretty.</li>
            <li>A trim is needed to fit properly on top of your lashes, but these are VERY natural and as long as you&#x27;re careful working with them, they&#x27;ll work GREAT for you!  </li>
            <li>I always get comments on how pretty my eyes are when I&#x27;m wearing these!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like picture !</li>
            <li>Looks great as natural eyelashes, or to add that extra pop for evening wear.</li>
            <li>Love how natural they look</li>
            <li>I love these lashes they look natural and make my eyelashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>Some of the lashes were uneven but the ones that were shaped evenly are the perfect natural look.</li>
            <li>I have pretty full eyelashes already but putting even one layer of these on made them stand out.</li>
            <li>these are fun, thank you for selling online</li>
            <li>These lashes are look so natural people thought they were mine.&lt;br /&gt;I would surely recommend these.</li>
            <li>They are very nice long natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I liked that they look natural, they are light on eyes, ive gotten complimented when i wear them, the only thing is that!</li>
            <li>Super ..I really like them.</li>
            <li>Though they may look pretty straight, they are super flexible and don&#x27;t rip.</li>
            <li>Haha - but I contacted the seller and he got them to me a day before I needed them!</li>
            <li>I will be placing my next order soon :)</li>
            <li>but if you catch it its the perfect eye lash to wear on casual days and not over</li>
            <li>and they were delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Very well made and shipped lightning fast!</li>
            <li>At first they were really tough to apply but after some practice they were great.  </li>
            <li>so they look super natural.</li>
            <li>super natural.</li>
            <li>Long, natural looking and perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li>Looks very pretty and natural that way.</li>
            <li>They feel good they aren&#x27;t plasticky or hard to bend.</li>
            <li>However, they are very natural looking and have a great base which lays very nicely along your lash line, making them nearly undetectable if applied correctly.  </li>
            <li>For the glue I would recommend the korean brand &amp;#34;darkness&amp;#34; it sticks really well with these lashes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Straight lash line.</li>
            <li>Really irritated my eyes</li>
            <li>I actually really like these.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the unusually thin (still strong) band.</li>
            <li>more practice snd have quite a few to practice on.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy as most falsies.</li>
            <li>Really good quality and the band is thin.</li>
            <li>This lashes are light so its harder to apply cause they move around when applying..........but have to admit i will order these again!</li>
            <li>I had to cut both ends of these lashes before I applied them because their just way too long, but  their very pretty on, and I also bought the 4 pack of Eye Charm adhesive from Amazon n</li>
            <li>would have rated it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to cut the strings on the ends off every time I wanted to wear a new pair.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>if you want a very natural look (not too dense)</li>
            <li>Very natural look for being faux.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>They look very natural.</li>
            <li>I bought them and put them on my mom and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>I order them in bulk frequently!</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t have the sticky stuff on them naturally but for the price there just isn&#x27;t anything anywhere that can beat it!</li>
            <li>When I wear them they look totally natural and they blend in well with my natural lashes! ^.^</li>
            <li>THey look really natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mistakes where the strip glues to my natural eyelash instead of my eye lid and</li>
            <li>I found better use out of these by cutting them into smaller segments and adhering them to the underside of my top lashes.</li>
            <li>(if you know how to put them on properly) is so natural.</li>
            <li>Like, natural lashes are way longer than these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>These are so natural looking.  </li>
            <li>These are perfectly natural looking lashes...</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and thin that you can wear them without eyeliner if you want a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Be careful taking them out because they mess up easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re different from your lashes you get in the store because the lashes are attaches by a thread or soft fabric</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s barely visible on my eyes, like I didn&#x27;t attach them.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that they are a little long but you can easily cut it to fit your lash line</li>
            <li>They were delivered extremely fast got them a day before due.</li>
            <li>I use these with a dark lash adhesive since white glue is pretty noticeable on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They are not nearly as long as I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>They were in a small cute little white package.</li>
            <li>I used a little mascara to blend them in with my real lashes</li>
            <li>Not as bulky as some other ones and very natural.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and they were delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Very well made and shipped lightning fast!</li>
            <li> At first they were really tough to apply but after some practice they were great.  </li>
            <li> so they look super natural.</li>
            <li> super natural.</li>
            <li> Long, natural looking and perfect for everyday.</li>
            <li> Looks very pretty and natural that way.</li>
            <li> They feel good they aren&#x27;t plasticky or hard to bend.</li>
            <li> However, they are very natural looking and have a great base which lays very nicely along your lash line, making them nearly undetectable if applied correctly.  </li>
            <li> For the glue I would recommend the korean brand &amp;#34;darkness&amp;#34; it sticks really well with these lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Straight lash line.</li>
            <li> Really irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> I actually really like these.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the unusually thin (still strong) band.</li>
            <li> more practice snd have quite a few to practice on.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as most falsies.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and the band is thin.</li>
            <li> This lashes are light so its harder to apply cause they move around when applying..........but have to admit i will order these again!</li>
            <li> I had to cut both ends of these lashes before I applied them because their just way too long, but  their very pretty on, and I also bought the 4 pack of Eye Charm adhesive from Amazon n</li>
            <li> would have rated it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to cut the strings on the ends off every time I wanted to wear a new pair.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>

            <li> They look very natural.</li>
            <li> I bought them and put them on my mom and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I order them in bulk frequently!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have the sticky stuff on them naturally but for the price there just isn&#x27;t anything anywhere that can beat it!</li>
            <li> When I wear them they look totally natural and they blend in well with my natural lashes! ^.^</li>
            <li> THey look really natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mistakes where the strip glues to my natural eyelash instead of my eye lid and</li>
            <li> I found better use out of these by cutting them into smaller segments and adhering them to the underside of my top lashes.</li>
            <li> (if you know how to put them on properly) is so natural.</li>
            <li> Like, natural lashes are way longer than these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> These are so natural looking.  </li>
            <li> These are perfectly natural looking lashes...</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and thin that you can wear them without eyeliner if you want a more natural look.</li>
            <li> Be careful taking them out because they mess up easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re different from your lashes you get in the store because the lashes are attaches by a thread or soft fabric</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s barely visible on my eyes, like I didn&#x27;t attach them.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they are a little long but you can easily cut it to fit your lash line</li>
            <li> They were delivered extremely fast got them a day before due.</li>
            <li> I use these with a dark lash adhesive since white glue is pretty noticeable on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as long as I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li> They were in a small cute little white package.</li>
            <li> I used a little mascara to blend them in with my real lashes</li>
            <li> Not as bulky as some other ones and very natural.</li>
            <li> Base is very flexible...not &amp;#34;wire-like.&amp;#34; Very light weight.</li>
            <li> do it with long lashes.</li>
            <li> Not as long as my wife was hoping for..</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t complain for the price, even if the shipping is a bit long.</li>
            <li> Way too long for me.</li>
            <li> They are really long as well.</li>
            <li> I can apply them faster and easier, and because of its thin and flexible base it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes at all, need very little glue with no needed touch ups as it doesn&#x27;t pull or pose any resistance fitting the natural curve over the eye lip, and is easy to forget that you have anything glued by your eyelashes at all!</li>
            <li> too thin for my liking and the band wouldnt stick on right</li>
            <li> Not happy, lashes came fast but individual hairs were falling out of the band.</li>
            <li> super obsessed.</li>
            <li> They also arrived a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The lashes are a tiny bit too long for me and my eyes are too small</li>
            <li> Be careful as well</li>
            <li> Not much to complain about.</li>
            <li> They r not what I expected .</li>
            <li> And the strip just looks like you have on black eyeliner and naturally long curly lashes that wisp out at the end like dolls lashes.</li>
            <li> These are VERY long, I had to trim them to about half their length so that I didn&#x27;t have spider-like lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected !</li>
            <li> They came a little jumbled up in the packaging but all I had to was just put them back in their little space</li>
            <li> The only thing is I was not able to put them on myself.</li>
            <li> The lash strip was extremely difficult to apply, very flimsy like string.</li>
            <li> The lashes are thin and soft.</li>
            <li> am super picky with what eyelashes i wear because i dont like them to be too thick and fake looking.</li>
            <li> I ordered them a week before I needed them without thinking that I would need them a few weeks before they were due to arrive.</li>
            <li> They came in less then two weeks when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Got them in a week or less</li>
            <li> The strip is very thin, not like normal lashes you buy at Target or Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> A little tricky to put on bc</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long but not super fake long</li>
            <li> Could use few times without breaking.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these and they don&#x27;t look like dead spiders on her face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t reuse the same ones because the wefts are so thin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not easy to apply</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too long or too thick nor do they give the appearance of being fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Too hard to work with, the strips are string.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t fabulous, but weren&#x27;t terrible.</li>
            <li> what can you not love!</li>
            <li> everyday wear to look fierce without noticible fake lashes</li>
            <li> they are thin at the strip and flimsy but if u take your time to put them on</li>
            <li> These require dramatic trimming.  </li>
            <li> They are also very thin</li>
            <li> Very poorly made ..they don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> they are very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li> These are the worst...</li>

            <li> I just received these lashes over the weekend! I love them! They don&#x27;t feel like plastic at all and they were delivered pretty fast. They came in less then two weeks when I ordered. They were in a small cute little white package. The strip is very thin, not like normal lashes you buy at Target or Wal-Mart but I like that better because it looks more natural to me but it still looks like you applied eyeliner on your eyes. I love them! $3.99 for a pack of 10 is what you pay for 1 pair at the store.</li>
            <li> Best lashes I have ever ordered, and I have purchased many! After I received mine and used it I had to go order two more boxes. The lashes its self look great and are workable. Easy to curl, fit, or trim, ect. My favorite part is the unusually thin (still strong) band. That feature makes all the difference. I can apply them faster and easier, and because of its thin and flexible base it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes at all, need very little glue with no needed touch ups as it doesn&#x27;t pull or pose any resistance fitting the natural curve over the eye lip, and is easy to forget that you have anything glued by your eyelashes at all! Looks great as natural eyelashes, or to add that extra pop for evening wear. Fantastic in every way!</li>
            <li> Light weight, affordable and easy to use! what can you not love! I&#x27;ve been purchasing these fake lashes and really love them. THey look really natural. For the glue I would recommend the korean brand &amp;#34;darkness&amp;#34; it sticks really well with these lashes.</li>
            <li> They were delivered extremely fast got them a day before due. I liked that they look natural, they are light on eyes, ive gotten complimented when i wear them, the only thing is that! they are very difficult to put on. Didnt realize this until now when lashes are fuller they are heavier so it makes it easier to apply. This lashes are light so its harder to apply cause they move around when applying..........but have to admit i will order these again!</li>
            <li> Love how natural they look I always add on a layer of mascara after I finish putting them on and they look perfect. Be careful as well I&#x27;ve had mistakes where the strip glues to my natural eyelash instead of my eye lid and its noticeable when you close your eyes but if you catch it its the perfect eye lash to wear on casual days and not over do it with long lashes. I love them I&#x27;ve ordered 4 boxes to have them on deck. :)</li>
            <li> Long, natural looking and perfect for everyday. I always get comments on how pretty my eyes are when I&#x27;m wearing these!üíÑ</li>
            <li> Not as long as my wife was hoping for.. An some of them were to messed up to wear. I guess you get what you pay for tho..</li>
            <li> I absolutely just love these lashes..Of course you have to cut them to fit your shape of your eyes but just how they are made is just great! Who ever made them put a lot of work on them and they look so natural, i am very much pleased with this product and would purchase again:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but doesn&#x27;t come with a glue</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they look natural and make my eyelashes look longer and fuller. I got lots of compliments and people could not believe i was wearing falsies because they blend well but i have definitely fuller longer lashes</li>
            <li> A trim is needed to fit properly on top of your lashes, but these are VERY natural and as long as you&#x27;re careful working with them, they&#x27;ll work GREAT for you!  LOVE THESE!!!  I even ordered my sister a box so that she won&#x27;t have any reason to steal mine!</li>
            <li> came as picture. The lashes are thin and soft. can&#x27;t complain for the price, even if the shipping is a bit long.</li>
            <li> best eyelashes! I love them!</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t fabulous, but weren&#x27;t terrible. I feel like it&#x27;s probably just an experience type deal. Great price, though. Very soft.</li>
            <li> The lash strip was extremely difficult to apply, very flimsy like string. I found better use out of these by cutting them into smaller segments and adhering them to the underside of my top lashes. Looks very pretty and natural that way.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Shipping was fast. &amp; these lashes are just amazing, perfect for an everyday use, they&#x27;re easy to apply &amp; just amazing. Definitely going to reorder once I&#x27;m out of them!</li>
            <li> Very nicely made for the price. Not as bulky as some other ones and very natural. Could use few times without breaking.</li>
            <li> Straight lash line. Not curved. Not easy to apply</li>
            <li> Other then some having gaps , these are awesome soft easy to work with !!!</li>
            <li> i cut the longer end of the lashes, works for me.. would buy again..</li>
            <li> Best bang for you&#x27;re buck! They are very nice long natural lashes. They&#x27;re different from your lashes you get in the store because the lashes are attaches by a thread or soft fabric so they&#x27;re not as structured as most are used to. However you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This was a piece of s***! they suck! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> At first they were really tough to apply but after some practice they were great.  Make sure to cut to the size of your eye and bend before putting them on.  Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> These require dramatic trimming.  They are not nearly as long as I thought they would be.  However, they are very natural looking and have a great base which lays very nicely along your lash line, making them nearly undetectable if applied correctly.  I purchased these for my freelance kit but I occasionally use them myself.  They are a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that they are a little long but you can easily cut it to fit your lash line</li>
            <li> Great very natural looking</li>
            <li> They were perfect! When I wear them they look totally natural and they blend in well with my natural lashes! ^.^</li>
            <li> This product was literally perfect! these eyelashes look soooo nice and they are super naturally looking! Also they are reusable ! I would recommend these lashes and I would buy these again</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM! I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> Way too long for me. Too hard to work with, the strips are string. Gave it to my daughter for cos play.</li>
            <li> I usually only stick to cr√©me lashes the (ones on the left) but I thought I tried these ones out. They feel good they aren&#x27;t plasticky or hard to bend. They could be more fuller though. I haven&#x27;t actually wore them yet, but they seem like they will hold up okay, shipping was fast as well. Not much to complain about. üëç</li>
            <li> Really irritated my eyes I felt like I was putting rope on my eyelids and versus the others I tried from drug stores did not do that to me.</li>
            <li> Some of the lashes were uneven but the ones that were shaped evenly are the perfect natural look. Be careful taking them out because they mess up easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these and they don&#x27;t look like dead spiders on her face.</li>
            <li> Not wearing mascara in the pics. Got them in a week or less and they&#x27;re perfect, all 10 pairs came intact. Very natural looking and thin that you can wear them without eyeliner if you want a more natural look. They&#x27;re long but not super fake long and I just love them. Definitely will order some more :)</li>
            <li> very nice and soft eyelashes</li>
            <li> Great lashes. Base is very flexible...not &amp;#34;wire-like.&amp;#34; Very light weight.</li>
            <li> Good tool for applying lashes</li>
            <li> These lashes are absolutely gorgeous and the seller is great. I ordered them a week before I needed them without thinking that I would need them a few weeks before they were due to arrive. Still with me? Haha - but I contacted the seller and he got them to me a day before I needed them! I&#x27;d give more than five stars if I could. These are absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such amazing experiences with these! This was my second time buying them &amp; they&#x27;re just ugh great! They also arrived a little earlier than expected. The look they give (if you know how to put them on properly) is so natural. I recommend!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected ! Looks exactly like picture !</li>
            <li> I actually really like these. I have pretty full eyelashes already but putting even one layer of these on made them stand out. They came a little jumbled up in the packaging but all I had to was just put them back in their little space and that was it. I use these with a dark lash adhesive since white glue is pretty noticeable on my eyelashes. But these are great, for a great price, super fast shipping, and they look natural once you&#x27;ve trimmed them up a bit.</li>
            <li> Feel really nice and look really nice and not clumpy</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are for your entire eyelid. They are also very thin so they look super natural. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> It would have been better if It came with glue</li>
            <li> These are beautiful n soft. Hopefully will get better application with more practice snd have quite a few to practice on.</li>
            <li> It all came well packed and sealed. The lashes look fabulous. Though they may look pretty straight, they are super flexible and don&#x27;t rip. They exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> if you want a very natural look (not too dense) these are great - good for everyday but would opt for a fuller look for evening out.</li>
            <li> came as the picture! super natural. probably my 5th order this year! super obsessed. the band is very light and easy to hide with eyeliner. everyday wear to look fierce without noticible fake lashes</li>
            <li> They look good in photos and are really comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to cut the strings on the ends off every time I wanted to wear a new pair. They are really long as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE these lashes. I order them in bulk frequently! Very natural look for being faux. Not as heavy as most falsies. AND, they&#x27;re way cheaper than paying $5 for one pair at most stores. Love love love. I will be placing my next order soon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Photo is the lashes WITH mascara)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them. Wear them everyday and they look great!!!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made ..they don&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Very well made and shipped lightning fast! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I LOVED themüòçüòçüòç&lt;br /&gt;they look amazing on me!! And they look identical to the ones shown!!! I will definitely buy more!!!!!!!üòäüòäüòä</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered! !!  Great product! !</li>
            <li> these are fun, thank you for selling online</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t u dare buy these!</li>
            <li> Not happy, lashes came fast but individual hairs were falling out of the band. Band is made out of fabric and soaks up glue rather than hold the glue so the lash doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> They are so natural that loks as if they were my own lashes but longer!! Very elegant!!</li>
            <li> Love these really . They are light and its a great deal for money</li>
            <li> Good quality, I was able to re-use some pairs. These are VERY long, I had to trim them to about half their length so that I didn&#x27;t have spider-like lashes. If you&#x27;re into that look though, these are the lashes for you!</li>
            <li> They r not what I expected .</li>
            <li> Very short. Like, natural lashes are way longer than these. They suck.</li>
            <li> Super ..I really like them.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all! I put them on and once I opened my eye they looked all scrunched up! I guess because of the string it&#x27;s made from. I don&#x27;t recommend these at all! DONT BUY!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I am super picky with what eyelashes i wear because i dont like them to be too thick and fake looking. These came really fast and are amazing and light on. I loved them so much i ordered 5 more packs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t reuse the same ones because the wefts are so thin. Very natural looking. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Rigid, couldn&#x27;t glue well. And it&#x27;s barely visible on my eyes, like I didn&#x27;t attach them.</li>
            <li> I had to cut both ends of these lashes before I applied them because their just way too long, but  their very pretty on, and I also bought the 4 pack of Eye Charm adhesive from Amazon n they stayed on all day. I used a little mascara to blend them in with my real lashes n they were very pretty. I&#x27;ll definately buy these again.</li>
            <li> The lashes are a tiny bit too long for me and my eyes are too small also so I needed to cut them to make them perfect for my eyes and my expectations. YOU NEED TO BUY SOME GLUE cause it is not into the package. Otherwise I like the results. It&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> These lashes are look so natural people thought they were mine.&lt;br /&gt;I would surely recommend these. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them</li>
            <li> These are so natural looking.  I love these...  They are light weight as well so you don&#x27;t notice notice them.</li>
            <li> they do work pretty good</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T USED BUT IT LOOKS NO SO STRENGHT.</li>
            <li> These are the worst... The strip is a piece of string. Will not work with regular lash adhesive. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> DIDNT LIKE THESE AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;IN FACT I HAVE NOTE USED THEM, CAUSE THE QUALITY WAS SO POOR.&lt;br /&gt;SOMEDAY I MIGHT TRY THEM, BUT I DOUGHT IT.</li>
            <li> Worth the money! These don&#x27;t have the sticky stuff on them naturally but for the price there just isn&#x27;t anything anywhere that can beat it! I super duper recommend!</li>
            <li> These lashes are great! They look very natural. A little tricky to put on bc they are thin at the strip and flimsy but if u take your time to put them on right then they make your eyes more beautiful! And the strip just looks like you have on black eyeliner and naturally long curly lashes that wisp out at the end like dolls lashes.</li>
            <li> Loved the eye lashes... I bought them and put them on my mom and they look very natural. The only thing is I was not able to put them on myself.</li>
            <li> These are perfectly natural looking lashes... great if you&#x27;re just wearing them day to day. They aren&#x27;t anything exotic.</li>
            <li> Really good quality and the band is thin. They look natural and curled, the arrival was quick and the product AMAZING.</li>
            <li> too thin for my liking and the band wouldnt stick on right</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too long or too thick nor do they give the appearance of being fake eyelashes. If you don&#x27;t want to put on individual lashes, these are PERFECT!</li>
            <li> They were ok. Quick delivery</li>
