            <li>Yes this product has good hold</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Works great, but the fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li>My boys are 5 &amp; 7 and this product holds their own hair style all day.</li>
            <li>This product promises a very strong hold, and it keeps that promise.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t flake like most gels or leave any sort of discolored crusty residue like the Joico Spiker.</li>
            <li>It works better than any of my waxes or pastes making my hair stand up.  </li>
            <li>It made to force your hair into any hair style (mostly textures and spikes).</li>
            <li>This is best used sparingly, and with little fiddling.  </li>
            <li>so it that is important to you</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use in addition to a thickener like American Crew Fiber/Forming Cream or Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream.  </li>
            <li>Great strong hold, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Use a small amount and run your hands through your hair for wonderful lift and body.  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy he doesn&#x27;t have to wet his hair before adding the product.</li>
            <li>True to its name</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old woman,  and have had tons of comments about how cute my hair is.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>It will also do just fine on it&#x27;s own, but takes a little practice to get the amount</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair in a messy cut and this works great to hold a style and give body.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for the strongest hold possible along with the ability to reshape throughout the day and even take a nap and fix your hair afterward without having to put more stuff in--</li>
            <li>My first tube lasted me forever.  </li>
            <li>When I used to have a more volumous hairstyle, I still used this only at all</li>
            <li>This stuff is really strong and you could rip hairs out if you&#x27;re not careful.)</li>
            <li>it pretty much hair glue.  </li>
            <li>Compared to other hair products like waxes, this adds a nice texture to your hair as well if you have straight hair like mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a spiking glue.</li>
            <li>I have never encountered a styling product with so much hold.</li>
            <li>, it will literally \\&quot;glue\\&quot; your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a spiky mohawk style, so I can&#x27;t really imagine distributing this product throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>The product was more watery than what I get at the salon, and the box was a little beaten up.</li>
            <li>It even held up in the damp northwest where I live.  </li>
            <li>leave a strong smell at all, and in fact can&#x27;t smell it at all after a few hours which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li>Make fine limp hair looks &#x27;tasselled&#x27; and wavey.  </li>
            <li>My son has very thick hair that seems to have a mind of his own.</li>
            <li>It looks natural, not greasy or spiky.</li>
            <li>Once the product sets, you absolutely cannot reshape your hair (short of rewetting it).</li>
            <li>Dries fast so work fast or use in slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 76 and don&#x27;t care for the spiky look for me, but it gave my hair such an up-to-date look that I have been complimented on my new look.</li>
            <li>I could get it to stand partially, though it would end up falling down significantly by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Be warned that if you use too much of this, or of the other product if you use this supplementally, your hair may have a greasy look.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and excellent services</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb for short hair. Add shine to your pixie by finishing with just a tad. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a lot for a great price.  It was a gift for the hubby &amp; he loves it.  He&#x27;s happy he doesn&#x27;t have to wet his hair before adding the product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product</li>
            <li> My son has very thick hair that seems to have a mind of his own. He&#x27;s very happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t look like he has anything in his hair, yet it still holds it in place. It looks natural, not greasy or spiky.</li>
            <li> When getting my hair done at the salon, she managed to hold my hair up with this product. When at home, however, (and my hair a little longer) I was unable to replicate it holding at all. I could get it to stand partially, though it would end up falling down significantly by the end of the day. It does stay in well though, even overnight.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  My hair stylus started using this on my blonde/silver very thin hair that I wear short and spiked!!!  I am a 60 year old woman,  and have had tons of comments about how cute my hair is.  Its not just for men!!</li>
            <li> I prefer my hair to not move at all so this stuff works great. It keeps everything in place all day long (it will stay for 12 hours at least) with maybe a quick comb through along the way. It also doesn&#x27;t flake like most gels or leave any sort of discolored crusty residue like the Joico Spiker. This and PM Tea Tree Shaping Cream are the only two products that I would ever give five stars and have ever used for an extended period of time. If you are looking for the strongest hold possible along with the ability to reshape throughout the day and even take a nap and fix your hair afterward without having to put more stuff in-- this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I can slick back Mad Men style, spike up, or messy up my hair with this product and THE HAIR DOESNT MOVE.  It is about 50% reformable if you get your hair damp, since it is water based.  Apply to towel dry hair for some slight shine and wet look hold.  Apply to dry hair for crazy spike and control.  Dries fast so work fast or use in slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, although it does hold. It is too sticky for me. It does say Maximum Hold Spiking, but I don&#x27;t need that.</li>
            <li> They should say for women too on the Hard Wired label.  Use a small amount and run your hands through your hair for wonderful lift and body.  I didn&#x27;t even need hair spray with this product.  It even held up in the damp northwest where I live.  I&#x27;m 76 and don&#x27;t care for the spiky look for me, but it gave my hair such an up-to-date look that I have been complimented on my new look.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair in a messy cut and this works great to hold a style and give body.  It makes the hair feel a bit sticky nasty ... so it that is important to you (ie, someone is going to be running their hands through your hair), don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl with short hair (think Miley Cyrus) and this product keeps my hair in place however I want to. I do my hair every day and the bottle will maybe last me about 1 1/2- 2 months.</li>
            <li> It is a tacky paste gel.  It works great on dry hair.  It works better than any of my waxes or pastes making my hair stand up.  You have to layer it a copy times (grind it into the hair let it dry and regrind).  Make fine limp hair looks &#x27;tasselled&#x27; and wavey.  PS..Just so you know--it pretty much hair glue.  It made to force your hair into any hair style (mostly textures and spikes).</li>
            <li> This is the best product for holding my boys spiked bangs.  My first tube lasted me forever.  You ohly need a tiny bit.  My boys are 5 &amp; 7 and this product holds their own hair style all day.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li> This has been my only go-to hair product for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;Despite it&#x27;s name, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a spiking glue. I would imagine that in order to spike your hair you&#x27;ll need to use a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;But even with a little amount I definitely vouch for its volume. When I used to have a more volumous hairstyle, I still used this only at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for control and hold throughout the day. One small dime sized dab or even less gets the job done, without being leaving the hair sticky or shiny. Compared to other hair products like waxes, this adds a nice texture to your hair as well if you have straight hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell at all, and in fact can&#x27;t smell it at all after a few hours which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> This product promises a very strong hold, and it keeps that promise. I have never encountered a styling product with so much hold. True to its name, it will literally \\&quot;glue\\&quot; your hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear a spiky mohawk style, so I can&#x27;t really imagine distributing this product throughout my hair. However, I do use very small amounts of this product as a final touch-up once I&#x27;m done styling, to help certain parts of the style stay put throughout the day. Once the product sets, you absolutely cannot reshape your hair (short of rewetting it). It leaves a slight shine, so don&#x27;t go overboard if the rest of your style has a matte finish. (Actually, don&#x27;t go overboard period. This stuff is really strong and you could rip hairs out if you&#x27;re not careful.)</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast. Good quality</li>
            <li> All you needs a little dab, its tacky, holds all day and it doesn&#x27;t give you the wet head look.</li>
            <li> I buy this spiking gel for my boyfriend.  He won&#x27;t use any other product and his hair always looks great.</li>
            <li> The product was more watery than what I get at the salon, and the box was a little beaten up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use in addition to a thickener like American Crew Fiber/Forming Cream or Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream.  It will also do just fine on it&#x27;s own, but takes a little practice to get the amount just right.  Be warned that if you use too much of this, or of the other product if you use this supplementally, your hair may have a greasy look.  This is best used sparingly, and with little fiddling.  Great strong hold, and lasts a long time.  Don&#x27;t get hair wet at all, or the hold will break down completely.</li>
            <li> Yes this product has good hold but do you plan on wearing it around living things? I wouldn&#x27;t advise it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff to keep his hair in place.  It&#x27;s hard to find in salons though. So this price is awesome!</li>
