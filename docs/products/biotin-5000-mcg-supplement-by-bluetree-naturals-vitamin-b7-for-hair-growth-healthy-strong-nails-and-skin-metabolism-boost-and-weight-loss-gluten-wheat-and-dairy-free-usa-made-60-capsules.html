            <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>

            <li>They are strong, and grow much faster than I have ever noticed them growing before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stopped taking it to see if I was right</li>
            <li>I have been trying this for a little over 3 weeks now and have noticed my nails have never looked as good as they have been.  </li>
            <li>They do grow but they are so soft that they break like super super</li>
            <li>I have noticed my nails are definitely stronger and my hair has begun to change for the better.</li>

            <li>The benefits of Biotin for hair/skin/nails have not only been documented, but proven by many who use and adore it&#x27;s benefits.   </li>

            <li>I should also point out that I do at home gel nail color more often than if I went to the salon, so that takes an extra toil on my nails..</li>

            <li>My nails feel stronger and are not breaking as much (which is often a problem for me in the winter).  </li>

            <li>Great product, have been taking biotin for months with visible results, less hair loss and improvements to grey hair.</li>
            <li>Usually my nails are very brittle I&#x27;ve notice that their so much stronger and growing a nice length haven&#x27;t seen that in years.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I am a 30 year old female, with brittle nails, hair that breaks easily, and with non-severe, but persistent adult acne.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! If you want something that will help your hair and nails grow longer and stronger then you should definitely try this out! Works great! No complaints at all. Shipped quickly and arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of biotin supplements and I can say that I like this one and I do seem to notice that my nail beds are stronger. I haven&#x27;t seen any additional hair growth or shine but I do notice that when shampooing and pulling conditioner through my hair I do not seem to be getting as many strands of hair pulled out in between my fingers s maybe that will come with more use. I don&#x27;t have any issues swallowing the biotin and have not noticed any trouble with my stomach or dehydration etc. I prefer taking this to all the phyto supplements you have to take 3 times a day in order to get the same benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using this biotin for several weeks and I am already seeing a difference in my hair.  It is shinier and feels softer.  My nails feel stronger and are not breaking as much (which is often a problem for me in the winter).  So I am sold on this and will be continuing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling better every day. I have been taking this product for 1 week and I am already feeling much more energetic and healthy. My nails are stronger then they ever have been.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!! My nails and hair grew over night. Stopped taking it to see if I was right and yes, I was!!! Great product</li>
            <li> Price is good. Biotin works for my hair and nails. good product.</li>
            <li> Great quality and easy to take.  They are a great addition to my supplement regimen.</li>
            <li> Great product, have been taking biotin for months with visible results, less hair loss and improvements to grey hair. Should drink plenty of water with it.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow nails and figured I&#x27;d give this product a try. I purchased these to strengthen my nails and get my hair to grow faster too. I have noticed my nails are definitely stronger and my hair has begun to change for the better. So far so good. I have added them to my daily vitamins.</li>
            <li> I got it in a good price...Happy!</li>
            <li> It feels very satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt; In response to feeling hair becomes thicker&lt;br /&gt; I have felt the effect of hair loss is also improved&lt;br /&gt; Then, I&#x27;d like to become to prefer this product</li>
            <li> Price is also cheap, the product is also more than expected seller willing to very kindly answering&lt;br /&gt;Please buy good things comfortably</li>
            <li> My nails amd skin love these biotin vitimans! I will update with more results in about a month.</li>
            <li> Thank you Bluetree for a great quality Biotin supplement! Speedy fulfillment of my order too. Can&#x27;t wait to see and share my hair/nail results!</li>
            <li> No wired taste first of all. Then the health fact is listed completely and correctly, which is really important for supplement.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for 10 days now.&lt;br /&gt;I waited a few days to write this review just to see.&lt;br /&gt;I have the softest nails I have ever seen on anyone. They do grow but they are so soft that they break like super super quick.&lt;br /&gt;I have also been having issues with my hair being brittle these days and not growing as well as it should.&lt;br /&gt;After 10 days I for sure see a difference in my nails. They are growing and at least half of them are strong then when I started taking them.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has only grown about a 1/2 inch but I feel like I do not lose as much hair as before so it must be at least making it stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I will update after taking the bottle!!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for my honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> These are average to small sized capsules.  I don&#x27;t encounter any problems taking it or any after effects.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to constantly eat well.</li>
            <li> The benefits of Biotin for hair/skin/nails have not only been documented, but proven by many who use and adore it&#x27;s benefits.   I can honestly say it is going to be a supplement I continue taking.  I have been trying this for a little over 3 weeks now and have noticed my nails have never looked as good as they have been.  I have never been one to be lucky enough to have beautiful shapely nails.  Within the last week I am amazed at the way they are growing and know I owe it to the Biotin as that&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve changed.  The pills are easy to take and have no crazy aftertaste.  I would strongly recommend this product if you are looking for results like I&#x27;ve seen!  I was offered to try Bluetree Naturals at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Love it!</li>
            <li> Good!! Very Nice !!! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed...my hairstylist suggested Biotin to help my hair grow and it seems to be helping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for 30 days. My skin looks so much healthier and softer. Usually my nails are very brittle I&#x27;ve notice that their so much stronger and growing a nice length haven&#x27;t seen that in years. I recently went natural and my hair has been so soft and manageable I&#x27;m so happy that I haven&#x27;t had any breakage This is a very good product..  .</li>
            <li> Goods you received you are very happy&lt;br /&gt;,, You are the best of the seller</li>
            <li> fast ship and good. thankd</li>
            <li> cute case, I prefer small case with full substance like this to bigbig case with so much air...</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I am a 30 year old female, with brittle nails, hair that breaks easily, and with non-severe, but persistent adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research before taking this supplement, as I always do and saw some disturbing instances of worsening acne, but quite assuring reviews of incredible results for nails and hair, so I decided to try it. I should also point out that I do at home gel nail color more often than if I went to the salon, so that takes an extra toil on my nails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed with 2 months of usage:&lt;br /&gt;1) My nails look better than they have in my entire life. They are strong, and grow much faster than I have ever noticed them growing before.&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair seems to not break as easily. I have never had thin hair, it just has always broken. But I have noticed a lot less split, broken ends.&lt;br /&gt;3) My skin has noticeably improved, but I do not think it is because of this product. Although It could be? I started a very strict, very complex skin care regimen a month or so before I started using this Biotin, so I cannot actually say that this did anything to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I would recommend if you need help with hair breakage, and ESPECIALLY brittle nails. And if the acne thing is steering you off,  I would still recommend trying it just to see if it works before you count it out.  Worked for me with no bad side effects!</li>
            <li> I have weak nails and these have helped.</li>
