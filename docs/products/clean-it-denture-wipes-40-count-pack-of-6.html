            <li>I love this wipe</li>
            <li>these work so much better than a tissue or paper towel.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>A paper towel works better.</li>
            <li>This product works much better than paper towels or tissues.  </li>
            <li>to better your product maybe add abit of rougher material.</li>
            <li>I will make sure I always have an ample supply.</li>
            <li>Love your product would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I guess it will be a while before I need to order more.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this many times, and will again</li>
            <li>OK, I fell for it.....</li>
            <li>I use to use napkins but the paper stuck to the goo or my dentures causing more agravation.</li>
            <li>A bit more of a problem, but</li>
            <li>Rinse mouth with warm to hot water</li>
            <li>a paper towel works fine.</li>
            <li>These little wipes are AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>Since I am still in the healing stage the dentures fit changes often and I use quite a bit of adhesive  to keep them in place.</li>
            <li>You start in a corner and wipe until you get a good ball, then fold the wipe on itself and wipe some more doing the same until all the goo is gone.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good when I dip it in vinager and water first.</li>
            <li>Remove top glue first then bottom.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I read the description of this product.  </li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>I like the way that they clean the gunk from dentures.</li>
            <li>These wipes are slightly abrasive (Won&#x27;t scratch dentures) making wipeing the goo off more successful.</li>
            <li>I was totally excited to find a product that would \\&quot;magically\\&quot; and quickly remove the goo from denture paste or strips from the gum and denture plate.</li>
            <li>D.O.C. Cleans most areas in one pass and makes cleanup much easier.</li>
            <li>And in fact, it was not as good, because it was thinner and smaller, so he had to use two or three instead of one 4&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34; gauze pad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make you a good deal on the 230 I have left.</li>
            <li>There is no better and free of unnatural components adhesive on the market than Secure denture adhesive ... and I clean my dentures with those wipes ... works great ...</li>
            <li>Looked all over for this for a few years, it&#x27;s a really great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to act like a magnet for the adhesive... comes right out.  </li>
            <li>they clean up much easier.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.for the price I was only expecting one box imagine my surprise when I got so many!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work half as good as they said.</li>
            <li>got them for a pretty cheap price, so live and learn I guess.</li>
            <li>I find wetting them works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Running hot water over it is preferable</li>
            <li>Very helpful!</li>
            <li>The sheets are slick, slippery, nonabsorbent and good for?????  </li>
            <li>My husband is new to dentures and this product has been so useful to him.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t remove gummy paste any better that a dry washcloth.</li>
            <li>If I purchased the only remaining box from AMAZON, y&#x27;all best order some more pronto for my next purchase or there&#x27;s gonna be some BIG trouble brewing!</li>
            <li>your money on these things, as a wet paper towel will work much better.</li>
            <li>must have needed to get rid of them fast.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, able to get into the smallest of spaces, works well wet or dry, no brushing is needed.</li>
            <li>It took almost an entire box of the wipes to clean the stuff off my gums and it just won&#x27;t take the stuff off my dentures at all.  </li>
            <li>a quick brushing with toothpaste, especially with a vibrating toothbrush, is much easier and quicker than this stuff.  </li>
            <li>A quick soak in a cleaning solution, no brushing even necessary.  </li>
            <li>I am a new denture  wearer and still have the &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; dentures.</li>
            <li>I should have enough for months to come what a bargain thanks so much.</li>
            <li>They are not as good as they say but are alot less messy then anything else I have come across or tried when the adhesive sticks to the roof of your mouth.</li>
            <li>but all it does is take a tiny bit and the rest snaps right back onto my gums or the dentures.  </li>
            <li>The Denture Wipes work beautifully to remove this residue without irritating the gums or leaving a smeary mess in the wearer&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li>I bought 6 boxes of these and they do not work any better than plain old toilet paper or paper towels.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I could find the Denture Wipes at local stores, then, all of a sudden, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in Nashville.     </li>
            <li>It works very well and beats using a paper towel by a long shot!</li>
            <li>I am able to wipe both dentures with just one wipe making it inexpensive and less messy than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>It does take scrubbing, brushing and makes a huge wet soggy mess.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the dry washcloth works better.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive about them is that they are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Not too much to say other than what is described on the box.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;These wipes are thin slick dry pieces of tissue material that didn&#x27;t magically do anything.</li>
            <li> i am using a dry wash rag to wipe out the goop fr roof</li>
            <li> but i find using two still slides over the roof areas needing dry rag strength.im</li>
            <li> it both wet and dry sheets.</li>
            <li> The fibers in the wipe seem to grab onto that gooey mess left from the adhesives.</li>
            <li> , be careful, it&#x27;s your mouth.  </li>
            <li> They know no one who tries it will ever order it again.  </li>
            <li> When dentures are removed, usually a residue of denture adhesive cream is left on the gums and \\&quot;icky\\</li>
            <li> If you use denture adhesive you will want these little wipes at hand.  </li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My husband has so much trouble getting the denture adhesive off the roof of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money since non-alcoholic beer.  </li>
            <li> I found these a few years ago and now they cannot be found in stores.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not much better than a paper towel.</li>
            <li> What a big disappointment and what a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to find anything that gets that glue off your teeth, out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;wipes&amp;#34; do everything they say they will - with hardly any effort!  </li>
            <li> I know why  Amazon sells this crap only in quantities of 240 items.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product does not work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Until I used this product it was difficult to get the residue off my gums.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> was making my life miserable!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Anyone wearing dentures knows the necessity of proper dental hygiene. I was introduced to this product by a dentist who is also a close friend.  When I first started using it, I could find the Denture Wipes at local stores, then, all of a sudden, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in Nashville.     When dentures are removed, usually a residue of denture adhesive cream is left on the gums and \\&quot;icky\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t begin to describe the feeling!  The Denture Wipes work beautifully to remove this residue without irritating the gums or leaving a smeary mess in the wearer&#x27;s mouth.  I am a three (3) year veteran denture wearer and I&#x27;d be up the proverbial creek without a paddle (or rather, without a Denture Wipe!)minus them.  If I purchased the only remaining box from AMAZON, y&#x27;all best order some more pronto for my next purchase or there&#x27;s gonna be some BIG trouble brewing! Your ad describes this product to a T: \\&quot;No scrubbing. No brushing. No mess\\&quot; and believe you me, IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Should have heeded the advice in another review of this product and saved my money! The sheets are slick, slippery, nonabsorbent and good for?????  Paper towels work better.  Buy rolls of \\&quot;Bounty\\&quot; instead--waaaay more effective.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product as to getting the Denture Paste off my gums and roof of mouth as well as the Dentures Themselves.  Unfortunately the product does not work as advertised.  In fact it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It took almost an entire box of the wipes to clean the stuff off my gums and it just won&#x27;t take the stuff off my dentures at all.  It states on the box that these wipes have a magnetic-like pull on the paste but all it does is take a tiny bit and the rest snaps right back onto my gums or the dentures.  It does take scrubbing, brushing and makes a huge wet soggy mess.  I don&#x27;t use them anymore.  Would not recommend this product to any denture wearer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great results.  Very satisfied with this product, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a truly great product for anyone struggling with denture adhesives. The fibers in the wipe seem to grab onto that gooey mess left from the adhesives. I love this wipe</li>
            <li> Looked all over for this for a few years, it&#x27;s a really great product.  Don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer carried by any&lt;br /&gt;of the stores in my area.  Now I have enough to last probably the rest of my life.  Thanx</li>
            <li> these work so much better than a tissue or paper towel. they clean up much easier.</li>
            <li> They are not as good as they say but are alot less messy then anything else I have come across or tried when the adhesive sticks to the roof of your mouth. I find wetting them works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely worthless. I had better luck with a paper towel. My advise is to NOT purchase this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My husband is new to dentures and this product has been so useful to him.  He needs to use a lot of denture cream for his temporary dentures and that leaves a lot of residue on the dentures when he removes them.  He uses these daily</li>
            <li> This product was not all it was advertised, it is better to use a warm washcloth!</li>
            <li> I bought 6 boxes of these and they do not work any better than plain old toilet paper or paper towels.  What a big disappointment and what a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Not much better than a paper towel.</li>
            <li> I was totally excited to find a product that would \\&quot;magically\\&quot; and quickly remove the goo from denture paste or strips from the gum and denture plate. I waited in anticipation!! Boy, was I disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are thin slick dry pieces of tissue material that didn&#x27;t magically do anything. They didn&#x27;t remove gummy paste any better that a dry washcloth. Actually, the dry washcloth works better.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive about them is that they are disposable.&lt;br /&gt;Will never but them again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. A paper towel works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if I could.  Don&amp;#34;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Work well .you have to learn to use these . Directions help but not the only way to use them .</li>
            <li> Running hot water over it is preferable</li>
            <li> This product works much better than paper towels or tissues.  For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t fall apart in your mouth like a tissue does.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to act like a magnet for the adhesive... comes right out.  Also you can rinse the wipe and it still holds up for a final wipe of the gums or dentures.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work half as good as they said. I have used it 8 times. Will probably not use it again. And I bought 6 boxes.</li>
            <li> Remove teeth. Rinse mouth with warm to hot water, be careful, it&#x27;s your mouth.  Remove top glue first then bottom. Finish with paper towel if necessary.  Voila! It works for me.  I would give them 5 stars if the paper towel step was never necessary.</li>
            <li> Recieved D.o.c. Denture Wipes in a timely manner and for a good price. Will purchase again if D.o.c. Denture Wipes are kept in stock.</li>
            <li> This was the 3rd time we have purchased it through Amazon.  Very helpful!</li>
            <li> Great Product..Your Cleaning Denture Gum Days Are Over...One Pad Cleans-It All... Love It !!!</li>
            <li> I like the way that they clean the gunk from dentures. They do make them feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> i am using a dry wash rag to wipe out the goop fr roof o fmouth..tho it bleeds if i wear n wipe too soon in between. prayed the wipes i ordered would work but i find using two still slides over the roof areas needing dry rag strength.im sorry i ordered so many boxes actually but what can ya do? to better your product maybe add abit of rougher material.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t take off any of any paste in your mouth or your dentures.&lt;br /&gt;Tried it both wet and dry sheets.</li>
            <li> This product goes on the short list of  products that do as claimed. I am a new denture  wearer and still have the &amp;#34;immediate&amp;#34; dentures. Since I am still in the healing stage the dentures fit changes often and I use quite a bit of adhesive  to keep them in place. Until I used this product it was difficult to get the residue off my gums. D.O.C. Cleans most areas in one pass and makes cleanup much easier. I will make sure I always have an ample supply.</li>
            <li> they make taking the adhesive off a breeze without chemicals it just the texture of the cloth that binds the adhesive there great</li>
            <li> Not too much to say other than what is described on the box.  It works very well and beats using a paper towel by a long shot!</li>
            <li> They work that is all I can say . I use them every day what else can I say they work.</li>
            <li> For a new denture user, what a life saver!works perfectly! Love your product would recommend to anyone. Fast shipping.for the price I was only expecting one box imagine my surprise when I got so many! I should have enough for months to come what a bargain thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I just got it...waiting to see how it fulfills the claims.</li>
            <li> I order these for my brother, he says they work great. I thought I was ordering 4 boxes of 40, whoops. I ordered 4 cases, so he got 960 of these things. I guess it will be a while before I need to order more.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I read the description of this product.  My husband has so much trouble getting the denture adhesive off the roof of his mouth.  He uses gauze pads because they don&#x27;t disintegrate in his mouth like a tissue.  Unfortunately, it did not work any better than the gauze pad.  And in fact, it was not as good, because it was thinner and smaller, so he had to use two or three instead of one 4&amp;#34; x 4&amp;#34; gauze pad.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;wipes&amp;#34; do everything they say they will - with hardly any effort!  Thank you for this product - I&#x27;m a recent denture wearer and getting the adhesive off the roof of my mouth was making my life miserable!  Thank you, again!</li>
            <li> These little wipes are AWESOME!  They will instantly remove any and all adhesive from the gums and/or roof of the mouth.  They have made my nightly routine a breeze.  If you use denture adhesive you will want these little wipes at hand.  They are the best!</li>
            <li> Very good at removing denture creams. I have ordered this many times, and will again</li>
            <li> OK, I fell for it.....D.O.C., you got me good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are just a bit thicker than the one-ply toilet paper.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry, not only do they NOT remove adhesive [from gums OR dentures],&lt;br /&gt;they actually spread the adhesive around, making it even more difficult&lt;br /&gt;to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I got them for a pretty cheap price, so live and learn I guess. But please don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;waste your money on these things, as a wet paper towel will work much better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  Didn&#x27;t get the adhesive off the roof of my mouth. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> i should have ordered only one box, but i jumped in and ordered the one that had 5 boxes for 19.95. must have needed to get rid of them fast. they do not not work. i read quite afew reviews pros and cons and decided to see for my self. what a waste of money. a paper towel works fine. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be wonderful. I use to use napkins but the paper stuck to the goo or my dentures causing more agravation. These wipes are slightly abrasive (Won&#x27;t scratch dentures) making wipeing the goo off more successful. You start in a corner and wipe until you get a good ball, then fold the wipe on itself and wipe some more doing the same until all the goo is gone. It leaves no traces of goo. I am able to wipe both dentures with just one wipe making it inexpensive and less messy than anything else I have tried. I would recommend these wipes to anyone. I guess people just need to know the process for using them. (Don&#x27;t start wipeing in the middle of the wipe, start in a corner so you can roll as you go.) GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Very good product! Works as described.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good when I dip it in vinager and water first.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, able to get into the smallest of spaces, works well wet or dry, no brushing is needed.</li>
            <li> Wipes work but it&#x27;s hard to find anything that gets that glue off your teeth, out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money since non-alcoholic beer.  I know why  Amazon sells this crap only in quantities of 240 items.  They know no one who tries it will ever order it again.  To remove adhesive from dentures?  A quick soak in a cleaning solution, no brushing even necessary.  From your mouth?  A bit more of a problem, but a quick brushing with toothpaste, especially with a vibrating toothbrush, is much easier and quicker than this stuff.  Anyone still want some?  I&#x27;ll make you a good deal on the 230 I have left.</li>
            <li> There is no better and free of unnatural components adhesive on the market than Secure denture adhesive ... and I clean my dentures with those wipes ... works great ...</li>
            <li> I found these a few years ago and now they cannot be found in stores. IMy husband loves these wipes.</li>
