            <li>These are great light colors for my daughter and the rest I gave as gifts.</li>
            <li>I would buy again also looks nice on</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and they apply nicely...</li>
            <li>They are great alone or on top of lipstick for more shine.</li>
            <li>Nice colors</li>
            <li>Nice lip gloss....</li>
            <li>nothing else about I liked.</li>
            <li>Nice variety.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the colors, but 2 out of the 6 were good.</li>
            <li>I LIKED ALL THE COLORS BECAUSE THEY COULD MATCH ANY ONE OF MY MOODS.  </li>
            <li>, you know it is nice.</li>
            <li>A bit sticky but that goes away and even when it dries up it leaves a nice shimmer on your lips.</li>
            <li>nice bought for stocking stuffers for granddaughters</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great idea to give these as gifts to special  friends.</li>
            <li>great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li>I bought better stuff for a dollar that was million times better and stayed on!</li>
            <li>This set of lip gloss would be ideal for girls playing dress up or pre-teens who aren&#x27;t very particular about the way gloss should feel on their lips.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super pleased that I got all six of the colors!!</li>
            <li>anyhow its nice but not that good..spend some more money and buy something else</li>
            <li>I love to put on my color of lipstick and put this over my lipstick, it just makes my lips shine and have color, but even alone they are nice to wear to.</li>
            <li>This is a great lipgloss if you&#x27;re the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t really want a color pay off from your lipglosses.</li>
            <li>and you will be ok</li>
            <li>Love...</li>
            <li>i was expecting it to be much better than what i got..</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more color, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Love the variety.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They look even better in person.</li>
            <li>thought this lip gloss was okay for the price</li>
            <li>love the colors.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, I never had lip gloss until now</li>
            <li>Gonna order some more üëç</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very shiny and look great.</li>
            <li>and I kinda love them too.</li>
            <li>The colors are lovely and the formula is not yuckily sticky.</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>I love the variety</li>
            <li>I love these and so affordable</li>
            <li>I like thicker more color and shimmer in one lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is to use 2-3 together, to match any eye makeup or outfit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>LOVE THE BEAUTY TREATS SHIMMERY LIP GLOSS SET 6 COLORS.  </li>
            <li>Love all these colors.</li>
            <li>Ordering more for me and giving away as treats.</li>
            <li>It is nothing more than glorified vaseline in a tube.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed applying all six lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>Most of the colors work for me.</li>
            <li>So cute</li>
            <li>my sister absolutely love them</li>
            <li>I love it gloss.</li>
            <li>Perfect to just wear around the house, at the beach, love the size of the bottles very cute, not too small.</li>
            <li>Great colors, nice shine and just enough glitter.</li>
            <li>Nice size tubes and a pretty shimmer!</li>
            <li>She loves to have lip gloss in her purse, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy these.  </li>
            <li>And paired with the right liner it becomes amazing.</li>
            <li>Other then that these are great!</li>
            <li>She loves the colors and said the application is easy and they wear well.  </li>
            <li>IT IS EASILY APPLIED TO THE LIPS.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m proud to wear something of such great quality that I know did not harm to any creatures, great or small.</li>
            <li>pretty colors and nice feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li>Because there is no flavor and no scents, they were less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with it, but others might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very glittery- better for teens!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I ordered disposable lipstick wands so they stay germ free.</li>
            <li>Great color choices and a LOT of product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>You can mix the colors to soften the bright colors and boost the soft colors.  </li>
            <li>kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>cheap product</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>Love that these feel good and not sticky, but only one has a tint.</li>
            <li>I absolutely ADORE this lip gloss!!!</li>
            <li>These lip gloss comes in very nice cool simple colors and are great for adults or teen girls day or night</li>
            <li>They‚Äôre sticky and barely add any color but worth the price and great to have on hand when I forget my chapstick at home.</li>
            <li>It was a great value, I was able to keep half the set.</li>
            <li>Great product,  Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but there are better sets to purchase for the same price point.</li>
            <li>The shiny aspect was somewhat ok for certain colors but not all of them.</li>
            <li>This came just in time to give as gifts to 4 special friends.  </li>
            <li>I got this set for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Overall they are a good value.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the Fast delivery of these top quality lip glosses‚ò∫</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit sticky, but not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice lip gloss,but had to keep reapplying more than one application over,and over,because lips felt dry.</li>
            <li>So the quality isnt that great, I&#x27;d go with some other glosses.</li>
            <li>So the colors are reallllly cute, and the little bottles they come in are good size for your purse or cluthc.</li>
            <li>She is on a constant quest to find the right color and this set is the perfect way to test out a bunch of different colors without making a huge investment.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>When I tried the colors on they were more than sheer, they had a lot more color than I thought.</li>
            <li>I was looking this for my wife and when I saw this kit groups, is the best choice to last you a long time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a small group of natural light colors, this&#x27;ll be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it added enough color to my lips, but the sparkle was amazing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s very little color, and she would have a great time mimicking Mommy.</li>
            <li>The colors are easy to be matched with common lipstick colors and also they look good if you wear them alone.  </li>
            <li>I really like them, they are not dark at all, I was afraid 2 of them would not look good, but since they are very light, they all look good on me.</li>
            <li>I only gave it three stars because the color is not as vibrant and rich as shown in picture, and it&#x27;s sticky like most lip glosses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not my cup of tea for a lip gloss, but they received 3 stars for arriving on time, looking exactly as pictured in the photo, and received all products that was advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was interested in the orangish colors first</li>
            <li>She is a big fan and is so glad that she has the whole set!</li>
            <li>and they are really pretty</li>
            <li>The colors are nice some were lighter than expected, giving a more sheer color while others gave off quite pronounced color.</li>
            <li>If you used a thicker coat of the gloss the color would be more obvious.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors even though they are similar.</li>
            <li>First time buyer of any beauty treats products....</li>
            <li>* Be aware that the lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really change the color of your lips like others</li>
            <li>The overall product was pretty good, but it is VERY sheer, I was hoping for something a little more pigmented, but other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, and I was a little unsure about some of the colors (I&#x27;m 20) but they are all nice, seeing as the color of the lip gloss isn&#x27;t the color that your lips will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lip glosses are shiny and shimmery, not too much color shows up unless you apply tons of layers(and</li>
            <li>However the colors are very light/transparent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfy with them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast (it is December 30th and the shipping says shipping.</li>
            <li>But does have more color than I expected.</li>
            <li>The description doesn&#x27;t say that these have them, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much NOT having</li>
            <li>The colors are really versatile</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend these lip glosses to others!  </li>
            <li>Initially the gloss feels smooth, and somewhat moisturizing.</li>
            <li>So much makeup for your money.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It leaves lips feeling moist, and it naturally gets absorbed into lips without crudding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>colored, very shimmery.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It came in and I was surprised because the colors were so pretty.</li>
            <li>Everyone that I have them to was surprised&amp; commented on how pretty they were.  </li>
            <li>but I put mines over lipstick to make the color a little more vibrant!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or dry.  </li>
            <li>the high gloss and feel on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I wanted the little girls to be able to pick which color they wanted during our &amp;#34;glamour&amp;#34; parties.</li>
            <li>but I wish the product was a little better quality.</li>
            <li>A little more deeper in color.</li>
            <li>This is probably okay for a little girl&#x27;s play set.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, very thick gloss.</li>
            <li>Very Fast Delivery, These were very nice, but a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li>These glosses are so light you can barely see anything but a tiny bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li>I find it is just as good as Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li>but it turned out that they don&#x27;t add enough color to really change the color of my lipstick anyways as long as I only used a very light coat.  </li>
            <li>The tints were more subtle than I expected making all of them extremely wearable without being too bright.</li>
            <li>and I thought, alright I can put the pink ones aside and just use the 2 orange ones and it&#x27;ll be still worthy</li>
            <li>Very moist, but much, much lighter color than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Completely recommend</li>
            <li>24 years old and 27 years old</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced and just the perfact item for the pre-teen and teen girl.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too much of glitter and not enough of gloss!</li>
            <li>The colors seem to be sheer but she really likes them.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR TEENS AND THE YOUNG AT HEART.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my 5 year old granddaughter for play makeup.  </li>
            <li>over all its a good product but its not a great product....i would use this as a gloss over my lipstick because the colors are not pigmented enough...</li>
            <li>Love the colors, soft on the lips not to thick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying these two items definitely added to ending the night on a high note.</li>
            <li>They do have shimmer, but not thick enough for color coverage.  </li>
            <li>The lip gloss is cheaply made, it absorbs in your skin after a few minutes it does not even stay shiney at all!</li>
            <li>you want them to be that dark on your lips, this is not for you, they are very light, even though some look dark.</li>
            <li>And barely anything comes out on the brush when you pull it out.</li>
            <li>Not clear and glossy with a hint of color and not creamy like other lorac but a little bit more sticky.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is not real \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; is why I tracked this particular lip</li>
            <li>but you could barely see anything until after several coats...</li>
            <li>All colors are very clear, not much tint to this lip gloss.</li>

            <li> girls loved the gloss, colors and size works perfect for side pockets in handbag.</li>
            <li> The best part, beyond the colors being gorgeous and not overpowering, is that these are cruelty-free lip glosses that are not tested on animals.  </li>

            <li> Thought it was good but doesn&#x27;t have the good quality of lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and good price</li>
            <li> very good but light color</li>

            <li> I just went to town and bought more!</li>
            <li> I was in love with all of them!</li>
            <li> LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I love all the shades!</li>
            <li> It could have been better!</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors!  </li>
            <li> I love these lip gloss!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> You will absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> These are great light colors for my daughter and the rest I gave as gifts.</li>
            <li> I would buy again also looks nice on</li>
            <li> The colors are nice and they apply nicely...</li>
            <li> They are great alone or on top of lipstick for more shine.</li>
            <li> Nice colors</li>
            <li> Nice lip gloss....</li>
            <li> nothing else about I liked.</li>
            <li> Nice variety.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the colors, but 2 out of the 6 were good.</li>
            <li> I LIKED ALL THE COLORS BECAUSE THEY COULD MATCH ANY ONE OF MY MOODS.  </li>
            <li> , you know it is nice.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky but that goes away and even when it dries up it leaves a nice shimmer on your lips.</li>
            <li> nice bought for stocking stuffers for granddaughters</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea to give these as gifts to special  friends.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I bought better stuff for a dollar that was million times better and stayed on!</li>
            <li> This set of lip gloss would be ideal for girls playing dress up or pre-teens who aren&#x27;t very particular about the way gloss should feel on their lips.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super pleased that I got all six of the colors!!</li>
            <li> anyhow its nice but not that good..spend some more money and buy something else</li>
            <li> I love to put on my color of lipstick and put this over my lipstick, it just makes my lips shine and have color, but even alone they are nice to wear to.</li>
            <li> This is a great lipgloss if you&#x27;re the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t really want a color pay off from your lipglosses.</li>
            <li> and you will be ok</li>
            <li> Love...</li>
            <li> i was expecting it to be much better than what i got..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for more color, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Love the variety.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They look even better in person.</li>
            <li> thought this lip gloss was okay for the price</li>
            <li> love the colors.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I never had lip gloss until now</li>
            <li> Gonna order some more üëç</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very shiny and look great.</li>
            <li> and I kinda love them too.</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely and the formula is not yuckily sticky.</li>
            <li> This is okay</li>
            <li> I love the variety</li>
            <li> I love these and so affordable</li>
            <li> I like thicker more color and shimmer in one lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is to use 2-3 together, to match any eye makeup or outfit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BEAUTY TREATS SHIMMERY LIP GLOSS SET 6 COLORS.  </li>
            <li> Love all these colors.</li>
            <li> Ordering more for me and giving away as treats.</li>
            <li> It is nothing more than glorified vaseline in a tube.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed applying all six lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> Most of the colors work for me.</li>
            <li> So cute</li>
            <li> my sister absolutely love them</li>
            <li> I love it gloss.</li>
            <li> Perfect to just wear around the house, at the beach, love the size of the bottles very cute, not too small.</li>
            <li> Great colors, nice shine and just enough glitter.</li>
            <li> Nice size tubes and a pretty shimmer!</li>
            <li> She loves to have lip gloss in her purse, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy these.  </li>
            <li> And paired with the right liner it becomes amazing.</li>
            <li> Other then that these are great!</li>
            <li> She loves the colors and said the application is easy and they wear well.  </li>
            <li> IT IS EASILY APPLIED TO THE LIPS.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m proud to wear something of such great quality that I know did not harm to any creatures, great or small.</li>
            <li> pretty colors and nice feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li> Because there is no flavor and no scents, they were less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with it, but others might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very glittery- better for teens!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I ordered disposable lipstick wands so they stay germ free.</li>
            <li> Great color choices and a LOT of product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> You can mix the colors to soften the bright colors and boost the soft colors.  </li>
            <li> kinda cheap.</li>
            <li> cheap product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> Love that these feel good and not sticky, but only one has a tint.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this lip gloss!!!</li>
            <li> These lip gloss comes in very nice cool simple colors and are great for adults or teen girls day or night</li>
            <li> They‚Äôre sticky and barely add any color but worth the price and great to have on hand when I forget my chapstick at home.</li>
            <li> It was a great value, I was able to keep half the set.</li>
            <li> Great product,  Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but there are better sets to purchase for the same price point.</li>
            <li> The shiny aspect was somewhat ok for certain colors but not all of them.</li>
            <li> This came just in time to give as gifts to 4 special friends.  </li>
            <li> I got this set for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Overall they are a good value.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the Fast delivery of these top quality lip glosses‚ò∫</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit sticky, but not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice lip gloss,but had to keep reapplying more than one application over,and over,because lips felt dry.</li>
            <li> So the quality isnt that great, I&#x27;d go with some other glosses.</li>
            <li> So the colors are reallllly cute, and the little bottles they come in are good size for your purse or cluthc.</li>
            <li> She is on a constant quest to find the right color and this set is the perfect way to test out a bunch of different colors without making a huge investment.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> When I tried the colors on they were more than sheer, they had a lot more color than I thought.</li>
            <li> I was looking this for my wife and when I saw this kit groups, is the best choice to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a small group of natural light colors, this&#x27;ll be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it added enough color to my lips, but the sparkle was amazing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little color, and she would have a great time mimicking Mommy.</li>
            <li> The colors are easy to be matched with common lipstick colors and also they look good if you wear them alone.  </li>
            <li> I really like them, they are not dark at all, I was afraid 2 of them would not look good, but since they are very light, they all look good on me.</li>
            <li> I only gave it three stars because the color is not as vibrant and rich as shown in picture, and it&#x27;s sticky like most lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not my cup of tea for a lip gloss, but they received 3 stars for arriving on time, looking exactly as pictured in the photo, and received all products that was advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was interested in the orangish colors first</li>
            <li> She is a big fan and is so glad that she has the whole set!</li>
            <li> and they are really pretty</li>
            <li> The colors are nice some were lighter than expected, giving a more sheer color while others gave off quite pronounced color.</li>
            <li> If you used a thicker coat of the gloss the color would be more obvious.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors even though they are similar.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of any beauty treats products....</li>
            <li> * Be aware that the lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really change the color of your lips like others</li>
            <li> The overall product was pretty good, but it is VERY sheer, I was hoping for something a little more pigmented, but other than that, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and I was a little unsure about some of the colors (I&#x27;m 20) but they are all nice, seeing as the color of the lip gloss isn&#x27;t the color that your lips will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lip glosses are shiny and shimmery, not too much color shows up unless you apply tons of layers(and</li>
            <li> However the colors are very light/transparent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfy with them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast (it is December 30th and the shipping says shipping.</li>
            <li> But does have more color than I expected.</li>
            <li> The description doesn&#x27;t say that these have them, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much NOT having</li>
            <li> The colors are really versatile</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend these lip glosses to others!  </li>
            <li> Initially the gloss feels smooth, and somewhat moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So much makeup for your money.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It leaves lips feeling moist, and it naturally gets absorbed into lips without crudding.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> colored, very shimmery.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> It came in and I was surprised because the colors were so pretty.</li>
            <li> Everyone that I have them to was surprised&amp; commented on how pretty they were.  </li>
            <li> but I put mines over lipstick to make the color a little more vibrant!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or dry.  </li>
            <li> the high gloss and feel on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I wanted the little girls to be able to pick which color they wanted during our &amp;#34;glamour&amp;#34; parties.</li>
            <li> but I wish the product was a little better quality.</li>
            <li> A little more deeper in color.</li>
            <li> This is probably okay for a little girl&#x27;s play set.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, very thick gloss.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Delivery, These were very nice, but a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> These glosses are so light you can barely see anything but a tiny bit of shimmer.</li>
            <li> I find it is just as good as Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> but it turned out that they don&#x27;t add enough color to really change the color of my lipstick anyways as long as I only used a very light coat.  </li>
            <li> The tints were more subtle than I expected making all of them extremely wearable without being too bright.</li>
            <li> and I thought, alright I can put the pink ones aside and just use the 2 orange ones and it&#x27;ll be still worthy</li>
            <li> Very moist, but much, much lighter color than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Completely recommend</li>
            <li> 24 years old and 27 years old</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced and just the perfact item for the pre-teen and teen girl.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too much of glitter and not enough of gloss!</li>
            <li> The colors seem to be sheer but she really likes them.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR TEENS AND THE YOUNG AT HEART.  </li>
            <li> I gave this to my 5 year old granddaughter for play makeup.  </li>
            <li> over all its a good product but its not a great product....i would use this as a gloss over my lipstick because the colors are not pigmented enough...</li>
            <li> Love the colors, soft on the lips not to thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying these two items definitely added to ending the night on a high note.</li>
            <li> They do have shimmer, but not thick enough for color coverage.  </li>
            <li> The lip gloss is cheaply made, it absorbs in your skin after a few minutes it does not even stay shiney at all!</li>
            <li> you want them to be that dark on your lips, this is not for you, they are very light, even though some look dark.</li>
            <li> And barely anything comes out on the brush when you pull it out.</li>
            <li> Not clear and glossy with a hint of color and not creamy like other lorac but a little bit more sticky.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is not real \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; is why I tracked this particular lip</li>
            <li> but you could barely see anything until after several coats...</li>
            <li> All colors are very clear, not much tint to this lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight and small enough to fit in a small purse, yet it has enough product to last for a while.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lip gloss is a little on the sticky side, when the wind blows my hair it stick to my lip gloss but other than that i love the product</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sheer but with enough color to give a hint of pink, red or coral to your lips!</li>
            <li> Shine last a long time.</li>
            <li> It leaves your lips with a shimmering glow, long lasting  </li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but still as heavy and tacky as other lip glosses.</li>
            <li> The colors are  Hott n last long!</li>
            <li> The Only downside I found was that there is not very much in each bottle.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make my lips too sticky and the shimmer lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was like it sat in the sun for a while or was old and dried up</li>
            <li> Although I love all the colors in the set, it seems to take an awful lot to show their true colors upon application.</li>
            <li> Each color gives so much shine and subtle color.</li>
            <li> The gloss lasts for awhile and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lips dry after using and contains chemical that can damage my lips.</li>
            <li> the darker colors show up a little bit different, but don&#x27;t expect it to make your lips red or baby pink.</li>
            <li> It is possibly to apply over a lipstick to maintain the shimmer look, with less of a sticky feeling but with this method the color does not stay long.</li>
            <li> I have used other lorac lipgloss and these are different than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I am not sending it back because it is not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this set twice because I tend to loose lip glosses and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on them.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that if you find a color you really like it might be difficult to find it as a standalone item.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time on this one,</li>
            <li> Colors were just as expected.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about this product, was the way it was shipped / packaged.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this I only had the lighter pink color and was forced to order all 6.  </li>
            <li> mazing and a wide variety of colors that can suit any skin color.</li>
            <li> Totally can waste of money.....</li>
            <li> As expected it</li>
            <li> those features would mean to young girls.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would have to throw away the other colors</li>
            <li> I like the colors but the glitter in them wreck havoc on my lips dry them out and seems to cut them a little.</li>
            <li> gloss down because I cannot stand feeling the lip gloss on my lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping 3 and giving away the other 3 in Easter baskets!</li>
            <li> The color of the tube is not the color on your lips, it is a faint tint and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> if your thinking of not getting them due to this, don&#x27;t worry, you can&#x27;t tell that much, very little.  </li>
            <li> The gloss has a little sparkly glitter in it and is not too gooey (like a lot of lip glosses tend to be.)  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kinda like little girl lip gloss.</li>
            <li> But wish they were a little darker on.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> A little sticky, but I&#x27;ve never known a lip-gloss to not be sticky.</li>
            <li> No irritation and there is a little shine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this feeling does not last very long and gives way to a sticky feeling, although it is not tacky like you just ate candy sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Very little gloss in each tube, very dry, very little comes out on the brush.  </li>
            <li> but the gloss seems very heavy and a bit stickier that other glosses</li>
            <li> take the risk of some bad comments&amp;#34; it was worth it</li>
            <li> did not want to waste time sending it back tried one and hated it, too much stickiness and glitter for me.</li>
            <li> The bad thing, is that theres too much glitter inside for the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; part of it.</li>
            <li> at least 7 coats.</li>
            <li> These were a little disappointing because they don&#x27;t have a lot of color coverage.  </li>
            <li> I did not think you could go wrong with lip gloss -</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Out of the 6 tubes, 2 of the &amp;#34;wands&amp;#34; for applying the lip gloss are stuck in the tub and therefore rendering the product useless.  </li>
            <li> LAME.</li>
            <li> even then, the color is still very thin, not too visible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> read the reviews and saw some saying that the consistency was bad, and that it was made out of oil, and the applicator was broken, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any of these things.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for coverage, staying power, and shimmer you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate kissing my partner&#x27;s cheeks or lips because of its stickiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

            <li> This is a great lipgloss if you&#x27;re the kind of person who doesn&#x27;t really want a color pay off from your lipglosses. Or better yet, its best used WITH lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip glosses are shiny and shimmery, not too much color shows up unless you apply tons of layers(and even then, the color is still very thin, not too visible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my cup of tea for a lip gloss, but they received 3 stars for arriving on time, looking exactly as pictured in the photo, and received all products that was advertised.</li>
            <li> I like the colors but the glitter in them wreck havoc on my lips dry them out and seems to cut them a little. good price just use something underneath  these and you will be ok</li>
            <li> Love... Great colors, great size... Great price.. Score!</li>
            <li> i was expecting it to be much better than what i got..anyhow its nice but not that good..spend some more money and buy something else</li>
            <li> Loved the colors n stays on my lips during hours.&lt;br /&gt;Worth it!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AWESOME. I absolutely love it! Completely recommend</li>
            <li> Good for the price, very thick gloss.</li>
            <li> All colors are very clear, not much tint to this lip gloss.</li>
            <li> pretty colors and nice feeling on your lips. However the colors are very light/transparent. If you&#x27;re looking for more color, this isn&#x27;t it. If you&#x27;re looking for a small group of natural light colors, this&#x27;ll be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> The color are similar</li>
            <li> Very moist, but much, much lighter color than I expected.  Even the red is only a hint of color.</li>
            <li> Very little gloss in each tube, very dry, very little comes out on the brush.  I just went to town and bought more! Total waste of time on this one, oh well...</li>
            <li> I absolutely ADORE this lip gloss!!! It stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> Colors were just as expected.  Love the variety.  Goes on smoothly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> very good , I love it</li>
            <li> I love them. Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my bestfriend that loves lipglosses and she loved them! I&#x27;m Planning on getting my mom a set.</li>
            <li> This was one of the greatest deals I&#x27;ve ever had on amazon! I was interested in the orangish colors first and I thought, alright I can put the pink ones aside and just use the 2 orange ones and it&#x27;ll be still worthy but when they came in the mail I tried all of them with my own matching lipsticks and gosh! I was in love with all of them! Now, I have had them for almost 6 months and I&#x27;m absolutely satisfy with them. They don&#x27;t make my lips too sticky and the shimmer lasts for a long time. The colors are easy to be matched with common lipstick colors and also they look good if you wear them alone.  I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> bought it for a friend as a gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Great colors! They look even better in person. Nice size tubes and a pretty shimmer! I would buy again also looks nice on but I put mines over lipstick to make the color a little more vibrant!</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a gift for a friend and she let me know that she is very pleased with each gloss!  She loves the colors and said the application is easy and they wear well.  She is a big fan and is so glad that she has the whole set!</li>
            <li> thought this lip gloss was okay for the price just didn&#x27;t like the sticky feeling it left after applying.</li>
            <li> very good but light color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it added enough color to my lips, but the sparkle was amazing.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lip gloss thinking &amp;#34;ill take the risk of some bad comments&amp;#34; it was worth it I got all six and they are really pretty I like how they have the perfect amount of glitter and color also they are the perfect size for me the shipping was fast (it is December 30th and the shipping says shipping. the estimate date is January 2-7) it came in 4 days!!! I was so happy love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my 5yo granddaughter.  She loves to have lip gloss in her purse, and I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll enjoy these.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> I have used other lorac lipgloss and these are different than I expected. Does not have a fruity flavor or smell. But does have more color than I expected. Not clear and glossy with a hint of color and not creamy like other lorac but a little bit more sticky. Doesn&#x27;t stay sticky though and after a while I forget I have it on.</li>
            <li> love the colors. great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Like them, they were gifts for friends.  I thought it was a great idea to give these as gifts to special  friends.</li>
            <li> I got these for gifts for my nieces at Christmas time.  Because there is no flavor and no scents, they were less than impressed.  The description doesn&#x27;t say that these have them, but I didn&#x27;t realize how much NOT having those features would mean to young girls.  The colors are nice and they apply nicely...</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for a princess business I run. I wanted the little girls to be able to pick which color they wanted during our &amp;#34;glamour&amp;#34; parties. I ordered disposable lipstick wands so they stay germ free. For a lip gloss I could see the different colors once applied. I was not expecting that. The colors are a good variety and the kids loved them.</li>
            <li> Good deal and not sticky</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, I never had lip gloss until now and I&#x27;m super pleased that I got all six of the colors!! Gonna order some more üëç</li>
            <li> The overall product was pretty good, but it is VERY sheer, I was hoping for something a little more pigmented, but other than that, I am very pleased. üòÄüòÄüòÄ</li>
            <li> Great color choices and a LOT of product, especially for the price.  They are great alone or on top of lipstick for more shine.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and I was a little unsure about some of the colors (I&#x27;m 20) but they are all nice, seeing as the color of the lip gloss isn&#x27;t the color that your lips will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and saw some saying that the consistency was bad, and that it was made out of oil, and the applicator was broken, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with any of these things. It&#x27;s a tad bit sticky, but not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Be aware that the lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really change the color of your lips like others do- the darker colors show up a little bit different, but don&#x27;t expect it to make your lips red or baby pink. I&#x27;m fine with it, but others might not be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> The lip glosses are a great deal!  The colors are really versatile and I use them all the time.  You can mix the colors to soften the bright colors and boost the soft colors.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> as advertised. Great price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on these!  I also like the assortment of colors, the size and the texture of the gloss.  Would order again for a gift.</li>
            <li> I did not think you could go wrong with lip gloss - but boy did they...when you take out the applicator, the plastic insert pulls all the gloss off.....</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Each color gives so much shine and subtle color. Fr the price and color options you can&#x27;t go wrong. This is my second order and I will def continue to order these. One gloss for my purse, one for beach bag, one fr my office and the others are backup. A must have!</li>
            <li> Love that these feel good and not sticky, but only one has a tint. The others are different colors, but look the same on. Still like them, just have to add lipstick under for a hint of color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed! These glosses are so light you can barely see anything but a tiny bit of shimmer. I just ended up giving them to my daughter for play makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this set twice because I tend to loose lip glosses and don&#x27;t want to spend a lot on them.  Great purchase, great value, I highly recommend these lip glosses to others!  They&#x27;re very shiny and look great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors,  excellent price. I bought a set for my 2 nieces and they loved them too.  24 years old and 27 years old...I am 40 and still the colors are for every age.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors and sizes to carry this summer.  They&#x27;re sheer but with enough color to give a hint of pink, red or coral to your lips!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice some were lighter than expected, giving a more sheer color while others gave off quite pronounced color.The shiny aspect was somewhat ok for certain colors but not all of them. Initially the gloss feels smooth, and somewhat moisturizing. Unfortunately this feeling does not last very long and gives way to a sticky feeling, although it is not tacky like you just ate candy sticky feeling. If you continuously reapply it will re-deliver moisture. This set of lip gloss would be ideal for girls playing dress up or pre-teens who aren&#x27;t very particular about the way gloss should feel on their lips. It is possibly to apply over a lipstick to maintain the shimmer look, with less of a sticky feeling but with this method the color does not stay long. The colors are nice, but there are better sets to purchase for the same price point.</li>
            <li> Great product,  Stays on a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted variety. It came in and I was surprised because the colors were so pretty. I couldn&#x27;t wear all of them because they didn&#x27;t work well with my skin tone, so I gave them away. Everyone that I have them to was surprised&amp; commented on how pretty they were.  When I tried the colors on they were more than sheer, they had a lot more color than I thought. You could use them as a lip gloss or to enhance lipstick. It was a great value, I was able to keep half the set. I&#x27;d say it was a win/win.</li>
            <li> They‚Äôre sticky and barely add any color but worth the price and great to have on hand when I forget my chapstick at home.</li>
            <li> So the colors are reallllly cute, and the little bottles they come in are good size for your purse or cluthc. The bad thing, is that theres too much glitter inside for the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; part of it. When I apply it, I feel like i&#x27;m applying glitter foil pieces that were mixed in only a tiny bit of lipgloss. And barely anything comes out on the brush when you pull it out. So the quality isnt that great, I&#x27;d go with some other glosses.</li>
            <li> I was looking this for my wife and when I saw this kit groups, is the best choice to last you a long time. are of good quality and is a very good opportunity to buy at that price</li>
            <li> Gave the glosses as stocking stuffers...girls loved the gloss, colors and size works perfect for side pockets in handbag. Recommend</li>
            <li> These were perfect for the mason jar favors I hade made up for my bridal shower.  All the girls loved them!</li>
            <li> great colors, great price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Out of the 6 tubes, 2 of the &amp;#34;wands&amp;#34; for applying the lip gloss are stuck in the tub and therefore rendering the product useless.  The product itself is sticky, clumpy, and is gross overall.  Nice colors but I wish the product was a little better quality.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my teenage daughter and she absolutely loved it. The colors are great and I kinda love them too. I sometimes borrow it from her. The colors are lovely and the formula is not yuckily sticky.</li>
            <li> This is okay I guess. I love the variety but the gloss seems very heavy and a bit stickier that other glosses I&#x27;m use to. Overall they are a good value.</li>
            <li> Great colors, nice shine and just enough glitter. My wife loves all of the colors.</li>
            <li> Great lip gloss set! I love all the shades! These aren&#x27;t greasy and don&#x27;t smell gross.</li>
            <li> I really like them, they are not dark at all, I was afraid 2 of them would not look good, but since they are very light, they all look good on me. Perfect to just wear around the house, at the beach, love the size of the bottles very cute, not too small. The shimmer in them is not a lot of shimmer, so if your thinking of not getting them due to this, don&#x27;t worry, you can&#x27;t tell that much, very little.  If your looking for the darker color, meaning the colors you see you want them to be that dark on your lips, this is not for you, they are very light, even though some look dark. I love to put on my color of lipstick and put this over my lipstick, it just makes my lips shine and have color, but even alone they are nice to wear to.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a gift for someone I know who carries with her no fewer then 3 lip glosses at a time. She is on a constant quest to find the right color and this set is the perfect way to test out a bunch of different colors without making a huge investment. The only downside is that if you find a color you really like it might be difficult to find it as a standalone item.</li>
            <li> over all its a good product but its not a great product....i would use this as a gloss over my lipstick because the colors are not pigmented enough...but yea they last for a lil while so i would recommend carry you gloss with you to get you thru the day</li>
            <li> I love these and so affordable</li>
            <li> These were a little disappointing because they don&#x27;t have a lot of color coverage.  They do have shimmer, but not thick enough for color coverage.  I like thicker more color and shimmer in one lip gloss.  If you are looking for coverage, staying power, and shimmer you will be disappointed. The color of the tube is not the color on your lips, it is a faint tint and doesn&#x27;t last long.  These would be great for those people looking for a shimmer to go over their lipstick or lip liner.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the Fast delivery of these top quality lip glosses‚ò∫</li>
            <li> I got the L.A. COLORS Color Craze Mini Bright Nail Polish CNS125 Brights and Beauty Treats Shimmery Lip Gloss Set 6 Colors as items for my gifts bags on a &#x27;Girls night In&#x27;. I included &#x27;girlie&#x27; tweezers and nail files as well. Everyone loved their gift bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying these two items definitely added to ending the night on a high note.</li>
            <li> This product was sticky and I couldn&#x27;t get out of the bottle.  It was like it sat in the sun for a while or was old and dried up but I am not sending it back because it is not worth the effort.  I just know not to buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> So much makeup for your money. All the best colors of lipgloss. Compliments never stop. My favorite is to use 2-3 together, to match any eye makeup or outfit. Great for a gift.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice item.  I purchase a couple of sets of these as part of my granddaughter&#x27;s Christmas gift.  They are reasonably priced and just the perfact item for the pre-teen and teen girl.  Would I recomment this item....you betcha.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the lipgloss, it&#x27;s too much of glitter and not enough of gloss! It could have been better!</li>
            <li> Although I love all the colors in the set, it seems to take an awful lot to show their true colors upon application.</li>
            <li> The best part, beyond the colors being gorgeous and not overpowering, is that these are cruelty-free lip glosses that are not tested on animals.  I did the research and I&#x27;m proud to wear something of such great quality that I know did not harm to any creatures, great or small.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would look like the color on the bottles but you could barely see anything until after several coats...at least 7 coats.</li>
            <li> Not as i thought. A little more deeper in color.</li>
            <li> Nice lip gloss....great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors!  The gloss lasts for awhile and doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips.  I&#x27;m keeping 3 and giving away the other 3 in Easter baskets!</li>
            <li> These lip gloss comes in very nice cool simple colors and are great for adults or teen girls day or night</li>
            <li> I have used the product a couple times. I like the variety of colors and price was great. I would buy maybe just one color next time.</li>
            <li> Ordered something else and this came probably a  mistake on my part as I thought that I was ordering another brand by Victoria Jackson. did not want to waste time sending it back tried one and hated it, too much stickiness and glitter for me. I gave the rest away. gave it a star for the colors that were in the pack. nothing else about I liked.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked about this product, was the way it was shipped / packaged.  Horrible.  One plastic sandwich bag holding all the pieces together.</li>
            <li> Nice lip gloss,but had to keep reapplying more than one application over,and over,because lips felt dry.</li>
            <li> You get all 6 colors.  Prior to this I only had the lighter pink color and was forced to order all 6.  I thought I would have to throw away the other colors but it turned out that they don&#x27;t add enough color to really change the color of my lipstick anyways as long as I only used a very light coat.  If you used a thicker coat of the gloss the color would be more obvious.  The gloss has a little sparkly glitter in it and is not too gooey (like a lot of lip glosses tend to be.)  The fact that it is not real \\&quot;gooey\\&quot; is why I tracked this particular lip gloss down because I cannot stand feeling the lip gloss on my lips but I want the shine.</li>
            <li> I love these lip gloss! Their just as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great colors love these</li>
            <li> The colors are  Hott n last long! And paired with the right liner it becomes amazing. And it&#x27;s not sticky</li>
            <li> mazing and a wide variety of colors that can suit any skin color. Would definitely recommend this product to make-artists who are beginning their career in the make up industry! Perfect for practicing!</li>
            <li> Very glittery- better for teens!</li>
            <li> The lip gloss is cheaply made, it absorbs in your skin after a few minutes it does not even stay shiney at all! It&#x27;s made out of oil! there&#x27;s nothing glossy about it! LAME. I bought better stuff for a dollar that was million times better and stayed on! Try the shea butter lip glosses</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Very happy with the product</li>
            <li> Nice variety. I love the colors even though they are similar. The Only downside I found was that there is not very much in each bottle. Other then that these are great!</li>
            <li> Thought it was good but doesn&#x27;t have the good quality of lip gloss. Makes my lips dry after using and contains chemical that can damage my lips.</li>
            <li> Not enough pigmentation. The feel is a bit sticky. This is probably okay for a little girl&#x27;s play set. There&#x27;s very little color, and she would have a great time mimicking Mommy. For makeup divas and fashionistas, this product serves best as a somewhat sticky gloss over lip color that you&#x27;ve already applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s kinda like little girl lip gloss. kinda cheap. but it&#x27;s ok because the price is great!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the colors, but 2 out of the 6 were good.</li>
            <li> This came just in time to give as gifts to 4 special friends.  My mom got one too!  I picked one for myself.  It goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t feel clumpy or dry.  It leaves lips feeling moist, and it naturally gets absorbed into lips without crudding.&lt;br /&gt;I love it! May purchase it in the future!</li>
            <li> Gift for a granddaughter. She seems quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> These are one of the best brand lip gloss I have ever used!... Shine last a long time. You will absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my niece for Xmas. The colors seem to be sheer but she really likes them. Good price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE BEAUTY TREATS SHIMMERY LIP GLOSS SET 6 COLORS.  I LIKED ALL THE COLORS BECAUSE THEY COULD MATCH ANY ONE OF MY MOODS.  IT IS EASILY APPLIED TO THE LIPS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR TEENS AND THE YOUNG AT HEART.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Very Fast Delivery, These were very nice, but a little smaller than I expected or I would have given them 5 stars.  I would order again.  Was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love all these colors. But wish they were a little darker on.&lt;br /&gt;Love the high gloss and feel on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Love the tubes they come in.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use. Very nice, like them allot!</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> I work with lots of teen girls and if they like it, you know it is nice. The colors that were too red for me, I gave it away to the girls and they are using it. Ordering more for me and giving away as treats. Great for the price and excellent gift ideas when working with 60 plus girls.</li>
            <li> Great price and great company. I recommend this company for future purchases and I will shop again from this company.</li>
            <li> Totally can waste of money.....cheap product</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 5 year old granddaughter for play makeup.  It is nothing more than glorified vaseline in a tube.  No color on me what so ever. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, but still as heavy and tacky as other lip glosses. Arrived on time and good price but I want order again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, and packaged nicely.  I enjoyed applying all six lip glosses.  It can be combined with another lip gloss or lipstick to make the color come out darker. Its lightweight and small enough to fit in a small purse, yet it has enough product to last for a while.  I only gave it three stars because the color is not as vibrant and rich as shown in picture, and it&#x27;s sticky like most lip glosses.  I hate kissing my partner&#x27;s cheeks or lips because of its stickiness.  It doesn&#x27;t have an odor which is a plus. Great for lip gloss lovers.</li>
            <li> Just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of any beauty treats products....Love the colors, soft on the lips not to thick colored, very shimmery. A little sticky, but I&#x27;ve never known a lip-gloss to not be sticky.The colors are as they appear in the photo. Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky but that goes away and even when it dries up it leaves a nice shimmer on your lips. Most of the colors work for me. So cute</li>
            <li> It leaves your lips with a shimmering glow, long lasting  and it gives you all kinds of different shades. I find it is just as good as Victoria Secret.</li>
            <li> I bought 2..one for each granddaughter.  Its a part of their Christmas.  The colors are very nice.</li>
            <li> my sister absolutely love them</li>
            <li> nice bought for stocking stuffers for granddaughters</li>
            <li> Great colors! The tints were more subtle than I expected making all of them extremely wearable without being too bright.</li>
            <li> I love it gloss. As expected it</li>
            <li> These are great light colors for my daughter and the rest I gave as gifts. No irritation and there is a little shine.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lip gloss is a little on the sticky side, when the wind blows my hair it stick to my lip gloss but other than that i love the product</li>
