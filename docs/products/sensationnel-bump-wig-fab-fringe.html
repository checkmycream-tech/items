            <li>THIS WIG IS REALLY CUTE...</li>
            <li>#1 Favorite wig now.</li>
            <li>I think because the unit has become so popular, the company has decided to Water Down a majority of what they are producing and saling to the consumer, SO GOOD LUCK people, you&#x27;re going to need it with Sensational wigs!</li>

            <li>At first I got compliments because it looked good.</li>

            <li>2nd time buying this wig &amp; it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li>Just got my unit last night and was very excited to fit it because of the great reviews from YouTube and here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great quality human hair wig for the price.  </li>
            <li>it had it fit my head...</li>
            <li>I gave it to my aunt..which by the way looked fantastic on her...</li>
            <li>It was very affordable, its low maintenance, and  it fits my head perfectly!</li>
            <li>I have the 1B/30 and just ordered the fall leaf today because I love this style so much.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I have purchased it  in another color.</li>
            <li>I really like this wig fit.</li>
            <li>the look feels natural many compliments</li>
            <li>Seeing that it is human hair it was very easy to curl.</li>
            <li>I tapered it some, but overall, sweet and sassy!!</li>
            <li>ITS REALLY SOFT AND EASY TO STYLE.</li>
            <li>Well packaged, shipped fast, super soft hair, fit well.</li>
            <li>I styled it in so many different ways.  </li>
            <li>It really delivered!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this wig to anyone.</li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>I wore the wig straight out of the box and got compliment after compliment!</li>
            <li>The only con is you have to make sure you hair is flat to your head, so you don&#x27;t have a bulk, unless you are ok with the bulk.</li>
            <li>Better quality in makemanship would go a long way.</li>
            <li>Once I shaped it a little bit it was amazing.</li>
            <li>so much I think I may buy another in another color.</li>
            <li>I rocked it straight out of the package</li>
            <li>this wig doesn&#x27;t conceal very well</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s straight out of the box without me curling or otherwise work my hair</li>
            <li>This wig looks pretty good accept it&#x27;s thin.  </li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and the wig was sealed new.</li>
            <li>but I decided to be a little adventurous</li>
            <li>I LIVE</li>
            <li>so it seems that unless you get one oif the ones with different color, you won&#x27;t have much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the flat iron was to hot the last time I curled it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>would suggest this for someone that wants to try out a short style or needs a quick go to wig for work if they have to wear their back (military) or short on time for grooming before work</li>
            <li>Because we all know a good quality wig under $30 is HARD TO FIND!!!</li>
            <li>I received the Sensational Bump Human Hair Wig, on time, but it was the wrong color.</li>
            <li>Many have received extremely  thin units of this Fringe Bump Wig.  </li>
            <li>I have not curled or done any other styling to this wig, I have worn it straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to diss it too bad because it was good looking</li>

            <li> the hair will become dull stiff and start shedding on you after the first wash I&#x27;m a seasoned wig wearer</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> You do need to use a flat iron or curling iron to give the longer side some body and style.  </li>
            <li> It was all black instead of having the red color mixed in.</li>
            <li> Their wigs have accumulated multiple complaints because they are not consistent with Quality.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of $32!,</li>
            <li> I typically stick to the solid colors</li>
            <li> I bought a second wig after getting so many complements, but was disappointed as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> but I may get the back tapered down because it&#x27;s a little long.</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair or thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 years now and is getting tired of the same ol&#x27; protective styles, so decided to give wigs a try.</li>
            <li> A little flat iron work helps to customize it to your taste.</li>
            <li> I could not wear it due to the size....</li>
            <li> I like really black hair...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any additional color (just jet black)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, the wig that was advertised  was fuller, not satisfied</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on lace front wigs in the past when this little beauty was out there all along.</li>
            <li> but after 1 it started shedding little pieces of the weft started showing</li>
            <li> i used little product</li>
            <li> I bought it in Caramel not sure whether or not it would work well with my complexion and lo and behold</li>
            <li> I was not sure about buying this wig considering I have never bought a wig before or even tried one on for that matter.</li>
            <li> Hard to make hair work.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this wig based on previous customer reviews............extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> was sad</li>
            <li> :-(</li>

            <li> My order was on time and I just love the wig!</li>
            <li> I.Love.This.Wig!!!! Well packaged, shipped fast, super soft hair, fit well. I tapered it some, but overall, sweet and sassy!!</li>
            <li> I have never bought a wig online before, BUT the reviews on YouTube and the beauty blogs was SO overwhelmingly FOR this unit, I had to buy it. And I&#x27;m so glad I did! I bought it in Caramel not sure whether or not it would work well with my complexion and lo and behold, it&#x27;s FABULOUS! I like this unit so much I think I may buy another in another color. Because we all know a good quality wig under $30 is HARD TO FIND!!!</li>
            <li> this picture does not do any justice for the wig. I love love love this wig and I&#x27;m not a wig or short hair kinda girl &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I really like this wig fit. I styled it in so many different ways.  I need to get another one cause I think the flat iron was to hot the last time I curled it. Now I can get that nice fringe look I was wearing before. I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments. Great wig!  Can&#x27;t wait to get another one!</li>
            <li> Just got my unit last night and was very excited to fit it because of the great reviews from YouTube and here on Amazon. I got #1 cause I like really black hair...It really delivered! I got it for vacation so I won&#x27;t be wearing it for the next 5 weeks. I&#x27;m anticipating tonnes of compliment cause it&#x27;s just absolutely beautiful...</li>
            <li> Sensational, the company, is not reliable at all. Their wigs have accumulated multiple complaints because they are not consistent with Quality. You are taking a risk when you order their products. Many have received extremely  thin units of this Fringe Bump Wig.  I think because the unit has become so popular, the company has decided to Water Down a majority of what they are producing and saling to the consumer, SO GOOD LUCK people, you&#x27;re going to need it with Sensational wigs!</li>
            <li> I love it! It was very affordable, its low maintenance, and  it fits my head perfectly! I would most definitely recommend this wig to anyone.</li>
            <li> Just received this wig yestetday and I&#x27;m in love! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on lace front wigs in the past when this little beauty was out there all along. I rocked it straight out of the package but I may get the back tapered down because it&#x27;s a little long. I have the 1B/30 and just ordered the fall leaf today because I love this style so much. Buy this wig!</li>
            <li> It looks like picture however the back reminds me of my grandmothers wigs the bottom had this unattractive curl that sticks out. At first I got compliments because it looked good. Ive had the wig 3 months now but after 1 it started shedding little pieces of the weft started showing so I could only Wear the bang to one side. I&#x27;m not going to diss it too bad because it was good looking but it doesn&#x27;t last long the hair will become dull stiff and start shedding on you after the first wash I&#x27;m a seasoned wig wearer and I know how to take care of my hair i used little product but  it made no diffrence.If you have natural hair or thick hair this wig doesn&#x27;t conceal very well it will look bulky.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this for someone that wants to try out a short style or needs a quick go to wig for work if they have to wear their back (military) or short on time for grooming before work</li>
            <li> Love this wig! The quality is great. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected. I think I want to order another one.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Came fast! Super cute!</li>
            <li> I received the Sensational Bump Human Hair Wig, on time, but it was the wrong color. I kept it any way. It was all black instead of having the red color mixed in.</li>
            <li> This wig looks pretty good accept it&#x27;s thin.  I didn&#x27;t get any additional color (just jet black) so it seems that unless you get one oif the ones with different color, you won&#x27;t have much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m keeping it anyway since it looks good on me otherwise and that&#x27;s straight out of the box without me curling or otherwise work my hair magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also noticed hair falling out as I finger combed it so that would explain the thinness also.  Better quality in makemanship would go a long way.</li>
            <li> Wig is jjust as it appears online.  Great quality human hair wig for the price.  You do need to use a flat iron or curling iron to give the longer side some body and style.  Received loads of complement on the hair piece.  Would purchase this brand again</li>
            <li> This is my date night, out on the town look because I bought it in Autumn. I typically stick to the solid colors but I decided to be a little adventurous and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is my significant others favorite style.  I would love to try it in another color too. The fit is awesome; this wig doesn&#x27;t move or shift around. I have not curled or done any other styling to this wig, I have worn it straight out of the package. Thumbs up and the price is cheaper than on the actual hair products website.</li>
            <li> OMG THIS WIG IS EVERYTHING IT WAS SAID TO BE. I LIVE TEXTURE ITS REALLY SOFT AND EASY TO STYLE. PLACING ORDER FOR SECOND ONE IN DIFFERENT COLOR. LOVE,LOVE,LOVE.IT.....</li>
            <li> The wig was Togo big for my head and facial features. I did like it overall though. I will probably give it to one of my friend&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great looking wig...I would of enjoyed it had it fit my head... I gave it to my aunt..which by the way looked fantastic on her...was sad I could not wear it due to the size....:-(</li>
            <li> I dont know who made this wig but im glad i bought it. it fits perfectly &amp; i recieved soo many compliments.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about buying this wig considering I have never bought a wig before or even tried one on for that matter. I have been natural for 2 years now and is getting tired of the same ol&#x27; protective styles, so decided to give wigs a try. Let me tell you when I tried this wig on, I had transformed into another person. It fits me well and it looks so real (in my eyes anyway, lol). I am happy I purchased it. The only con is you have to make sure you hair is flat to your head, so you don&#x27;t have a bulk, unless you are ok with the bulk. The shipment was fast and the wig was sealed new.</li>
            <li> I bought a second wig after getting so many complements, but was disappointed as soon as I opened the package. I t smelled like it had been doused with lighter fluid. I ended up tossing it. Will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying this wig &amp; it&#x27;s beautiful</li>
            <li> I now have two. Great wig.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this wig based on previous customer reviews............extremely disappointed! Hair on wig literally came out when I ran my fingers through the wig! Nothing like the picture! Complete waste of $32!,</li>
            <li> Great wig and it came to my post office in 2 days after ordering.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love everything about this wig, does not shed, easy to maintain. Seeing that it is human hair it was very easy to curl.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected, the wig that was advertised  was fuller, not satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this wig. Once I shaped it a little bit it was amazing. I received multiple compliments about this wig. I am going to order another one in a different color. The shipping was only two days.</li>
            <li> Hard to make hair work.</li>
            <li> I just luv it fits great the style is excellent!  I will buy again it&#x27;s perfect ! I will tell my friends about!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in a 1B love the look feels natural many compliments</li>
            <li> I love this wig. It is perfect for the summer heat and it looks fabulous. A little flat iron work helps to customize it to your taste. I have received a ton of compliments for this unit. I love it so much that I have purchased it  in another color.</li>
            <li> THIS WIG IS REALLY CUTE...I TRIED IT ON FOR MY HUBBY...WHEN HE WALKED IN THE HOOUSE AFTER WORK HE DROPPED EVERTYTHING IN HIS HAND...HE LOVES IT...I LIKE THE SIZE OF IT...FITS WELL</li>
