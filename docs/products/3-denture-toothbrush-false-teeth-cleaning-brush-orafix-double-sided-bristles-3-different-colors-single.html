            <li> I wanted to compare the brushe to others(Archtek) brushes, which are less expensive, no noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Apparently there was a reaction between the bristles and the base.</li>
            <li> The gunk moved up the bristles and accumulated on the base.</li>

            <li> Brush teeth not stiff enough to get denture holding paste off.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother and she liked it .</li>
            <li> I love myself a new denture brush, and I saw the purple one and I had to buy it!  Yes, when it arrived, it was purple (score!).  Sometimes these things aren&#x27;t true to the photo.  Sadly, there aren&#x27;t very many denture brushes on the market, and demand is kind of low.  I wish that it was curved and that the bristles were a bit longer, but what a girl to do?  I gotta brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a program on Haley&#x27;s Hints.  I like the bristles being stiffer than a regular tooth brush.  It works much better for some cleaning tasks.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a denture brush. It works just fine. Vendor shipped promptly. The quality is good. I would reccomend to others. I am adding comment on 2-28-15. About two weeks ago I had to clean out black gunk from the base of the brush. Apparently there was a reaction between the bristles and the base. The gunk moved up the bristles and accumulated on the base. I bought another brush (GUM a known and trusted name).</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price!!  My only comment is that the brushes at times are hard to hold onto. The brushes do a great job, but  I would prefer  a &amp;#34;gripper&amp;#34; handle.</li>
            <li> Good brush but a bit harder than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this in May and used it daily.  Unfortunately the bristles are way too soft and simply do not do the job well anymore.  I have reverted to my Walmart brush which is much firmer and lasts a whole lot longer.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This works okay.  I was hoping that the bristles were firmer/stiffer.  It&#x27;s a bit better than the old ones I have that are pretty frayed.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Seabond denture brush. I didn&#x27;t use it too many times before the bristles didn&#x27;t go back into shape. This brush seems to be what I want! I have used it a few times and it has gone back into shape so far.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what I thought it would do cleans my denture so great product. I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used this kind for years would say buy it, I like it but you may not..so far so good..</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, with good brushes, for doing a good denture cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Will be puchasing this product again - good price.</li>
            <li> this is an effective brush for cleaning my dental appliance used for controlling sleep apnea .  however ,  it must be used in conjunction with a product like Efferdent in order to be effective .  however , i paid too much for this brush via amazon .  can be found much cheaper at walmart , CVS , etc .</li>
