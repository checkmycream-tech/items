            <li>This does not make your hair feel heavy or greasy, it&#x27;s the best</li>

            <li>I keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li>This product adds a lot of body and just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li>I have very fine short gray hair and have always had a problem with styling my hair.</li>
            <li>To me it adds body to my fine hair better than any other mousse.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much also.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase again and recommend it to family and friends!</li>

            <li>It can be a bit expensive in the stores, so this is the perfect place to purchase it.</li>
            <li>What I ordered wasnt exactly what I received.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted at the time they said I would get.</li>
            <li>and I order more of it when I start my last can of it.</li>
            <li>thanks....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do so very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and sometimes frizzy hair and this helps to control it along with the Joico hair spray.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It almost seems like too much product (I fill my palm)</li>
            <li>I like how the product holds my hair more than other products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to style and Joico firm holds my style all day.  </li>
            <li>I have moderately course, very frizzy type 2 b - ish hair that must have product in it in order to be defined.</li>
            <li>This defines curls, reduces frizz and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and this foam</li>
            <li>The bottle is large and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m feeling particularly up to it, I use a defuser and dry with my hair flipped over.</li>
            <li>It is the only one that moisturizes and gives body to my 2B fine wavy/curls without weighing down my hair or making it dry or greasy and</li>
            <li>It gives body but is not too heavy (use less rather than more).</li>
            <li>I can only use a little bit &amp; found it very sticky.</li>

            <li> My hair is now on the thin side, so I just use a little, but if you have thick, curly hair, this will make your curls beautiful.  </li>
            <li> but then I scrunch it in my hair and let it air dry - occasionally flipping my hair over and rescrunching.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other name-branded hair mousse again.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair, it leaves it crunchy.</li>
            <li> Sadly Joico has changed the fabulous formula of the old &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; to something less &#x27;firm hold&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> When my hair is wet</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful because a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m sweating a lot or working out.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that sometimes the product doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle even though there is plenty left.  </li>
            <li> I bought it expecting it would hold my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have been using Joico firm hold mousse since it was called Joico Ice Whip.</li>
            <li> I would only suggest this product for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Us thick hair people should look for something else.</li>
            <li> have thin hair and this adds a lot of body to it.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> I have used this product for many years and cannot live without it.  Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> Sadly Joico has changed the fabulous formula of the old &amp;#34;ice&amp;#34; to something less &#x27;firm hold&#x27;. Joiwhip is not as good as ice was. So now, I&#x27;ve got to find something that has the kind of holding power ice did.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t think of washing my hair and not using this product.  It helps to hold my style for days.</li>
            <li> Received on time but the cap was ajar and the nozzle shifted. It still works but the product comes out as a liquid rather than a foam. Not what I&#x27;m used to from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Joico Joiwhip mousse helps give my fine hair some body.  Just a dab before drying helps give hair more body.</li>
            <li> my curly hair loves this product</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have fine hair without a lot of body. This product adds a lot of body and just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> I have moderately course, very frizzy type 2 b - ish hair that must have product in it in order to be defined. This is the best mousse I&#x27;ve ever used - dare I write the best product for defining otherwise unruly hair. Crunchy? Heck yes. I love. .xoxo</li>
            <li> Great to be able to find the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this foam for about 6 years.  I use it daily and love love love it.  I recieved the foam very quickly and the packaging was super.  thanks....</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used it for years and still haven&#x27;t found anything better. I highly recommend it. I recommend ANY Joico product! :)</li>
            <li> I think they may have changed their formula a bit but good product for curly hair.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have 3b curls, and it gives them volume,zero frizz,and perfect curls that lasts for days! Love the scent too! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have bought this mousse for years.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s so different about it but nothing controls and enhances my curls as well as this stuff.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best mousse hands down for curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried others and nothing comes close. This defines curls, reduces frizz and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ... would recommend seller since they delivered as promised for the not so easy to find mousse. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and this is the best product I have found that controls and curls and frizz. Will continue to use for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have to say, after trying so many different brands of mousse (salon &amp; drugstore), this one has become my all time favorite. It is the only one that moisturizes and gives body to my 2B fine wavy/curls without weighing down my hair or making it dry or greasy and the scent is very light and clean. Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this on my hair last time I went and I loved it.  It gave my hair thickness and my style stayed.  I could not purchase locally without a beauty license so I was glad to get it from Amazon.  Great price.  Great product.  Got here quick.  Will always use this. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Not too crunchy, not too light.  This provides good control and smells nice.  Be careful because a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It gives body but is not too heavy (use less rather than more).</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that sometimes the product doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle even though there is plenty left.  I don&#x27;t know what causes that.  The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m sweating a lot or working out.  I like how the product holds my hair more than other products.</li>
            <li> Love this,use it all the time!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mousse for many years.  I have curly hair and I use this daily to keep my curls in control.  If you are looking for something that give curls texture, this is it. My curls are \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and frizz free with this mousse. I hope it never disappears! I have tried others that say they are an \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot; mousse, but none have lived up to the quality of Joico. I purchase these by 2 or 3 at a time so I always have it available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 15 years. Its a staple must-have for this curly girl!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Have been using this for years and now it is not sold here anymore . I do not like the product I have been using.  So glad I found this site. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much also. It gives my hair body.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and this adds a lot of body to it.&lt;br /&gt;Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using Joico firm hold mousse since it was called Joico Ice Whip. If this product is ever discontinued, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do!! It can be a bit expensive in the stores, so this is the perfect place to purchase it. This vendor sent me my products right away, at a much better price than can be found in the stores. I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foam for years. It doesn&#x27;t flake off and look like dandruff which some of the cheaper foam brands do.</li>
            <li> I bought it expecting it would hold my hair down. It didn&#x27;t do so very well. It did give my hair a nice shine and eliminated frizz. I do like the fact that it dries in your hair so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being greasy for the rest of the day. I would only suggest this product for people with thin hair. Us thick hair people should look for something else.</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives me extra body.</li>
            <li> Holds hair without buildup!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  To me it adds body to my fine hair better than any other mousse.</li>
            <li> What I ordered wasnt exactly what I received.  The product I got was okay.  If you don&#x27;t blow dry your hair, it leaves it crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  It is the best mouse for body that I have ever tried!  I keep coming back for more!</li>
            <li> Great product ...experience was so great I don&#x27;t normally by online but was done very easy. I got exactly what I wanted at the time they said I would get.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and sometimes frizzy hair and this helps to control it along with the Joico hair spray. Wish I could get it in stores here in Louisville instead of buying on line.</li>
            <li> Does a good job to give you body, but I found it dries my hair after a while.  Not what I expected. I can only use a little bit &amp; found it very sticky.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I prefer this foam to most mousse that I have tried. Highly recommend it.  Not scented</li>
            <li> I love this mousse.... for curly hair like mine... it keeps my curls in place.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this product. Works better than anything I have used in the past. Hands down the best. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product in every way! Loved it!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist turned me onto this mousse.  Since I have been using it, I don&#x27;t have to use a curling iron, curlers etc.  My hair is easy to style and Joico firm holds my style all day.  It&#x27;s the best product of it&#x27;s kind and I highly recommend it.  I have found by ordering it through Amazon I save money compared to the beauty supply stores.  This does not make your hair feel heavy or greasy, it&#x27;s the best and I am a hair product junky.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my curly and I&#x27;ve tried everything. When my hair is wet I distribute a handful of product throughout. It almost seems like too much product (I fill my palm) but then I scrunch it in my hair and let it air dry - occasionally flipping my hair over and rescrunching. If I&#x27;m feeling particularly up to it, I use a defuser and dry with my hair flipped over. Perfect curls every time. Great smell. Love love love this!!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other name-branded hair mousse again. JOICO is no. 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, luxurious hair. I can style it just as I please, and this mousse will definitely hold it in place-it doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing ANY on my hair :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t change for the world.  It is the best mousse I have every found and I order more of it when I start my last can of it.</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected.</li>
            <li> Joico Joiwhip foam is wonderful!!! I love love love it!!! I have very fine short gray hair and have always had a problem with styling my hair. This foam not only helps me with styling but it holds my style all day.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I have natural curly hair and this foam helps set the curl to hold all day.  My hair is now on the thin side, so I just use a little, but if you have thick, curly hair, this will make your curls beautiful.  The bottle is large and lasts a long time.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the product and good delivery.</li>
