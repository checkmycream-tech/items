            <li>and it is the authentic product.</li>
            <li>But LOVE it with the clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>so.. I am guessing it was more of how shipping went</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what most products do anyways.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>

            <li>It was shipped very quickly</li>
            <li>Smells kind of funny.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a smooth</li>
            <li>The new formula is not as effective and dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather or foam in any way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>this help to keep my skin clean</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin and this just perfects it for me.</li>
            <li>I ever do have a blemish coming through this seems to take care of it in a super quick fashion</li>
            <li>I got this as a present for Christmas with my Clarsonic spinbrush and it works amazingly together</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and smooth!</li>
            <li>The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fragrance (it doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all)</li>
            <li>I first tried this cleanser as part of the Mia 2 Acne Care system.</li>
            <li>but then the box was pretty pressed up</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>This cleanser, in combination with the Mia, really does the job of keeping blemishes at bay with out drying your skin!</li>
            <li>After the break outs I went ahead and purchased the refreshing gel again and that helped get my skin back in control.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this and it has worked really well with the Clarisonic Mia 2.</li>
            <li>Maybe I washing my face too much as I&#x27;m still having breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleanser for a week and my skin is clearing up fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer after using this cleanser and the clarisonic brush together.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not going through the six ounce tubes fast at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this wash</li>
            <li>and it really helps A LOT.</li>
            <li>Face feels smooth and pores getting smaller too.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a tear now with the brush, my face is better than when I was using other products.</li>
            <li>Really does the job, and mild enough to use twice a day.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the extra money for the product as their are others on the market that are cheaper.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear without causing dryness.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>learning to use this only at night and then the gentle wash in the morning.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne</li>
            <li>It is the only product out there that really works on my acne.</li>
            <li>Within a short time my skin began to clear up</li>
            <li>Since it was a small sample I ran out fairly quickly so  </li>
            <li>it cleanses deeply, yet your skin feels soft and not stripped or dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I believe this product is just way overpriced for what it is, but because i wanted to give it a chance, I succumbed to the hype. Never again.  Use any soap, it works just as well.</li>
            <li> This worked well, the only downside was it smelled like baby puke.</li>
            <li> The new formula is not as effective and dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this cleanser at all. It doesn&#x27;t lather or foam in any way, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling clean. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> nice cleanser! this help to keep my skin clean and it works great with the machine. other cleanser does not work as well.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin and this just perfects it for me. I don&#x27;t use this with the brush. The brush breaks me out.</li>
            <li> I first tried this cleanser as part of the Mia 2 Acne Care system. I loved it from the first try - it cleanses deeply, yet your skin feels soft and not stripped or dry. It works equally well with the Acne brush head and the Deep Pore head. The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the fragrance (it doesn&#x27;t smell nice at all) but it works so well I just put up with it. Also, buy it here - way cheaper than at Sephora or Ulta and it is the authentic product.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a tear now with the brush, my face is better than when I was using other products.</li>
            <li> Like this acne cleanser.  With or without the clarisonic.  But LOVE it with the clarisonic.  Makes my face feel so great!</li>
            <li> Got this product and the seal was opened - I hope it was not returned or used one but then the box was pretty pressed up so.. I am guessing it was more of how shipping went down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin dry after the wash but that&#x27;s what most products do anyways.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. A little bit goes a long way. It clears the skin and evens the tone when used with the Clarisonic unit. Good value too.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and it has worked really well with the Clarisonic Mia 2. Really great product - highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for acne for about a year and love it. Keeps my face clear without causing dryness.</li>
            <li> I chose this cleasnser to go with my Clarisonic machine. I had severe acne and bought the two products together. Within a short time my skin began to clear up and it felt smoother than ever. I have used this for several years now and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells kind of funny. Didn&#x27;t notice an improvement while using this cleanser. I wouldn&#x27;t spend my money on this and just use your favorite cleanser with your clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and break out prone skin on my face, and clarisonic acne daily has done wonders for it. I got the mia2 as a gift and started using it and it helped out somewhat. Then i decided to try this product and it&#x27;s made a huge difference. I&#x27;m happy I tried it and will continue buying it once I need a refill, which should be a while since you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps my daughter&#x27;s acne</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> learning to use this only at night and then the gentle wash in the morning. Maybe I washing my face too much as I&#x27;m still having breakouts.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> Sort of a maintenance item.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Love it with my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Too drying. Did not like. Wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it, only bad thing is, you face feels very dry afterwards, I do see clearing though, I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful I found this cleanser. I have been using this cleanser for a week and my skin is clearing up fast. I use this cleanser evening time only and Josie argan cleansing oil in the morning. It seems to work well. I&#x27;ve used tons of acne cleansers and this is the best with using the brush. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. Im loving it!</li>
            <li> This product made my skin feel dry after cleansing. I don&#x27;t have acne and worry more about keeping my skin hydrated, so this was the wrong choice.</li>
            <li> This cleanser, in combination with the Mia, really does the job of keeping blemishes at bay with out drying your skin!</li>
            <li> The clarisonic acne daily cleanser has worked wonders for my skin! I have had less breakouts and less-severe breakouts! My skin is so much softer after using this cleanser and the clarisonic brush together. I would definitely recommend this product hands down. Also, the cleanser goes a long way so you&#x27;re not going through the six ounce tubes fast at all.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for acne. I suffer from adult acne and I&#x27;m always on the look out for a great cleanser to try. This product works wonderful on my face, leaving it clean , smooth and my pores is getting smaller. I also bought the Clarisonic  brush to go along with this cleanser. You just need a liitle bit to work wonders on your face and it smells great. I have seen results on my face in like 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> dont know it was for the wife</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only product out there that really works on my acne. I got this as a present for Christmas with my Clarsonic spinbrush and it works amazingly together</li>
            <li> When i bought my clarisonic It came with the refreshing gel cleanser. Since it was a small sample I ran out fairly quickly so  I decided to come on Amazon and order another. When i went to order it I saw this and thought it would be better for my skin. It was shipped very quickly and I was happy with that. After using this product for a few days it made me break out worse then before, I continued to use it and it didn&#x27;t help me at all. I discovered it made my skin worse then before. After the break outs I went ahead and purchased the refreshing gel again and that helped get my skin back in control. Everyone has different skin types so this still may work for you but if it breaks you out more I recommend trying the Refreshing gel! It also may seem slightly expensive but it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> The clarisonic Mia 2 brush is incredible and helps keep my skin really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use the Daily clarifying Cleanser every day and apply it with the brush once or twice a week as a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;If I ever do have a blemish coming through this seems to take care of it in a super quick fashion so have always been pleased with it as a cleaning regime.</li>
            <li> Excellent and it works.</li>
            <li> I really like this wash and it keeps my skin clear, but the redness can be bad at times. Invest in a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering, this is my favorite face wash and feel incomplete without it :(. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it! I have combination skin and it really helps A LOT. Love it!</li>
            <li> great product. it was a game changer.</li>
            <li> Really does the job, and mild enough to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne since I was 7 and I&#x27;m now 20, I&#x27;ve tried every over the counter product, antibiotics, epiduo, proactive..and nothing has worked long term. I&#x27;ve been using this product since November I use it with clarisonic Mia 2 I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Used as it says on the tube it does what it say&#x27;s it will.  It is well worth the extra money for the product as their are others on the market that are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Cleaned my face but it dried it out very badly. I thought it would be a smooth but it&#x27;s like a foam.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and usually acne cleanser products will dry out my face, but not clarisonic! Face feels smooth and pores getting smaller too.</li>
