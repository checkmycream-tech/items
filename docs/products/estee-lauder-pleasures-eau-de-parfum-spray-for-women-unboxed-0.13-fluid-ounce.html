            <li>This was just the right size for my purse, and didn&#x27;t cost too much for my favorite scent ever!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the perfect little purse-size bottle, and used pretty regularly, this lasted a good 12 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The product is all that I expected and more and it even came in a cute mini cosmetic bag which I love and can use.  </li>

            <li>Does not come in the bottle shown above and you could probably get a sample with the same amount at Macys  for free!!!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance I just thought the bottle would have been bigger.</li>
            <li>I also know how much I pay for a bottle at the department store perfume counter, so</li>
            <li>smells great small enough to carry in my purse</li>
            <li>It was small enough to fit in my cell pocket!!!</li>
            <li>Cute little bottle.</li>
            <li>when I saw this tiny bottle for $5, I knew there wasn&#x27;t going to be much to it (having no clue</li>

            <li> Fragrance lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Then, when I tracked the shipping, I saw that its point of origin was a city less than 40 miles from my house, and it actually arrived in 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Tiny little bottle...</li>
            <li> what was expected or ordered.</li>
            <li> Not worth 10bucks plus shipping.</li>
            <li> dont see why such a tiny bottle should be so expensive.</li>
            <li> when I unpacked this thing, the perfume itself was so small that I almost threw it away with all the stuffing paper trash thinkinng that they had sent me an empty box.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> and it was a small bottle</li>
            <li> However, I did not experience the prolonged fragrance effect as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Small bottle.</li>
            <li> although small you get a lot of sprays from it.  </li>
            <li> This is a bad product and the picture is not what it seemed to be.</li>

            <li> It is a perfect size,a good price and it fits in my pocket if i wanted to carry it with me. I would like to order more.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance I just thought the bottle would have been bigger. Guess I should have done the conversion before buying.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and am carrying it in my purse! Thanks for the fast shipment and good price !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she love the smell and it came on it it&#x27;s small but it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth 10bucks plus shipping. Does not come in the bottle shown above and you could probably get a sample with the same amount at Macys  for free!!!</li>
            <li> This is a bad product and the picture is not what it seemed to be. don&#x27;t buy. I unpaked it and it was a small bottle .14 oz that is not what the picture show</li>
            <li> this perfume has been around for ages. Its no channel no. 5. dont see why such a tiny bottle should be so expensive. it&#x27;s a great fragrance but has been worn to death by aunties around the world...ok, but wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> Tiny little bottle...but Estee Lauder manufactures the best scents and this perfume is perfect not too loud just perfect for day time or night time.</li>
            <li> this was a great deal for this size of bottle. My wife wears it every day... It is very nice</li>
            <li> It was small enough to fit in my cell pocket!!! Found it in a magazine and smells sooo good! :)</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THE BOTTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LARGER &#x27;&#x27;  FL. &amp; OZ.&#x27;&#x27;  MAKES A BIG DIFFERENT&#x27;&#x27; BUT THE SCENT IS LOVELY , YOU WILL ENJOY IT.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Pleasures&amp;#34; is my favorite fragrance by Estee. My only problem is the amount of spray far too small to consider buying one bottle this size. This size is ideal for a refresher to carry in your purse. However, I did not experience the prolonged fragrance effect as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I gave it the high rating because I Love It! Also no problems at all&lt;br /&gt;with product or shipper.I would absoutley return a product if it was&lt;br /&gt;not what was expected or ordered.The only problem is i need to&lt;br /&gt;order more.</li>
            <li> when i purchased this item. i have no regret. This perfume has a pleasant smell and i love it. :D i wear this at work.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. Small bottle. Cheap. It was just easier to get on line than go to the mall. Bottle is not that big though.</li>
            <li> Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pleasures is my \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot; that I&#x27;ve worn for 10+ years, so I know I love the scent and it works well for me.  I also know how much I pay for a bottle at the department store perfume counter, so when I saw this tiny bottle for $5, I knew there wasn&#x27;t going to be much to it (having no clue how much 4 mL actually is).  But it&#x27;s the perfect little purse-size bottle, and used pretty regularly, this lasted a good 12 weeks.  I had to laugh when I got the shipping notification, as it indicated that I should expect delivery in 3 weeks.  Then, when I tracked the shipping, I saw that its point of origin was a city less than 40 miles from my house, and it actually arrived in 3 days.  So, the seller definitely exceeded all shipping expectations too!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so good to keep it in your purse all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; if you wish to refresh just use it and feel elegant once more.&lt;br /&gt; Pleasures makes romantic.</li>
            <li> Cute little bottle. Fragrance lasts a long time. I am pleasantly pleased. Would purchase again it is such a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This was just the right size for my purse, and didn&#x27;t cost too much for my favorite scent ever!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> smells great small enough to carry in my purse but I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how small 4ml&#x27;s really is</li>
            <li> The product is all that I expected and more and it even came in a cute mini cosmetic bag which I love and can use.  In fact I used it on a recent trip.  The pleasures scent is wonderful and lasts long.  The bottle is so cute and although small you get a lot of sprays from it.  I&#x27;ve had mine for over 3 weeks and still have some left and I use it almost every day</li>
