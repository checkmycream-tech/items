            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and it comes out, kind of like a mechanical pencil.  </li>
            <li>Good but smudges easily.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself was great, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>I put eyeliner on my waterline and this is by far the best looking eyeliner for that use.</li>

            <li>It glides on very smooth.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on the bottom lids and liquid liner on the top.  </li>

            <li>BUT..&lt;br /&gt;it broke on me soon after I began to twist it to use more eyeliner.</li>

            <li>You can do better.</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner ever.</li>
            <li>This pencil is more like a crayon.  </li>
            <li>I cannot begin to mention the brands or the different countries that I went to to find the perfect liner (I shopped for a liner no matter where I went on</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pencil eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I do think some liquid liners and pots stay on better</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite drug store eye liners.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>

            <li>Since the first time I tried this item I loved it.</li>
            <li>I use this product while teaching and am impressed with how long and evenly it stays on.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to apply this product.  </li>
            <li>I deal with it since I love that it stays precise all day-but,</li>
            <li>I love that it is smooth</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and wont smudge.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I was hoping it would no smudging, running and make a nice line.</li>
            <li>in all, Maybelline still makes the best eyeliner of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried hands down.</li>
            <li>Seemed to go on smoothly</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It smudges and looks cheap.  </li>

            <li>Smooth  and waterproof.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to tug (much) at my eye to get it to go on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>but pencils are so much easier!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to apply and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>My new favorite eye liner!</li>
            <li>Overall great eyeliner good pigment and lasts for a long time....</li>
            <li>special occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the color- very,</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it smudges easily and seems to run out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of makeup, and this is my first eyeliner ever, but I&#x27;m super impressed.</li>
            <li>It glides really smoothly too and applies pretty evenly.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner glides on pretty easily, but wears off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Ok so first of all the pen would come out more than a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Love the midnight/dark color (beautiful and dramatic).  </li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s dark and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so I have the drugstore kind for daily use and department store brands for parties/</li>
            <li>I had one for 8+months and was getting crusty, then bought a new one on Amazon and was reminded of how nice it is when it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>The lid broke and doesn&#x27;t snap on right.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice dark, easy eyeliner to apply, but it makes my eyes water more than other brands and tends to smudge easily.</li>
            <li>I have really watery eyes because of my full time allergies, so I needed a pencil liner for my waterline that didn´t run all over my face within 5 minutes of applying it.</li>
            <li>A good long wearing and lasting eyeliner, which glides so easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with nice dark smooth lines with no back tracking needed to fill in the gaps.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>First of all, mine came without a cap and therefore, with no tip, so I had to sharpen it.</li>
            <li>You simple turn the top</li>
            <li>I do have to touch up every now and again to keep it looking pretty.  </li>
            <li>Happened with my first one too.  </li>
            <li>A VERY light swipe goes a long way, and this is the first eyeliner I&#x27;ve used where I&#x27;ve felt that one misguided line</li>
            <li>My favorite eye liner its dark and bold .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily (unless you put on an oily facial cream).</li>
            <li>The upside is that the color (vibrant violet) is pretty and it stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>Plus I couldn&#x27;t turn the liner if I turned it too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really convenient to not have to sharpen it.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed at first, but after a couple of applications, the tip has became firm, and has to be pressed hard to apply.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner glides on smooth and does not move all day long!  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply on waterline even if it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>so I only use it on my top eyelid and use a different one on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I put the eyeliner on my water line and this by far stays put better than any other pencil.  </li>
            <li>I turned the bottom to get more product but nothing happens, so then I took out the bottom piece to expose the little screw.  </li>
            <li>I have looked for a dark, easy glide eye pencil for YEARS..</li>
            <li>First I thought it was only a defected one, so I called and got a replacement.</li>
            <li>It is super creamy, super black and long wearing.  </li>
            <li>It stays on all day and is a rich, black color.</li>
            <li>That being said, I really do like this product for my upper lid.</li>
            <li>My go to eye liner so far.</li>
            <li>Be sure to cap this product tightly or else it will lose some of its creaminess and you may want to set it with a translucent powder if you have oily skin to prevent it from transferring to your crease after a long day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not tight and just messed up my bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be going back to my normal Maybelline cream pencil liner when this runs out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most black eyeliners turn out more grey than black but this one looks very dark.</li>
            <li>The new one had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s brand new you have to turn it several times before it starts raising.  </li>
            <li>Comes out black unlike most eyeliners that advertise black but come out gray.</li>
            <li>it sets really fast and is long wearing plus it doesn´t make may eye itchy and red.</li>
            <li>so far this is the only liner I can put on my waterline.</li>
            <li>It does dry out after a while, so just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had bought a Japanese liner instead for a little more money because this was a total waste.</li>
            <li>Goes on really easily, and gives the dramatic look of liquid liner.</li>

            <li> It makes a pretty thick line so you have to be careful not to overdo it when you are applying it for just a normal day.</li>
            <li> but they dont last very long</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it breaks with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and creates a dramatic effect with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I did, it was like it was dry.</li>
            <li> I don’t know if it because the product is sort of dry or because it’s not pigmented at all.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was broken, you have to turn it a lot for it to come out.</li>
            <li> Now that I have finally tried a cream pencil I can throw away the dry hard pencils and the never drying liquids and only use cream.</li>
            <li> and I would have to rub it on several times to get A LITTLE COLOR.</li>
            <li> so occasionally some of it is wasted because it will fall off the pencil.</li>
            <li> All other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried on the bottom irritate my eyes and make them water..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly waterproof.</li>
            <li> Very dark, but it takes a little practice and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I pushed very carefully and half of the stick comes out.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t use half of the product.  </li>
            <li> the packing is terrible, and I was only able to use it a few times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black and have medium-dark skin, so I like a very dark eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It is very dark</li>
            <li> Very dark.</li>
            <li> Too bad because the liner itself is creamy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It does sometimes smudge a bit if worn in the water line, but I can usually prevent this by powdering under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy when I looked in the mirror a few hours later and saw &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s hard to get it to come out</li>
            <li> less expensive at Target or drug stores,</li>
            <li> In order to get any sort of a line I would have had to pull and poke at my eye, and that is never a good idea.</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> Dramatic eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;Stunning</li>
            <li> I hate how the tube is flawed and leads to wasted product.</li>
            <li> and it just got really uncomfortable that I had to take it off.</li>
            <li> and I found it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> This stuff smudges like crazy on me.</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed and will not purchase again/</li>
            <li> Very bad mechanism.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyes water a lot up here in the Canadian winters. I can not use liquid eyeliner on the bottom lid.  A friend suggested this brand and I love it.  I use it on the bottom lids and liquid liner on the top.  Does exactly what I was hoping it would no smudging, running and make a nice line.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner its dark and bold . its perfect</li>
            <li> Seemed to go on smoothly and I like the cream style and applicator. I was unhappy when I looked in the mirror a few hours later and saw &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;. This stuff smudges like crazy on me. I must say this happened on the lower lid only. At night I washed up and used a makeup remover, when I woke up in the morning there as another smudge of raccoon eyes from the minuscule amount that was missed by the makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I always buy this eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black and have medium-dark skin, so I like a very dark eyeliner. This one definitely does the trick but it took a bit of getting used to to use properly. A VERY light swipe goes a long way, and this is the first eyeliner I&#x27;ve used where I&#x27;ve felt that one misguided line and I look like I&#x27;ve been in a fight! That being said, I really do like this product for my upper lid. I&#x27;ve had some issues with it spreading on my lower lid even when applied very lightly. I&#x27;ll probably be going back to my normal Maybelline cream pencil liner when this runs out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, Maybelline still makes the best eyeliner of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried hands down.</li>
            <li> Comes off if eyes water</li>
            <li> Since the first time I tried this item I loved it. I love it because it&#x27;s dark and very easy to apply. One thing I dislike is that it does smear but then again I do tend to touch my eyes a lot. But it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Master Drama series by Maybelline for a couple years now, but I always used the&lt;br /&gt;Espresso Brown and then purchased the Midnight color one time as store was out of Espresso. I have&lt;br /&gt;blue eyes so the Midnight compliments better and seems to stay on longer. Great product. You can prob.&lt;br /&gt;get less expensive at Target or drug stores, but they&#x27;re almost always out of the Midnight color and Amazon&lt;br /&gt;is never out of supply.</li>
            <li> My favorite liner for the bottom. All other eyeliners I&#x27;ve tried on the bottom irritate my eyes and make them water..so far this is the only liner I can put on my waterline. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product will keep buying again and again</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my eyeliner of choice!</li>
            <li> I use this product while teaching and am impressed with how long and evenly it stays on. I love this product and will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner I have used. It stays on all day and is a rich, black color. It glides on very smooth. Be sure to cap this product tightly or else it will lose some of its creaminess and you may want to set it with a translucent powder if you have oily skin to prevent it from transferring to your crease after a long day.</li>
            <li> My new favorite eye liner! Essentially the color of a gel liner in a pencil. Only complaint is that it breaks with too much pressure.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner to use and cheaper than buying it in the store</li>
            <li> I really like this eyeliner! I don&#x27;t usually wear a lot of makeup, and this is my first eyeliner ever, but I&#x27;m super impressed. It&#x27;s super easy to apply and goes on smoothly. I definitely recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> If there were a  ZERO star rating, I would select it for this product. It sucks! First of all, mine came without a cap and therefore, with no tip, so I had to sharpen it. Once I did, it was like it was dry. It wouldn’t color and I would have to rub it on several times to get A LITTLE COLOR. I don’t know if it because the product is sort of dry or because it’s not pigmented at all. Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Goes on smooth.  Love the midnight/dark color (beautiful and dramatic).  Will not buy a different brand going forward unless another product can &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me..  This was recommended by a friend and I am so glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Overall great eyeliner good pigment and lasts for a long time....BUT..&lt;br /&gt;it broke on me soon after I began to twist it to use more eyeliner. The eyeliner itself was great, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the price I paid- the packing is terrible, and I was only able to use it a few times.</li>
            <li> A good long wearing and lasting eyeliner, which glides so easily. Why should I purchase urban decay&#x27;s 24/7 one, when I have maybelline&#x27;s?!</li>
            <li> I love how this eyeliner stays all day BUT there are mechanical issues with the product. The cap doesn&#x27;t like to stay on. Also, it&#x27;s hard to get it to come out and it likes to break off. I deal with it since I love that it stays precise all day-but, I hate how the tube is flawed and leads to wasted product.</li>
            <li> From reading reviews I think that these pencils have a very short lifespan. I am in SEA, and it takes a while for things to get over here. I wish I had bought a Japanese liner instead for a little more money because this was a total waste. In order to get any sort of a line I would have had to pull and poke at my eye, and that is never a good idea. Boo, Maybelline. You can do better.</li>
            <li> This is a nice dark, easy eyeliner to apply, but it makes my eyes water more than other brands and tends to smudge easily.</li>
            <li> I have a graveyard of liquid /pencil eyeliners that didn&#x27;t quite cut it. They say \\&quot;Smooth\\&quot; or \\&quot;Soft\\&quot; or something like that, but they are not. Now that I have finally tried a cream pencil I can throw away the dry hard pencils and the never drying liquids and only use cream. Yay!</li>
            <li> Dramatic eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;Stunning effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.facebook.com/TheOneLifetoLiveNaturalist.health</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner ever. Goes on really easily, and gives the dramatic look of liquid liner. Favorite!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was broken, you have to turn it a lot for it to come out. Plus I couldn&#x27;t turn the liner if I turned it too much. It wasn&#x27;t as creamy as I thought it was gunna be, but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
            <li> This pencil is more like a crayon.  It smudges and looks cheap.  I was disappointed! I will probably use it for the insides of my eyes.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner glides on smooth and does not move all day long!  It is very dark so I only use it on my top eyelid and use a different one on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Perfect cream eyeliner. Stays on all day and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Ok so first of all the pen would come out more than a tiny bit. Second problem is that it does not  \\&quot;glide\\&quot; on like it&#x27;s supposed to . It tugs at the lid. The upside is that the color (vibrant violet) is pretty and it stays on for hours.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this eyeliner. it&#x27;s not pointy &amp; it smudges all over my eyes and whenever i check my make up bag, the covers are not on it. it&#x27;s not tight and just messed up my bag. don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I put eyeliner on my waterline and this is by far the best looking eyeliner for that use. Most black eyeliners turn out more grey than black but this one looks very dark.</li>
            <li> Perfect, my favorite eyeliner, have bought it many times over. Comes out black unlike most eyeliners that advertise black but come out gray. Easy to apply on waterline even if it&#x27;s wet. Doesn&#x27;t smudge and stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have looked for a dark, easy glide eye pencil for YEARS..I cannot begin to mention the brands or the different countries that I went to to find the perfect liner (I shopped for a liner no matter where I went on vacation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search has finally led me to this beauty. Glides on easily. Very dark. Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily (unless you put on an oily facial cream). WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT!! Best eyeliner, ever!</li>
            <li> Got just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Good product but they dont last very long</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pencil eyeliner.  I put the eyeliner on my water line and this by far stays put better than any other pencil.  I do think some liquid liners and pots stay on better but pencils are so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice, and each time the pencil would not scroll up.  I have no complaints with the actual product, just the \\&quot;packaging\\&quot; you have to push up manually (like break it apart) so occasionally some of it is wasted because it will fall off the pencil.</li>
            <li> I have really watery eyes because of my full time allergies, so I needed a pencil liner for my waterline that didn´t run all over my face within 5 minutes of applying it. This is amazing! it sets really fast and is long wearing plus it doesn´t make may eye itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Stay on and doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
            <li> So I wear contacts and maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not used to wearing makeup but I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it around my eyes. It just felt like there was always something in my eye and it just got really uncomfortable that I had to take it off. So maybe if you don&#x27;t wear contacts you may like it, but I do and I found it uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite drug store eye liners.  It is super creamy, super black and long wearing.  It does sometimes smudge a bit if worn in the water line, but I can usually prevent this by powdering under my eyes.</li>
            <li> When i open the pen it never came out so I couldn&#x27;t use. I returned. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I admit that I&#x27;m not an eye-liner guru.  I love how easy it is to apply this product.  It&#x27;s a cream pencil.  You simple turn the top and it comes out, kind of like a mechanical pencil.  It&#x27;s really convenient to not have to sharpen it.  It glides really smoothly too and applies pretty evenly.  I love the color- very, perfectly black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly waterproof. I do have to touch up every now and again to keep it looking pretty.  All-in-all this is the best eye-liner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It stays all day without being smooshed all over my eyes. Great price!</li>
            <li> My go to eye liner so far. Lasts all night. Smooth glide. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I only us this eyeliner now. Smooth  and waterproof.  Easy to handle and wont smudge.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed at first, but after a couple of applications, the tip has became firm, and has to be pressed hard to apply.  Must like dollar store makeup.  I am slightly disappointed and will not purchase again/</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this eyeliner.  It is easy to apply with nice dark smooth lines with no back tracking needed to fill in the gaps.  One swipe per eye your done.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite eyeliner. it goes on smoothly and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go anywhere without eyeliner (I put it on before heading to the hospital when I was in labor). I go through a lot of eyeliner so I have the drugstore kind for daily use and department store brands for parties/special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really enjoyed the Maybelline Master Drama line since it&#x27;s come out. It goes on easily and creates a dramatic effect with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it smudges easily and seems to run out pretty quickly. It makes a pretty thick line so you have to be careful not to overdo it when you are applying it for just a normal day.</li>
            <li> Liner has a great pigment, however, I can&#x27;t get it to turn to get more product out.  First I thought it was only a defected one, so I called and got a replacement. The new one had the same problem.  I turned the bottom to get more product but nothing happens, so then I took out the bottom piece to expose the little screw.  Still no luck turning it.  I pushed very carefully and half of the stick comes out.  I tried to put some of it back into the container and it breaks.  Now I can&#x27;t use half of the product.  Very bad mechanism.  Too bad because the liner itself is creamy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love that it is smooth and I don&#x27;t have to tug (much) at my eye to get it to go on nicely.  It does dry out after a while, so just buy a new one.  I had one for 8+months and was getting crusty, then bought a new one on Amazon and was reminded of how nice it is when it&#x27;s new. The lid broke and doesn&#x27;t snap on right.  Happened with my first one too.  Cheap plastic.  Others have had problems with it not screwing up properly, but I haven&#x27;t.  When it&#x27;s brand new you have to turn it several times before it starts raising.  Love it!</li>
            <li> love this liner.  Very dark, but it takes a little practice and lasts all day long. Never have to re-apply.</li>
            <li> Good but smudges easily. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed and the definition of the line is awesome.  I always get compliments. I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Even though the item came packaged, when I opened the the package and tried to twist the tube for liner to come out but  it didnt do so&amp;#34; into the garbage it went</li>
            <li> The eyeliner glides on pretty easily, but wears off pretty quickly. I was looking for a product that would last all day. This was not it. Plus the cap wont stay on.</li>
