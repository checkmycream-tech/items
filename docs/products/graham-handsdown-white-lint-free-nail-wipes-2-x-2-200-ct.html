            <li>As any nail tech would tell you, using anything that&#x27;s not lint free will surely have consequences.</li>
            <li>These are hands down the best lint free wipe!</li>
            <li>These are so much better than using cotton, I&#x27;m all set with those little strands being stuck under my otherwise perfect Mani for two weeks!</li>
            <li>Unlike those these are thicker and are truly lint free.</li>
            <li>Absolutely necessary for the gel nail stuff, great wipes.</li>

            <li>I bought some lint free wipes a few months before this purchase and I left a nice review before I realized those were leaving lint on my nails.</li>
            <li>They are a finished 2x2 size , folded into fourths (4 ply), so you can unfold them into a bigger, but much thinner, size if you want.  </li>
            <li>Like that it&#x27;s such a large quanity and will last a long time.</li>

            <li> Like that it&#x27;s such a large quanity and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> These ARE lint free, these are the same thickness of the 2x2 cottons I use at work (in a hospital), these may take two of them to be thick enough to take off a few fingers of regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Works really well and leaves no little fuzzies behind.</li>
            <li> While they are lint free - they are very thin and it takes several for one application or the nail remove will leak through.  </li>
            <li> I think that I had gotten 500 wipes in the other package that took about a month to come to me for china or some place like that.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse when doing your nails than having to pick off lint from a freshly painted nail that was left behind from a remover pad!</li>
            <li> I bought these little remover pads to remove my nail polish.</li>
            <li> But if only removing one nail or thin layers or something, one pad will work.</li>
            <li> These also work well when removing glitter polish - just wrap the saturated pad with a square of tin foil and let sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the wipes.  </li>

            <li> I do my own nails with gel and ordered these wipes for cleansing.  They work very well!  I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I like it!!!! good quality no lint at all.</li>
            <li> I use these to prep my nails for gel nail polish application.  These ARE lint free, these are the same thickness of the 2x2 cottons I use at work (in a hospital), these may take two of them to be thick enough to take off a few fingers of regular nail polish.  But if only removing one nail or thin layers or something, one pad will work. They are a finished 2x2 size , folded into fourths (4 ply), so you can unfold them into a bigger, but much thinner, size if you want.  Comes in a paper package.  I will buy again. I&#x27;ve included a photo to show you what I got.</li>
            <li> THESE WIPES ARE RIGHT SIZE AND DO THE LINT FREE JOB VERY WELL</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brand at a great price here on amazon. These wipes are prefect for any manicure, especially for gel manicures. As any nail tech would tell you, using anything that&#x27;s not lint free will surely have consequences. These are so much better than using cotton, I&#x27;m all set with those little strands being stuck under my otherwise perfect Mani for two weeks!

            <li> Lint free? I don&#x27;t think so. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just like they use in the salon when getting your gel nails done.  Perfect and you get tons.  I probably have enough for 2 plus years.</li>
            <li> Use these for my gel manicures.  Works great!</li>
