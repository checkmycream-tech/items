            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, this one stands out bc of how its a bit heavy but not to the point its overbearing.</li>
            <li> Wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> But I was hesitant to purchase it because it was expensive</li>

            <li> This parfum smells awesome. I first discovered it when I was shopping at Macy&#x27;s. But I was hesitant to purchase it because it was expensive and I already own quite a few other perfumes. But, I saw it in different locations when I shopped and sampled it again, decided I really enjoy the fragrance. So, I purchase it on amazon. It is authentic and looks and smells like those I sampled at the department stores. The scent lasted for a long time. I am very happy!</li>

            <li> I got the sample at Sephora.  I liked it well enough. I found it for a decent price on Amazon and I am happy with this purchase.  It has a lingering sweetness similar to the other fragrances in the Choo Collection.  Overall, this one stands out bc of how its a bit heavy but not to the point its overbearing.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged, arrived when promised. Smells amazing, price was right. What else can you ask for?</li>
