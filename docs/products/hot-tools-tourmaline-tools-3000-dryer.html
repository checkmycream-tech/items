    <ol>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>this one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The settings are great on this dryer too!  </li>
            <li>and I am so happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing dryer that I have ever owned in all my 40+ years of using dryers!  </li>
            <li>It has more body than ever!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better price on this kind of quality in my honest opinion!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think it stands right up there in quality with many of the dryers that stylists use in the salon.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is quick and ultra quiet as well as x-lite weight with great balance.</li>
            <li>Does heat up as hot as my old one, which is good.</li>
            <li>Love it, leaves my hair feeling soft and light weight, also</li>
            <li>Get very hot but has no power.</li>
            <li>First off, it is light.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries my hair in about 15 minutes, straight out of the shower, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!!</li>
            <li>Who saves that kind of box, packaging and pamphlet/booklet; my last dryer (purchased from Target) lasted me 7 years and still works!  </li>
            <li>Not sure where the amazing reviews come from, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much more manageable and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li>Dries without being too hot and damaging.</li>
            <li>Dryes fast and no frizze.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Go to a drug store or box store and buy a cheap one, it will last you a lifetime compared to this one.</li>
            <li>Third, it comes with a great concentrator attachment and what appears to be a very quality diffuser attachment (I use the concentrator and love it, but probably won&#x27;t use the diffuser due to the fact that it would probably make my wildly thick hair look like Bozo the Clown).  </li>
            <li>of the Hot Tools Tourmaline Tools 3000 Hair Dryer that I purchased directly from Amazon (not a third-party seller on Amazon)</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair and try everything to make it look better.</li>
            <li>because when I first turned it on, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, this is so quiet, there is no way it will be able to dry my hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have short hair, the end was obviously clean since it was brand new</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Can hear something inside buzzing a little more each day.</li>
            <li>I had invested a great deal of time reading reviews and comparing ratings (all on Amazon) of multiple dryers featuring tourmaline heat, mid-range power, and a fast drying time with minimal damage to my hair as possible; ultimately deciding on this particular dryer.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I am compelled to do so about this dryer.</li>
            <li>I must have been burning my hair with the old one!</li>
            <li>The Hot Tools Tourmaline hair dryer actually makes my hair shiny and thicker looking.</li>
            <li>That is a good thing when you are 40+ years old and trying to dry wildly thick hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Kinda short for my liking but very durable and flexible.</li>
            <li>I searched in vain for a blow dryer with 3-speeds when my old Conair died.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;My thinning, wimpy, short grey hair needed a really low speed to be able to actually style my hair</li>
            <li>Super Quiet, long enough cord.</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, I am back to using it after my new one died.  </li>
            <li>The low speed is really low &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li>It normally takes 20-45 minutes to dry my hair if I don&#x27;t let it sit in a towel for half an hour first.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and powerful, have had for 2 months now and use everyday.  </li>

            <li> Relatively quiet and a long cord - what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> and I have found that even on medium heat the dryer has plenty of power to quickly dry my hair and get me out the door.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer on a regular basis and was very pleased with the first 5 uses that took place over a 30+-day period, but the next time, I was proven wrong; 3 minutes in to my 6-8 minute drying process the motor started to make a horrible ceasing noise that ended up halting the motor completely.  </li>
            <li> Easy to get to the cold shot button when you need it,</li>
            <li> What a total waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Average.  </li>
            <li> Lots of airflow so less heat is needed.</li>
            <li> Not Rose thought Orange..</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with the longevity (only 6 uses!)</li>
            <li> However, what&#x27;s up with that thick cord?!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and I recall reading the brand&#x27;s warranty as longer that the time I&#x27;ve owned the dryer, but seriously, it&#x27;s a hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> and I had trusted the customer reviews that I had tediously researched!&lt;br</li>
            <li> A measly 30-day return policy by Amazon didn&#x27;t cover it</li>
            <li> A bit awkward while using it.</li>
            <li> icing on the cake of disappointment comes after I say to myself, I&#x27;m an Amazon Prime customer with an Amazon Visa; I should have no problem getting a refund, credit or exchange.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> (Happily wrong!).  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>

            <li> Super Quiet, long enough cord. I have very thick, wavy hair. It normally takes 20-45 minutes to dry my hair if I don&#x27;t let it sit in a towel for half an hour first. This dryer dries my hair in about 15 minutes, straight out of the shower, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!! Lots of airflow so less heat is needed. I won&#x27;t use the diffuser, but it&#x27;s the biggest one I&#x27;ve ever seen that came with a dryer before.</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes my hair so much more manageable and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is quick and ultra quiet as well as x-lite weight with great balance. I do hair for a living and would purchase another when needed. The cord is about 6ft. Kinda short for my liking but very durable and flexible.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Dryes fast and no frizze.</li>
            <li> Love it, leaves my hair feeling soft and light weight, also</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this and I am so happy with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I searched in vain for a blow dryer with 3-speeds when my old Conair died.&lt;br /&gt;My thinning, wimpy, short grey hair needed a really low speed to be able to actually style my hair not just blast it dry.&lt;br /&gt;All the new dryers seem to be aimed at consumers with long, thick, Rapunzel-like hair!&lt;br /&gt;But this one is perfect for me. The low speed is really low &amp; gentle. I would totally recommend it for someone with the same hair issues.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does heat up as hot as my old one, which is good. I must have been burning my hair with the old one! Ha! However, what&#x27;s up with that thick cord?! A bit awkward while using it. That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 months.  Thank you to Amazon for refunding this purchase.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet and a long cord - what we were looking for!</li>
            <li> Get very hot but has no power.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my hair. Dries without being too hot and damaging. Not Rose thought Orange..</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing dryer that I have ever owned in all my 40+ years of using dryers!  First off, it is light.  That is a good thing when you are 40+ years old and trying to dry wildly thick hair like mine.  Secondly, it is quiet.  It is deceptively quiet in fact, because when I first turned it on, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh, this is so quiet, there is no way it will be able to dry my hair&amp;#34; (Happily wrong!).  Third, it comes with a great concentrator attachment and what appears to be a very quality diffuser attachment (I use the concentrator and love it, but probably won&#x27;t use the diffuser due to the fact that it would probably make my wildly thick hair look like Bozo the Clown).  The settings are great on this dryer too!
