            <li>I love this product and my cuticles need it so much !</li>
            <li>It works better than many cuticle oils and it moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a watery consistency than an oil and isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>have really improved and I do not get as many hang nails.</li>
            <li>I am no longer biting my nails and my nails look a lot more feminine :) The only reason I didnt vote five stars is because I have to use quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li>Wheat Germ oil, aloe, apricot kernel oil and safflower oil absorb quickly and keep your cuticles healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply the oil right after I remove my polish &amp; it keeps my cuticles nice &amp; soft.</li>

            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>RIGHT.</li>
            <li>so I have been doing it right before my showers.</li>

            <li>Sally Hansen never fails.  </li>
            <li>so be aware of that when using it.</li>
            <li>My cuticles have a tendency to dry out and by using this oil twice daily, they are doing really great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M 54YRS OLD &amp; I PASS 4 A FULL DECADE</li>
            <li>This handy little bottle of Vitamin E nail and cuticle oil fits nicely in your nail kit and doesn&#x27;t leak like other bottles of vitamin E oil</li>
            <li>so it should last me a good long while.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that gives quick relief and moisture right where I need it to go.</li>
            <li>I love Sally Hansen products, this oil is what I expected...</li>
            <li>, It doesn&#x27;t secure tightly enough.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my cuticles .</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It lasts very longtime.</li>
            <li>thanks for this product, i just hop that it was sold in my country, but i still can buy it with amazon so thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very empressed.</li>
            <li>Once I get in the shower, I run the hot water over them and then shower as normal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for some nail care help!</li>
            <li>&amp; I BELIEVE IT HAS HELPED KEEP A MORE YOUTHFUL LOOK IN GENERAL AROUND MY ENTIRE EYES &amp; LIPS AREA BECAUSE OF MY LONGTERM USE.</li>
            <li>love the brush that comes with this stuff because it is big enough to covers my nails and cuticles all in a couple of swipes.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it as a night time treatment and it works well for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for your nails</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars yet as i haven&#x27;t had the product that long.</li>
            <li>This does not take more than a few seconds per nail.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hard skin around the nails and cuticles of course.</li>
            <li>If you massage this oil into your nail bed it will help to stimulate new nail growth.</li>
            <li>apply this oil at night, usually while watching a youtube video, and I make sure to just massage it into the nail bed as well as around the nail.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this oil, I rarely have any dry cuticles</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>This oil is absolutely a must for daily nail care.  </li>
            <li>I am almost 24 years old and have suffered from panic disorder a majority of my life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I run out of oil and refill this bottle with Kama Sutra massage oils or the Burt&#x27;s Bees natural massage oils.</li>
            <li>and then I picked it up as an adult.</li>
            <li>They are soft and I no longer have an issue with cracking.</li>
            <li>Though price of product is ok shipping and handling IS RIDICULOUS.</li>
            <li>THAT IS THE TRUE STORY OF THESE LITTLE BOTTLES OF MIRACLES.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil since December and have waited a few months to do a full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My toe nails were cracked and dry and this really helped repair them.</li>
            <li>Luckily my nails grow fast but lately, I have been taking extra caution to keep them painted and oiled up</li>
            <li>I then let it dry and follow up with Soap &amp; Glory&#x27;s Hand Food (HIGHLY recommend this combo).</li>
            <li>I live in the Arizonza and my skin gets so dry diuring the winter and using hand lotion</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of water and does not dry on like nail polish (it will never harden)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this especially since the bottle lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My nails were feeling weak and easily breaking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it daily in years because it works a bit different in the dry weather that I  live in.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and less snags.</li>
            <li>Since summer has come around (and since my last professional manicure..don&#x27;t get me started), my cuticles have been dry and cracking</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It has the consistency of water and does not dry on like nail polish (it will never harden)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this especially since the bottle lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My nails were feeling weak and easily breaking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it daily in years because it works a bit different in the dry weather that I  live in.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and less snags.</li>
            <li> Since summer has come around (and since my last professional manicure..don&#x27;t get me started), my cuticles have been dry and cracking</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s on tight only to find after its been tipped over that it was not tight.</li>
            <li> thanks to it&#x27;s essential oil complex containing the following:&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin</li>
            <li> Because of this my nails and cuticles are always dry and crack, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle oil fairly frequently for the past month and have noticed a big difference in the feel and appearance of my cuticles.</li>
            <li> A LONG, LONG TIME &amp; I HOPE &amp; PRAY THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply when your nails are polished and dry or every day as a healing treat before bed.</li>
            <li> Use it as a finishing touch to soothe dry cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has helped my fingernails look healthier and stronger and helped with unsightly, dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> My skin is SOOO dry that it cracks and bleeds around my nails</li>
            <li> I have very tough cuticles that grow quickly and get dry &amp; crack.  </li>
            <li> It created dry spots around my nails and caused me to get hang nails!</li>
            <li> This bottle should last you a few years as a small dab goes a long, LONG way.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;thin&#x27; nails which break easily especially because I wash my hands constantly</li>
            <li> IT HELPS TO KEEP MY DARK CIRCLES AWAY</li>
            <li> I hate the top  though</li>
            <li> but when I stop using it they go back to their sad, dry state a few days later.</li>
            <li> The oil has made my nails stronger and they split less.</li>
            <li> THEY&#x27;RE HALF</li>
            <li> cuticle oil claims to give you softer cuticles and less brittle nails</li>
            <li> Thank you for the nail file little pouch to store it all</li>
            <li> A little dab of this oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a little over 24 hours and my cuticles already look and feel</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few times a week for over a month now, and I have seen little to no improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week because I am not a creature of habit, but even that has drastically improved the condition of my nails.</li>
            <li> The shipping took less than a week!</li>
            <li> I would compuslively bite my nails everyday!</li>
            <li> I think i am still trying to master getting the correct amount on my nails without going overboard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed at how rough my nails and cuticles suddenly look.</li>
            <li> A little too thin for me, but</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> You need to use a very small amount of each nail and voila.</li>
            <li> but seriously dries out my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It feels a little weird if you have foot issues..as I do...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> My nails are too thin to get manicures.  </li>
            <li> They sand, scrape and use chemical exfoliants all of which make my thin nails even thinner.  </li>
            <li> This oil, however, made my cuticles and hangnails infinitely worse.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t terribly greasy but isn&#x27;t dry to the touch either.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> I may just have really bad cuticles</li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot and my cuticles can go bad in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I DONT CARE HOW BAD UR CUTICLES R</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a really bad biter, and I bite the skin, too.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that you have to wash it off before you add your nail polish.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell,  its like cooking oil.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for dry hard skin around the nails and cuticles of course.</li>
            <li> My nails are too thin to get manicures.  They sand, scrape and use chemical exfoliants all of which make my thin nails even thinner.  I don&#x27;t do a particularly good job of trimming my cuticles myself.  They look good for a couple of days then the dryness sets in and the ragggedness shows.  Cuticle creams just kind of clogged my nail bed and didn&#x27;t really do much.  Sally Hansen Vit E Oil is great and I&#x27;m surprised at how well it works.  I put it on in the morning and at bedtime.  It absorbs and keeps my cuticles and the skin surrounding my nails looking good.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely a must for daily nail care.  I&#x27;ve used it daily in years because it works a bit different in the dry weather that I  live in. This oil was my number one, until I tried Avoplex and Essie apricot oil.</li>
            <li> I have very tough cuticles that grow quickly and get dry &amp; crack.  Since I started using this oil, I rarely have any dry cuticles (only when I don&#x27;t put it on for a while) and it helps my nails to grow.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love Sally Hansen products, this oil is what I expected...cuticle oil. I hate the top  though, It doesn&#x27;t secure tightly enough. I think it&#x27;s on tight only to find after its been tipped over that it was not tight. Other than that its okay. It shipped fast so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement in my cuticles . I may just have really bad cuticles but I will keep searching for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have been using a nail strengthener which works wonders for my nails but seriously dries out my cuticles. Anyways, I purchased this stuff when I ran out of my cuticle cream and it&#x27;s pretty terrible. It&#x27;s more of a watery consistency than an oil and isn&#x27;t very moisturizing. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> Great Revitalizer and Moisturizing Complex. Though price of product is ok shipping and handling IS RIDICULOUS. I will recommend the product to anyone but I&#x27;m reconsidering the ordering of it. Sanctuary Nail Care (Mel Trinidad)</li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot and my cuticles can go bad in a heartbeat. This oil helps restore the moisture and speeds healing thus easing the pain in my fingers.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this vitamin E cuticle  oil! It&#x27;s the best! I think it&#x27;s great that&#x27;s all I really can say is great great great! And a nice smoove feeling at the end!</li>
            <li> My manicurist noticed the difference. The oil has made my nails stronger and they split less.</li>
            <li> I am almost 24 years old and have suffered from panic disorder a majority of my life. I would compuslively bite my nails everyday! Finally, two weeks ago, I bought this Sally Hansen Vitmin E. I know its recommended to use it at night but Ive been using it in the mornings too. It is excellent! It hardens the nails and it makes my hypotrophic cuticles look much better. I am no longer biting my nails and my nails look a lot more feminine :) The only reason I didnt vote five stars is because I have to use quite a bit of it. I have to dip the brush in the bottle about three times to cover all my nails.</li>
            <li> This is an overall great product. It works better than many cuticle oils and it moisturizes like no other. Great product.</li>
            <li> My cuticles have a tendency to dry out and by using this oil twice daily, they are doing really great.</li>
            <li> something to keep my nails at their best</li>
            <li> The product is phenomenonal... delivery was fast and perfect... Thank you for the nail file little pouch to store it all</li>
            <li> I found this oil well worth the money.  My toe nails were cracked and dry and this really helped repair them.</li>
            <li> It does the job. Moisturizes nicely. Will continue to but this.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT KEEPS MY NAILS AND CUTICLES STRONG AND SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;I KEEP ONE AT THE OFFICE AND ONE AT HOME AND USE DAILY.</li>
            <li> My nails look healthy after I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Yes this is great cuticle oil it doesn&#x27;t evaporate 5 minutes after you put it on like most do, it stays on ur cuticles and moisturizers them.Therefore you can buy it cheaper king suppers.</li>
            <li> I bought this last December and I have been using it on-and-off since. Whenever I use it, my nails cuticles are moisturized and my nails look very healthy but when I stop using it they go back to their sad, dry state a few days later. I highly recommend this especially since the bottle lasts for a very long time. You need to use a very small amount of each nail and voila.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few times a week for over a month now, and I have seen little to no improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product that seems to last forever. I always end up using it until the gold has rubbed off the label haha I just put a dab of oil on each nail and rub it all over my nail and cuticle.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell,  its like cooking oil. Dont see any difrerence. Woulndt buy it ever again</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The best cuticle oil I have used.  I bought a couple bottles in case they discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Received item as describe, uses item twice a week makes cuticles very soft and healthy will buy product again</li>
            <li> I like that it has a nail polish brush !</li>
            <li> This handy little bottle of Vitamin E nail and cuticle oil fits nicely in your nail kit and doesn&#x27;t leak like other bottles of vitamin E oil seem to on occasion. Wheat Germ oil, aloe, apricot kernel oil and safflower oil absorb quickly and keep your cuticles healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply when your nails are polished and dry or every day as a healing treat before bed. If you massage this oil into your nail bed it will help to stimulate new nail growth. Not recommended just before you have a manicure or pedicure. Use it as a finishing touch to soothe dry cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I run out of oil and refill this bottle with Kama Sutra massage oils or the Burt&#x27;s Bees natural massage oils. You can also add some of your own essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush makes it easy to apply this oil and the bottle never leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that you have to wash it off before you add your nail polish. Seems counterintuitive to wash away the moisturizer that you need to have on your nails.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. Vitamin E is supposedly great for your cuticles, and I generally don&#x27;t mind Sally Hansen products. This oil, however, made my cuticles and hangnails infinitely worse. It created dry spots around my nails and caused me to get hang nails! I didn&#x27;t have hangnails before using this oil!  I don&#x27;t know why it did this, but I won&#x27;t continue using this. I&#x27;m so disappointed at how rough my nails and cuticles suddenly look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS CUTICLE OIL 4 A LONG, LONG TIME &amp; I HOPE &amp; PRAY THEY NEVER STOP MAKING IT. I DONT CARE HOW BAD UR CUTICLES R, THIS STUFF IS GONNA BLOW U AWAY. I DONT KNOW WHY OR HOW, ALL I KNOW IS THE SMALLEST DROP OF THIS OIL MASSAGED INTO CUTICLE &amp; NAILBED OF EACH FINGER AND TOES KEEP ALL MY NAILS CUTICLE FREE. BUT IT DOESNT STOP THERE. I&#x27;VE BEEN ABLE 2 GROW MY FINGERNAILS 2 GREAT LENGTHS USING THIS STUFF BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE NAILS FROM BECOMING BRITTLE. ALSO, GREAT LIP BALM IN COLD OR DRY CLIMATES &amp; AN EXCELLENT OVERNIGHT UNDER EYE SIRUM. THATS RIGHT. IT HELPS TO KEEP MY DARK CIRCLES AWAY &amp; I BELIEVE IT HAS HELPED KEEP A MORE YOUTHFUL LOOK IN GENERAL AROUND MY ENTIRE EYES &amp; LIPS AREA BECAUSE OF MY LONGTERM USE. I&#x27;M 54YRS OLD &amp; I PASS 4 A FULL DECADE YOUNGER - ALWAYS. THAT IS THE TRUE STORY OF THESE LITTLE BOTTLES OF MIRACLES. BTW, THEY&#x27;RE HALF THE PRICE HERE AT AMAZON + ARRIVED IN PRISTINE CONDITION. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.</li>
            <li> this product is magnificent in healing the cuticle and nourishing the nail bed.  I would definitely recommend to others.  Nails are healthy, no cuticle tears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cuticle oil fairly frequently for the past month and have noticed a big difference in the feel and appearance of my cuticles. Much smoother and less snags.</li>
            <li> It gives your cuticles alot of life but it is kind of a hassal because you have to wash it off but great for price!</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;thin&#x27; nails which break easily especially because I wash my hands constantly (being in the medical field). This product has helped my fingernails look healthier and stronger and helped with unsightly, dry cuticles. I always take this with me when I travel and they make my mani/pedi last longer too!</li>
            <li> I love this product and my cuticles need it so much ! It lasts very longtime. I use it every night and my nails and cuticles look much better. thanks for this product, i just hop that it was sold in my country, but i still can buy it with amazon so thanks.</li>
            <li> was a Gift for My Niece, she say they are great to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very empressed. The shipping took less than a week! She included a nail file with it as a gift. Thank you will purchase from this store again. Then product makes my cuticles so soft and smooth. I love it and recommend it! Thank you.</li>
            <li> My skin is SOOO dry that it cracks and bleeds around my nails (I&#x27;m a really bad biter, and I bite the skin, too.) This is the only thing that gives quick relief and moisture right where I need it to go. Again, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I used this product &amp; S.H. VitaSurge cuticle Gel together &amp; my nails look wonderful. I apply the oil right after I remove my polish &amp; it keeps my cuticles nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I have only ever used cuticle creams but have been wanting to switch to oil so I picked this one up. Sally Hansen never fails.  Since summer has come around (and since my last professional manicure..don&#x27;t get me started), my cuticles have been dry and cracking so I definitely needed to do something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cuticle oil claims to give you softer cuticles and less brittle nails thanks to it&#x27;s essential oil complex containing the following:&lt;br /&gt;-Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;-Wheat Germ&lt;br /&gt;-Apricot Kernel&lt;br /&gt;-Aloe &amp; Panthenol moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;The package recommends brushing the oil onto your nails and cuticles every night before bed and massaging in. It just says to wash off before applying nail color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the brush that comes with this stuff because it is big enough to covers my nails and cuticles all in a couple of swipes. I do find though, that my hands are still too oily once I massage it in so I have been doing it right before my showers. I will swipe on, massage in and then wait a while. Once I get in the shower, I run the hot water over them and then shower as normal. The oil comes off while I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I can notice a different in my nails. I will admit, when I get stressed, I bite my nails....a lot. This is actually a habit I used to get on to my sister about and then I picked it up as an adult. It infuriates me. Luckily my nails grow fast but lately, I have been taking extra caution to keep them painted and oiled up so I revert to biting my lips or inside of my cheek instead. Ouch..by the way. Anyways, enough about my nervous tendencies. Admit it, you have them too. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails seem stronger which, I was not expecting and my cuticles are much more manageable. They are soft and I no longer have an issue with cracking. I use this a few times a week because I am not a creature of habit, but even that has drastically improved the condition of my nails. This bottle contains quite a bit of oil so it should last me a good long while.I will definitely need it in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggestion: Massage this cuticle oil into your toe nails and cuticles and wear socks around for a bit. It feels a little weird if you have foot issues..as I do...but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I work in a nursing home,  so I constantly wash my hands.  Because of this my nails and cuticles are always dry and crack, especially in the winter. A little dab of this oil and they&#x27;re good as new.  I mainly use it as a night time treatment and it works well for me.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> In an effort to support my NY Resolution of nail care I ordered this and am very happy with it... apply mostly at night.  My nails/cuticle are gradually improving.  It&#x27;s still January!</li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as I thought it would be.  A little too thin for me, but I am still going to use it of course.  Guess I thought I was getting regular cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, soft oil, safe for skin and nails.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for your nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product a little over 24 hours and my cuticles already look and feel 75% better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This produt is a 4,000 I.U. vitamin E nail and cuticle oil. It has the consistency of water and does not dry on like nail polish (it will never harden) so be aware of that when using it. This bottle should last you a few years as a small dab goes a long, LONG way. Absorbs ok/pretty good. Isn&#x27;t terribly greasy but isn&#x27;t dry to the touch either. I think i am still trying to master getting the correct amount on my nails without going overboard. I threw the package away before i got a chance to review this so i can&#x27;t remember the rest of the ingredients. sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this again if i had to. It&#x27;s done an excellent job in just 24 hours time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars yet as i haven&#x27;t had the product that long. I&#x27;ll update accordingly as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Another excellent product from Sally Hansen. It&#x27;s improved the health of my nails and cuticles in just a couple of weeks, and it doesn&#x27;t take much so it will last a long time - great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> The oil is helping my cuticles  a lot.  I live in the Arizonza and my skin gets so dry diuring the winter and using hand lotion was not helping my cuticles so I decided to try the cuticle oil and my cuticles have really improved and I do not get as many hang nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil since December and have waited a few months to do a full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has done wonders for my nails. My nails were feeling weak and easily breaking so I started to look into cuticle oils as I&#x27;d heard that they were the way to go. No one warned me of the plethora of options when it comes to cuticle oils though! What lead me to Sally Hansen is mostly brand loyalty. I have been using their Nailgrowth Miracle for YEARS underneath my self manicures. It&#x27;s always made my nails feel nice and strong, so I trusted them on some level with a cuticle oil. That that product has always worked well for me, regardless of my actual nail health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this oil at night, usually while watching a youtube video, and I make sure to just massage it into the nail bed as well as around the nail. This does not take more than a few seconds per nail. I then let it dry and follow up with Soap &amp; Glory&#x27;s Hand Food (HIGHLY recommend this combo). You see the difference in your nail clarity instantly, and with continues use, especially with using the hand creme to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;, your hands will look AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are very strong now. I apply this oil even when I have nail polish on (I do let me nails breathe for a week from time to time, but mostly my nails remain painted all the time). I absolutely love this oil. Highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for some nail care help!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used at such reasonable prices.</li>
