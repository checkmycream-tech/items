            <li>It doesn&#x27;t whiten but it gets my skin squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>This soap has been amazing so far!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more once I&#x27;ve used up the bar, which may take awhile since I heard it lasts a long time! :D</li>
            <li>it has not delivered any new results, It is more of an exfoliant not a lightner.</li>
            <li>This soap is good for exfoliating, not sure about it changing your pigment, overall a great soap to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really find this so useful to me</li>
            <li>had my doubts at first but after using it</li>
            <li>The first time I just used it all over my body in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is made with milk protein which is especially beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li>Stay consistent and positive and you will too</li>
            <li>Most men don&#x27;t notice subtleties, so for my husband to say something, the improvements definitely were not subtle.  </li>
            <li>I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and after using this soap I&#x27;m not itching as much.</li>
            <li>BUT MY SPOT ARE NOT FADING FAST EITHER,MAYBE</li>
            <li>like to see results fast</li>
            <li>If u feel as though it&#x27;s too much, then you really don&#x27;t want change.</li>
            <li>our very well ...</li>
            <li>I have reordered the soap and will be re-ordering the gel cream very soon.</li>
            <li>how much softer it feels after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain about this soap.</li>
            <li>Just a regular soap nothing special in it</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>This is a much better result than I have obtained using other products within my price range and far quicker.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done rinsing off my skin feels clean but dry</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and I can see a difference in the lightening of dark areas on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable fading after two weeks - and almost completely gone after one month.  </li>
            <li>It is not as harsh as other soaps and leaves my skin looking brighter with a bit of a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft &amp; silky after 1 use..</li>
            <li>I will write back at two months on the progress, but so far I would definitely recommend.</li>

            <li> I really see a difference. Once I&#x27;m done rinsing off my skin feels clean but dry so I wash my body with my regular cleanser and then I feel great. I have eczema and after using this soap I&#x27;m not itching as much.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> SO FAR GOOD,I HAVE NOT HAD A BREAK OUT BUT MY SPOT ARE NOT FADING FAST EITHER,MAYBE BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR 2WKS,BUT IT&#x27;S OKAY</li>
            <li> the product was ok, I have no problems with it I think I have to use it some more in order to give a quality ratings</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really find this so useful to me but it smells good that&#x27;s why I only gave it 2 stars</li>
            <li> My husband has complemented me on my face since using this product.  Most men don&#x27;t notice subtleties, so for my husband to say something, the improvements definitely were not subtle.  Definitely brightened me up and shaved off some years...</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for my skin, I can&#x27;t wait to order more, but the price could be lower. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D A M N!! STILL EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It doesn&#x27;t whiten but it gets my skin squeeky clean. Literally.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this product. Results disappointing.</li>
            <li> this is a very strong soap. had my doubts at first but after using it i must say i am pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I used this soap just as recommended for a little over a month but I saw no results so I discontinued using it.&lt;br /&gt;I like to see results fast but I was more than patient and it got me no where :(</li>
            <li> I love this soap nice and smooth leaves skin silky</li>
            <li> I can see a little bit of a difference after a month  so far.</li>
            <li> I used it for some dark spots on my thigh that appeared after mosquito bites.  Noticeable fading after two weeks - and almost completely gone after one month.  I was using scar creams before the soap but was not seeing any results.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and I can see a difference in the lightening of dark areas on my skin.  The first time I just used it all over my body in the shower.  The second time I just used it on my face and left it on for five minutes. I could definitely see a difference.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Since I was a teenager, I have had a lot of black spots on my butt. I started using this product and they are clearing up. I&#x27;m very surprised and happy that they are clearing up. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just a regular soap nothing special in it</li>
            <li> This soap has been remarkable. There&#x27;s no words that can describe what this soap has done for me. I am now lighter than my boyfriend who is a toffee complexion. I am now caramel complexed. I went from being very dark (Naomi Campbell complexion) who is beautiful BTW, but I&#x27;m more like rihannas complexion. This will not happen over time, it takes consistency. I used it every day morning (6am) evening  when I got off work (4pm) and night 9(pm) or later depending on how long I stayed out. I never went to bed without washing my body. I also used it on my face. If you want results you have to work... The same comes with weight loss. If u feel as though it&#x27;s too much, then you really don&#x27;t want change. My skin changed in a matter of 3 months. I seen a DRASTIC chang within only a week. Stay consistent and positive and you will too</li>
            <li> This soap has been amazing so far! I love how clean it makes my skin feel. It is not as harsh as other soaps and leaves my skin looking brighter with a bit of a healthy glow to it. I love that it is made with milk protein which is especially beneficial for the skin. Will definitely order more once I&#x27;ve used up the bar, which may take awhile since I heard it lasts a long time! :D</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliation...nice smell...fast delivery..</li>
            <li> good product.. will buy again..seeing good result from using it ... my skin is evening our very well ... i am excited for summer</li>
            <li> The soap makes my skin so soft and I noticed the few dark spots on my face are fading. I use this soap along with the gel cream. Will definitely repurchase. I have used this product for a week.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 3/31/13: It has been almost 4 weeks since using the combination of the two products and I must say the dark patches are almost gone from my cheeks. I have reordered the soap and will be re-ordering the gel cream very soon.</li>
            <li> Not really working. At least I don&#x27;t see a difference at all... maybe another product might work better. Everyone is different...</li>
            <li> This soap smoothed out my very rough elbows and subsequent rash scars. It&#x27;s a great exfoliate to prep skin for lotions. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It do irritates my skin, worse whitening soap ever!!!waste of money it doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> This soap is good for exfoliating, not sure about it changing your pigment, overall a great soap to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with this product it has not delivered any new results, It is more of an exfoliant not a lightner.</li>
            <li> I like this soap works for me.</li>
            <li> Works great! It does what it says it does, after purchasing this soap wait a while...a few months before making your next purchase... your skin might adjust to the product and it will not longer work...just a suggestion!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it . Save your money go buy any other product!</li>
            <li> It has only been day two for me but I love the sent of the soap and how much softer it feels after I wash it. Im using it around my neck and forehead because it is darker because of the oil from my face and hair.Already I cansee a slight difference in color. My only problem im having is I have noticed my fingers are drier than usual and apear to be chapped so tomorrow I will be washing my face with with gloves to protect my hands.</li>
            <li> All this soap has done so far is dry my skin out!  I also do not care for the scent.  It smells like something out of a hospital.</li>
            <li> Hello! I purchased the soap along with the bleaching gel and lotion about three weeks ago. While I use the lotion all over, including my face and neck, I use the soap and gel on my face, neck and upper chest area only. Being a dark Asian American who tans easily, I spent quite a lot of time on the beach when I was young. Now, at age 58, I have the age spots to prove it, and they are so not cute like freckles. They are large, amoeba like, and apparently social because they slowly creep toward each other to form even larger spots, especially on my face. With use of all three products on my face, I am seeing a lessening of darkness in the time that I have used them. This is a much better result than I have obtained using other products within my price range and far quicker. I will write back at two months on the progress, but so far I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about this soap. I bought it to fade a dark patch of skin on my chin after I an accident that left a scar. The bar seems to be lasting forever (I put it back into the box when I&#x27;m done using it). Also my skin seems to be clearer of blemishes. The dark patch is nearly gone so I will keep using this product.</li>
