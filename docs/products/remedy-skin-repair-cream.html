            <li>I got the first tube of this at a local hospital during a stay there..and found it to be healing, non-greasy and a great product.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and it really helps with my eczema.  </li>
            <li>Ordered 3 more from Amazon because I really like how it heals chapped hands.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>But I found it on Amazon and love it so much that I tell everyone about it.  </li>
            <li>None of it&#x27;s miraculous claims came true.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best lotion my husband and I have used for dry, irritated skin on any part if the body.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes sensitive skin very well and has a mild pleasant scent.</li>

            <li>Has a mild citrus smell and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it here, and ordered a ton of it.</li>
            <li>Works great on babies and my old skin makes it soft and helps with the wrinkles on my arms.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick and a lot of good skin protectants.</li>

            <li>My sister in law was given this lotion during a recent hospital stay, and I loved it so much I had to buy some!</li>
            <li>Fast and just what I needed!!</li>
            <li>exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Best stuff on the market for an overall body lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution for skincare that actually works on dry skin without grease.</li>
            <li>Simply put, Remedy is the best lotion for dry and cracked skin I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Does fine but has too much of a perfume smell to it for me.  </li>
            <li>A good remedy for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is light and non greasy feeling but really nourishes skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this cream, works great on rough hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, is easily absorbed and leaves the skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I really liked it too; it smells great and is quickly absorbed, non-greasy and a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li>The price is right, too.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and gives your skin a smooth healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>Got a full size tube from a nurse while in hospital recently and love it.</li>
            <li>Nice cream, not too thick and not too watery like most lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product with a faint, pleasant scent but lasts much longer on the skin than other products.</li>
            <li>Now all the hospitals and nursing homes use it as it is incredibly effective, fast acting and very soothing without leaving your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Used this for first time when sent home from hospital after surgery.</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce the itching from winter/dry skin!</li>
            <li>I first saw it when my Mom was in the hospital.</li>
            <li>First tried this stuff in hospital.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this product during my radiation treatments.</li>
            <li>The dryness disappeared with the first application.</li>
            <li>I first used this on my husband while he was in hospital to help keep him from getting bed sores.  </li>
            <li>and I love the size - use it for travel, by the kitchen sink, or put an extra tube in the car.  </li>
            <li>very healing!</li>
            <li>PRODUCT WAS FIRST USED</li>
            <li>I would wake up at night and all my skin all over my body would be hot and itchy.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first used product while a patient in hospital.  </li>
            <li>I first used Remedy at my mom&#x27;s recommendation because she is a nurse</li>
            <li>Was first given to me at a hospital stay.</li>
            <li>I first used this product while in the hospital</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product when I had my knee replaced.</li>
            <li>If I actually use it up, I won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>It is a bit expensive compared to the many good skin creams out there.</li>
            <li>used it in hospital first and it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>Superior to any other lotions, by far.</li>
            <li>Nice light subtle smell, not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best lotion for dry sensitive hands or for people with ecxema (sp?)</li>
            <li>I have never found a better product for dry skin, heels, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li>Worked better than anything else has for my wife&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of their products I&#x27;ve had to use on patients the most for chapped skin, extremely dry areas, and reddened areas.</li>
            <li>Love using this for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I buy it in the large pump bottles for the house and this size for my office and purse.</li>
            <li>I had bought the large bottle of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I ordered the large pump container of this cream.</li>
            <li>Love this for dry skin!</li>
            <li>They looked great after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>My hands were getting very sore.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and repairs the skin</li>

            <li>Very moisturizing and nourishing....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this stuff to everyone!</li>

            <li>my hands not hurt as much from cuts &amp;breaks during Winter.</li>
            <li>, it is really helping my cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Now the whole family uses it to protect ourselves from the ravages of this horrid winter.</li>
            <li>Helped with my leg problems but not as much as I had thought it would be through a friend of ours who praised about it.</li>
            <li>We really tried every moisturizer on the market and even some herbal remedies and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>I could see results the very next day and within a week, his skin was baby smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This works very well at keeping my hands from drying and cracking.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on other very dry areas and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t more extraordinary than your ordinary drugstore lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited not to be rubbing my arms constantly.</li>
            <li>I wash them a lot and they dry out and crack easily</li>
            <li>It is the best everyday cream to protect your skin, especially skin that tends to be extremely dry, cracked, and weather beaten.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and long lasting results accompanied by nice fragrance that is unisex.  </li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to soak into the skin, but is wonderful for healing super dry, cracked skin, especially with regular use.</li>
            <li>Her skin became very smooth, less itchy.</li>
            <li>I used it in a hospital for the first time 3 years ago and found that it is not greasy, makes my skin soft, and rubs in without having to wipe off any.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my diabetic skin.</li>
            <li>Works like hospital said it would during radiation and has repaired my mothers older skin.</li>
            <li>It is my main product now besides coconut oil.</li>
            <li>This  product was used in the hospital on an older person&#x27;s skin and it helped heal and soften her skin.</li>
            <li>Rich and nongreasy; lasts a long time without reapplying.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>THE SKIN&#x27;,I WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is amazing to say the least.</li>
            <li>Really help clear up rash my grandbaby had.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This cream works well for me -- non-sticky, stays for a long time and the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li>I lost all my hair and my head is nice and reflective if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>Love this stiff.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to use on my vacation with new lotion applicator.  </li>
            <li>not greasy and does work in super dry climates with cracked hands &amp; feet</li>
            <li>My husband loves it, says it helps him tremendously with the dry skin on his legs and feet.</li>
            <li>if they could tone down the smell it would be fine.</li>
            <li>My husband is very masculine and doesn&#x27;t like girly products</li>
            <li>There is a definite fragrance when it is first applied.</li>
            <li>It also had itchy red spots and hot spots.</li>
            <li>I first found out about this from my sister in law who works at a medical supply store, who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>All the ladies I know, including my wife&#x27;s friends highly recommend this cream for young and old.  </li>
            <li>It works a little better than regular hand creams in addressing this problem.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old HATES having lotion put on his face</li>
            <li>When my mom, a nurse, was in the last stages of ALS she was very worried about getting bedsores.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR SCARS AND SKIN SOFT.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I am a healthcare professional.</li>
            <li>Soft but not greasey.  </li>
            <li>old people she was working with were raving about it&lt;</li>
            <li>Cures my sensitive skin isssues.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d recommend not ordering any books anywhere near when you order the lotion, because they might send the lotion with a paperback book and hurt both products in the shipping process.</li>
            <li>Soothing, soft, and</li>
            <li>It was a mess to clean and was basically unusable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on dry skin, foot calluses, and all kinds of skin problems and it works really well!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also small and easy to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>My elderly mother first used this in Rehab for her dry, flaky skin and saw the difference it made!</li>
            <li>We will certainly keep using it for o long time to come.</li>
            <li>Works very well on my dry, sensitive hide.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my pharmacist for minor skin irritations and works very well.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy the large size later.</li>
            <li>It proves that it contains natural oil with little preservatives, or else it would not have gone rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not become gummy on  the  skin and really helps to heal dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does help with dry hands and mine</li>
            <li>It really works on dry, chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>Really works to relieve my dry cracked hands!</li>
            <li>This lotion really helps my husband&#x27;s hands when they are very dry....</li>
            <li>My aunt was visited by a nurse who introduced her to this product to protect her 90 year old fragile skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has aggressive squamous cell cancer of the head and neck and is at the end of a 6 week course of radiation directed directly on the left side of his face and ear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a breast cancer survivor, due to the radition my breast would itch so much for a year.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Having my hands constantly in water plus the fact that I have dry skin, this product has been a great help to relieve the uncomfortable sensation of dry, &amp;#34;stretched&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the wrong product in the same line, but this does a nice moisture treatment on hands, especially when used overnight.</li>
            <li>This was like a miracle cream, I had several dry spots and this made my skin like new</li>
            <li>It has several natural oils, antioxidants, MSN, amino acids and vitamins in it, plus other natural ingredients as well as a skin protectant..</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to those with dry skin and those who need to wash hands frequently.</li>
            <li>have dry sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>Wish it were accessible in my town and a little less pricey, though.</li>

            <li> Fast repair</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> my hands not hurt as much from cuts &amp;breaks during Winter.</li>
            <li> , it is really helping my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Now the whole family uses it to protect ourselves from the ravages of this horrid winter.</li>
            <li> Helped with my leg problems but not as much as I had thought it would be through a friend of ours who praised about it.</li>
            <li> We really tried every moisturizer on the market and even some herbal remedies and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> I could see results the very next day and within a week, his skin was baby smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This works very well at keeping my hands from drying and cracking.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on other very dry areas and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t more extraordinary than your ordinary drugstore lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited not to be rubbing my arms constantly.</li>
            <li> I wash them a lot and they dry out and crack easily</li>
            <li> It is the best everyday cream to protect your skin, especially skin that tends to be extremely dry, cracked, and weather beaten.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and long lasting results accompanied by nice fragrance that is unisex.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to soak into the skin, but is wonderful for healing super dry, cracked skin, especially with regular use.</li>
            <li> Her skin became very smooth, less itchy.</li>
            <li> I used it in a hospital for the first time 3 years ago and found that it is not greasy, makes my skin soft, and rubs in without having to wipe off any.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> Works like hospital said it would during radiation and has repaired my mothers older skin.</li>
            <li> It is my main product now besides coconut oil.</li>
            <li> This  product was used in the hospital on an older person&#x27;s skin and it helped heal and soften her skin.</li>
            <li> Rich and nongreasy; lasts a long time without reapplying.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> THE SKIN&#x27;,I WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing to say the least.</li>
            <li> Really help clear up rash my grandbaby had.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This cream works well for me -- non-sticky, stays for a long time and the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li> I lost all my hair and my head is nice and reflective if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Love this stiff.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use on my vacation with new lotion applicator.  </li>
            <li> not greasy and does work in super dry climates with cracked hands &amp; feet</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, says it helps him tremendously with the dry skin on his legs and feet.</li>
            <li> if they could tone down the smell it would be fine.</li>
            <li> My husband is very masculine and doesn&#x27;t like girly products</li>
            <li> There is a definite fragrance when it is first applied.</li>
            <li> It also had itchy red spots and hot spots.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this from my sister in law who works at a medical supply store, who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> All the ladies I know, including my wife&#x27;s friends highly recommend this cream for young and old.  </li>
            <li> It works a little better than regular hand creams in addressing this problem.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old HATES having lotion put on his face</li>
            <li> When my mom, a nurse, was in the last stages of ALS she was very worried about getting bedsores.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR SCARS AND SKIN SOFT.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a healthcare professional.</li>
            <li> Soft but not greasey.  </li>
            <li> old people she was working with were raving about it&lt;</li>
            <li> Cures my sensitive skin isssues.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d recommend not ordering any books anywhere near when you order the lotion, because they might send the lotion with a paperback book and hurt both products in the shipping process.</li>
            <li> Soothing, soft, and</li>
            <li> It was a mess to clean and was basically unusable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on dry skin, foot calluses, and all kinds of skin problems and it works really well!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small and easy to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother first used this in Rehab for her dry, flaky skin and saw the difference it made!</li>
            <li> We will certainly keep using it for o long time to come.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my dry, sensitive hide.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my pharmacist for minor skin irritations and works very well.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy the large size later.</li>
            <li> It proves that it contains natural oil with little preservatives, or else it would not have gone rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not become gummy on  the  skin and really helps to heal dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does help with dry hands and mine</li>
            <li> It really works on dry, chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> Really works to relieve my dry cracked hands!</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps my husband&#x27;s hands when they are very dry....</li>
            <li> My aunt was visited by a nurse who introduced her to this product to protect her 90 year old fragile skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has aggressive squamous cell cancer of the head and neck and is at the end of a 6 week course of radiation directed directly on the left side of his face and ear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a breast cancer survivor, due to the radition my breast would itch so much for a year.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Having my hands constantly in water plus the fact that I have dry skin, this product has been a great help to relieve the uncomfortable sensation of dry, &amp;#34;stretched&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong product in the same line, but this does a nice moisture treatment on hands, especially when used overnight.</li>
            <li> This was like a miracle cream, I had several dry spots and this made my skin like new</li>
            <li> It has several natural oils, antioxidants, MSN, amino acids and vitamins in it, plus other natural ingredients as well as a skin protectant..</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to those with dry skin and those who need to wash hands frequently.</li>
            <li> have dry sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> Wish it were accessible in my town and a little less pricey, though.</li>
            <li> It far surpasses any other product i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> A year ago, when I was in a rehab facility for several months, this cream was used on my very sore &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; and to treat a small bedsore.</li>
            <li> It has kept the skin intact and healthier on my mother&#x27;s legs which is the key goal to prevention of open wounds due to poor circulation better than any other topical creams or ointments we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it next winter when dry skin is a constant issue!</li>
            <li> I need something heavier and long lasting.</li>
            <li> AND THE DEAD SKIN IS SLOUGHING, CAUSING THE NEW SKIN TO COME THROUGH.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it myself several times afterward because it was so soothing for dry, flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Constant washing and sanitizing my hands leaving them dry and some times cracked.</li>
            <li> This is used in several nursing homes to address dry skin and bruising.  </li>
            <li> We all use it now, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Finally found a hand cream that works in the dry air of Colorado!</li>
            <li> My mother is in her 80&#x27;s and has very thin skin which means she bruises or her skin tears easily.</li>
            <li> Any minor but bothersome skin hardness, dryness, cracking, roughness, etc.</li>
            <li> arrived when expected and being used regularly for hubby&#x27;s itchy skin--it provides relief.  </li>
            <li> It will create some burning, but it actually helps to heal my skin  unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Any other lotion feels greasy or makes my hands irritated and red from the dyes and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this cream to people with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> as a reptile I have always had  dry scale skin&lt;</li>
            <li> I still use it today for dry and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It helps relieve dry skin all over the body as well as hands and works well on dry feet and cracked heels too.</li>
            <li> Nothing fixes my cracked and dry winter hands like this product.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD DIABETES FOR OVER 18 YEARS NOW AND HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH DRY SKIN AND DISCOLORATION.  </li>
            <li> THE DRY SKIN IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM</li>
            <li> My husband has dry skin that cracks</li>
            <li> I an in the sun and even though I use sun block my skin still gets dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> When my husband was in the Hospital this was the lotion they used for his feet that were dry and cracking.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law had some in her room there when her skin was dry.  </li>
            <li> I had a dry patch on my elbow that I have had forever</li>
            <li> I am ordering more and trying my ugly feet next.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone with dry hand problems.  </li>
            <li> This cream is helping several people with thin, mottled skin, and it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon and my husband is using it for his dry rough elbows.</li>
            <li> I have tried close to 15 different lotions in the past, and this is the only one that works!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, not greasy and repairs chapped, red skin in minutes.  </li>
            <li> His skin looked like an alligator with big flakes of dead dry skin all over his cheeks, ear and neck.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and has a minimal scent.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and worth the try.</li>
            <li> I WAS IN A REHAB CENTER</li>
            <li> We shall see within the next few weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> I have red round places on my skin that is a side effect from Chemo for cancer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble sending back.</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry and dark.  </li>
            <li> When a person is sick and not able to keep scrubbed, this is a nice, soothing cream.</li>
            <li> I do believe that using it constantly prevented a lot of cracking and splitting this past winter.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure that it was for sale to the public.</li>
            <li> I still had a small amount left in the tube</li>
            <li> Smell if any is very minimal.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Smear some on your bottom and slide down the hallway.  </li>
            <li> I hope that I can buy it in other parts of the world!</li>
            <li> I have serious medical problems below knees.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lot less money.</li>
            <li> We used it on the irritating/breaking down areas and they cleared up in a few days.  </li>
            <li> ,MY SKIN HAD BROKEN  DOWN SEVERELY,AFTER TWO MONTHS OF DAILY</li>
            <li> It seems to be working a little however it will take time.</li>
            <li> And the smell is heavily.</li>
            <li> and she gave a small tube of it.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of it somewhere and was never able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Had it in past and like it.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased some on a recent trip but was unable to find it in my area.  </li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> I have DVTs and bad circulations has made it hard for the skin on the leg to heal itself completely.</li>
            <li> Especially in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> so I can use it all over and not have to use small amounts to save it!</li>
            <li> My area had a worse than usual winter</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot in the cold months, so they get dry and cracked and split.  </li>
            <li> , his cheeks get extremely chapped from the cold winter weather</li>
            <li> It was so dry it began to crack and bleed and was painful.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Non irritating even on eyes.  </li>
            <li> Made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li> It was very bad and tried several treatments until we found this.  </li>
            <li> We are obsessed with this cream.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but it works well.</li>
            <li> Just what my tired and crack feet needed!</li>
            <li> Help heal my hands during this cold winter.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy about not having access to this cream any longer until I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the TSA confiscated a tube I had in my purse while returning from Mexico!  </li>
            <li> I think it has helped my skin cracks to not be as bad.</li>
            <li> Try it - you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> How stupid is that?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in geriatrics and would hate to be without this product.</li>
            <li> are the worst.</li>

            <li> Best stuff on the market for an overall body lotion for dry skin. Particularly good on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for me.  I used it in a hospital for the first time 3 years ago and found that it is not greasy, makes my skin soft, and rubs in without having to wipe off any.  I buy several for home, in my purse and in my car.</li>

            <li> This is the best &#x27;hand cream&#x27; I have ever tried.  It is the only product that has healed my fingertips when they split.  I do believe that using it constantly prevented a lot of cracking and splitting this past winter.  I have also used it on other very dry areas and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It has kept the skin intact and healthier on my mother&#x27;s legs which is the key goal to prevention of open wounds due to poor circulation better than any other topical creams or ointments we&#x27;ve tried. Thanks to our Home Health Care staff for introducing this wonderful cream to us. It has a very pleasant fragrance, is very creamy and smooth and absorbs quickly with no greasy or sticky residue. I just purchased the 32 oz. pump size, we don&#x27;t want it to run out!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this skin repair cream. Begin a diabetic I have to check my sugar several times a day. My hands were getting very sore. While in a rehab facility for a fractured femur they nurse gave me a tube and I noticed a difference within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion. I use it mainly for my diabetic skin.</li>
            <li> This is great cream, not greasy and the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> Great product. I am an RN and first saw this product in a Surgical Supply store and fell in love with it. Now all the hospitals and nursing homes use it as it is incredibly effective, fast acting and very soothing without leaving your skin feeling greasy. I buy it in the large pump bottles for the house and this size for my office and purse. I have never found a better product for dry skin, heels, elbows, etc. I buy if for family members as stocking stuffers. Has a mild citrus smell and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin repair cream.  Does not become gummy on  the  skin and really helps to heal dry and cracked skin.  Would recommend this cream to people with dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Worked better than anything else has for my wife&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is great, had radiation treatment on my neck and this helped from getting burns.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has improved my itchy arms in two days! I&#x27;m so excited not to be rubbing my arms constantly. I&#x27;m going to have some on hand always. The fragrance is an additional bonus♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li> best lotion in the world!! not greasy and does work in super dry climates with cracked hands &amp; feet</li>

            <li> This hand cream is awesome.  It healed my dry, cracked skin and smells great!</li>
            <li> Discovered this when they used it in the hospital. Very thick and creamy. When a person is sick and not able to keep scrubbed, this is a nice, soothing cream. I ordered it myself several times afterward because it was so soothing for dry, flakey skin. There is a definite fragrance when it is first applied. This might be off putting for some people. It is a bit expensive compared to the many good skin creams out there.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> My sister in law was given this lotion during a recent hospital stay, and I loved it so much I had to buy some! It is very moisturizing, but not greasy at all. I use it on my hands, I keep a tube at home and a tube in my purse. My 3 year old HATES having lotion put on his face, his cheeks get extremely chapped from the cold winter weather and it&#x27;s a battle to get anything on his face...but he lets me apply this with no problem, he said he likes it. And that&#x27;s worth any price to this mom!</li>
            <li> We are obsessed with this cream.  Especially in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it, says it helps him tremendously with the dry skin on his legs and feet.</li>
            <li> As a registered nurse working in home care, I love the products of this company!  This is one of their products I&#x27;ve had to use on patients the most for chapped skin, extremely dry areas, and reddened areas. Medline you are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I work in a hospital. Constant washing and sanitizing my hands leaving them dry and some times cracked. I use this before bed and I also have one in my purse. I love this stuff. It does not leave your hands greasy at all</li>
            <li> a great hand cream when you have really dry skin that cracks and burns.  Very soothing and repairs the skin</li>
            <li> Got bumps all over my leg!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It lasts a long time and gives your skin a smooth healthy sheen. It is not sticky and absorbs very well.  The fragrance is pleasing and not too strong.</li>
            <li> This skin care product is amazing. I use the whole line and it just repairs everything. I&#x27;m in geriatrics and would hate to be without this product. AMAZON has just been amazing in service and delivery,  thank you Amazon.</li>

            <li> This cream is very good on dried out skin. It is expensive but it works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I use the product in its hospital version to help to repair the skin&#x27;s dryness after using Purell all day. It is not oily and has a minimal scent. I found in sharing the product, however, that not all women find the scent appealing.</li>
            <li> The best lotion for winter months. Very moisturizing and nourishing.... and it smells delightful.</li>
            <li> Works like hospital said it would during radiation and has repaired my mothers older skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on dry skin, foot calluses, and all kinds of skin problems and it works really well!  Absorbs nicely with nice fragrance.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought the wrong product in the same line, but this does a nice moisture treatment on hands, especially when used overnight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I have eczema flare ups on my hands. Thought this might help. It did ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Really like this cream, works great on rough hands.</li>
            <li> When my wife became bedridden with stomach cancer, the hospital recommended this product to ward off bedsores. It worked awesome. I still use it today for dry and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> We were given a sample of this during a hospital stay. It is wonderful. My husband had radiation and his skin healed great using this. All the clinic nurses were impressed and plan to use it too. It soaks in, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and has to be felt to be believed. Won&#x27;t ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this cream for several years and found it most effective in soothing and providing skin healing. Used on arm with damaged skin from too much hospital pokes and tapes. (Turned my forearm into alligator skin.) Also rough elbows love the moisturizing and healing of this cream. Any minor but bothersome skin hardness, dryness, cracking, roughness, etc. will all benefit from this cream. Not too expensive and worth the try.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and it really helps with my eczema.  It will create some burning, but it actually helps to heal my skin  unlike any other lotion I&#x27;ve tried.  I won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Used this for first time when sent home from hospital after surgery. Ordered 3 more from Amazon because I really like how it heals chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I was given this product by a nurse while my husband was in the hospital.  It works great on cracked skin, which my hands are prone to in the winter.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> perfect, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic! It really helps reduce the itching from winter/dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  When my mom, a nurse, was in the last stages of ALS she was very worried about getting bedsores.  I found this stuff by accident at a medical equipment supply and the salesperson said people were having a lot of luck with it treating and preventing bedsores.  It worked great.  We used it on the irritating/breaking down areas and they cleared up in a few days.  She never had a bedsore with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it now for my hands, especially during the winter.  I wash them a lot and they dry out and crack easily but this stuff fixes that in a hurry!  In addition to being a great moisturizer, it has a silicone skin protectant that helps minimize the drying from frequent washing.  I highly recommend this stuff to everyone!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT BUY FOR THE PRICE AND EVEN BETTER FOR YOUR SKIN. IT MAKES YOUR SCARS AND SKIN SOFT.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution for skincare that actually works on dry skin without grease. It dries in minutes, has a pleasant aroma that smells clean, and soothes as it nourishes damaged skin. It truly is a REPAIR cream.</li>
            <li> I found this product when my mom was in the hospital. It is amazing to say the least. The results show improved moisture and softness even the next day. Not greasy and long lasting results accompanied by nice fragrance that is unisex.  I was not sure that it was for sale to the public. I found it on Amazon and my husband is using it for his dry rough elbows. I use it as a body lotion and have started to use it as a night cream on my face. Love product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this skin cream for a few years, now, and it is truly the best product I have ever used on my skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite sometime. It is the best everyday cream to protect your skin, especially skin that tends to be extremely dry, cracked, and weather beaten.</li>
            <li> Very effective for my mother&#x27;s needs. She uses it to help her skin heal and she is very comfortable applying the cream herself. Smells nice, too!</li>
            <li> As an RN, we had a lot of problems with our hands drying out from a lot of hand washing daily at work.&lt;br /&gt;We used this with many of our patients and most all loved it. I really liked it too; it smells great and is quickly absorbed, non-greasy and a little goes a long way.. It helps relieve dry skin all over the body as well as hands and works well on dry feet and cracked heels too. Patient&#x27;s have used this on their faces, and I have used on my own face and it is great for moisturizing; as good if not better than many high dollar department store moisturizers. It has several natural oils, antioxidants, MSN, amino acids and vitamins in it, plus other natural ingredients as well as a skin protectant..&lt;br /&gt;When I retired, I was unhappy about not having access to this cream any longer until I found it on Amazon. I quickly bought more, and am now a happy camper!</li>
            <li> Hospital used this on my mother. Gave it a try and absolutely love it. Works great on my chapped hands and leaves a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Rich and nongreasy; lasts a long time without reapplying.</li>
            <li> My mother is in her 80&#x27;s and has very thin skin which means she bruises or her skin tears easily. Her wound care specialist recommended this cream and she loves what it does for her skin and the pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great on face and hands. Not greasy. Absorbs quickly. Non irritating even on eyes.  Bought it for my son who scrubs multiple times in a day.</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful product! It smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stiff. My skin feels so soft. I went to see my mom in the hospital and she gave a small tube of it. I had to buy some.</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used!!!!!</li>
            <li> its a great product for my diabetic skin for my feet to with the cracking on toes and ruff heales</li>
            <li> This product is great. I first saw it when my Mom was in the hospital. It works very well. It is light and non greasy feeling but really nourishes skin. It improves texture and softness</li>
            <li> I had bought the large bottle of this lotion. I love it so much I bought the smaller tubes to take with me in my purse so I&#x27;ll have it whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to everyone.  It far surpasses any other product i&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s a lot less money.</li>
            <li> First tried this stuff in hospital.  Great stuff.  Makes me silky smooth.  Smear some on your bottom and slide down the hallway.  It&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> This is used in several nursing homes to address dry skin and bruising.  I&#x27;ve used it to help address the bruises I get easily on my hands/arms.  Rubbing this in several times a day helps these bruises to dissipate sooner.  It works a little better than regular hand creams in addressing this problem.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome&lt;br /&gt; I was so happy 2 find  it on Amazon.  It smells great and leaves hands and arms feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Fast and just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product during my radiation treatments. It was used by the staff for side effects.&lt;br /&gt;It is now part of my daily facial routine prior to makeup.  What result!&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived early and I am most happy with ordering and shipping process.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this cream.  My hands were very dry and dark.  They looked great after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> My hands have never looked better! I have eczema and haven&#x27;t had to use my steroid cream since I started using this lotion over a month ago. It&#x27;s not greasy and it has a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> Everything from ordering to delivering and then to applying this Skin Repair Cream was EXCELLENT!  I recommend it and MEDLINE products.</li>
            <li> I have tried products that cost twice as much without this kind of wonderful result. The dryness disappeared with the first application. I will be keeping this creme on hand!</li>
            <li> I am a healthcare professional. I wash my hands frequently and as the winter approaches in the NE, my hands have started to get incredibly dry/cracked/bleed. This cream is amazing. I have tried close to 15 different lotions in the past, and this is the only one that works! And it doesn&#x27;t not burn when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find a lotion that does what it&#x27;s supposed to. This one seems better than the others (aveno, lubriderm, etc) but in the end doesn&#x27;t have a terribly big impact on lasting moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing fixes my cracked and dry winter hands like this product.  I had tried several different creams and lotions, but my finger tips wouldn&#x27;t heal.  After I tried the Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream, my hands were healed within a week.  I won&#x27;t use anything else now.  Just ordered two more tubes.</li>
            <li> The review says it all. Great stuff. It does an amazing job - a family member was bedridden for an extended time in the hospital, and this kept her skin in very good condition. We all use it now, especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I first used this on my husband while he was in hospital to help keep him from getting bed sores.  The fragrance is nice and the texture is so wonderful.  Soft but not greasey.  My husband is very masculine and doesn&#x27;t like girly products and he said it felt good.It is NOT greasy at all, just moisturizes..love this product I have purchased 3 more tubes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion! I got a sample of it somewhere and was never able to find it in stores. Luckily I found it here, and ordered a ton of it. Now I&#x27;ve got my friends and family members using it too! It&#x27;s not too thick or too thin, feels great on, smells pleasant, and most importantly makes my skin feel great and my cuticles look great! I work with paper employee files and my cuticles stayed torn up until I started using this.</li>
            <li> It does what they say</li>
            <li> A good product which transforms the essence o the nature to daily life.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market and I love the size - use it for travel, by the kitchen sink, or put an extra tube in the car.  I love it</li>
            <li> Works great on babies and my old skin makes it soft and helps with the wrinkles on my arms.</li>
            <li> It does repair skin, especially hands.  I&#x27;m most satisfied with it.  Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream.  This is the best hand cream that I have ever tried.  Not greasy and leaves hands smooth.</li>
            <li> AWESOME Cream...very healing! Can&#x27;t find locally. It&#x27;s the best as skin care cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Fast repair</li>
            <li> All the ladies I know, including my wife&#x27;s friends highly recommend this cream for young and old.  Chuck</li>
            <li> Does fine but has too much of a perfume smell to it for me.  Smell lingers a while also...other than that it seems ok but I have allergies and it bothers me a bit....if they could tone down the smell it would be fine.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best lotion my husband and I have used for dry, irritated skin on any part if the body.  We will certainly keep using it for o long time to come.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use on my vacation with new lotion applicator.  Love it.  Placing another order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, smells very nice and makes my hand and feet very soft. I would recommend this line and especially this cream.</li>
            <li> I WAS IN A REHAB CENTER A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK AND THIS WAS THE LOTION THE AIDES USED ON MY BODY,MY SKIN HAD BROKEN  DOWN SEVERELY,AFTER TWO MONTHS OF DAILY USE MY SKIN WAS BACK IN ORDER.WHEN I CAME HOME I CONTINUED TO USE IT UP UNTIL THE PRESENT.TO ME IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE PRODUCT AND DOES JUST AS IT STATES,,&#x27;IT REPAIRS THE SKIN&#x27;,I WOULD RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my arms and this is the best lotion in the world and the only one I can find that works for me!</li>
            <li> Good lotion but not as good as I expected after reading reviews.  Does well if you use it several times a day but once or twice is not enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a breast cancer survivor, due to the radition my breast would itch so much for a year. My doctor suggested that I buy this product. I used it for a week and loved  loved it. I&#x27;m yet to experience anymore itching. I&#x27;ve even given it to my gyn doctor for his daughter that&#x27;s an radiation oncologist to refer to her patients. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD DIABETES FOR OVER 18 YEARS NOW AND HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH DRY SKIN AND DISCOLORATION.  SINCE USING THIS PRODUCT THE DRY SKIN IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THE DEAD SKIN IS SLOUGHING, CAUSING THE NEW SKIN TO COME THROUGH.  AMAZING PRODUCT WITH AMAZING RESULTS, YOU MUST BE COMMITTED TO USING THIS PRODUCT AND MAINTAIN A STRICT SCHEDULE OF USING IT DAILY.  GOOD LUCK AND I&#x27;M SURE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU.  PRODUCT WAS FIRST USED FOR MY WOUND CARE WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  My husband has dry skin that cracks and he uses this product all the time.  It was recommended by a Doctor to heal skin irritated by radiation treatment.  NE Husker Fan.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It is the only one I use.  I an in the sun and even though I use sun block my skin still gets dry.  This cream solves the problem.  Ni will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> While working in a hospital,I discovered this product,very very good for dry skin a great product, The best ever.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing cream for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my daughter told me about this. old people she was working with were raving about it&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job minimizing the wrinkles in my hands. We shall see within the next few weeks&lt;br /&gt;if it continues to do its job some more.</li>
            <li> A very good handcream which was given to me during a stay in hospital in the USA.  Pleasant perfume and good results. I hope that I can buy it in other parts of the world!</li>
            <li> 93-year-old mother informs me it removed the wrinkles on her butt.  When I recovered from the shock that she felt this was important, I decided it was good enough for me so have begun using it.  Will update/revise as needed after appropriate time.</li>
            <li> This cream works well for me -- non-sticky, stays for a long time and the scent is not bad. I am told by doctor friends that olive oil is good for your skin; it has an enzyme that repairs skin. From the manufacturer&#x27;s name (Medline) and blurb, it seems to target doctors who have to wash their hands a lot, and wear latex gloves a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is my tube of this cream went rancid after about a year. I guess I should have used more, more frequently. It proves that it contains natural oil with little preservatives, or else it would not have gone rancid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and at $12.00 for 8 oz, it&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li> My elderly mother first used this in Rehab for her dry, flaky skin and saw the difference it made! Her skin became very smooth, less itchy. Just recently purchased the 32oz pump size, which is a great price for this product. A truly superb cream that works!</li>
            <li> Started using this product after it was used during my mother-in-laws illness.  It is one of the best creams I have found for my clapped and dry hands and elbows.  It is my main product now besides coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Was introduced to this product in the hospital. Like a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> Never did get  remedy with nutrashield.  Had it in past and like it.  Got my refund.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate. This is the best quality lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used this on patients in the hospital and loved it. I found it on amazon and ordered some for home. It keeps my skin soft, moisturized and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Wish this came in larger sizes!  Moisturizes sensitive skin very well and has a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> A good remedy for very dry skin.  Works well</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, ordered for gifts, best lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li> It is a good product. We received a tube when in the hospital  and ordered from Amazon</li>
            <li> Works great. Relieves itching and burning in legs.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Light mild scent, light feel, non greasy. Feels good. Works well to soften and smooth.  It&#x27;s used by the HMO I go to also.  I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Execllent product! Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> seems to be a nice hand cream.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! What a difference it makes on my feet!</li>
            <li> This lotion really helps my husband&#x27;s hands when they are very dry....if you know what I mean. Also it helps my grandson with his eczema.</li>
            <li> Used it in a healthcare setting and saw how effective it is, and I love using it myself. Superior to any other lotions, by far.</li>
            <li> A great cream designed to combat the rough winter weather!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion i have found!!&lt;br /&gt;I was getting eczema on my thumbs and after i used this for 1 week,it disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;makes my hands not hurt as much from cuts &amp;breaks during Winter.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! What can I say but praise for this product? Nothing. I can give no con&#x27;s to this product only pro&#x27;s. I have red round places on my skin that is a side effect from Chemo for cancer. The doc gave me a prescription for Psoriasis. It did not work. I would wake up at night and all my skin all over my body would be hot and itchy. Like my skin was on fire. This lotion puts out the fire. My skin feels smooth and cool. Like a babies skin. I lost all my hair and my head is nice and reflective if you know what I mean. It also had itchy red spots and hot spots. This stuff that smells like a creamsicle is a dream-sicle and an answer to prayer. The nurses at Roswell cancer hospital give this to me for free. They say all there patients love it and that when I run out just let them know. They said I could not purchase it anywhere and it seems as if the docs don&#x27;t know about it. I think they buy it for there patients out of their own pocket.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand moisturizer/lotion/cream I have tried. Having my hands constantly in water plus the fact that I have dry skin, this product has been a great help to relieve the uncomfortable sensation of dry, &amp;#34;stretched&amp;#34; skin. I have used it for about a year. It goes on well, is easily absorbed and leaves the skin feeling silky. It&#x27;s also small and easy to carry in your purse. Wish it were accessible in my town and a little less pricey, though. I would recommend it to those with dry skin and those who need to wash hands frequently. It is especially good for aging skin.</li>
            <li> perfect, fast shipping, exactly as described</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream.  Used it during radiation treatments and then continued as daily cream. Soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cream, not that great and don&#x27;t feel it worked any better than any other cream on the market.</li>
            <li> My wife ia happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great service.  wonderful product!</li>
            <li> arrived when expected and being used regularly for hubby&#x27;s itchy skin--it provides relief.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This  product was used in the hospital on an older person&#x27;s skin and it helped heal and soften her skin. I tried to find it locally but no one carried it so I ordered it from amazon. It arrived promptly. It&#x27;s an excellent product with a faint, pleasant scent but lasts much longer on the skin than other products. Especially useful for older people and to combat winter weather. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, not too thick and not too watery like most lotions. Non-greasy, absorbs quickly.  Nice light subtle smell, not overly perfumed. Packed with great stuff, olive oil, vitamin E &amp; A, aloe is the first ingredient. Great for chapped medical hands or protecting cracked skin. I keep one at work, by the kitchen sink and in the bathroom. I use it all over my dry winter skin. Grade A stuff.</li>
            <li> This repair cream is AWESOME!  It absorbs quickly, not greasy and repairs chapped, red skin in minutes.  This is also good for helping new scars heal and retain moisture.</li>
            <li> Was introduced to this at the nursing home my wife was recovering in...good medicine</li>
            <li> using this on the legs. works well</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and am totally happy with it. I didn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;skin issues&amp;#34; when I heard of it, and with it I don&#x27;t expect to get any!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hand lotion. It really does help with dry hands and mine are the worst. I use it all the time--that&#x27;s my best suggestion is to rub it on your hands after washing several times a day. I think it has helped my skin cracks to not be as bad. And that is a very good thing! Great smell, too!</li>
            <li> Love using this for my dry skin. will recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used for dry skin.  Doctor recommeded.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I received this order very quickly.  Thank you.  Great stuff too, it is really helping my cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Really smells nice and works well also, my daughter has tried a lot of products and likes this one over all.</li>
            <li> use it for a face primer.  Nice and thick and a lot of good skin protectants.</li>
            <li> exactly as described!</li>
            <li> even better than their barrier cream.</li>
            <li> Works well for people with mobility issues causing skin to be compromised.</li>
            <li> Use this product for helping to heal cuts and keep scars pliable.  Works great as always.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my dry, sensitive hide.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working a little however it will take time. I have only been using it for about&lt;br /&gt;one month.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my pharmacist for minor skin irritations and works very well.</li>
            <li> An excellent skin repair cream.</li>
            <li> I first used product while a patient in hospital.  It really works on dry, chapped hands.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  Works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I had purchased some on a recent trip but was unable to find it in my area.  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion but the packaging was terrible. The one tube was cut open and then wrapped in cellophane. It was a mess to clean and was basically unusable. Not worth the trouble sending back.</li>
            <li> Made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this cream after a breast operation. I already had it because I had ordered it for my husband. The skin on his fingers cracks during the winter. It is a wonderful product which I am still using for a hand cream.</li>
            <li> The best lotion/cream I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> excellent for dry skin -- notice the difference overnight!!</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Broke out in terrible rash . Lotion is creamy and smells good , but can&#x27;t use it .</li>
            <li> LOVE the 32 oz for home use, but this is THE BEST for on the go.  Now I&#x27;m never without the best cream around</li>
            <li> nice cream plus it smells nice</li>
            <li> All of this Companies line of Skin Care Products are great.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from exema this is one of the best products out there.  It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the large pump container of this cream. I love it and ordered the tubes to keep in kitchen and work bag.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is a nurse gave me this for my dry hands,  Works perfectly.  Glad I could find it.</li>
            <li> Got a full size tube from a nurse while in hospital recently and love it. Smells great, not greasy. Best deal I could find on net. thanks</li>
            <li> Sadly, the TSA confiscated a tube I had in my purse while returning from Mexico!  How stupid is that?  But it is a great cream for the body and hands.  I first came upon it at a hospital, and fortunately found it at Amazon!  What a great and helpful retailer Amazon is!</li>
            <li> A,Macon only place I found this excellent product. Just had surgery on my nose and this is helping with healing!</li>
            <li> This was like a miracle cream, I had several dry spots and this made my skin like new</li>
            <li> My aunt was visited by a nurse who introduced her to this product to protect her 90 year old fragile skin. Now the whole family uses it to protect ourselves from the ravages of this horrid winter. It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever picked up in a store. It works!</li>
            <li> Simply put, Remedy is the best lotion for dry and cracked skin I have ever used.  No lotion works as good or better.</li>
            <li> My mother used this cream in both the hospital and skilled nursing.  It is very healing to tender skin - absorbs well - has a light, pleasant scent.  We ordered more as soon as she got home.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it next winter when dry skin is a constant issue!</li>
            <li> When I was hospitalized after a surgery, they provided this for me for skin care use. My area had a worse than usual winter and I couldn&#x27;t keep my skin from flaking. I used this lotion. It takes very little to go a long way. It&#x27;s not scented so can use with my perfume without issues.</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product. Cures my sensitive skin isssues. Gave some to my dad who had some skin tears, and it helped them heal quickly.</li>
            <li> The radiation burns you go through after a lumpectomy. This cream is a lifesaver for your skin. I wish I had know about it sooner.</li>
            <li> I got the first tube of this at a local hospital during a stay there..and found it to be healing, non-greasy and a great product. Will continue to purchase and share with others.  Great, simple gift to give and always appreciated.</li>
            <li> This cream is used in healthcare facilities in Florida. It was recommended to me by a caregiver. It is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Really works to relieve my dry cracked hands!</li>
            <li> Product exceeded my expectations and areas applied to began healing quickly.</li>
            <li> Helped with my leg problems but not as much as I had thought it would be through a friend of ours who praised about it.</li>
            <li> One of my coworkers brought a tube of this to the office to place in our ladies&#x27; room after raving about how great it was.  Her husband had gotten it during a stay in the hospital.  Now we take turns buying it to make sure we don&#x27;t run out!  With the two pack I was able to keep one tube for myself at home.  I love the smell of it and it makes a great little gift also.</li>
            <li> Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream is the best repair cream I have ever used. I have Crohn&#x27;s disease along with a chronic hemorrhoid condition. A year ago, when I was in a rehab facility for several months, this cream was used on my very sore &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; and to treat a small bedsore. It gave me great relief and I knew that I wanted to continue to use it at home. It is so soothing and does heal the area where I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> I first used Remedy at my mom&#x27;s recommendation because she is a nurse and she used it on her patients. It does take a few minutes to soak into the skin, but is wonderful for healing super dry, cracked skin, especially with regular use.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin with eczema.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry sensitive skin and eczema. I am always in search of a cream that will make my hands and feet look presentable without being too sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 2 weeks. It has helped a lot with dryness and peeling of the skin. Smell if any is very minimal. It takes couple mins to absorb. Afterwards it is not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it will help erase wrinkles, it would help not creating more wrinkles by keeping skin supple.</li>
            <li> Nurse in my oncologists offered this to me against chemo caused peeling rash on hands and it soothes and improves best with white cotton gloves.  It dries to a silk then softens.  Not greasy, pleasant aroma of mild tangerine.  Helps.</li>
            <li> Since my bypass surgery in 2010 I have been looking for something to use on my leg that the veins were taken from. I have DVTs and bad circulations has made it hard for the skin on the leg to heal itself completely. I am allergic to most cremes and lotions. My wife, a nurse suggested this repair cream.It is amazing. My leg has not looked this good in years and the sores are beginning to heal up. I will continue using this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great skin repair cream</li>
            <li> Excellent for diabetic feet</li>
            <li> This is so great as it feels light on the skin and it works quickly to aleeve the dry skin discomfort.</li>
            <li> Has healing properties that are evidenced-based.</li>
            <li> Just what my tired and crack feet needed!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t more extraordinary than your ordinary drugstore lotion. I need something heavier and long lasting.</li>
            <li> best hand cream *I have ever used</li>
            <li> Used this cream in hospital. Love it. Has great smell and is not greasy even tho&#x27; a somewhat heavier cream.</li>
            <li> Works great in moistening the skin and alleviating itching!</li>
            <li> When my husband was in the Hospital this was the lotion they used for his feet that were dry and cracking. I still had a small amount left in the tube so I looked it up on Amazon and they carried this brand. Works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it arrived with a book I ordered and exploded and hurt the book. So I&#x27;d recommend not ordering any books anywhere near when you order the lotion, because they might send the lotion with a paperback book and hurt both products in the shipping process.</li>
            <li> works good on skin with no unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Was first given to me at a hospital stay. Softens and repairs skin, dries quick, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great product works very well.</li>
            <li> used it in hospital first and it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> I first used this product while in the hospital and it healed my skin after it cracked from adhesive tape. Wonderful scent and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product when I had my knee replaced. I have not been able to find this product in a store so I was glad to find it on line. It is very soothing as well as does a good job softening injured tissue.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell and works great leaving skin well protected;  would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The way I found this lovely cream was through the Masonic Village at Elizabethtown.  My mother-in-law had some in her room there when her skin was dry.  I asked her for some had lotion, and this is what she gave me.  Unfortunately, she passed away before I was able to ask her what it was.  But I found it on Amazon and love it so much that I tell everyone about it.  I sent some to my Mom, too.  Soothing, soft, and the wonderful citrus-olive oil smell is great.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product at a rehab center and was impressed with its effectiveness.  Thus, I am continuing to use it now at home.</li>
            <li> Everything I read about how great this stuff is - is TRUE!  Best hand cream I&#x27;ve found anywhere.</li>
            <li> None of it&#x27;s miraculous claims came true. Has an odor that lasts for hours. I can&#x27;t identify it but it is like citrus. If I actually use it up, I won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> My husband has aggressive squamous cell cancer of the head and neck and is at the end of a 6 week course of radiation directed directly on the left side of his face and ear. His skin looked like an alligator with big flakes of dead dry skin all over his cheeks, ear and neck. We really tried every moisturizer on the market and even some herbal remedies and nothing helped. It was so dry it began to crack and bleed and was painful. A nurse at the clinic gave us a tube of this lotion to try and it was like a miracle. I could see results the very next day and within a week, his skin was baby smooth and shiny. I had a dry patch on my elbow that I have had forever and my lotions made it better, but never made it go away. One week later and it is gone and I don&#x27;t even recognize my elbow. I am ordering more and trying my ugly feet next. I never recommend products because I never find anything I am completely happy with. I found it now.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lotion for dry sensitive hands or for people with ecxema (sp?) - I keep reordering this lotion when I run out. I wash my hands a lot in the cold months, so they get dry and cracked and split.  Any other lotion feels greasy or makes my hands irritated and red from the dyes and perfumes.  NOT this lotion - it makes your hands feel smooth and heals them and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  I recommend it to anyone with dry hand problems.  I first found out about this from my sister in law who works at a medical supply store, who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!! And the smell is heavily. Can&#x27;t wait to get me a bigger bottle so I can use it all over and not have to use small amounts to save it! I work in a hospital and we put this in our rooms, but all the staff has some too. We all love it. Stuff is gold!! Trying the lip balm next.</li>
            <li> Is the best of any hand creme.</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and I am in love with the smell, oh boy.</li>
            <li> great cream, I have eczema and this cream hydrates well.</li>
            <li> Finally found a hand cream that works in the dry air of Colorado! The price is right, too.</li>
            <li> This cream is helping several people with thin, mottled skin, and it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Works very well! I work in a hospital and wash my hands constantly. This works very well at keeping my hands from drying and cracking.</li>
