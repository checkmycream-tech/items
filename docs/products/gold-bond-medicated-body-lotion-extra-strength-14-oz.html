            <li>Nice after a shower.  </li>
            <li>If some is good, perhaps more is better.  </li>
            <li>Fine product that exceeded all expectations!</li>
            <li>I have used Gold Bond for many years and will continue t use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking that more (5%) dimethicone would be better.  </li>
            <li>I have a seasonal water allergy as well as chronic itching on my breasts, and I have suffered most of my life until I found this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the fragrance</li>
            <li>but it is ok,</li>
            <li>In fact, my mother loved mine so much she stole it!</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Not always available in stores</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong.</li>
            <li>This helped tremendously with itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I give this cream a five star for keeping its word and not disappointing me.</li>
            <li>Thank you Gold Bond for the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that works and works quickly.</li>
            <li>so I ,m the right path of threatment</li>
            <li>Good for people who have problems with their skin especially dry skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use Ben Gay for the same reason.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thus it is very smelly if you put it on.</li>
            <li>I find this lotion very soothing.</li>
            <li>It works very well but has a medicine smell to it.  </li>
            <li>The time standing and wearing close toed shoes were really taking a toll on his feet.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t care much if they smell like Vicks vapor rub, so I started using it on my feet at night with a pair of cotton socks.  </li>

            <li>I like it, but I can see how someone might not be able to get past it.</li>
            <li>Doctors tried many prescription lotions and salves and recommended other OTC products, and this was the first that actually relieves serious itching quickly.</li>
            <li>The peppermint smell is not that noticeable unless you are just so so sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>Decent product that does a decent job of helping with moisturizing,controls minor itch, and soothes skin.</li>
            <li>After using this for only three nights in a row you could see a major difference.</li>
            <li>At first when you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, but after a few minutes, you realize the itch is gone.  </li>
            <li>I have a stubborn strong itch at a spot behind my shoulder and I have tried several creams to soothe it and this is ghe only cream that stops the itch all day.  </li>

            <li> It definitely helps both the dry skin and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever found that truly works to treat serious itching.</li>
            <li> The smell of of the lotion doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin long, so don&#x27;t worry,</li>
            <li> I started also keeping your stronger anti-itch product on hand for extreme issues with my breasts, but this one is usually enough.</li>
            <li> But the smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I get itchy dry skin on my hands and tops of my feet.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend who has dry skin</li>
            <li> dry skin, itching.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for itchy skin no matter from insect bites or from hives or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> this won&#x27;t &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34; the rash, but it cools the skin (like aloe vera but stronger) and this provided really fast temporary relief that allowed me to get some sleep and stop itching/making my problem worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for relief from mosquito and other bug bites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion, like other Gold Bond lotions, works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Just apply a little.  </li>
            <li> But I did not anticipate the heavy smell of menthol that comes with this product.  </li>
            <li> it burn a little ,the itch is gone and the heavy crust is down to one thin layer</li>
            <li> Worked no better than scentless body lotions which I prefer.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t usually put it on before going out anywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also absorbs into the skin really well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, so you can keep applying if it works but wears off (which it does for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con - if you hate the smell of menthol, maybe buy something else.</li>
            <li> sorry for the delay...</li>
            <li> I sometimes go through a strange spell of terrible hives just appearing for no reason for months at a time.  </li>
            <li> I came into contact with something on a hike that gave me hives and itched like crazy...</li>
            <li> the itch is horrible and the scalp has layers of crust that you can peel ;arge section of scalp off,,</li>
            <li> which to me is horrible.  </li>

            <li> It lives up to the reputation of Gold Bond.  As always, would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it. It has worked well on his skin</li>
            <li> sorry for the delay...everything is great. thanks</li>

            <li> Best lotion ever I hope Gold Bond never stops making it.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. It has 5 percent menthol. Thus it is very smelly if you put it on. I don&#x27;t use Ben Gay for the same reason. Too smelly. Worked no better than scentless body lotions which I prefer.</li>
            <li> This lotion, like other Gold Bond lotions, works extremely well.  It gives instant relief which seems to last all day.  I only wish it came in bigger containers.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> I find this lotion very soothing. I have used Gold Bond for many years and will continue t use it.</li>
            <li> i have psoriasis in my head the itch is horrible and the scalp has layers of crust that you can peel ;arge section of scalp off,, I usd this it burn a little ,the itch is gone and the heavy crust is down to one thin layer so I ,m the right path of threatment</li>
            <li> It works very well but has a medicine smell to it.  But the smell doesn&#x27;t linger very long.</li>
            <li> Nice after a shower.  Just apply a little.  Keep away from private parts.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I get itchy dry skin on my hands and tops of my feet. It definitely helps both the dry skin and itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells great but don&#x27;t want to be around people when I smell like menthol so I don&#x27;t usually put it on before going out anywhere.</li>
            <li> I had been using lotion with 1.3% dimethicone.  If some is good, perhaps more is better.  I bought this product thinking that more (5%) dimethicone would be better.  But I did not anticipate the heavy smell of menthol that comes with this product.  Further the increased dimethicone did not seem to add any advantage.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve ever found that truly works to treat serious itching. I have a seasonal water allergy as well as chronic itching on my breasts, and I have suffered most of my life until I found this. Doctors tried many prescription lotions and salves and recommended other OTC products, and this was the first that actually relieves serious itching quickly. In fact, my mother loved mine so much she stole it! Thank you Gold Bond for the first product I&#x27;ve ever used that works and works quickly. I started also keeping your stronger anti-itch product on hand for extreme issues with my breasts, but this one is usually enough.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion, so soothing!</li>
            <li> Fine product that exceeded all expectations!</li>
            <li> My husband is on his feet all day, sometimes for 30hr shifts. The time standing and wearing close toed shoes were really taking a toll on his feet. After using this for only three nights in a row you could see a major difference. He loves this stuff and uses it all the time now.</li>
            <li> It was great to put on my neck when it itched It is a great idem I would recommend  it to anyone</li>
            <li> Good for people who have problems with their skin especially dry skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> which to me is horrible.  I bought it for my boyfriend who has dry skin and he didn&#x27;t like the smell and wouldn&#x27;t use it.  So, instead of trashing it I thought I&#x27;ll use it on my feet, don&#x27;t care much if they smell like Vicks vapor rub, so I started using it on my feet at night with a pair of cotton socks.  It is good lotion but I also couldn&#x27;t see using this on my body because of the scent.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not always available in stores</li>
            <li> Works well to help with winter itch. I don&#x27;t love the fragrance but it is ok, Decent product that does a decent job of helping with moisturizing,controls minor itch, and soothes skin.</li>
            <li> I always get the best results using Gold Bond - I an older and Gold Bond gives me the results I want.  tjm</li>
            <li> Do you have what I&#x27;ve got...dry skin, itching. chaffing where my thighs rub? If so give this one a shot cause it works......</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time and it&#x27;s amazing. Starts soothing itchiness within seconds of lathering.</li>
            <li> works well i would buy it again</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. Great for itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This helped tremendously with itchy skin.  It gives your skin a cooling feeling - very soothing.  I know you can buy it anywhere, but amazon is so convenient - it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; store.</li>
            <li> I sometimes go through a strange spell of terrible hives just appearing for no reason for months at a time.  Sometimes the hives are so itchy and I have tried all kinds of creams and lotions to help relieve the itching.  The gold bond medicated itch lotion does help a lot.  At first when you put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything, but after a few minutes, you realize the itch is gone.  maybe that is just me though.  This is a must have for itchy skin no matter from insect bites or from hives or dry skin.  Highly recommend this!  The peppermint smell is not that noticeable unless you are just so so sensitive to smells.  The smell of of the lotion doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin long, so don&#x27;t worry, you won&#x27;t smell that medicated, smiles.</li>
            <li> I have a stubborn strong itch at a spot behind my shoulder and I have tried several creams to soothe it and this is ghe only cream that stops the itch all day.  I have dry skin so I lather the cream all over me including under my heels to keep moisture within me and go stop anymore itch.  I wish that this cream can come in s spray form with the same or stronger dosage so that I can lap it on faster after showers and the containers dhojld be larger without jeopardising the dosages.  I give this cream a five star for keeping its word and not disappointing me.</li>
            <li> Works really good and quickly - wife loves it too-eh!!</li>
            <li> good deal on gold bond lotion</li>
