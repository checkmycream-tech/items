            <li>We bought this one from Amazon fits perfect and seller had super fast shipping.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s not fancy and it costs more than I think it should, but it does it&#x27;s job and works as advertized</li>
            <li>I lost the battery charge of my Philips electric shaver in one of mine latest business trips.</li>
            <li>Received on time and works just like my lost original one, love it!</li>
            <li>Make sure your model uses this end plug.  </li>
            <li>Once more smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li>The was a fast shipment, good quality product, and charges like the one that came with it.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>So happy we didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Lost the original on a trip.  </li>
            <li>Use this as a replacement for the original power cord.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, stays cool.</li>
            <li>and I have to force it in, but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>The charger arrived quickly and has worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>This cord works great with the Norelco 8240L which has a different plug that the older Norelco shavers.  </li>
            <li>I was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being there</li>
            <li>It works well and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this particular cord, I did some research and determined which cord was appropriate as there were many different models to choose from.  </li>
            <li>and it is either the right one or not.  </li>
            <li>My husband left his original power cord for his shaver in a hotel on a trip, after quite a long time of not using his electric shaver, I was happy to find a replacement on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it works, but i&#x27;m not overall pleased.  </li>
            <li>This power cord was exactly what I needed for my razor.  </li>
            <li>It seems that they use the strategy that your shaver won&#x27;t work without it, but still to much for it.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and get the right one.</li>
            <li>It arrived as promised, and works well with an older model Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li>He was devastated when he could not find the cord because we couldn&#x27;t replace that particular razor.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same charger that the Norelco 8240XL brings, it works very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fed up with the apparent lack of quality control or indifference to customer needs on the part of the designers responsible for this sort of spec change.  </li>
            <li>Tried finding one in different stores only to be told sorry, your best bet is buy a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have spent less money, as there were a few listed that were much cheaper, but they would not have worked.  </li>
            <li>If made in China, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual manufacturer changed.</li>

            <li> overpriced.  also pay attention to the wiring because it&#x27;s real thin and will wear out quickly if you&#x27;re not easy with it.  it works, but i&#x27;m not overall pleased.  but in a crunch, what else can you do?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fancy and it costs more than I think it should, but it does it&#x27;s job and works as advertized</li>
            <li> I found the one this replaced, but I can use another on trips. I was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being there</li>
            <li> Lost the original on a trip.  Ordered from Amazom.com and can use my  electric razor again.  Once more smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> It works fine. A bit expensive though, especially in relation to the cost of the razor.</li>

            <li> It is a power charger -- it is what it is and it is either the right one or not.  For me,  this was the correct one.</li>
            <li> The charger arrived quickly and has worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thank you we  move across the country and lost the cord for my husband&#x27;s electric razor. This cord was a perfect match.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly into my razor and I have to force it in, but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> I lost the battery charge of my Philips electric shaver in one of mine latest business trips. I found this model on Amazon and I decided to buy it. It works well and it is worth the money. I recommend it !</li>
            <li> It arrived as promised, and works well with an older model Norelco shaver.</li>

            <li> Son lost charger. This one fit perfect as the replacement!</li>
            <li> This was just what we needed.  Left home without power cord to my husbands razor.  Tried finding one in different stores only to be told sorry, your best bet is buy a new razor.  We bought this one from Amazon fits perfect and seller had super fast shipping.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Received on time and works just like my lost original one, love it!</li>
            <li> I lost my cord to my shaver and of course when this arrived, I found my other cord in the RV.  Now I will keep one in the RV and the house.</li>
            <li> Though the packaging clearly was marked 8240XL, the female cord end did not fit into the end of the shaver, which is definitely an 8240XL.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the manufacturer changed the specs.  If made in China, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual manufacturer changed. I&#x27;m really fed up with the apparent lack of quality control or indifference to customer needs on the part of the designers responsible for this sort of spec change.  I&#x27;ve reverted to not using an electric razor and won&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> This power cord was exactly what I needed for my razor.  It came just in time so I could recharge my razor.</li>
            <li> This cord works great with the Norelco 8240L which has a different plug that the older Norelco shavers.  Lowest price around.</li>
            <li> lost my charger in move. needed replacement. worked great as promised.&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;jc</li>
            <li> Perfect and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Worked just as expected.  Was in a jam as away from home, forgot to bring my cord and needed inexpensive one and this did the trick</li>
            <li> The was a fast shipment, good quality product, and charges like the one that came with it.  I&#x27;d do it again!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace a lost Norelco charging cord.  Works great.  I would recommend this to someone looking for a Norelco cord.  Make sure your model uses this end plug.  Some Norelco models use a different one.</li>
            <li> Use this as a replacement for the original power cord. Charges quickly, stays cool. no issues. Have used this for the past two months now.</li>
            <li> My husband said that his Norelco razor was the best one he ever had. He was devastated when he could not find the cord because we couldn&#x27;t replace that particular razor. So I made a call to Norelco to see if they had the cord, they did but very expensive. the representative then went on line and found this one through Amazon. So now we are both happy! :)</li>
            <li> My husband left his original power cord for his shaver in a hotel on a trip, after quite a long time of not using his electric shaver, I was happy to find a replacement on Amazon. Great price and works exactly as it should. We&#x27;ve had it for several months now and haven&#x27;t had any problems. So happy we didn&#x27;t have to buy a whole new electric shaver.</li>
