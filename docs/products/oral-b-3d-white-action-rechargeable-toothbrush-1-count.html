            <li>Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>Good value plus product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>this may be good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>Its Good.</li>
            <li>As of now, its good.</li>
            <li>I loved it and will recommend it...</li>
            <li>does a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li>good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>this is a good buy for a good quality product</li>
            <li>Otherwise, makes me feel good about using it compared to a mechanical toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good Morning, I am writing because I want to receive a refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, prompt delivery from Amazon and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>For me this is good, I brush for about 15 minutes per day and that is about a week of charge.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good in making the teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>and I felt they know how to continue taking good care of their</li>
            <li>, I recommend it without doubt the best buy for your peace of original replacements as they are good quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rotating type for years and find that it gives the best, clean feel.</li>
            <li>very good value for the money, but they sound like a toy.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m VERY glad i bought this one rather than one that needs batteries.</li>
            <li>great value and love the product.</li>
            <li>IT IS A GREAT TOOTHBRUSH, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GUMS HEALTHY, AND THE DENTIST AWAY.  </li>
            <li>So glad to see they have the rechargeable model on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>and we both love them !  </li>
            <li>This brush is easy to use and does a great job keeping the cavities away.</li>
            <li>MY teeth look amazing now too</li>
            <li>The power of this rechargeable toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not needing batteries in my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>How nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a nice electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>great toothbrush my husband love it :-)</li>
            <li>I charge it once every two weeks, which is nice</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The brush does a nice job and holds a charge.</li>
            <li>It is safe and really good, I recommend if you buy this also buy the replacement bristles as you will need it just after a month or 2.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;d each have our own about 18 months ago.  </li>
            <li>I loved it for more than it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush part itself is nice and works well to travel with or use every day.</li>
            <li>awesome brush fast and recharges instantaneously</li>
            <li>I liked this brush</li>
            <li>Awesome product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean after use!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to get my best friend one, she said she has heard of them but never owned one, so she will soon be surprised by this gift.</li>
            <li>is really good toothbrush for a cheap price..</li>
            <li>Very pleased came quickly!</li>
            <li>The price looks too good to be true...</li>
            <li>Took a while to ship, but works just fine!  </li>
            <li>more than meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Nice cheap electric toothbrush alternative.</li>
            <li>I get much better results with this than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to leave it</li>
            <li>I just wish the bristles were more durable.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>Works great,  Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this Oral-B product.</li>
            <li>We have been using Oral-B products for many years.  </li>
            <li>Works ok but we like the rotating head.  </li>
            <li>and I have worn out many of them.</li>
            <li>I actually love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and it works as promised.</li>
            <li>and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I</li>
            <li>I like to eat chocolate, and my teeth have been scraped so many times by the dentist</li>
            <li>the price is much better than the newer models.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>I hope it cleans my teeth more than manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Loooks and feels OK</li>
            <li>It &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; and vibrates more than it spins/reciprocates.</li>
            <li>My children have had throw-a-way spin brushes that performed better.</li>
            <li>It is just slightly better than a non powered brush.</li>
            <li>, you can spend hundreds for top-knotch brushes that polish your shoes and do your laundry or whatever it is they do, but at the heart of it, they&#x27;re probably not going to do much more for your teeth than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My conclusion is that the 6-month one (which did need charged more often from the start) was a defect.  </li>
            <li>But this one is doing way, way better than that.</li>
            <li>Was better than I expacted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for many years now.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li>the way the product work for the moment it is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this unit as I believe that it cleans my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Ok so i hav been using this for like two days now...</li>
            <li>I have to say, I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would have bought more.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>What more can one say.</li>
            <li>This one has two rotating pieces which makes this a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to purchase a new brush to replace, say, a Vitality, I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll be happy with the job this one does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Teeth feel very clean and replacement heads are $6 a pair at walmart</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel VERY clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well but should have a more powerful smooth sounding rotoation on toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a good choice for people trying electric brush for the first time</li>
            <li>His teeth have never been this clean in between dentist appointments!</li>
            <li>May clean better than the Braun Oral-b it replaced at a much better price.</li>
            <li>He got it for Christmas and so far it works great.</li>
            <li>Works great just like the old one.</li>
            <li>Is loud but works great.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE, DOES A SUPER JOB, REALLY COMPACT AND CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li>hope the replacement bristles are better than the original....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are easy to put on when the bristles wear out.  </li>
            <li>I admit that I haven&#x27;t tried to push its longevity because it&#x27;s so easy to charge</li>
            <li>The box said it could hold a charge for up to 2 weeks but mine easily holds a charge for over a month.</li>
            <li>Works great, actually bought more as gifts</li>
            <li>I got this electric toothbrush because my dentist recommended I use one to keep my wisdom teeth clean and healthy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sturdy, strong rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it does any better at cleaning my teeth as my old one, both do a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>A high quality, fairly priced electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This brush has high marks for a good reason.  </li>
            <li>The first was amazing, but the motor conked out after six months.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s fine, gets the job done.</li>
            <li>They work fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the lucky people who doesn&#x27;t need to!).</li>
            <li>I decided on this (MUCH cheaper) model, and I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I found a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a huge deal-breaker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now trying to brush lightly.  </li>
            <li>Great taste for a low carb snack that keeps the sugar cravings away!</li>
            <li>But it is too noisy and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>gift for granddaughter and she has seemed to enjoy using it...</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li>and this one was cheap and the replacement heads didn&#x27;t cost $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything about this is great except I can&#x27;t tell when my toothbrush is fully charged or if it is currently charging.</li>
            <li>Also, the replacement heads are cheap too.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Super nice product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>, so this is the replacement nice but liked the other model better.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anything special and for a battery powered toothbrush it could be a lot more powerful, but it is cheap</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money and gets my teeth exceptionally clean!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased them at Amazon and at your friendly ginormous chain store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of a joke after using this and then picking up a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li>My wife and I have both had this toothbrush for many years, and when hers stopped working, I went on the search for an exact replacement.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in quite some time and was really excited to receive this one.</li>
            <li>I originally got this because it said whitening on the label.</li>
            <li>Recently we needed to replace our old units and these were perfect.</li>
            <li>makes tooth care easy &amp; fun again.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, MY TEETH ARE CLEAN &amp; MY MOUTH FEELS CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I bought two of them, I received two different colors, then I will not make mistake with my husband, they looked great and useful.</li>
            <li>The kicker is, my teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel SO CLEAN using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But I do feel my teeth extremely clean</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>It gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>it is a great toothbrush and lasts forever on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>I own a Professional Care and a Vitality dual clean.</li>
            <li>The quality is great, replacement heads by Oral B are very reasonable and last around 3 months each ...</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t bother me though because this is a pretty darn good product at a reasonable price, and that electric toothbrush clean for your smile and dental health are well worth it.</li>
            <li>toothbrush itself works great and we have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li>Good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD BUY, BUT IT IS TOO NOISY.</li>
            <li>when I need to buy another one I&#x27;ll make sure I pick the size I really want</li>
            <li>Battery only good for about 6-8 months</li>
            <li>They get my teeth super clean.</li>
            <li>Love absolutely everything about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good rechargeable handheld brush.</li>
            <li>and it was a good product but only had one rotating piece to the brush.</li>
            <li>over all it is not a bad buy</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are very reasonable in price, and easy to find.  </li>
            <li>The old ones did a good job, but these do an even better job as they run much faster and are more comfortable to hold as the body is much smaller in diameter.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and after charging the battery it works exactly as I knew it would.</li>
            <li>You may initially find its action strange, but give it a week &amp;, like me, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than happy !</li>
            <li>It is very cheap, but with high quality.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Even if I had to replace it every 6 months it would be worth it for the health benefits of having truly clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one, the 1st lasted many many years</li>
            <li>I think a lesser price would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li>It sends high-speed circular motions that makes cleaning easy and definitely positive for gum massage.  </li>
            <li>Its better to spend a little more and buy something of a better quality.</li>
            <li>When you put that in the charger and let it be charged for 12 hours, you can use it for more than a month with a normal usage.</li>
            <li>The smooth and curved handle feels natural to operate and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Good, but does not hold battery for a long time.</li>
            <li>My son used the second one to clean his Halo action figure (chucked that one immediately lol).</li>
            <li>We have another low cost Oral-B that has worked perfectly for a long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>Even so, it was good enough for the first 5 months that it was worth it to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however, overall, this is an AMAZING toothbrush at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li>Worth it if you want a powered toothbrush, but don&#x27;t want to spend a $100.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 14 year old and he said he was ok with it.</li>
            <li>But after three years, it&#x27;s well worth the $17.</li>
            <li>so I plug it in for a day and let it run till it dies still awesome for the price and its wireless charging no wires or contacts to worry about getting broken</li>
            <li>Not that it bothers me, but I thought it was worth a mention.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one I bought qver 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>it was worth the price</li>
            <li>Its worth the price.</li>
            <li>My old electric toothbrush, from another brand, died after many years of service.  </li>
            <li>However, the action of the round brush is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Makes my teeth nice and white!</li>
            <li>This brush is worth the money</li>
            <li>Actually it still kind of works, but doesn&#x27;t really spin the brushes fast enough to be very effective for brushing.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush due to its recharging capability - always a full charge to get the teeth and gums clean!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean afterwards and as far as inexpensive rechargeable toothbrushes go, try this one.</li>
            <li>the pro side, it keeps its charge really well; the original charge outlasted the brush head.</li>
            <li>For a electric toothbrush, this is the right price point for me.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>, ONE CON is that it can break right where the replacement brush heads pop in.</li>
            <li>but the price is right and it cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because the price was right.</li>
            <li>If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right?  </li>
            <li>I also feel like this toothbrush really leaves my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li>really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how clean my teeth feel so much,</li>
            <li>We have had several of these for well over a year,  and I like that the heads are easy to replace!  </li>
            <li>In regards to power, I unboxed it and didn&#x27;t work right off the bat, had to charge it first.</li>
            <li>I would like the brush to be slightly softer but all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li>meets my expectations, much more economical than units found in local stores.  </li>
            <li>deep cleans and holds a charge for well over a week, at a price that will surely make you smile.</li>
            <li>I expected more from Oral B!</li>
            <li>My children like it very much.</li>
            <li>Still use it, the charge lasts a long time and is very strong.</li>
            <li>I actually brush my teeth more often now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd toothbrush as the top of the handle unit breaks since I&#x27;m a masher.  </li>
            <li>The first one wore out after three years.</li>
            <li>Really like this would reorder the item again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>used it once, and died midway through brushing the first Time..</li>
            <li>However, after the first use, the reciprocating head (the top head doesn&#x27;t spin all the way around, it &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; partially back and forth) stopped working.</li>
            <li>Does the work and its ok to use especially considering the money you paid.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>First one worked for a week and wouldnt charge.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local store any more.  </li>
            <li>it gets hot</li>
            <li>It has a slightly cheap feel to it and is rather loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the first one, which I had for three years.</li>
            <li>I never had any problem with the first one, and so why not get another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>exactly as described -- works well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works okay to brush my teeth, but it&#x27;s always pretty gross to pick up.  </li>
            <li>vibrating brush takes some getting used to, but I feel it cleans my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;Surely intended only for healthy hygienic oral care practices.</li>
            <li>It also seems to charge higher when the brush has been turned off with the button.</li>
            <li>sure it need to be charged all he time or can be used multiple times after each charge&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>When you first get it, plug it in and let it sit for 16 hours.</li>
            <li>Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li>I am really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this toothbrush and how clean my teeth feel when I brush them.  </li>
            <li>operation is quite, smooth and the dual action is both fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Is as good as the much more expensive models and the point is it does the job ...</li>
            <li>This is a Christmas present, that I would buy again for myself, since my own has lasted six years and counting so far.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much stain this Oral-B took off my teeth on the FIRST USE.</li>
            <li>They hold a charge very well and keep the kids interested in brushing.</li>
            <li>It is super loud, but it&#x27;s never bothered me.</li>
            <li>If they were easier to use you might bump them during use, switching the unit off accidentally, I don&#x27;t know, but they&#x27;re easy enough as is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>rinse off brush, extra water easily drains through holder/</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud, the brush head is a bit too big, and the handle is a bit too small (seems to be more suitable for children than adults), but it was cheap and will work for now.</li>
            <li>The brush head is really large in size but may work alright for adults use.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase largely for the rechargable feature.</li>
            <li>My Vitality only cost $1 more than this when it was new 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Teeth get cleaned, batteries easy to change, but wow is it loud.  </li>
            <li>Like most people, I&#x27;m on a budget these days, and I was pretty discouraged when I saw the $200 price tag on other brands like Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The little charging dock is nice.</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush, a little on the noisy side, but it cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>I did not really like it but did not like manual brushes even more and ended up with this thanks to favorable reviews and affordability (including replacement heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s VERY noisy.</li>
            <li>This one has a much thicker handle and is much louder</li>
            <li>I do get the replacement heads about once a year, but even with those the whole thing is worn out after about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>Power, battery lasts about 2 weeks once charged and works very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>What would you really expect?</li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>REALLY NOISY.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY NOISY.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as it used to.</li>
            <li>Really like this one and</li>
            <li>and it is ready in the morning.    </li>
            <li>I really like the toothbrush, but it has a lot of holes in it and when trying to keep your mouth shut to keep toothpaste and whatnot in while brushing, the holes leak</li>
            <li>and I really like that.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li>I instead got a light blue colored one.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts much longer than the Vitality.</li>
            <li>He really loves the toothbrush so I am going on his recommendation.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the size of the head, you will really like the rotating brush feature.</li>
            <li>i know it isnt much of a time frame to write a review on.....</li>
            <li>fast shipping .</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t stomach spending that much on one toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought them at Wegman&#x27;s but they should have been available on Amazon as a product next to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an electric toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for a few weeks, and it sits nicely in the charging station.</li>
            <li>Could definitely use more power but other than that works just fine.</li>
            <li>This has been a great help for me and my family as I have a disabled son who has trouble getting all of his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It is as good as the most expensive brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for my gums, and I can use it to clean around dental work much more thoroughly and with less damage than with an ordinary scrubber toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li>This holds it&#x27;s charge well and is better at scrubbing the gum line and polishing teeth than it is at removing food between the teeth due to the motion it has.  </li>
            <li>The price point is a bit high, but so far has been well worth it.</li>
            <li>I am now an electric toothbrush convert and highly recommend this model to anyone else who wants to try an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is quite different from the previous Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, but it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>One full charge of 2 hours approx is enough for a week</li>
            <li>You can buy replacement heads easily, just use the old brush to clean any dried toothpaste from the inside...</li>
            <li>Nice and small.  </li>
            <li>g/f new to power brush &amp; really likes it.pleased with design,performance,rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I just buy a whole new one.  </li>
            <li>I believe this because when it&#x27;s brushing the motor seems to become slower or louder at times when there&#x27;s more or less resistance.</li>
            <li>Particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>I like my older (more expensive) model better.</li>
            <li>oh they are probably exaggerating you know how some ppl are super picky and critical</li>
            <li>The old one&#x27;s battery is just fine, but the metal nub in the head of the brush wore flat</li>
            <li>Just like the original ones I bought long ago.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads snap into place in a matter of seconds and are of high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying one for everyone in the house.</li>
            <li>and it was suggested that he try a high powered mechanical toothbrush to keep the build up under control between dental cleanings.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it Oral B products.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try submerging the thing underwater, but it works fine when it gets wet-</li>
            <li>The on/off buttons could be a little easier to use, but they are certainly OK just as they are.  </li>
            <li>Spin motion works good, though it is a limited spin and NOT a full circle spin.</li>
            <li>I preferred the Vitality to the Professional Care as my teeth/mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it seemed expensive for what you bought.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this toothbrush, the charge holds for a long time and it actually came charged so I did not have to wait to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is a much cheaper option than your usual electric tooth brush, and works much better than the battery operated brushes.</li>
            <li>;) very noisy toothbrush with paste, turned it on and brushed for literally 30 seconds when it quit.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on a second one, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>After about a couple of months it loses its strength and the bristles won&#x27;t vibrate effectively.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as my last model, I think.</li>
            <li>cuz normal tbrush wasnt reaching at all)</li>
            <li>OH, and to keep any residual water from possibly getting into the innards and messing anything up, I have found a way to store my Oral-B at an angle pointing downward right after use.</li>
            <li>Regular brushing can only clean so much, especially in far corners of the mouth like where wisdom teeth are.</li>
            <li>I got this as a cheap alternative to the other rechargeable toothbrushes that are on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am now looking to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one after three years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this new toothbrush  for about 3 months now.  </li>
            <li>They replaced them with new models.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to get a new one soon rather than buy new replacements.</li>
            <li>The condition specified that the purchase was a new mower.</li>
            <li>the problem is that i live in Europe.</li>
            <li>i live in Europe</li>
            <li>it will work like new again.</li>
            <li>More like it vibrates- hard and fast.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;d be nice if the replacement heads came in soft, medium and hard), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li>Have used these tooth brushes before this purchase however  they are no longer available where we use to purchase them only the more expensive ones and these work just fine and last for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the color of the picture (the picture is red, and it&#x27;s a light blue), but it&#x27;s probably the awesomest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve used on</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery wise, brushing 2 minutes per go, two or three times a day, you&#x27;ll probably last at least a week between charges.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the operation of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but is very loud.  </li>
            <li>This model oral B rechargeable toothbrush is very loud /noisy when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>Very loud toothbrush...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud - I almost don&#x27;t like to use it if my spouse is already asleep.</li>
            <li>ground fault circuited bathroom plug, placed the toothbrush into the charger overnight and tossed my 3 year old high quality Oral B Vitality Toothbrush away.</li>
            <li>It is very loud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it is very loud.  </li>
            <li>well I&#x27;m here to confirm it is VERY loud.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased one for each one of my family members and they sent them all in the same color and it was not even in the beautiful red shown, rather a pale blue.</li>
            <li>better than the replaceable battery operated toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>Overtime, no matter how long I kept it on the charger, it didn&#x27;t work at powerfully as the first time I brushed with it.</li>
            <li>I did not deduct a star for this, however, because my first brush of this model lasted TWO YEARS before it finally succumbed.</li>
            <li>I just set it up to recharge for the first time after using it daily for 2 1/2 MONTHS.</li>
            <li>ask 4 of these brushes, 1 of which was ruined the first day, pull away several dollars in purchases.</li>
            <li>The first one finally died so i replaced it again.</li>
            <li>litte difference in power from first to 2nd usage after charging&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product; have purchased it in the past.</li>
            <li>The first one finally pretty much wore out a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>our old ones wore out and it was time for new ones.</li>
            <li>This one is cheap yet looks like it should last a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 3d White action after I mis-ordered replacement heads for the dual clean and got 3d replacements (the brush head looks similar).</li>
            <li>They say it should last 12 days between charges, and today is the first time I&#x27;ve had any diminished action.</li>
            <li>It is noisier than my old Oral B like a very loud bee buzzing.</li>
            <li>front brush spins left and right, back brush rotates left and right.</li>
            <li>I noticed an obvious positive difference in using an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>Better then battery powered brushes, &#x27;cuz batteries are not cheap and go dead quickly.</li>
            <li>I look forward to my time in the morning and before bed when I can wake up or wind down and get a really clean feeling in the process.</li>
            <li>The charge last for a very longtime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I threw my old 12v battery powered brush in the trash.</li>
            <li>so much I keep the regular battery operated version in my camper, never have to worry about being &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; in.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews after my old toothbrush (cost way over $100) died after 2 years.</li>
            <li>I read that it is loud but not to me - not as loud as that way over $100 one I had was.</li>
            <li>It is loud though, but who cares.</li>
            <li>for the cost, this is by far the one to give a try.</li>
            <li>It is alright except for the loud noise .</li>
            <li>It is loud as others have noted, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>power well through brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;Handle does not accommodate my old brushes from another power toothbrush.</li>
            <li>very,very,VERY loud, pricey replacement brushes</li>
            <li>The link to replacement bristles is : Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count&lt;</li>
            <li>:B003UBTYKI Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count]]</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really surprised me.</li>
            <li>that I find myself brushing 4 times a day, instead of the 2 times with the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But it does the job, and does it well, it just does it loudly.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads are not compatible with the Action line.  </li>
            <li>As loud as an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud as all get out</li>
            <li>onefor my mom and for my 3tr old son</li>
            <li>I do not care much for the 3rd dimension</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth well, but it is so loud that i&#x27;m going to have to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>The noise is so high-pitched and loud compared to my old oral-b vitality</li>
            <li>I purchased these Oral-B brushes (2) for my 19 teeth.and 17 year old children.</li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush to be nothing more than a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li>Works as good as expensive ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt; would recommend vendor to other to purchase their much needed items, i really like the service and the products that i have received.</li>
            <li>I have gum degeneration and these brushes clean without hurting or destroying the gums.</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral B rechargeable toothbrush-I had my first one for several years</li>
            <li>On a recent dental visit, the hygienist highly recommended electric toothbrushes over manual toothbrushes and tried to sell me one for $120.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth it to buy new every few months.  </li>
            <li>The brush is small and light.</li>
            <li>For how cheap this electric toothbrush is, it definitely packs a punch and does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a cheap alternative to having a really expensive dentist grade electric toothbrush and I hit gold.</li>
            <li>I have long used electric tooth brushes as the really help with keeping my gums in shape.</li>
            <li>I had my last one for 2 years and it still worked until my new puppy chewed the cord.</li>
            <li>My old one still works, I just wanted one as a back up in case they completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li>One little nuisance I have is that before you can even attach a new brush head, there&#x27;s a tool you have to buy from oral-b to detach the first one.</li>
            <li>: the handle and single charger are much lighter than the Vitality.</li>
            <li>no other complaints.  </li>
            <li>AWSOME products quality is beyond repence there is not much more I can say about this product this day unique</li>
            <li>I actually felt like I had a professional dental cleaning!  </li>
            <li>I think this feels really cheap when I use it  and not strong enough on the teeth.</li>
            <li>Also the brush is larger (I prefer the smaller generally) but gave it a try and found the toothbrush head really gets the tartar away from the gum line and does wonder on the gums when lightly brushed over.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a 13 year old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a 3.5 year old Oral B, which the charge only lasted 5 or 6 days now.</li>
            <li>I did not get this oral b 3 D white action rechargeable toothbrush</li>
            <li>I actually dropped my old one or would have gotten about another year out of it.</li>
            <li>If you normally buy battery because of price this one will be cheaper in the long run because of battery savings.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my previous electric toothbrush, this new one is easier to hold (somewhat slim), holds a charge much longer, and the charging cradle is much smaller.  </li>
            <li>We had two older oral-B&#x27;s that were getting pretty tired, so we decided to go for new ones.</li>
            <li>It does his job, the only con is that it&#x27;s really loud and it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did, to remind you how long you&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li>The little holes are a structural weakness that can lead to cracks, until finally the whole end just snaps off and you have to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Overall, great toothbrush, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anyone sleeping here, expect a cat, but it is loud enough to wake your entire house up.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads look fairly expensive but you know what they cost going in, so be it, that said I&#x27;m sure the replacement heads are profitable whereas the base/motor-driver is at or near the cost to manufacture in order to get you into the product and then use the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>It speeds up and slows down at certain intervals.</li>
            <li>In general, they last for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>The only cons that I can see so far are that the bottom is rounded so it cannot be set flat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised nearly no one has said this in the opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the cost of most is crazy high.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the noise (different from other electrics I&#x27;ve had) or the vibration caused by the high speed oscillation.</li>

            <li> this may be good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>

            <li> As of now, its good.</li>
            <li> I loved it and will recommend it...</li>
            <li> does a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li> good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> this is a good buy for a good quality product</li>
            <li> Otherwise, makes me feel good about using it compared to a mechanical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good Morning, I am writing because I want to receive a refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, prompt delivery from Amazon and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> For me this is good, I brush for about 15 minutes per day and that is about a week of charge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good in making the teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> and I felt they know how to continue taking good care of their</li>
            <li> , I recommend it without doubt the best buy for your peace of original replacements as they are good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rotating type for years and find that it gives the best, clean feel.</li>
            <li> very good value for the money, but they sound like a toy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m VERY glad i bought this one rather than one that needs batteries.</li>
            <li> great value and love the product.</li>
            <li> IT IS A GREAT TOOTHBRUSH, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GUMS HEALTHY, AND THE DENTIST AWAY.  </li>
            <li> So glad to see they have the rechargeable model on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> and we both love them !  </li>
            <li> This brush is easy to use and does a great job keeping the cavities away.</li>
            <li> MY teeth look amazing now too</li>
            <li> The power of this rechargeable toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not needing batteries in my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> How nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a nice electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> great toothbrush my husband love it :-)</li>
            <li> I charge it once every two weeks, which is nice</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The brush does a nice job and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> It is safe and really good, I recommend if you buy this also buy the replacement bristles as you will need it just after a month or 2.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;d each have our own about 18 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I loved it for more than it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush part itself is nice and works well to travel with or use every day.</li>
            <li> awesome brush fast and recharges instantaneously</li>
            <li> I liked this brush</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean after use!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to get my best friend one, she said she has heard of them but never owned one, so she will soon be surprised by this gift.</li>
            <li> is really good toothbrush for a cheap price..</li>
            <li> Very pleased came quickly!</li>
            <li> The price looks too good to be true...</li>
            <li> Took a while to ship, but works just fine!  </li>
            <li> more than meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> Nice cheap electric toothbrush alternative.</li>
            <li> I get much better results with this than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t need to leave it</li>
            <li> I just wish the bristles were more durable.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> Works great,  Holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love this Oral-B product.</li>
            <li> We have been using Oral-B products for many years.  </li>
            <li> Works ok but we like the rotating head.  </li>
            <li> and I have worn out many of them.</li>
            <li> I actually love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it works as promised.</li>
            <li> and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I</li>
            <li> I like to eat chocolate, and my teeth have been scraped so many times by the dentist</li>
            <li> the price is much better than the newer models.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> what more can I say?  </li>
            <li> I hope it cleans my teeth more than manual tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Loooks and feels OK</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; and vibrates more than it spins/reciprocates.</li>
            <li> My children have had throw-a-way spin brushes that performed better.</li>
            <li> It is just slightly better than a non powered brush.</li>
            <li> , you can spend hundreds for top-knotch brushes that polish your shoes and do your laundry or whatever it is they do, but at the heart of it, they&#x27;re probably not going to do much more for your teeth than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that the 6-month one (which did need charged more often from the start) was a defect.  </li>
            <li> But this one is doing way, way better than that.</li>
            <li> Was better than I expacted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for many years now.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> the way the product work for the moment it is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this unit as I believe that it cleans my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Ok so i hav been using this for like two days now...</li>
            <li> I have to say, I LOVE this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> What more can one say.</li>
            <li> This one has two rotating pieces which makes this a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to purchase a new brush to replace, say, a Vitality, I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll be happy with the job this one does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Teeth feel very clean and replacement heads are $6 a pair at walmart</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel VERY clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well but should have a more powerful smooth sounding rotoation on toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a good choice for people trying electric brush for the first time</li>
            <li> His teeth have never been this clean in between dentist appointments!</li>
            <li> May clean better than the Braun Oral-b it replaced at a much better price.</li>
            <li> He got it for Christmas and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Is loud but works great.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, DOES A SUPER JOB, REALLY COMPACT AND CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li> hope the replacement bristles are better than the original....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are easy to put on when the bristles wear out.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I haven&#x27;t tried to push its longevity because it&#x27;s so easy to charge</li>
            <li> The box said it could hold a charge for up to 2 weeks but mine easily holds a charge for over a month.</li>
            <li> Works great, actually bought more as gifts</li>
            <li> I got this electric toothbrush because my dentist recommended I use one to keep my wisdom teeth clean and healthy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sturdy, strong rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it does any better at cleaning my teeth as my old one, both do a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> A high quality, fairly priced electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush has high marks for a good reason.  </li>
            <li> The first was amazing, but the motor conked out after six months.</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s fine, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> They work fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the lucky people who doesn&#x27;t need to!).</li>
            <li> I decided on this (MUCH cheaper) model, and I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I found a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a huge deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now trying to brush lightly.  </li>
            <li> Great taste for a low carb snack that keeps the sugar cravings away!</li>
            <li> But it is too noisy and feels cheap.</li>
            <li> gift for granddaughter and she has seemed to enjoy using it...</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> and this one was cheap and the replacement heads didn&#x27;t cost $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything about this is great except I can&#x27;t tell when my toothbrush is fully charged or if it is currently charging.</li>
            <li> Also, the replacement heads are cheap too.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Super nice product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> , so this is the replacement nice but liked the other model better.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything special and for a battery powered toothbrush it could be a lot more powerful, but it is cheap</li>
            <li> Leaves my teeth smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money and gets my teeth exceptionally clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased them at Amazon and at your friendly ginormous chain store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of a joke after using this and then picking up a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both had this toothbrush for many years, and when hers stopped working, I went on the search for an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in quite some time and was really excited to receive this one.</li>
            <li> I originally got this because it said whitening on the label.</li>
            <li> Recently we needed to replace our old units and these were perfect.</li>
            <li> makes tooth care easy &amp; fun again.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, MY TEETH ARE CLEAN &amp; MY MOUTH FEELS CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them, I received two different colors, then I will not make mistake with my husband, they looked great and useful.</li>
            <li> The kicker is, my teeth have never felt this clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel SO CLEAN using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But I do feel my teeth extremely clean</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> It gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> it is a great toothbrush and lasts forever on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> I own a Professional Care and a Vitality dual clean.</li>
            <li> The quality is great, replacement heads by Oral B are very reasonable and last around 3 months each ...</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t bother me though because this is a pretty darn good product at a reasonable price, and that electric toothbrush clean for your smile and dental health are well worth it.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself works great and we have absolutely no complaints.  </li>
            <li> Good basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD BUY, BUT IT IS TOO NOISY.</li>
            <li> when I need to buy another one I&#x27;ll make sure I pick the size I really want</li>
            <li> Battery only good for about 6-8 months</li>
            <li> They get my teeth super clean.</li>
            <li> Love absolutely everything about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good rechargeable handheld brush.</li>
            <li> and it was a good product but only had one rotating piece to the brush.</li>
            <li> over all it is not a bad buy</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are very reasonable in price, and easy to find.  </li>
            <li> The old ones did a good job, but these do an even better job as they run much faster and are more comfortable to hold as the body is much smaller in diameter.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and after charging the battery it works exactly as I knew it would.</li>
            <li> You may initially find its action strange, but give it a week &amp;, like me, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than happy !</li>
            <li> It is very cheap, but with high quality.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Even if I had to replace it every 6 months it would be worth it for the health benefits of having truly clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one, the 1st lasted many many years</li>
            <li> I think a lesser price would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li> It sends high-speed circular motions that makes cleaning easy and definitely positive for gum massage.  </li>
            <li> Its better to spend a little more and buy something of a better quality.</li>
            <li> When you put that in the charger and let it be charged for 12 hours, you can use it for more than a month with a normal usage.</li>
            <li> The smooth and curved handle feels natural to operate and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Good, but does not hold battery for a long time.</li>
            <li> My son used the second one to clean his Halo action figure (chucked that one immediately lol).</li>
            <li> We have another low cost Oral-B that has worked perfectly for a long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Even so, it was good enough for the first 5 months that it was worth it to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however, overall, this is an AMAZING toothbrush at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> Worth it if you want a powered toothbrush, but don&#x27;t want to spend a $100.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 14 year old and he said he was ok with it.</li>
            <li> But after three years, it&#x27;s well worth the $17.</li>
            <li> so I plug it in for a day and let it run till it dies still awesome for the price and its wireless charging no wires or contacts to worry about getting broken</li>
            <li> Not that it bothers me, but I thought it was worth a mention.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one I bought qver 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> it was worth the price</li>
            <li> Its worth the price.</li>
            <li> My old electric toothbrush, from another brand, died after many years of service.  </li>
            <li> However, the action of the round brush is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Makes my teeth nice and white!</li>
            <li> This brush is worth the money</li>
            <li> Actually it still kind of works, but doesn&#x27;t really spin the brushes fast enough to be very effective for brushing.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush due to its recharging capability - always a full charge to get the teeth and gums clean!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean afterwards and as far as inexpensive rechargeable toothbrushes go, try this one.</li>
            <li> the pro side, it keeps its charge really well; the original charge outlasted the brush head.</li>
            <li> For a electric toothbrush, this is the right price point for me.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> , ONE CON is that it can break right where the replacement brush heads pop in.</li>
            <li> but the price is right and it cleans your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because the price was right.</li>
            <li> If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right?  </li>
            <li> I also feel like this toothbrush really leaves my teeth feeling clean</li>
            <li> really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how clean my teeth feel so much,</li>
            <li> We have had several of these for well over a year,  and I like that the heads are easy to replace!  </li>
            <li> In regards to power, I unboxed it and didn&#x27;t work right off the bat, had to charge it first.</li>
            <li> I would like the brush to be slightly softer but all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> meets my expectations, much more economical than units found in local stores.  </li>
            <li> deep cleans and holds a charge for well over a week, at a price that will surely make you smile.</li>
            <li> I expected more from Oral B!</li>
            <li> My children like it very much.</li>
            <li> Still use it, the charge lasts a long time and is very strong.</li>
            <li> I actually brush my teeth more often now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd toothbrush as the top of the handle unit breaks since I&#x27;m a masher.  </li>
            <li> The first one wore out after three years.</li>
            <li> Really like this would reorder the item again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> used it once, and died midway through brushing the first Time..</li>
            <li> However, after the first use, the reciprocating head (the top head doesn&#x27;t spin all the way around, it &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; partially back and forth) stopped working.</li>
            <li> Does the work and its ok to use especially considering the money you paid.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> First one worked for a week and wouldnt charge.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local store any more.  </li>
            <li> it gets hot</li>
            <li> It has a slightly cheap feel to it and is rather loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the first one, which I had for three years.</li>
            <li> I never had any problem with the first one, and so why not get another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> exactly as described -- works well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works okay to brush my teeth, but it&#x27;s always pretty gross to pick up.  </li>
            <li> vibrating brush takes some getting used to, but I feel it cleans my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;Surely intended only for healthy hygienic oral care practices.</li>
            <li> It also seems to charge higher when the brush has been turned off with the button.</li>
            <li> sure it need to be charged all he time or can be used multiple times after each charge&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> When you first get it, plug it in and let it sit for 16 hours.</li>
            <li> Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I am really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this toothbrush and how clean my teeth feel when I brush them.  </li>
            <li> operation is quite, smooth and the dual action is both fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Is as good as the much more expensive models and the point is it does the job ...</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present, that I would buy again for myself, since my own has lasted six years and counting so far.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much stain this Oral-B took off my teeth on the FIRST USE.</li>
            <li> They hold a charge very well and keep the kids interested in brushing.</li>
            <li> It is super loud, but it&#x27;s never bothered me.</li>
            <li> If they were easier to use you might bump them during use, switching the unit off accidentally, I don&#x27;t know, but they&#x27;re easy enough as is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> rinse off brush, extra water easily drains through holder/</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud, the brush head is a bit too big, and the handle is a bit too small (seems to be more suitable for children than adults), but it was cheap and will work for now.</li>
            <li> The brush head is really large in size but may work alright for adults use.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase largely for the rechargable feature.</li>
            <li> My Vitality only cost $1 more than this when it was new 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Teeth get cleaned, batteries easy to change, but wow is it loud.  </li>
            <li> Like most people, I&#x27;m on a budget these days, and I was pretty discouraged when I saw the $200 price tag on other brands like Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The little charging dock is nice.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush, a little on the noisy side, but it cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> I did not really like it but did not like manual brushes even more and ended up with this thanks to favorable reviews and affordability (including replacement heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY noisy.</li>
            <li> This one has a much thicker handle and is much louder</li>
            <li> I do get the replacement heads about once a year, but even with those the whole thing is worn out after about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> Power, battery lasts about 2 weeks once charged and works very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> What would you really expect?</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> REALLY NOISY.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY NOISY.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as it used to.</li>
            <li> Really like this one and</li>
            <li> and it is ready in the morning.    </li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush, but it has a lot of holes in it and when trying to keep your mouth shut to keep toothpaste and whatnot in while brushing, the holes leak</li>
            <li> and I really like that.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I instead got a light blue colored one.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts much longer than the Vitality.</li>
            <li> He really loves the toothbrush so I am going on his recommendation.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the size of the head, you will really like the rotating brush feature.</li>
            <li> i know it isnt much of a time frame to write a review on.....</li>
            <li> fast shipping .</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t stomach spending that much on one toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought them at Wegman&#x27;s but they should have been available on Amazon as a product next to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an electric toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a few weeks, and it sits nicely in the charging station.</li>
            <li> Could definitely use more power but other than that works just fine.</li>
            <li> This has been a great help for me and my family as I have a disabled son who has trouble getting all of his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It is as good as the most expensive brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for my gums, and I can use it to clean around dental work much more thoroughly and with less damage than with an ordinary scrubber toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li> This holds it&#x27;s charge well and is better at scrubbing the gum line and polishing teeth than it is at removing food between the teeth due to the motion it has.  </li>
            <li> The price point is a bit high, but so far has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am now an electric toothbrush convert and highly recommend this model to anyone else who wants to try an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is quite different from the previous Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, but it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> One full charge of 2 hours approx is enough for a week</li>
            <li> You can buy replacement heads easily, just use the old brush to clean any dried toothpaste from the inside...</li>
            <li> Nice and small.  </li>
            <li> g/f new to power brush &amp; really likes it.pleased with design,performance,rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I just buy a whole new one.  </li>
            <li> I believe this because when it&#x27;s brushing the motor seems to become slower or louder at times when there&#x27;s more or less resistance.</li>
            <li> Particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> I like my older (more expensive) model better.</li>
            <li> oh they are probably exaggerating you know how some ppl are super picky and critical</li>
            <li> The old one&#x27;s battery is just fine, but the metal nub in the head of the brush wore flat</li>
            <li> Just like the original ones I bought long ago.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads snap into place in a matter of seconds and are of high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying one for everyone in the house.</li>
            <li> and it was suggested that he try a high powered mechanical toothbrush to keep the build up under control between dental cleanings.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it Oral B products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try submerging the thing underwater, but it works fine when it gets wet-</li>
            <li> The on/off buttons could be a little easier to use, but they are certainly OK just as they are.  </li>
            <li> Spin motion works good, though it is a limited spin and NOT a full circle spin.</li>
            <li> I preferred the Vitality to the Professional Care as my teeth/mouth felt much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it seemed expensive for what you bought.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this toothbrush, the charge holds for a long time and it actually came charged so I did not have to wait to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper option than your usual electric tooth brush, and works much better than the battery operated brushes.</li>
            <li> ;) very noisy toothbrush with paste, turned it on and brushed for literally 30 seconds when it quit.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on a second one, and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> After about a couple of months it loses its strength and the bristles won&#x27;t vibrate effectively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as my last model, I think.</li>
            <li> cuz normal tbrush wasnt reaching at all)</li>
            <li> OH, and to keep any residual water from possibly getting into the innards and messing anything up, I have found a way to store my Oral-B at an angle pointing downward right after use.</li>
            <li> Regular brushing can only clean so much, especially in far corners of the mouth like where wisdom teeth are.</li>
            <li> I got this as a cheap alternative to the other rechargeable toothbrushes that are on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am now looking to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one after three years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this new toothbrush  for about 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> They replaced them with new models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to get a new one soon rather than buy new replacements.</li>
            <li> The condition specified that the purchase was a new mower.</li>
            <li> the problem is that i live in Europe.</li>
            <li> i live in Europe</li>
            <li> it will work like new again.</li>
            <li> More like it vibrates- hard and fast.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;d be nice if the replacement heads came in soft, medium and hard), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> Have used these tooth brushes before this purchase however  they are no longer available where we use to purchase them only the more expensive ones and these work just fine and last for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the color of the picture (the picture is red, and it&#x27;s a light blue), but it&#x27;s probably the awesomest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve used on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery wise, brushing 2 minutes per go, two or three times a day, you&#x27;ll probably last at least a week between charges.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the operation of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but is very loud.  </li>
            <li> This model oral B rechargeable toothbrush is very loud /noisy when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Very loud toothbrush...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud - I almost don&#x27;t like to use it if my spouse is already asleep.</li>
            <li> ground fault circuited bathroom plug, placed the toothbrush into the charger overnight and tossed my 3 year old high quality Oral B Vitality Toothbrush away.</li>
            <li> It is very loud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is very loud.  </li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m here to confirm it is VERY loud.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased one for each one of my family members and they sent them all in the same color and it was not even in the beautiful red shown, rather a pale blue.</li>
            <li> better than the replaceable battery operated toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Overtime, no matter how long I kept it on the charger, it didn&#x27;t work at powerfully as the first time I brushed with it.</li>
            <li> I did not deduct a star for this, however, because my first brush of this model lasted TWO YEARS before it finally succumbed.</li>
            <li> I just set it up to recharge for the first time after using it daily for 2 1/2 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> ask 4 of these brushes, 1 of which was ruined the first day, pull away several dollars in purchases.</li>
            <li> The first one finally died so i replaced it again.</li>
            <li> litte difference in power from first to 2nd usage after charging&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product; have purchased it in the past.</li>
            <li> The first one finally pretty much wore out a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> our old ones wore out and it was time for new ones.</li>
            <li> This one is cheap yet looks like it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3d White action after I mis-ordered replacement heads for the dual clean and got 3d replacements (the brush head looks similar).</li>
            <li> They say it should last 12 days between charges, and today is the first time I&#x27;ve had any diminished action.</li>
            <li> It is noisier than my old Oral B like a very loud bee buzzing.</li>
            <li> front brush spins left and right, back brush rotates left and right.</li>
            <li> I noticed an obvious positive difference in using an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> Better then battery powered brushes, &#x27;cuz batteries are not cheap and go dead quickly.</li>
            <li> I look forward to my time in the morning and before bed when I can wake up or wind down and get a really clean feeling in the process.</li>
            <li> The charge last for a very longtime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw my old 12v battery powered brush in the trash.</li>
            <li> so much I keep the regular battery operated version in my camper, never have to worry about being &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; in.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews after my old toothbrush (cost way over $100) died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I read that it is loud but not to me - not as loud as that way over $100 one I had was.</li>
            <li> It is loud though, but who cares.</li>
            <li> for the cost, this is by far the one to give a try.</li>
            <li> It is alright except for the loud noise .</li>
            <li> It is loud as others have noted, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> power well through brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;Handle does not accommodate my old brushes from another power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> very,very,VERY loud, pricey replacement brushes</li>
            <li> The link to replacement bristles is : Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count&lt;</li>
            <li> :B003UBTYKI Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count]]</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really surprised me.</li>
            <li> that I find myself brushing 4 times a day, instead of the 2 times with the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But it does the job, and does it well, it just does it loudly.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads are not compatible with the Action line.  </li>
            <li> As loud as an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud as all get out</li>
            <li> onefor my mom and for my 3tr old son</li>
            <li> I do not care much for the 3rd dimension</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth well, but it is so loud that i&#x27;m going to have to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> The noise is so high-pitched and loud compared to my old oral-b vitality</li>
            <li> I purchased these Oral-B brushes (2) for my 19 teeth.and 17 year old children.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be nothing more than a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Works as good as expensive ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt; would recommend vendor to other to purchase their much needed items, i really like the service and the products that i have received.</li>
            <li> I have gum degeneration and these brushes clean without hurting or destroying the gums.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B rechargeable toothbrush-I had my first one for several years</li>
            <li> On a recent dental visit, the hygienist highly recommended electric toothbrushes over manual toothbrushes and tried to sell me one for $120.  </li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s worth it to buy new every few months.  </li>
            <li> The brush is small and light.</li>
            <li> For how cheap this electric toothbrush is, it definitely packs a punch and does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a cheap alternative to having a really expensive dentist grade electric toothbrush and I hit gold.</li>
            <li> I have long used electric tooth brushes as the really help with keeping my gums in shape.</li>
            <li> I had my last one for 2 years and it still worked until my new puppy chewed the cord.</li>
            <li> My old one still works, I just wanted one as a back up in case they completely disappeared.  </li>
            <li> One little nuisance I have is that before you can even attach a new brush head, there&#x27;s a tool you have to buy from oral-b to detach the first one.</li>
            <li> : the handle and single charger are much lighter than the Vitality.</li>
            <li> no other complaints.  </li>
            <li> AWSOME products quality is beyond repence there is not much more I can say about this product this day unique</li>
            <li> I actually felt like I had a professional dental cleaning!  </li>
            <li> I think this feels really cheap when I use it  and not strong enough on the teeth.</li>
            <li> Also the brush is larger (I prefer the smaller generally) but gave it a try and found the toothbrush head really gets the tartar away from the gum line and does wonder on the gums when lightly brushed over.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 13 year old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 3.5 year old Oral B, which the charge only lasted 5 or 6 days now.</li>
            <li> I did not get this oral b 3 D white action rechargeable toothbrush</li>
            <li> I actually dropped my old one or would have gotten about another year out of it.</li>
            <li> If you normally buy battery because of price this one will be cheaper in the long run because of battery savings.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my previous electric toothbrush, this new one is easier to hold (somewhat slim), holds a charge much longer, and the charging cradle is much smaller.  </li>
            <li> We had two older oral-B&#x27;s that were getting pretty tired, so we decided to go for new ones.</li>
            <li> It does his job, the only con is that it&#x27;s really loud and it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did, to remind you how long you&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> The little holes are a structural weakness that can lead to cracks, until finally the whole end just snaps off and you have to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Overall, great toothbrush, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anyone sleeping here, expect a cat, but it is loud enough to wake your entire house up.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads look fairly expensive but you know what they cost going in, so be it, that said I&#x27;m sure the replacement heads are profitable whereas the base/motor-driver is at or near the cost to manufacture in order to get you into the product and then use the replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It speeds up and slows down at certain intervals.</li>
            <li> In general, they last for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> The only cons that I can see so far are that the bottom is rounded so it cannot be set flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised nearly no one has said this in the opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the cost of most is crazy high.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the noise (different from other electrics I&#x27;ve had) or the vibration caused by the high speed oscillation.</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy on full charge, but less so the longer it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> i only used this once because by cybersonic toothbrush was broken &amp; then the movers brought my other cybersonic, which is so much better.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t consider it too loud, like other reviews.</li>
            <li> My family knows when I wake up in the morning due to my loud grounding oral B model I chosen.</li>
            <li> The other two brushes are sealed well and so far have been impervious to any water intrusion.</li>
            <li> I seen other reviews that takes about how loud the brush is...</li>
            <li> I bought it because the replacement heads for my previous battery-powered toothbrush were over twice the price of just buying a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and the head of the brush is not so big that it is difficult to brush and reach the back teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love it and the only thing bad is it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off after 2 min like me old one did.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a long time and is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> I am also prone to tartar on certain spots on my teeth that I have a hard time reaching with the manual toothbrush and this toothbrush definitely hit those hard-to-reach spots.  </li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s awful - more like the sound of a swarm of bees buzzing around in my head.</li>
            <li> After using this for less than a week I was completely sold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spent $120 total for manual toothbrushes in the entire 40 years I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> Uses non standard brush with limited availibilty.  </li>
            <li> Other brushes are more expensive.</li>
            <li> The torque on the round bristle head is much lower than my other two brushes.</li>
            <li> the replacement heads are different by the other ones but it is not a very big problem.</li>
            <li> A little loud when it vibrates</li>
            <li> off buttons difficult to locate (by feel) when brush in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Brush makes a sound like a swarm of bees.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles</li>
            <li> Sad that this is no longer available.</li>
            <li> Turns out the spinning brush head only spins when it&#x27;s not touching anything, like your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, no timer, and really loud and rackety</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it at first because I was use to my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> unbelievably long time between charges....</li>
            <li> It keeps charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does go a long time between charges, though, so I may just put the charger in the closet between times.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time, maybe too long.</li>
            <li> and still nothing.. a complete waste of money..</li>
            <li> also it stays charges a long time, close to a month.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The charge holds for a long time, around 10 days ...</li>
            <li> The brush head is bigger than I expected, but it does what it says.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts quite a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Hold charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> And unlike my old one, the base can&#x27;t be wall-mounted, so it takes up precious real estate on our small bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> We had previously used a much more expensive electric tooth brush and just one replacement head was $15.00.  </li>
            <li> I MEAN REALLY  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it is LOUD!</li>
            <li> If it dies and you forget to switch it back, it only charges a little bit.</li>
            <li> It also keeps a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush should last a few years with proper battery practice.</li>
            <li> Works very well, however I wish that the bristles were a little softer and not quite so stiff.  </li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist have both stated that my teeth looked really clean with very little plague especially way in the back and under my front teeth retainer wire which is especially difficult but easy with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Even slight pressure loads down the action.</li>
            <li> It is not fair that costs 15 dollars as much as the brush price.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the time and effort to send it back, so I didn&#x27;t bother contacting the sellerr.</li>
            <li> You move your toothbrush maybe 20 times up and down in one spot and the Oral-B hits the same area 200 times??</li>
            <li> It was a totally waist of money for me that i need to buy now a step down converter from 220volts to 110volts.</li>
            <li> Instead of a cheap electric toothbrush, this is a really expensive conventional one.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you would buy any of the more expensive brushes.  </li>
            <li> wish the heads were just a little smaller</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger that what I expected but it does the work.</li>
            <li> I am not really keeping track</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who is having trouble getting the motivation to get back out of bed when they forget to brush or is trying to motivate their kids to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Did not really like this.</li>
            <li> that I have some micro-grooves or rough areas that are just primed for retaining a stain.</li>
            <li> It works as expected based on the product description.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, but I only charge it over night every couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> It backs up into the charger and makes the bottom of the brush wet when you pick it up,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what to make of that, but at this price, I&#x27;m not really complaining, just highlighting something</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the charging station wet though.</li>
            <li> as I felt it should run with same power attract few times after every charge</li>
            <li> Her brush died a couple of months ago and we spent months looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that it isn&#x27;t as strong as the past ones I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> little slow in rotations after first round of usage</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal since the one we were replacing was a dark blue one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never completely died on me, but I notice it seems a little lackluster after about two weeks</li>
            <li> Only real complaint is that the photo shows a red tooth brush and a dark blue one was what we received.</li>
            <li> turn it on, shove it under a few pillows and half an hour later its still not depleted.</li>
            <li> The Oral B 3-D has been going for 3 weeks and only just starting to slow down!</li>
            <li> The other advantage is that the brush head is small, and fits in my mouth easier than the bigger ones.  </li>
            <li> I have no doubt that it would keep my teeth virtually stain-free with daily or multi-daily use, but I am too lazy, and it does buzz a bit</li>
            <li> A few people complained about the charge not lasting, but we have had our toothbrushes for 5 months now and have only had to fully charge them twice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about due.</li>
            <li> I would recommend other to purchase it too.</li>
            <li> look at the price it is cheaper than some of the replacement bristles for other rechargeable brushes...</li>
            <li> The other two have timers, though I knew going in; this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> other thing,</li>
            <li> the other 3 work well.</li>
            <li> When replacing our old electric toothbrush, I was deciding between two models and ultimately clicked on the wrong one (meant to get the one that runs on rechargeables).</li>
            <li> Again, one less electrical part to worry about getting wet.</li>
            <li> Depending on what kind of stains you have and how bad they are, it starts working as soon as you start using it!</li>
            <li> so I just have to brush them as if I was using a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, though a little roughly.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a lot less costly than the other brands I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> and i hav a slight cock teeth due to yrs(+still)</li>
            <li> and I got tired of replacing the batteries in his old one.  </li>
            <li> I had one just like it for years and it recently started to slow down and needed  replaced.</li>
            <li> This one has the rotating head paired with the up and down rectangular section below it.  </li>
            <li> Basically it sounds like it slows down sometimes</li>
            <li> however the instructions say to let it run down between charges.  </li>
            <li> for how it cleans my teeth, I might brush a little too hard or something, but occasionally it feels like it&#x27;s hurting my gums where they contact the teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a basic model of rechargeable toothbrush, no frills, very small footprint on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The brush is too erratic and unpredictable.</li>
            <li> My problem is that my front lower teeth slant slightly backwards</li>
            <li> it does not clean well between the teeth</li>
            <li> A LITTLE NOISY</li>
            <li> As little work as brushing your teeth is, for me, this takes it from a chore to being relaxing.</li>
            <li> He said it took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s not a hugely important factor, is that the rechargeable toothbrush does not have a battery cover to mess with, or a risk of getting water into the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> so I charge it for a few hours.</li>
            <li> No need to buy one of those expensive ones, this one works its &amp;#34;bleep&amp;#34; off and seems reliable so far.</li>
            <li> The power behind it hasn&#x27;t changed, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it one time since buying it.</li>
            <li> Remember kids, twice a day, everyday.</li>
            <li> Clunky and noisy thought I was getting round oral b round head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few years now</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> and it stays charged for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Like a million bees trapped in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to return them and the battery was starting to get a little weak on the Vitality</li>
            <li> so I figure it&#x27;s too late to return - not worth the shipping cost to return either.</li>
            <li> My previous electric toothbrush was rather thick and clunky, but this one is thinner and smoother and easier to hold.</li>
            <li> A little common sense would have helped here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes up very little counter space.</li>
            <li> A big warning - it is now difficult to find replacement heads as I think they are phasing out this model.</li>
            <li> I am past the return date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked a bit, but am not sure if they still make them.</li>
            <li> but it cleans just as well, if not better than the pricier brands.</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately that my teeth felt cleaner after use, compared to my past manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, but I think it uses wireless charging.</li>
            <li> but i can say that it is useless for me in the future.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit firmer than I usually like</li>
            <li> I usually get about 1 and a 1/2 hours of power from 1 charge.</li>
            <li> You could say a little ridiculous....</li>
            <li> But, the brush itself was hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find a rechargeable toothbrush for this price.</li>
            <li> I wish they were not so hard to get.</li>
            <li> but the Bristles are a bit hard... but</li>
            <li> The handle on the 3d is hard plastic</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like to use it late at night.</li>
            <li> but this tooth brush sucks...</li>
            <li> I saw results (just a shade or so lighter) within two days of use, brushing at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> The heads are much less expensive too.</li>
            <li> THOUGH IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> They sounded just like the drills that I hated so much.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to brush with a regular toothbrush and get any plaque or tartar buildup behind them at the gumline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery operated brushes for a few years and HATED trying to pry them open just to replace the batteries.  </li>
            <li> When the one I had started to get weak, I went on-line, read all the reviews and bought another one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just afraid of any battery memory retention issues shortening its life, and the manufacturer DOES recommend whittling the charge down once a month before charging.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I keep the toothbrush in the holder, and when I set it down after rinsing it off, the water and remains of the toothpaste that didn&#x27;t quite rinse off run down the brush and put an nasty green spot on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> but Im a little afraid to plug this in and leave it in after I know its charged (which you have to guess there is no indicator)</li>
            <li> Mine has already broken don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> it bent enuf to reach the behind of my cock out teeth(the ones infront) and between the gap where my teeth was taken out....</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be going back to that EXPENSIVE philips sonicare again!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah, the noise is a little annoying.  </li>
            <li> My wife has an expensive sonic tooth brush that she paid over $100.00 for.</li>
            <li> the problem is now i cant find the replacement heads #Fail</li>
            <li> but I know it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as a lot of power brushes..</li>
            <li> I dont think you will be sorry</li>
            <li> No buyers&#x27; remorse here; don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> But ordered wrong replaceable brushes.</li>
            <li> No boggy will use on expensive set.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 one failed to hold a charge after 2 months.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this brush because of the price.</li>
            <li> I had to get a soap dish and a thingy to raise it off the soap dish to keep from having a disgusting green goo underneath.  </li>
            <li> Pulling the brush head in and out when it needs to be changed is extremely awkward and finneky.</li>
            <li> BRUSH VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE</li>
            <li> Since Oral-B discontinued them that has been impossible.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s turned on, it does make a lot of noise, but it isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad inside your mouth, just remember to turn it off before you remove it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I am really disappointed with its performance.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed Braun discontinued it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes an awful racket.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> the prices on these is the store is terrible.</li>

            <li> The charge makes it possible to travel for up to 2 weeks without taking the charger.  Bristles seem to do an excellent cleaning job.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for years, and it was working great.  Until one day it kind of stopped working, and I can&#x27;t find this anywhere!  So glad to see they have the rechargeable model on Amazon!  For a electric toothbrush, this is the right price point for me.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by the operation of this toothbrush.  You can&#x27;t beat the price for the value of this item.  I actually brush my teeth more often now.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The brush is too erratic and unpredictable. It speeds up and slows down at certain intervals. It leaves the gums feeling bruised.</li>
            <li> The charge last for a very longtime.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;It more than meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than the replaceable battery operated toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price.  I have been using these for about 5 years.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd toothbrush as the top of the handle unit breaks since I&#x27;m a masher.  I&#x27;m now trying to brush lightly.  My dentist and hygienist have both stated that my teeth looked really clean with very little plague especially way in the back and under my front teeth retainer wire which is especially difficult but easy with an electric toothbrush.  Rechargeable batteries saves a lot of money as standard alkaline batteries do not last 2 weeks. A big warning - it is now difficult to find replacement heads as I think they are phasing out this model.</li>
            <li> My children and I love these electric brushes!!  We have been using this style of toothbrush for over 10 years.  The replacement heads are very reasonable in price, and easy to find.  But, the brush itself was hard to find.  I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  Will NEVER go back to regular toothbrushes!!!</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush, good power. Worth it if you want a powered toothbrush, but don&#x27;t want to spend a $100.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this for a couple of months when I noticed my gums getting sore.  Turns out the spinning brush head only spins when it&#x27;s not touching anything, like your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, no timer, and really loud and rackety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the pro side, it keeps its charge really well; the original charge outlasted the brush head.</li>
            <li> unbelievably long time between charges.... I am not really keeping track but I would have to guess several months...</li>
            <li> Took a while to ship, but works just fine!  Nice cheap electric toothbrush alternative.</li>
            <li> Works very well, however I wish that the bristles were a little softer and not quite so stiff.  Very powerful.  It&#x27;s nice not needing batteries in my toothbrush.  My dentist says my teeth look great.  I get much better results with this than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> good cleaning for my teeth</li>
            <li> Holds Charge for a while and cleans good!</li>
            <li> Great taste for a low carb snack that keeps the sugar cravings away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this three times. The first one wore out after three years. My son used the second one to clean his Halo action figure (chucked that one immediately lol). I&#x27;ve purchased them at Amazon and at your friendly ginormous chain store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes up very little counter space. It&#x27;s never completely died on me, but I notice it seems a little lackluster after about two weeks so I charge it for a few hours. I love that I don&#x27;t need to leave it plugged in all of the time, because I have virtually no counter space.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  It does a real good job.</li>
            <li> i only used this once because by cybersonic toothbrush was broken &amp; then the movers brought my other cybersonic, which is so much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because he likes power toothbrushes and I got tired of replacing the batteries in his old one.  He got it for Christmas and so far it works great.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a good battery life off of the charger.  I just wish the bristles were more durable.</li>
            <li> Really like this would reorder the item again!</li>
            <li> Once it was discharged it did not get charged ever again. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think this feels really cheap when I use it  and not strong enough on the teeth. Its better to spend a little more and buy something of a better quality. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this toothbrush, the charge holds for a long time and it actually came charged so I did not have to wait to use it.  It is easy to hold and the head of the brush is not so big that it is difficult to brush and reach the back teeth.  The only cons that I can see so far are that the bottom is rounded so it cannot be set flat.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Could not stand some of the electric toothbrushes that I tried.  They sounded just like the drills that I hated so much.  This toothbrush does a great job.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and after charging the battery it works exactly as I knew it would.</li>
            <li> I found this toothbrush to be nothing more than a total waste of my money. After a month this piece of junk stop working,it just would not charge.</li>
            <li> My wife has an expensive sonic tooth brush that she paid over $100.00 for. I believe this brush works every bit as well for under $20.00! This is my 2nd one, the 1st lasted many many years it out lasted 2 of my wife&#x27;s sonic brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first I had one just the same before , but this one when I got it I found out it only works at 110v so take care , u will need an adapter</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works okay but is very loud.  I don&#x27;t have anyone sleeping here, expect a cat, but it is loud enough to wake your entire house up.</li>
            <li> i love this product. the problem is now i cant find the replacement heads #Fail</li>
            <li> I have used the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes for years.  I think they are the best for gum problems.  The toothbrush massages the gums and in my case actually improved my pockets in my gums.  I also feel like this toothbrush really leaves my teeth feeling clean and I like to use it, so therefore I brush longer than with another type.  The other advantage is that the brush head is small, and fits in my mouth easier than the bigger ones.  I ordered this online and amazon had it to her in 2 days.  Prime rocks. My sister says she likes the toothbrush too.</li>
            <li> Works great ease to charge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember what I paid for this product but I know it wasn&#x27;t as expensive as a lot of power brushes..I threw my old 12v battery powered brush in the trash. How nice</li>
            <li> It works fairly well but should have a more powerful smooth sounding rotoation on toothbrush. This model oral B rechargeable toothbrush is very loud /noisy when it&#x27;s on. My family knows when I wake up in the morning due to my loud grounding oral B model I chosen.</li>
            <li> Works great,  Holds a charge very well.  Does a great job on massaging my gums.  I would recommend this tooth brush for anyone.</li>
            <li> Super nice product at a very reasonable price. Will buy from them again</li>
            <li> EASR OF USE FEEL SO GOOD ON GUMS AND TEETH.  A LITTLE NOISY BUT STILL LIKE IT A LOT.  RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper option than your usual electric tooth brush, and works much better than the battery operated brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush, a little on the noisy side, but it cleans your teeth very well. It keeps charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does a good job but it&#x27;s VERY noisy. Sounds like the dentist drill so it took some getting used to...</li>
            <li> Very loud toothbrush...no other complaints.  Does it&#x27;s job.  I had a good Oral B one from years ago but just can&#x27;t find the replacement heads anymore so I had no choice but to upgrade.  This one has a much thicker handle and is much louder but it does it&#x27;s job and brushes my teeth.  It&#x27;s not anything special and for a battery powered toothbrush it could be a lot more powerful, but it is cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for many years.  In general, they last for about 3 years.  I do get the replacement heads about once a year, but even with those the whole thing is worn out after about 3 years.  I like them so much I keep the regular battery operated version in my camper, never have to worry about being &amp;#34;plugged&amp;#34; in.</li>
            <li> My children like it very much. It whitens and cleans their teeth. And you don&#x27;t worry to replace battery because it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best toothbrush with a great charger. When you put that in the charger and let it be charged for 12 hours, you can use it for more than a month with a normal usage. I love this Oral-B product. Besides, you pay like $17 for this and it works like $50 stuff for you.</li>
            <li> So I got this rechargeable oral b toothbrush and have charged for 16 hrs. But it does not show it is charged. When I press the on button, it works for 10 seconds and it&#x27;s gone again. What must I do?</li>
            <li> We have been using Oral-B products for many years.  Recently we needed to replace our old units and these were perfect.</li>
            <li> It was meant for my mother And she cannot press the button because of her arthritis... so the item turned out abandoned.</li>
            <li> Buy it and don&#x27;t regret! Power, battery lasts about 2 weeks once charged and works very well. I am very happy about it.</li>
            <li> Good basic electric toothbrush. I had one just like it for years and it recently started to slow down and needed  replaced. Good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> over all it is not a bad buy&lt;br /&gt;this is a good choice for people trying electric brush for the first time</li>
            <li> My wife lost her last rechargeable tooth brush and i was looking for something inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;This product is the best for the Price.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it</li>
            <li> It is super loud, but it&#x27;s never bothered me. The little charging dock is nice. It hasn&#x27;t ever died on me and hte longest I&#x27;ve gone without charging is 4 days.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews after my old toothbrush (cost way over $100) died after 2 years. I read that it is loud but not to me - not as loud as that way over $100 one I had was. And the bonus is - this gets your teeth cleaner! Also the brush is larger (I prefer the smaller generally) but gave it a try and found the toothbrush head really gets the tartar away from the gum line and does wonder on the gums when lightly brushed over. I am sold on this one. I think people should try it. at the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I won&#x27;t be going back to that EXPENSIVE philips sonicare again!!!</li>
            <li> I would like the brush to be slightly softer but all in all, a good product. Particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> g/f new to power brush &amp; really likes it.pleased with design,performance,rechargeable. makes tooth care easy &amp; fun again. no batt&#x27;s to buy.</li>
            <li> Works ok but we like the rotating head.  I&#x27;ve used the rotating type for years and find that it gives the best, clean feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used. The toothbrush should last a few years with proper battery practice. The replacement heads snap into place in a matter of seconds and are of high quality. I highly recommend buying one for everyone in the house.</li>
            <li> it is a great toothbrush and lasts forever on a single charge.  I am thankful that i am not wasting batteries.</li>
            <li> Perfect works great and have no complaints at all about this product, I recommend it without doubt the best buy for your peace of original replacements as they are good quality</li>
            <li> AWSOME products quality is beyond repence there is not much more I can say about this product this day unique</li>
            <li> Great product. Rechargeable is the way to go. Shipping was fast. Had one prior that lasted about 5 years with no issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush!!  What would you really expect? It&#x27;s  a nice electric toothbrush. That&#x27;s all I have to say. It does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised nearly no one has said this in the opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned an electric toothbrushes already but I moved overseas and I couldn&#x27;t bring it with me. I decided to buy this one cause I had a low budget and I am really disappointed with its performance. It &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; around 10 degrees and when you place it over your teeth the brisks seem to stop spinning and just vibrate. It doesn&#x27;t help at all to the cleaning of the teeth so I just have to brush them as if I was using a conventional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking to buy a new one. Instead of a cheap electric toothbrush, this is a really expensive conventional one.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a rechargeable toothbrush for this price. In Europe it&#x27;s quite easier! It does his job, the only con is that it&#x27;s really loud and it doesn&#x27;t beep every 30 seconds like my old one did, to remind you how long you&#x27;ve been using it (they recommend to use it for not longer than 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> No need to buy one of those expensive ones, this one works its &amp;#34;bleep&amp;#34; off and seems reliable so far. It is loud though, but who cares.</li>
            <li> for the price this is the best oral-B electric tooth brush I owned and I have worn out many of them. operation is quite, smooth and the dual action is both fast and efficient. for the cost, this is by far the one to give a try. I dont think you will be sorry</li>
            <li> As little work as brushing your teeth is, for me, this takes it from a chore to being relaxing. I look forward to my time in the morning and before bed when I can wake up or wind down and get a really clean feeling in the process. I&#x27;ve only had it a short time but I can see myself using this one for awhile to come. I would recommend this for anyone who is having trouble getting the motivation to get back out of bed when they forget to brush or is trying to motivate their kids to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for several years.  When the one I had started to get weak, I went on-line, read all the reviews and bought another one.  This works great, is lightweight and does the job.</li>
            <li> When replacing our old electric toothbrush, I was deciding between two models and ultimately clicked on the wrong one (meant to get the one that runs on rechargeables). This one&#x27;s fine, gets the job done. But three things I don&#x27;t like and almost gave two stars for: It&#x27;s very loud - I almost don&#x27;t like to use it if my spouse is already asleep. It&#x27;s the drippiest toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned. And unlike my old one, the base can&#x27;t be wall-mounted, so it takes up precious real estate on our small bathroom counter. It does go a long time between charges, though, so I may just put the charger in the closet between times.</li>
            <li> I actually love this toothbrush. I was skeptical about it at first because I was use to my old toothbrush. The power behind it hasn&#x27;t changed, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it one time since buying it. Nice toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> meets my expectations, much more economical than units found in local stores.  front brush spins left and right, back brush rotates left and right.</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. After opening the well packaged item I promptly plugged the charger into&lt;br /&gt;my ground fault circuited bathroom plug, placed the toothbrush into the charger overnight and tossed my 3 year old high quality Oral B Vitality Toothbrush away. In the morning I loaded up this (&amp;#34;AWESOME DEAL.... NOT!&amp;#34;) very noisy toothbrush with paste, turned it on and brushed for literally 30 seconds when it quit. Pushed the buttons with no response. Placed it back in the charger to see if it possibly needed a longer charge where as later I officially proclaimed it &amp;#34;JUNK&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This brush worked just 1 minute and never again&lt;br /&gt;The battery is not recharged enough to work&lt;br /&gt;I did not returned the product because I had already thrown out the packaging</li>
            <li> You get what you see.  It&#x27;s well worth the money and gets my teeth exceptionally clean!</li>
            <li> Did not really like this.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and it works as promised. It will operate days without recharging. Other brushes are more expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I really liked my expectation filled the qualify because everything arrived as requested I really I liked all the pretty enough to recommend to all the community through Amazon not change.&lt;br /&gt; would recommend vendor to other to purchase their much needed items, i really like the service and the products that i have received.</li>
            <li> REALLY NOISY. I MEAN REALLY  NOISY BUT DOES THE JOB OR SAYS MY DAUGHTER&lt;br /&gt;WHOM I PAWNED IT OFF TO</li>
            <li> great toothbrush my husband love it :-)</li>
            <li> Works great. Charge lasts a long time, maybe too long. I like to charge my stuff when the battery is actually depleted, but it takes forever! I get to where I feel and hear that it&#x27;s runnin at about 33% power and I take it in my room, turn it on, shove it under a few pillows and half an hour later its still not depleted. You could say a little ridiculous....I&#x27;m just afraid of any battery memory retention issues shortening its life, and the manufacturer DOES recommend whittling the charge down once a month before charging.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, the product. Spin motion works good, though it is a limited spin and NOT a full circle spin. More like it vibrates- hard and fast. Kind of a joke after using this and then picking up a normal toothbrush and you think you&#x27;re being thorough. You move your toothbrush maybe 20 times up and down in one spot and the Oral-B hits the same area 200 times?? I like to eat chocolate, and my teeth have been scraped so many times by the dentist that I have some micro-grooves or rough areas that are just primed for retaining a stain. If I eat chocolate at work, and I like to make my chocolate last, then I know I am gonna be scraping when I get home. I could not believe how much stain this Oral-B took off my teeth on the FIRST USE. I have no doubt that it would keep my teeth virtually stain-free with daily or multi-daily use, but I am too lazy, and it does buzz a bit so I don&#x27;t like to use it late at night. OH, and to keep any residual water from possibly getting into the innards and messing anything up, I have found a way to store my Oral-B at an angle pointing downward right after use.</li>
            <li> im not one to write reviews. but this tooth brush sucks... I bought it. used it once, and died midway through brushing the first Time.. I let it &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; although you cant even tell if its charging or not. came home 8 hours later. and still nothing.. a complete waste of money..</li>
            <li> IT DOES THE JOB. IT IS VERY NOISY. HOWEVER, MY TEETH ARE CLEAN &amp; MY MOUTH FEELS CLEAN. OVERALL IT WAS A GOOD BUY, BUT IT IS TOO NOISY.</li>
            <li> A high quality, fairly priced electric toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank and values dental hygiene. Remember kids, twice a day, everyday.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes an awful racket. I bought it for my 14 year old and he said he was ok with it. However, after the first use, the reciprocating head (the top head doesn&#x27;t spin all the way around, it &amp;#34;spins&amp;#34; partially back and forth) stopped working. I removed and re reinstalled the head and it worked briefly and stopped again. Very dissatisfied with this purchase. We have another low cost Oral-B that has worked perfectly for a long time. I wanted to buy that one but it is unavailable.</li>
            <li> Had this brush for awhile and I have no complaints.  I charge it once every two weeks, which is nice</li>
            <li> Nice product. My family has used these for years.</li>
            <li> It did not work - could not be recharged. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them, I received two different colors, then I will not make mistake with my husband, they looked great and useful.</li>
            <li> I ordered  this item and just recently used it. Well,it worked for about 10 seconds, then I tried charging it to no avail. I am past the return date so I am stuck with a non-functional toothbrush. I expected more from Oral B! My mistake was ordering in advance of use.</li>
            <li> It is alright except for the loud noise . The brush head is really large in size but may work alright for adults use.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not on par with a nicer sonic toothbrush, but how could it be when it&#x27;s under $15? It gets the job done, though a little roughly.</li>
            <li> I am really pleasantly surprised by the quality of this toothbrush and how clean my teeth feel when I brush them.  Excellent product, excellent price.</li>
            <li> This is a great, affordable electric toothbrush. Leaves my teeth smooth and clean. I bought a new one after three years. The old one&#x27;s battery is just fine, but the metal nub in the head of the brush wore flat so it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as it used to. But after three years, it&#x27;s well worth the $17.</li>
            <li> Good, but does not hold battery for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery operated brushes for a few years and HATED trying to pry them open just to replace the batteries.  I love this brush due to its recharging capability - always a full charge to get the teeth and gums clean!</li>
            <li> Battery only lasted 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Good value plus product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Does the work and its ok to use especially considering the money you paid. But it is too noisy and feels cheap.</li>
            <li> This has been a great help for me and my family as I have a disabled son who has trouble getting all of his teeth clean.  Great Brush.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush. It works as expected based on the product description. I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a set of these toothbrushes for several years and the finally wore out.  These replacements work just as well.  I wish they were not so hard to get.</li>
            <li> This is really great.  Everybody needs one.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was looking for. it works great and does an excellent job of cleaning. also it stays charges a long time, close to a month. i have not had to change the replaceable heads but it&#x27;s a very simple process too. i&#x27;m VERY glad i bought this one rather than one that needs batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 13 year old Oral B electric toothbrush that finally died.  What a difference 13 years make.  I&#x27;ve had this new toothbrush  for about 3 months now.  Compared to my previous electric toothbrush, this new one is easier to hold (somewhat slim), holds a charge much longer, and the charging cradle is much smaller.  I think my teeth look cleaner after brushing with it.  Yeah, the noise is a little annoying.  But, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s awful - more like the sound of a swarm of bees buzzing around in my head.</li>
            <li> Returning again! First one worked for a week and wouldnt charge. Second one worked for a day and wouldnt charge. Save yourself the headache.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush because my husband genetically has a lot of tartar build up and it was suggested that he try a high powered mechanical toothbrush to keep the build up under control between dental cleanings. This works perfect! His teeth have never been this clean in between dentist appointments! A few people complained about the charge not lasting, but we have had our toothbrushes for 5 months now and have only had to fully charge them twice. Overall, great toothbrush, nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Just like the original ones I bought long ago.  Couldn&#x27;t find them at my local store any more.  They replaced them with new models. My old one still works, I just wanted one as a back up in case they completely disappeared.  This one has the rotating head paired with the up and down rectangular section below it.  The newer models just had the rotating head.  Really like this one and the price is much better than the newer models. At this price you can buy one for every member of the family. The charge lasts a long time.  I use it everyday, but I only charge it over night every couple of weeks.  The replacement heads are easy to put on when the bristles wear out.  Buy some of those at the same time.</li>
            <li> I charged it once and it lasted for 2 weeks. Then one day it stopped working and I recharged it, but it never works ever since!! Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> It is awesome for the price but Im a little afraid to plug this in and leave it in after I know its charged (which you have to guess there is no indicator) it gets hot so I plug it in for a day and let it run till it dies still awesome for the price and its wireless charging no wires or contacts to worry about getting broken</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Cannot say enough about this ... it works beautifully (my last checkup, had almost NO plaque since using this toothbrush.  The charge holds for a long time, around 10 days ... just put it in holder overnight and it is ready in the morning.    The quality is great, replacement heads by Oral B are very reasonable and last around 3 months each ... what more can I say?  Is as good as the much more expensive models and the point is it does the job ... dental check up to prove it ... no cavities and almost no plaque.  Every time I brush, I feel like I just got a profressional cleaning at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The brush is small and light. The brush does a nice job and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush.  It is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase largely for the rechargable feature. I wanted a sonic cleaner, but didn&#x27;t want the price tag that came with it. No buyers&#x27; remorse here; don&#x27;t get me wrong. This is a solid product and it works well. It is loud as others have noted, but not a deal breaker. What concerns me is finding replacement heads...I&#x27;ve looked a bit, but am not sure if they still make them. I may have to go a different route if I can&#x27;t find replacements...it&#x27;s about due.</li>
            <li> Perfect, works great!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great brush with cheaper brushheads!  wish the heads were just a little smaller but it cleans just as well, if not better than the pricier brands.</li>
            <li> very good value for the money, but they sound like a toy. They work fine and my daughter is happy with them.</li>
            <li> I really like the toothbrush, but it has a lot of holes in it and when trying to keep your mouth shut to keep toothpaste and whatnot in while brushing, the holes leak and you drip everywhere.. but over the sink, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I received this as a birthday gift about 2 weeks ago and have been using it ever since.  I could tell immediately that my teeth felt cleaner after use, compared to my past manual toothbrush.  You will notice the difference and I really like that.  The on/off buttons could be a little easier to use, but they are certainly OK just as they are.  If they were easier to use you might bump them during use, switching the unit off accidentally, I don&#x27;t know, but they&#x27;re easy enough as is so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  The replacement heads look fairly expensive but you know what they cost going in, so be it, that said I&#x27;m sure the replacement heads are profitable whereas the base/motor-driver is at or near the cost to manufacture in order to get you into the product and then use the replacement heads.  That doesn&#x27;t bother me though because this is a pretty darn good product at a reasonable price, and that electric toothbrush clean for your smile and dental health are well worth it. I&#x27;ve decided to get my best friend one, she said she has heard of them but never owned one, so she will soon be surprised by this gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive. Includes one replaceable brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy, strong rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;When rinse off brush, extra water easily drains through holder/charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On/off buttons difficult to locate (by feel) when brush in mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Brush makes a sound like a swarm of bees.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles may irritate receding gums. this may be good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Holds power well through brushing session.&lt;br /&gt;Handle does not accommodate my old brushes from another power toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Its Good. It works. I wish there was a timer. But it is noisy.... I hope it cleans my teeth more than manual tooth brush. As of now, its good. I would recommend other to purchase it too.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush this is my second one replacement brushes price just right</li>
            <li> very,very,VERY loud, pricey replacement brushes</li>
            <li> Uses non standard brush with limited availibilty.  Bought it to replace our oral b rechargable.  Dissapointed in the product</li>
            <li> This toothbrush makes my teeth feel so clean after use!! it&#x27;s amazing! at this price, it&#x27;s unbeatable. only three cons I&#x27;ve come up with: color, power, and detachable brush. I ordered this thinking I&#x27;d get a maroon colored toothbrush in the picture. I instead got a light blue colored one. Not that it bothers me, but I thought it was worth a mention. In regards to power, I unboxed it and didn&#x27;t work right off the bat, had to charge it first. Overtime, no matter how long I kept it on the charger, it didn&#x27;t work at powerfully as the first time I brushed with it. One little nuisance I have is that before you can even attach a new brush head, there&#x27;s a tool you have to buy from oral-b to detach the first one. why they didn&#x27;t include one in this package is beyond me. however, overall, this is an AMAZING toothbrush at an unbeatable price. I highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both had this toothbrush for many years, and when hers stopped working, I went on the search for an exact replacement. Couldn&#x27;t find it in any local stores, but of course Amazon came to the rescue. Works great just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable brush in itself is awesome but the Bristles are a bit hard... but look at the price it is cheaper than some of the replacement bristles for other rechargeable brushes... I loved it and will recommend it... hope the replacement bristles are better than the original.... One full charge of 2 hours approx is enough for a week (14 usages).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 04/15/2013: I found a replacement bristles and now the set is 5 star unit. It is safe and really good, I recommend if you buy this also buy the replacement bristles as you will need it just after a month or 2. The link to replacement bristles is : Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003UBTYKI Oral-B Action Power Soft Replacement Brush Head, 2-Count]]</li>
            <li> does a good job as advertised. good buy for the price. will recommend to my friends. Loooks and feels OK</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really surprised me. It has a slightly cheap feel to it and is rather loud. The kicker is, my teeth have never felt this clean. I just switched from an Oral B Vitality. The heads are much less expensive too. The battery lasts much longer than the Vitality. I find myself tossing it in my work bag and brushing there. I like how clean my teeth feel so much, that I find myself brushing 4 times a day, instead of the 2 times with the old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my oldest son and after talking with him about it. He really loves the toothbrush so I am going on his recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Oral B rechargeable. I own a Professional Care and a Vitality dual clean. I purchased the 3d White action after I mis-ordered replacement heads for the dual clean and got 3d replacements (the brush head looks similar). I was too lazy to return them and the battery was starting to get a little weak on the Vitality so, I ordered the 3d with the intent of replacing it. Observations: the handle and single charger are much lighter than the Vitality. I preferred the Vitality to the Professional Care as my teeth/mouth felt much cleaner. Though the brush head is similar on the 3d, the performance leaves a lot to be desired. It &amp;#34;buzzes&amp;#34; and vibrates more than it spins/reciprocates. The torque on the round bristle head is much lower than my other two brushes. Even slight pressure loads down the action. The other two brushes are sealed well and so far have been impervious to any water intrusion. The handle on the 3d is hard plastic and there is a gap between some of the handle components. I&#x27;m not too optimistic about it&#x27;s sea worthiness. The other two have timers, though I knew going in; this one didn&#x27;t. My children have had throw-a-way spin brushes that performed better. My Vitality only cost $1 more than this when it was new 2 years ago. This brush isn&#x27;t in the same class and I am disappointed Braun discontinued it. I&#x27;m overseas and don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning. It is just slightly better than a non powered brush. I will use it for traveling and keep it until I wear out all the replacement heads. I will resurrect the Vitality by replacing the battery and procuring the proper replacement heads. 2 Stars is generous........</li>
            <li> Do not like it at all. The head is to big and bulky. Very hard to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> i have used this brand for years. our old ones wore out and it was time for new ones. the prices on these is the store is terrible. great value and love the product.</li>
            <li> Teeth get cleaned, batteries easy to change, but wow is it loud.  Not something I can do discretely while my wife sleeps.  But it does the job, and does it well, it just does it loudly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he uses it daily. He said it took a little getting used to but it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 3.5 year old Oral B, which the charge only lasted 5 or 6 days now. The Oral B 3-D has been going for 3 weeks and only just starting to slow down! It is noisier than my old Oral B like a very loud bee buzzing. I can&#x27;t say it does any better at cleaning my teeth as my old one, both do a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the first one, which I had for three years. The battery didn&#x27;t wear out, the plastic on the switch did. I never had any problem with the first one, and so why not get another?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a basic model of rechargeable toothbrush, no frills, very small footprint on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have one of these and we both love them !  We had previously used a much more expensive electric tooth brush and just one replacement head was $15.00.  This toothbrush takes a replacement head that comes 2/pkg for 6 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself works great and we have absolutely no complaints.  We had purchased one about 3 or 4 years ago and shared the use of it until we purchased a second one so we&#x27;d each have our own about 18 months ago.  The first one finally pretty much wore out a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured the one we purchased 3 or 4 years ago (used 3.5 years for my calculation), gave us 3,960 brushings before finally failing. Actually it still kind of works, but doesn&#x27;t really spin the brushes fast enough to be very effective for brushing.  For a $16 dollar item.....in my opinion, that&#x27;s very good performance.</li>
            <li> Clunky and noisy thought I was getting round oral b round head.  Would not order this model again. Joan williams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few years now and I don&#x27;t think I would change back to a manual brush because your teeth feel cleaner with electric or battery powered brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the color of the picture (the picture is red, and it&#x27;s a light blue), but it&#x27;s probably the awesomest electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve used on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, you can spend hundreds for top-knotch brushes that polish your shoes and do your laundry or whatever it is they do, but at the heart of it, they&#x27;re probably not going to do much more for your teeth than this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery wise, brushing 2 minutes per go, two or three times a day, you&#x27;ll probably last at least a week between charges. I admit that I haven&#x27;t tried to push its longevity because it&#x27;s so easy to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, ONE CON is that it can break right where the replacement brush heads pop in. The little holes are a structural weakness that can lead to cracks, until finally the whole end just snaps off and you have to get a new one. I did not deduct a star for this, however, because my first brush of this model lasted TWO YEARS before it finally succumbed. Even after it starts cracking, you can probably squeeze another month or two out of it before it breaks.</li>
            <li> IT IS A GREAT TOOTHBRUSH, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR GUMS HEALTHY, AND THE DENTIST AWAY.  THOUGH IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> BRUSH VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REPLACE/REMOVE.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Holds it&#x27;s charge for days. Works great!</li>
            <li> Mine has already broken don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> exactly as described -- works well</li>
            <li> Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is not the pro series of oral-b electric toothbrushes.  The toothbrush heads are not compatible with the Action line.  The price looks too good to be true... which for me it was.  It is very loud.  As loud as an electric shaver.  I am used to/ spoiled by the relative quiet of the more expensive Oral-Bs, so despite the rock bottom price, I had to return 2 of these.</li>
            <li> gift for granddaughter and she has seemed to enjoy using it...</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first was amazing, but the motor conked out after six months. I took a chance on a second one, and it was worth it. I just set it up to recharge for the first time after using it daily for 2 1/2 MONTHS. They say it should last 12 days between charges, and today is the first time I&#x27;ve had any diminished action. My conclusion is that the 6-month one (which did need charged more often from the start) was a defect.  Even so, it was good enough for the first 5 months that it was worth it to buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I will say that it leaves my teeth cleaner than I ever knew my teeth could get. It&#x27;s better for my gums, and I can use it to clean around dental work much more thoroughly and with less damage than with an ordinary scrubber toothbrush. Even if I had to replace it every 6 months it would be worth it for the health benefits of having truly clean teeth. But this one is doing way, way better than that. And it&#x27;s a lot less costly than the other brands I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, though it&#x27;s not a hugely important factor, is that the rechargeable toothbrush does not have a battery cover to mess with, or a risk of getting water into the battery compartment.There are no visible charging terminals. I am not sure, but I think it uses wireless charging. Again, one less electrical part to worry about getting wet.</li>
            <li> I keep the toothbrush in the holder, and when I set it down after rinsing it off, the water and remains of the toothpaste that didn&#x27;t quite rinse off run down the brush and put an nasty green spot on the counter.  I had to get a soap dish and a thingy to raise it off the soap dish to keep from having a disgusting green goo underneath.  It backs up into the charger and makes the bottom of the brush wet when you pick it up, eeewww.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it cleans my teeth, I might brush a little too hard or something, but occasionally it feels like it&#x27;s hurting my gums where they contact the teeth.  Well, I maybe need to replace the head or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works okay to brush my teeth, but it&#x27;s always pretty gross to pick up.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year (gone through 4 replacement heads,) I&#x27;m probably going to get a new one soon rather than buy new replacements.</li>
            <li> This product gets mandatory five stars because of the way the head and handle are shaped.&lt;br /&gt;The vibrating brush takes some getting used to, but I feel it cleans my teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;Surely intended only for healthy hygienic oral care practices.</li>
            <li> This was also a mistaken order and has been resolved to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> ask 4 of these brushes, 1 of which was ruined the first day, pull away several dollars in purchases. the other 3 work well.</li>
            <li> Not like the Vitality, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> this is a good buy for a good quality product</li>
            <li> Great quality for the money. I had my last one for 2 years and it still worked until my new puppy chewed the cord. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Noisy but the price is right and it cleans your teeth.  May clean better than the Braun Oral-b it replaced at a much better price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud as all get out but it gets the job done. I like my older (more expensive) model better.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recharge. a waste of money</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger that what I expected but it does the work. when I need to buy another one I&#x27;ll make sure I pick the size I really want</li>
            <li> Was better than I expacted. Much better than the old one I bought qver 10 years ago. Couldn&#x27;t figure out where to buy the replacement brush attachnment, will continue searching.</li>
            <li> Battery only good for about 6-8 months</li>
            <li> I like that it came with a plastic guard. It also keeps a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for many years now.  After about a couple of months it loses its strength and the bristles won&#x27;t vibrate effectively.  I just buy a whole new one.  I&#x27;ve never tried just replacing the head, I think it&#x27;s worth it to buy new every few months.  Otherwise, makes me feel good about using it compared to a mechanical toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good Morning, I am writing because I want to receive a refund. The product I received is used and does not work. The condition specified that the purchase was a new mower.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner from a home cleaning. Recommend to anyone. Great value for the price. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I was so happy that my boyfriend loved this toothbrush i gave him! it was worth the price</li>
            <li> is really good toothbrush for a cheap price..i am so happy with it an its really good with the whitenning results.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel SO CLEAN using this toothbrush. and it stays charged for a few weeks. i&#x27;m so glad i bought this.</li>
            <li> the way the product work for the moment it is okay. but i can say that it is useless for me in the future. the problem is that i live in Europe. now im soldier overseas and in the descriptions was not written that it works ONLY ON 110 VOLTS for recharging. the replacement heads are different by the other ones but it is not a very big problem. It was a totally waist of money for me that i need to buy now a step down converter from 220volts to 110volts. It is not fair that costs 15 dollars as much as the brush price. i read again the description but didn&#x27;t appeared that charging works only at 110volts. yes i saw on the product&#x27;s bottom but not in the description before i buy. i live in Europe so i have now a brush that i cannon recharge it...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in quite some time and was really excited to receive this one. My only disappointment is that it isn&#x27;t as strong as the past ones I&#x27;ve owned. Could definitely use more power but other than that works just fine.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the size of the head, you will really like the rotating brush feature. It really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> My third set! I love this unit as I believe that it cleans my teeth thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is quite different from the previous Oral-B electric toothbrush I used, but it&#x27;s good I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel very clean and replacement heads are $6 a pair at walmart so I think this is an excellent value product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as my last model, I think. I believe this because when it&#x27;s brushing the motor seems to become slower or louder at times when there&#x27;s more or less resistance. Does that make sense? Basically it sounds like it slows down sometimes and I don&#x27;t know what to make of that, but at this price, I&#x27;m not really complaining, just highlighting something I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, prompt delivery from Amazon and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Ok so i hav been using this for like two days now...yes i know it isnt much of a time frame to write a review on.....but....i hav like four wisdom tooth that only a 25% has pushed out frm the gym and i hav taken out a back tooth(the big one a molar i tink) and i hav a slight cock teeth due to yrs(+still) sucking finger.this bristles got all on the wisdom tooth and cleaned the plawue off cuz normal tbrush wasnt reaching at all) it bent enuf to reach the behind of my cock out teeth(the ones infront) and between the gap where my teeth was taken out....it is awesome i will keep using it .....after use ur mouth feels lije u went to the dentist...well of course there isnt actual flouride being used....but yes u shud yey one i already hav two in my cart onefor my mom and for my 3tr old son dunno how he will take it he runs fr the vibrating noise</li>
            <li> If there is a way to post 0 stars, I would. This only lasted me 2 days, and when I recharged it, it never came back on. It did not work at all. Defective product.</li>
            <li> Charged it over night and didnt have to charge it again for days! MY teeth look amazing now too</li>
            <li> fast shipping . item as stated</li>
            <li> For how cheap this electric toothbrush is, it definitely packs a punch and does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for a cheap alternative to having a really expensive dentist grade electric toothbrush and I hit gold. My problem is that my front lower teeth slant slightly backwards and it&#x27;s almost impossible to brush with a regular toothbrush and get any plaque or tartar buildup behind them at the gumline. This was my saving grace and has helped to get some of the gunk off and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 -- definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I had this toothbrush for 2+ years. The first one finally died so i replaced it again. Its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this because the price was right. However, this brush does a great job. Some reviewers didn&#x27;t like the noise (different from other electrics I&#x27;ve had) or the vibration caused by the high speed oscillation. After using this for less than a week I was completely sold. If you&#x27;re looking to purchase a new brush to replace, say, a Vitality, I&#x27;m confident you&#x27;ll be happy with the job this one does. My wife has decided to get one of these for herself next brush purchase. You may initially find its action strange, but give it a week &amp;, like me, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than happy !</li>
            <li> I love it and the only thing bad is it doesn&#x27;t turn itself off after 2 min like me old one did.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I LOVE this toothbrush. I bought it because the replacement heads for my previous battery-powered toothbrush were over twice the price of just buying a new toothbrush. But, as I didn&#x27;t like how often I had to replace the batteries I decided to get a rechargeable one and this one was cheap and the replacement heads didn&#x27;t cost $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the toothbrush home I loved it for more than it&#x27;s price. The box said it could hold a charge for up to 2 weeks but mine easily holds a charge for over a month. The bristles are a bit firmer than I usually like (It&#x27;d be nice if the replacement heads came in soft, medium and hard), but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and my teeth feel VERY clean after using this brush. And lastly, I like the shape of the brush. My previous electric toothbrush was rather thick and clunky, but this one is thinner and smoother and easier to hold. I&#x27;d definitely say it&#x27;s worth checking out!</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 of these &amp; 1 of them won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Packaging was already thrown away &amp; brush has been used so I figure it&#x27;s too late to return - not worth the shipping cost to return either.</li>
            <li> The brush head is bigger than I expected, but it does what it says. When it&#x27;s turned on, it does make a lot of noise, but it isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> have recommended it to all my friends who question what I use to keep my teeth so shiny and white</li>
            <li> I did not get this oral b 3 D white action rechargeable toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what happened with</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning my teeth and gums. Battery lasts quite a long time between charges. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve tried. I have been using this toothbrush for yesrs. Better then battery powered brushes, &#x27;cuz batteries are not cheap and go dead quickly. I usually get about 1 and a 1/2 hours of power from 1 charge. For me this is good, I brush for about 15 minutes per day and that is about a week of charge.</li>
            <li> We had two older oral-B&#x27;s that were getting pretty tired, so we decided to go for new ones. The old ones did a good job, but these do an even better job as they run much faster and are more comfortable to hold as the body is much smaller in diameter.</li>
            <li> Was looking for the Oral B vitality but I guess they don&#x27;t make that one anymore, so this is the replacement nice but liked the other model better.</li>
            <li> My old electric toothbrush, from another brand, died after many years of service.  I did not really like it but did not like manual brushes even more and ended up with this thanks to favorable reviews and affordability (including replacement heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is very loud.  It sounds like an RC Piper hovering above your head when in use.  However, the action of the round brush is wonderful.  It sends high-speed circular motions that makes cleaning easy and definitely positive for gum massage.  The smooth and curved handle feels natural to operate and easy to clean.  I do not care much for the 3rd dimension but I guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great non-battery rechargeable toothbrush. I just wish there would have been different colors to choose from. But great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter use it every night and morning and I bought one too.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth nice and white!</li>
            <li> This thing for the price I guess I can&#x27;t complain. I seen other reviews that takes about how loud the brush is... N I thought to myself oh they are probably exaggerating you know how some ppl are super picky and critical well I&#x27;m here to confirm it is VERY loud. But I do feel my teeth extremely clean plus you don&#x27;t need to move your hand the brush does it itself.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE, DOES A SUPER JOB, REALLY COMPACT AND CONVENIENT.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicare toothbrush that finally stopped taking a proper charge.  It is a bit loud, the brush head is a bit too big, and the handle is a bit too small (seems to be more suitable for children than adults), but it was cheap and will work for now.</li>
            <li> I got this as a cheap alternative to the other rechargeable toothbrushes that are on the market. I find it to work well. It keeps a charge for a long time and is very simple to use. The toothbrush part itself is nice and works well to travel with or use every day. Will probably eventually get a second one to bring with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> I have used manual toothbrushes for over 40 years now and that&#x27;s all I knew.  If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right?  On a recent dental visit, the hygienist highly recommended electric toothbrushes over manual toothbrushes and tried to sell me one for $120.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve spent $120 total for manual toothbrushes in the entire 40 years I&#x27;ve been brushing my teeth so I couldn&#x27;t stomach spending that much on one toothbrush.  I decided to look at lower cost options at discount stores (Walmart) and I selected this model because the brush head looked impressive, it is rechargeable and the replacement heads are affordable.  I am so glad I chose this model because the brush head felt wonderful on my teeth and gums.  I have a problem with receding gumlines and a definite plus is that the brush head felt gentler on my gums than my manual toothbrush.  I am also prone to tartar on certain spots on my teeth that I have a hard time reaching with the manual toothbrush and this toothbrush definitely hit those hard-to-reach spots.  I noticed an obvious positive difference in using an electric toothbrush over a manual toothbrush -- my teeth felt like they were deep cleaned and polished.  I actually felt like I had a professional dental cleaning!  I am now an electric toothbrush convert and highly recommend this model to anyone else who wants to try an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stays charged longer than specified and leaves my teeth with that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; feeling every time!  This is the best electric toothbrush for the price!</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a bit noisy and the brush head takes a bit of getting used to: the bottom line is this toothbrush deep cleans and holds a charge for well over a week, at a price that will surely make you smile.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Works great, actually bought more as gifts</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean.  Even my hygienist commented.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the second time. Tried another Oral B but I prefer the Cross-Action over any of the others. Best toothbrush at a very good price! Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very pleased came quickly! Is loud but works great. Bought 2 one for boyfriend to keep at my house and one to keep for me at his. Works as good as expensive ones. But ordered wrong replaceable brushes. No boggy will use on expensive set.</li>
            <li> Sad that this is no longer available. I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> Does the job and recharges well!</li>
            <li> I got this electric toothbrush because my dentist recommended I use one to keep my wisdom teeth clean and healthy (I never had them pulled and it turns out I&#x27;m one of the lucky people who doesn&#x27;t need to!). Regular brushing can only clean so much, especially in far corners of the mouth like where wisdom teeth are. Like most people, I&#x27;m on a budget these days, and I was pretty discouraged when I saw the $200 price tag on other brands like Sonicare. I decided on this (MUCH cheaper) model, and I have to say I love it! Money well spent. My teeth even feel cleaner, and I have the peace of mind knowing I&#x27;m cleaning all of them thoroughly. It keeps a charge for a few weeks, and it sits nicely in the charging station. I wouldn&#x27;t try submerging the thing underwater, but it works fine when it gets wet- don&#x27;t get the charging station wet though. A little loud when it vibrates but it&#x27;s not obnoxious. Overall, I&#x27;m really happy I found a cheap alternative.</li>
            <li> This has been my brush brand and style for years. It is as good as the most expensive brush! You cannot beat the price except at the big box stores. You can buy replacement heads easily, just use the old brush to clean any dried toothpaste from the inside...it will work like new again. I actually dropped my old one or would have gotten about another year out of it. Love these.</li>
            <li> This brush has high marks for a good reason.  It stays charged for WEEKs and cleans well.  It is a little noisy on full charge, but less so the longer it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 one failed to hold a charge after 2 months. Of course, I am beyond Amazon&#x27;s 30 day refund date.</li>
            <li> I was worried this wouldn´t work in Peru but it is great and lasts a good three days before I have to recharge.</li>
            <li> It is much more difficult to use than the earlier version. Pulling the brush head in and out when it needs to be changed is extremely awkward and finneky. Also I didn&#x27;t see replacement brush heads on sale next to the brush itself. I bought them at Wegman&#x27;s but they should have been available on Amazon as a product next to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.....</li>
            <li> I have six of these in the family.  They hold a charge very well and keep the kids interested in brushing. With the kids brushing twice a day, they generally only need charged once a month.  We have had several of these for well over a year,  and I like that the heads are easy to replace!  The price point is a bit high, but so far has been well worth it.</li>
            <li> awesome brush fast and recharges instantaneously</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush. It gets my teeth really clean. The only negative I can think of is that it is LOUD! Like a million bees trapped in your bathroom. It&#x27;s not too bad inside your mouth, just remember to turn it off before you remove it.</li>
            <li> The power of this rechargeable toothbrush is amazing. A good value in a great toothbrush..If you like rechargeable toothbrushes you will like this one.</li>
            <li> Kids are happy with these. Although the battery seems only to last 7-10 days of brushing twice a day it charges back up. It also seems to charge higher when the brush has been turned off with the button. If it dies and you forget to switch it back, it only charges a little bit.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is great except I can&#x27;t tell when my toothbrush is fully charged or if it is currently charging. Other than that, great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great toothbrush!  It does an excellent job and can&#x27;t be beat at $12.  What more can one say.</li>
            <li> This holds it&#x27;s charge well and is better at scrubbing the gum line and polishing teeth than it is at removing food between the teeth due to the motion it has.  Need an up-down motion for between the teeth so I use this before bed and in the AM and a regular brush after meals.</li>
            <li> I liked this brush it&#x27;s really good in making the teeth whiter&lt;br /&gt;but it does not clean well between the teeth</li>
            <li> I have used these toothbrushes for years. They get my teeth super clean. I have gum degeneration and these brushes clean without hurting or destroying the gums.</li>
            <li> Still use it, the charge lasts a long time and is very strong. My teeth feel very clean afterwards and as far as inexpensive rechargeable toothbrushes go, try this one.</li>
            <li> Came on time&lt;br /&gt;Works good&lt;br /&gt;Felt litte difference in power from first to 2nd usage after charging&lt;br /&gt;Not sure it need to be charged all he time or can be used multiple times after each charge&lt;br /&gt;Gave 4* as I felt it should run with same power attract few times after every charge&lt;br /&gt;It does work after charge but little slow in rotations after first round of usage</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it seemed expensive for what you bought.  I think a lesser price would have been more appropriate.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth well, but it is so loud that i&#x27;m going to have to get rid of it. The noise is so high-pitched and loud compared to my old oral-b vitality, it&#x27;s a huge deal-breaker.</li>
            <li> Love absolutely everything about this toothbrush. I bought it for my husband, had tried once... got jealous and got another one for myself.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present, that I would buy again for myself, since my own has lasted six years and counting so far. Personally, I don&#x27;t consider it too loud, like other reviews. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Have used these tooth brushes before this purchase however  they are no longer available where we use to purchase them only the more expensive ones and these work just fine and last for years. Like this toothbrush  a lot .&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I originally got this because it said whitening on the label. And it does do the job! Depending on what kind of stains you have and how bad they are, it starts working as soon as you start using it! I saw results (just a shade or so lighter) within two days of use, brushing at least twice a day. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a good rechargeable handheld brush. Hold charge for a long time. When you first get it, plug it in and let it sit for 16 hours. I got mine on November 14, today is December 26 and it still hasn&#x27;t had to be charged again. Also, the replacement heads are cheap too.</li>
            <li> My wife and I bought these tooth brushes a couple of years ago. Her brush died a couple of months ago and we spent months looking for a replacement. Since Oral-B discontinued them that has been impossible. I was really happy to find them here. Only real complaint is that the photo shows a red tooth brush and a dark blue one was what we received. Not a huge deal since the one we were replacing was a dark blue one. Just something to be aware of.</li>
            <li> I love this product; have purchased it in the past. However, I purchased one for each one of my family members and they sent them all in the same color and it was not even in the beautiful red shown, rather a pale blue. It was not worth the time and effort to send it back, so I didn&#x27;t bother contacting the sellerr. A little common sense would have helped here.</li>
            <li> I purchased these Oral-B brushes (2) for my 19 teeth.and 17 year old children. They have never had any cavities and I felt this would be a great purchase for them. They are very happy to get the brushes. They both have beautiful smiles and I felt they know how to continue taking good care of their</li>
            <li> This brush is worth the money and then some. I highly recommend it Oral B products. This brush is easy to use and does a great job keeping the cavities away.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B rechargeable toothbrush-I had my first one for several years and it was a good product but only had one rotating piece to the brush. This one has two rotating pieces which makes this a better toothbrush. It is somewhat noisy as another reviewer stated however after brushing, my teeth feel like they have been polished and not just brushed. It is rechargeable however the instructions say to let it run down between charges.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants an electric toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank with reasonably priced replacement brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***this is an update*** I have been using this toothbrush 2-3 times daily since my last post and have not had to recharge the batteries as of today. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Best electric toothbrush I have ever owned.  It charges great.  Nice and small.  Never had issues with it.  Not sure why you would buy any of the more expensive brushes.  This one works great.  Easy to clean.  If you normally buy battery because of price this one will be cheaper in the long run because of battery savings.  Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this brush because of the price.</li>
            <li> I have long used electric tooth brushes as the really help with keeping my gums in shape. But the cost of most is crazy high. This one is cheap yet looks like it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> good！I like it. It is very cheap, but with high quality. I recommend . I would like to buy another one</li>
