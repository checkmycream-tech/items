            <li>even my nephew who&#x27;s a barber loved them</li>
            <li>I get maximum  3 shaves per blade, if I use it anymore I would get some pulling but with 200 blades and price per blade I still believe it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>These are good but not quite Merkurs.</li>
            <li>Good price for 200.  </li>

            <li>Nice blades for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can not beat this deal and if some one finds a better deal on some 200 good blades I would like to know where.</li>
            <li>Best shaving blades I ever used for sure highly recomended  </li>
            <li>Both are excellent on my sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li>These are some of my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>Of the many double edge blades I have tried, Van Der Hagen blades have been the best.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful and only 9 cents a blade.  </li>
            <li>Perfect tool for my daily driver.</li>
            <li>blades ok</li>
            <li>Trying it with a shim works better, it seems like using this blades on a more aggressive razor works wonders.</li>
            <li>Damn fine DE razor blades.</li>
            <li>Experienced no tugs just smooth shaves for 4 solid days</li>
            <li>The Chroma gives me a smooth shave without scrapes and nicks.</li>
            <li>They are mild and smooth.</li>
            <li>First off I have to say this blades are really smooth</li>
            <li>have used them everyday and found they do a great job.</li>
            <li>Far better than Derby and Dorco.</li>
            <li>Good sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>Right under feathers.</li>
            <li>If I have heavier growth from not shaving for a couple of days, I need something sharper, but for everyday, these are amazing!</li>
            <li>Will certainly stock up on these!</li>
            <li>Also my hair is pretty think, that could be a reason why.</li>
            <li>I love it in my Fatip Grande Open Comb.  </li>
            <li>I would rate them very high.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave with them with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>thanks for the product at a reasable price.</li>
            <li>or more per year( .ALL OTHER RAZORS ARE WAY OVER PRICED )</li>
            <li>They are on par with Personna Stainless and Wilkinson Sword Classic (Germany) blades.</li>
            <li>I had no issues and BBS shaves in my Weber Classic, Jagger DE89, and</li>
            <li>If everybody still shaved this way with the older type razor,they would probely save about a $100.</li>
            <li>The Croma Diamant blades are very sharp and give me a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and longer lasting than most blades.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a medium beard.</li>
            <li>Picked up for the value alone but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>All beards are not the same but these blades dragged and pulled brand new just out of the package!</li>
            <li>I alternate between the medium angled Parker 99R Butterfly and a mild Merkur 38HD classic using Proraso Green shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin and moderate beard growth and had tried these as a cheaper alternative to my normal Blue Bird blades.</li>
            <li>and I only use them twice before changing to a new blade.  </li>
            <li>I tried these and they are clearly the same blade as Van Der Hagen with a different name.  </li>
            <li>They are not top of the line, but real good nevertheless and a lot less expensive</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and a medium beard. These are some of my favorite blades. They are on par with Personna Stainless and Wilkinson Sword Classic (Germany) blades. Very good all around. I had no issues and BBS shaves in my Weber Classic, Jagger DE89, and my Merkur 38C.</li>
            <li> I herd if you want to get good blades , you order them from Germany. well that was right , very happy with the blades , they provide a good close shave.and they will last me for years.If everybody still shaved this way with the older type razor,they would probely save about a $100. or more per year( .ALL OTHER RAZORS ARE WAY OVER PRICED )</li>
            <li> Damn fine DE razor blades. The Croma Diamant blades are very sharp and give me a smooth shave. Comparing them with its competitors, its equal to the Personna Lab Blues and Astras. Far better than Derby and Dorco. Lately, I&#x27;ve been swapping between the Chroma and Lord Platinum. Both are excellent on my sensitive neck area. The Chroma keeps its edge longer. I alternate between the medium angled Parker 99R Butterfly and a mild Merkur 38HD classic using Proraso Green shaving soap. I typically do two passes, WTG and ATG. The Chroma gives me a smooth shave without scrapes and nicks.</li>
            <li> Of the many double edge blades I have tried, Van Der Hagen blades have been the best.  But they are around 50 cents a blade and I only use them twice before changing to a new blade.  Then I found info online that the same company that makes Van Der Hagen&#x27;s blades also makes Croma Diamant.  I tried these and they are clearly the same blade as Van Der Hagen with a different name.  Wonderful and only 9 cents a blade.  P.S.  I&#x27;ve also discovered Arko shave soap/sticks.  It is wonderful and cheap!</li>
            <li> Nice blades for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I just received these blades and had to try them out. They are great and they are the cheapest around.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy any blades for a while. There is 20 packs of 10 blade packs 20x10  200 blades.&lt;br /&gt;You can not beat this deal and if some one finds a better deal on some 200 good blades I would like to know where.</li>
            <li> Picked up for the value alone but was pleasantly surprised. Very sharp and longer lasting than most blades. Experienced no tugs just smooth shaves for 4 solid days (I usually switch at day 3). Will certainly stock up on these! Perfect tool for my daily driver.</li>
            <li> best value. as seen on &amp;#34;how it&#x27;s made&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feather and mercur blades haven&#x27;t impressed me&lt;br /&gt;especially feathers razors... 200 bucks a piece and there is something wrong with them. blades ok</li>
            <li> All beards are not the same but these blades dragged and pulled brand new just out of the package! Needless to say, these blades did not work well for me and I returned them ASAP!</li>
            <li> Best shaving blades I ever used for sure highly recomended  I order 2 packs even my nephew who&#x27;s a barber loved them</li>
            <li> I have normal skin and moderate beard growth and had tried these as a cheaper alternative to my normal Blue Bird blades. They are mild and smooth. I get a very close shave with them with no irritation whatsoever. If I have heavier growth from not shaving for a couple of days, I need something sharper, but for everyday, these are amazing! Do yourself a favor and give these a try!</li>
            <li> These blades work really great.  Quality and consistency is great.  They are not top of the line, but real good nevertheless and a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> First off I have to say this blades are really smooth but on the other hand it&#x27;s not as sharp, still way smoother then astra and derby which is a plus for me. I would have to do multiple passes but even with multiple passes no problem with my skin. Trying it with a shim works better, it seems like using this blades on a more aggressive razor works wonders. This blades work for me but it might not work for you. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little update. I get maximum  3 shaves per blade, if I use it anymore I would get some pulling but with 200 blades and price per blade I still believe it&#x27;s a good deal. Also my hair is pretty think, that could be a reason why. With feather blades it only last me about 3-4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Sharp product, works as advertised.  I get a minimum of 5 shaves with  each blade, Baldy, my cat loves them too.</li>
            <li> These are good but not quite Merkurs.</li>
            <li> The husband loves these!</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery. Days before it should have arrived. The product over exceeded my expectations. Right under feathers. I would recommend them in any shavers tools of the trade.</li>
            <li> I found them to work well. have used them everyday and found they do a great job. I would rate them very high. aaa  pos. thanks for the product at a reasable price. teddy</li>
            <li> Good sharp blade.  I love it in my Fatip Grande Open Comb.  Cuts through my beard rather well.  Good price for 200.  Will last a while.</li>
