            <li> Not the same as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I live in central NJ and could not find this cream in any of the several stores, including two grocery stores, two or three drug stores as well as in Target. I love this body cream for the summer. It&#x27;s silky light with a perfect, light scent. Love...it. Buy...it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she cannot live without this lotion! She has tried many other brands and she has not liked any of them! Whenever she is running low I will be ordering more for her!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! Great smell! Skins feels great!  And it&#x27;s difficult to find the 24 HR one in regular stores!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how many bottle of this stuff I&#x27;ve gone through!&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice creamy consistency, not too watery or too paste-like, and it gets absorbed fast without leaving a sticky residue. It&#x27;s pretty hydrating, I use it through out the whole year but sometimes I wound need a little more in the winter.

            <li> Love this-SO happy to be able to stock up on my favorite discontinued lotion!!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and have noticed softer, smoother skin.  I use it daily, sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something for my sensitive skin, that smelled nice and clean, soft, that lasted, but didn&#x27;t have people asking you &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s that baby&amp;#34; every time you entered a room.  This is it.  My search is over.  I hope Amazon always carries it, because I plan to always purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lotion.  I was very sad that I could no longer find it in any stores near me and bought a lot of other lotions and ended up throwing them out because they were too greasy or filmy.

            <li> I love this lotion and can&#x27;t find it at any store in my area! It smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in the stores anymore, but I love this body lotion. It mosturizes really well without a heavy feeling. I even use it on my face and I do not have any breakouts or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a light, fragrance-free lotion. It was neither. Probably ordering online for something like this not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Johnson&#x27;s Body Care is my favorite body lotion.  It has a clean baby powder (not overpowering) scent that doesn&#x27;t clash with anything else.  The moisture stays with you, without any feeling of greasiness.  It absorbs quickly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the light, clean scent of this lotion.  It goes on smoothly and keeps my skin soft for hours.  Glad I found it again!!</li>
            <li> Keep going back to johnsons 24 hr lotion as it pretty much does everything im looking for in a body lotion. Great smell, absorbs quickly to the skin and a great moisturizer! Even gives a slight almost unnoticeable shimmer, which makes your skin glow out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I get a miniature as a gift for Christmas one year and I have difficulty trying in stores. I like to stay moisturized and it&#x27;s good quality. It has the slightest hint of shimmer (so men can use it), and smells really good, too. I like that I got it in the pack. Was not too expensive, and was convenient.</li>
            <li> great lotion-next to impossible to find in stores anymore so this was very helpful, good price and easy to get</li>
            <li> it is very soft for your skin,and also very moisturizing. My whole family use it after bath.so i buy two items.</li>

            <li> the items are very cheap. Smell good and make body smoothy. recommend to you. hope you like them. very good</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and always makes my skin feel terrific. I wish it was more widely available!</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit different from the one I bought before.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great...absorbs quickly and has a nice, light scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with any perfume you might want to use.  This is my new &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; body lotion.  It&#x27;s so nice and convenient to order products like this from Amazon using Prime and it saves me money at the same time.</li>

            <li> Sort of makes your skin feel smooth but not hydrated. A bit like painting over a wall... if that makes sense. Not great.</li>
            <li> Best lotion around!  I love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it works for me. I keep a bottle on my night table by my bed and one by my lounge chair&lt;br /&gt;in front of the TV.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Soaks in quickly leaving nothing but smooth!</li>
            <li> So happy to find this lotion online after not being able to find it in stores! Use it every night, so light and makes your skin so soft!</li>
