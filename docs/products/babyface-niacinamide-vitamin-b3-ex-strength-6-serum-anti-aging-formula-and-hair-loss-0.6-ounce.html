            <li>Time will tell if these products are my long-term solution, but for the moment, I&#x27;m extremely happy with both this product and the Weleda ones.</li>
            <li>Ordered it once, I liked it</li>
            <li>Time will tell if these products are my long-term solution, but for the moment, I&#x27;m extremely happy with both this product and the Weleda ones.ile traveling for about 2 weeks, I still had and used the serum, and it seemed effective on its own at preventing full recurrence.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>But i do love the stuff and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Between this serum and my skin vac my skin is now bump free and very smooth.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I&#x27;d have to mix up my own, but then saw this product, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Fine eye wrinkles are also improved.</li>
            <li>I have fewer blemishes erupting, the ones I do have seem not to be as severe as before and seem to resolve more quickly.  </li>
            <li>do feel that my chronic acne is more than a surface issue, and also use Weleda Hepatodoron and Amara drops (both oral), which have helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Like many with the condition, my experience with most over the counter products has been good initial improvement, followed quickly by diminishing returns and then significant recurrence, even with continued per label usage.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it obsorbs quickly, and leaves my skin very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Real good product only wear at night would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I love the old fumula much more than this new fumula!</li>
            <li>Using the serum in addition to them resulted in further substantial improvement, and when I ran out of the Weleda products later while traveling for about 2 weeks, I still had and used the serum, and it seemed effective on its own at preventing full recurrence.  </li>
            <li>Having used the serum for about 2 months, and the Weleda products a month on, 2 weeks off, a month on, I&#x27;m very pleased with the improvement in my skin and intend to keep using all three products so long as they seem to be working.  </li>

            <li>Good serum for daily wear and under daily make up.</li>

            <li>Use this for awhile and not sure if its just water can not tell that is doing any good for my face....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I really thought this would help with my acne.  </li>
            <li>, VERY SOON.</li>
            <li>Prescription products seem to be more effective than OTC for me, however, I&#x27;m unwilling to stay on oral or topical antibiotics long term, and with some of the animal studies showing tumor formation at very low doses of tretinoin (EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep database), I&#x27;m reluctant to stay on Retin-A either.  </li>
            <li>book The Natural Pharmacy: Complete Home Reference to Natural Medicine suggested niacinamide.  </li>
            <li>I think it helps but too early to tell.seems to help with</li>
            <li>After the last round of weaning myself off Rx&#x27;s and experiencing major flare-ups again, I was searching again for something both safe and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its moisturising characteristic has allowed me to simplify my skin care routine: I simply use a gentle cleanser (7th Generation mandarin hand soap), then this product, followed by a non-comedogenic sunscreen if I&#x27;ll be in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne for about 2 decades now, and have tried every conventional approach -- both OTC and Rx -- short of Accutane, with limited success.  </li>

I have fewer blemishes erupting, the ones I do have seem not to be as severe as before and seem to resolve more quickly.  There seems to me to be an overall healthier appearance to my skin, a glow if you will, that wasn&#x27;t there before I used this product.  Its moisturising characteristic has allowed me to simplify my skin care routine: I simply use a gentle cleanser (7th Generation mandarin hand soap), then this product, followed by a non-comedogenic sunscreen if I&#x27;ll be in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that my chronic acne is more than a surface issue, and also use Weleda Hepatodoron and Amara drops (both oral), which have helped tremendously.  I discovered these two products before I found the Babyface serum, and they seemed to make a substantial improvement within a week or two.  Using the serum in addition to them resulted in further substantial improvement, and when I ran out of the Weleda products later while traveling for about 2 weeks, I still had and used the serum, and it seemed effective on its own at preventing full recurrence.

            <li> Very sticky.  I use it prior to my moist. And got to apply my foundation and it &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34; ...&lt;br /&gt;Just not what I expected</li>
            <li> Use this for awhile and not sure if its just water can not tell that is doing any good for my face....</li>
            <li> I really thought this would help with my acne.  It made me break out!  The serum is thick and greasy.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the old fumula much more than this new fumula!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any change to the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product it obsorbs quickly, and leaves my skin very silky smooth. my pores are smaller &amp; my face looks brighter, thank you . I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN., VERY SOON.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference made by the product.  It did dry my skin a bit - it may have faded spotting a little bit but other than that, no difference.</li>
            <li> I can not use it everyday. It caused my face to breakout  and to be flakey around the noes area.</li>
            <li> Learned about this on Dr Oz. Sad product. Would never buy this again. My face broke out like a teenage.</li>
            <li> I think it helps but too early to tell.seems to help with overall skin tone.will have to use for longer</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the product. For all the hype, there was no change whatsoever.  Just another way to get money without producing results.</li>
            <li> Product had an odd smell, did not use.</li>
            <li> Ordered it once, I liked it so I ordered two more bottles. I received only one bottle which was a lotion, not a serum. Same bottle, same label, different product. I just wasted $43 dollars.</li>
            <li> At first the reaction on my face was not pleasant. Little bumps kept popping up and it looked like I had an adolescent case of pimples. Between this serum and my skin vac my skin is now bump free and very smooth. The dark spots are going away.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.  I will keep using it and then rate this product  again.  Hoping for specials, which will encourage re-orders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54. I use this before my moisturizer. A little goes a long way. It goes on silky and absorbs quickly. i see improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and brightness, also pores are smaller. Fine eye wrinkles are also improved. I use it on my lips at night and they look plump. I took away one star because I have not seen an improvement in age spots. (after 2 months) But i do love the stuff and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Real good product only wear at night would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Good serum for daily wear and under daily make up.</li>
    </ol>
