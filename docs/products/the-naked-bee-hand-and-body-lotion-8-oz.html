            <li>I love this lotion; however, the fragrance is a little strong.  </li>
            <li>This brand is one of the few that not only offers something that I can use, but it works, and it smells sooooo good that I can use it as a light perfume.</li>
            <li>Arrived very well packaged and on time.</li>

            <li> Less expensive also ;-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other lotion!</li>
            <li> I usually buy one at a time but decided to buy in twos.  </li>
            <li> I like the usual Oil of Olay ect.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> will say that it goes on very thick and requires a lot of effort to fully rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> It does not feel sticky or weird on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon carries this product.  I use it instead of perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bunch of these for teacher appreciation day.  Great gift!!</li>
            <li> This arrived today and I&#x27;m returning it today.  There is definitely a strong scent to this product but it&#x27;s NOT of orange blossoms.  The scent (in my opinion) is sickeningly sweet, cloying actually.  My grandmother would like it.  I&#x27;ve washed my hands several times this morning after using this lotion and the smell still lingers.  I cannot recommend this product.  Even if YOU like it, I guarantee that you&#x27;re bound to offend someone if you wear it in public. My learning:  Don&#x27;t buy scented items over the internet unless I&#x27;ve actually smelled it in real life.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this product. It smells wonderful and makes your skin oh so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling hand cream ever.  It also leaves your skin so soft but never greasy.  I was so excited to find it here on Amazon...it makes it so much easier to my stock in supply and makes buying it for Christmas presents so easy!</li>

            <li> I love this  lotion because it is all natural and smells like candy!  It isn&#x27;t greasy and I feel comfortable using it any time.  I have a pump in the car and one at home.  I don&#x27;t use any other lotion!</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion!  Works wonderfully without any residue or greasy feeling. Plus my kids always tell me I smell like Smarties when I wear it!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this lotion for quite some time.  I usually buy one at a time but decided to buy in twos.  I also send this lotion to my daughter in college and she loves it.  Smells wonderful!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It does not feel sticky or weird on my hands.  Makes them feel silky.  Has a nice fruity scent.  I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I have problems with lotions and allergies. This brand is one of the few that not only offers something that I can use, but it works, and it smells sooooo good that I can use it as a light perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves your hands soft and not at all greasy.  Great product especially for the price.  I paid $20 for a different lotion that is only 3.5oz and I don&#x27;t like it nearly as well as naked bee.</li>
            <li> My coworker has a tube of this lotion. I love it, it smells soooo delicious.  Leaves my hands smooth and silky, and I live in Arizona.</li>

            <li> Non greasy, light. I can feel my skin is softer just after 1 use. My daughter has eczema, her skin is sensitive. I just started using this lotion on her, and she is doing fine, her skin is soft and smooth. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this lotion.</li>

            <li> Naked Bee is the best hand and body lotion on the market!  I use it twice a day, morning and evening.  It works well to smooth hands and cuticles.  My sister even said to me, &amp;#34;Ooooh, you&#x27;re hands are sooooo soft&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> My co-worker had this in her office and I put some on. I fell In LOVE with the smell and I have gotten another co-worker hooked, my fiance is hooked and my daughter. This fragrance is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best hand and body lotion I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Great smelling stuff!  I use it after shaving and it&#x27;s not oily and absorbs well.  Recommending it to friends.  Bottles smaller than I realized in the photo.  Will get more when these run out for sure.</li>
            <li> This is great lotion. I have extremely dry skin, and this lotion not only makes my skin soft, it smells soooooooo good!!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so very good!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes your skin feel .  Less expensive also ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful lotion I have ever tried.  Not only is it organic but it smell is very good.  I wish they made a perfume with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great soft fragrance and lotion is also softening.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer on the market - and it smells so good - people always tell me how good I smell!</li>
            <li> Both my bottles leaked a little when they were mailed, but I was reimbursed the full cost of one of them even though I didn&#x27;t lose nearly that much lotion. The product and customer service are great!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it goes on very thick and requires a lot of effort to fully rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion but dislike the scent, I will purchase the scent less one next time. but its really a great hand lotion.</li>
            <li> What a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; non-greasy most effective hand lotion. Have them scattered all over my home.... Great deal/fast shipping</li>
            <li> A unique lotion that feels great. Long lasting for all day softness.  Different that anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Great gift that is not a typical type of lotion.  The scent is light and wonderful. Not girly or masculine.   I like the usual Oil of Olay ect. But thiis is a luxury item but worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION!  I use it everyday!  It&#x27;s light, smells amazing, and the ingredients are great ;)</li>
            <li> Never received it. But it is the best lotion you would ever want. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I first tried this lotion at our local zoos gift shop. HAD TO HAVE IT! My skin feels like silk and the fragrance is out of this world. All natural products are hard to find, but this meets all my expectations. Love It!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the most hydrating lotion I have ever had, love it and I will order it again (as soon as I run back out).</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE, SHE HAS BEEN USING IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND LIKES IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I ordered the lotion but received hand wash.  My receipt said lotion, but after I opened the bottles, realized I didn&#x27;t get that.  I was very disappointed.  Still love the scent though.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on this product.  I keep a bottle in each bathroom, kitchen sink and my dresser.  It absorbs quickly and keeps hands really moist.  The smell of orange blossom is refreshing without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I apply this lotion after my morning shower, while my skin is still moist, and my skin stays smooth and hydrated all day. I have very dry skin, so this rarely happens with other products.</li>
            <li> No alcohol to dry the skin. Love the aroma too. Made my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have always used this lotion and love the smell and feel of it. I started using this lotion when I lived in a desert climate and now I use it in a tropical climate. Either climate is good- it absorbs fast and never clogs my pores. I use it on my face and body. I love this product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for very dry skin.  I love how it makes my skin feel, as well as the delicious scent.  It&#x27;s divine.  I wish it was easier to purchase.  I don&#x27;t know of any stores in my area that sell it.  I bought two extra (online) to give as gifts.  It&#x27;s a great product, but a bit overpriced, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!! Great customer service.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  Works so well, is not harmful and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Relieves dry skin in just a couple days, non-greasy and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Soooooo smooth,  wonderful fragrance, long lasting!</li>
