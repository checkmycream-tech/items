            <li>The suction cups work great.  </li>
            <li>But it works for plucking my eyebrows, so I am happy</li>
            <li>It is great for morning makeup sessions.</li>
            <li>8x and 10x mirrors, but the magnification and clarity in this one is great.</li>
            <li>but it is a great size to hold in your hand and the magnification is great as well.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>Good value and service.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good for eyebrow grooming, makeup application, etc.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror!</li>
            <li>but boy is this magnification amazing.</li>
            <li>I like this mirror because I need one to see the pesky eyebrow hairs I can&#x27;t see on my own.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, strong hold and just the right magnification...</li>
            <li>Love the product and will be ordering more of them soon!</li>
            <li>Love this for eye makeup application without leaning over the bathroom sink toward the magnification mirror stuck to my full-size mirror.  </li>
            <li>cause I have problems seeing things in it unless I&#x27;m almost touching the mirror.  </li>
            <li>just right!!  </li>
            <li>Definitely larger than most mirrors of this type, and it&#x27;s amazing how much more you can see!  </li>
            <li>This magnifying mirror is a bit larger than I was expecting, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is just cheap...</li>
            <li>The suction cup is super strong and holds the mirror in place without my having to worry about it</li>
            <li>I love this 12x mirror, now that I am older</li>
            <li>I am able to pluck ear hairs that I could have never seen in a smaller less powerful mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Rucci, I will be groomed perfectly!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a mirror that will make you scared of your own face, look no further.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one so much, I bought a second for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought it since it should last until I no longer care.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Wants one for each car, each bath, and each purse!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>My wife found it to be just about the right magnification -- not too much as is the case with 20X or 15X mirrors -- for make-up application without glasses.  </li>
            <li>My wife can finally see when she puts her makeup on because it was easy for her, by trial and error,to locate the optimum placement in our oddly lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it were about 10 inches across...5&amp;#34; is good to see my face, however It&#x27;s  just slightly small.</li>
            <li>It has been stuck to my large bathroom mirror for two months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate this because it does have a really good magnification, but you really have to be close to use it.  </li>
            <li>Yes, as one ages there are days when even THAT is too much of an effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eye sight isn&#x27;t what it use to be and this mirror really helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to pluck those unwanted hairs and get your mascara</li>
            <li>Very misleading picture</li>
            <li>so I could prop it up since the suction cups come loose fairly easily</li>
            <li>This mirror works well, but would be much better for me with 20X magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Holds tight to a mirror, but haven&#x27;t tried any other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing which would make this better is for it to be 10 inch diameter.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Far away it gets blurry fast.  </li>
            <li>eyes without glasses necessitate bringing it very close, but once I do this is a fantastic little mirror for eye makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I have used smaller diameter (3&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple design that fits in perfectly in my newly remodeled modern bathroom.</li>

            <li> My wife found it to be just about the right magnification -- not too much as is the case with 20X or 15X mirrors -- for make-up application without glasses.  The suction cups seem to be holding well -- three weeks and it hasn&#x27;t fallen off.</li>
            <li> Love this for eye makeup application without leaning over the bathroom sink toward the magnification mirror stuck to my full-size mirror.  Yes, as one ages there are days when even THAT is too much of an effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a dual-sided pedestal mirror but, since ITS magnification side is also inadequate, I affixed this one to that side with its suction cups and it&#x27;s now perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes without glasses necessitate bringing it very close, but once I do this is a fantastic little mirror for eye makeup application.  So glad I bought it since it should last until I no longer care.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Good product! Sticks to the mirror without problem and the magnifying strength is perfect! Will be purchasing another to take on trips. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for close up beauty care.  Senior eyes appreciate it!  I kept it on the cardboard card it came on so I could prop it up since the suction cups come loose fairly easily and it rolls if you try to prop it without the square cardboard.</li>
            <li> This magnifying mirror is a bit larger than I was expecting, but it works great.  I have it on my bathroom mirror and have taken it on trips with me.  Good price for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this 12x mirror, now that I am older it&#x27;s hard to see as well as I did in my 20s but boy is this magnification amazing. The only thing that would make it better is if it were about 10 inches across...5&amp;#34; is good to see my face, however It&#x27;s  just slightly small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror, and it magnifies...what can I say. The suction cups work great.  It has been stuck to my large bathroom mirror for two months.  My wife can finally see when she puts her makeup on because it was easy for her, by trial and error,to locate the optimum placement in our oddly lit bathroom.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Good value and service.</li>
            <li> This replaces a mirror that my cat decided to knock off the counter. It&#x27;s hard to rate this because it does have a really good magnification, but you really have to be close to use it.  Far away it gets blurry fast.  I think this is a result of the magnification and not the actual mirror, because my other one did the same.  But it works for plucking my eyebrows, so I am happy</li>
            <li> Love the product and will be ordering more of them soon! My Wife loves the view. Big help. Wants one for each car, each bath, and each purse!</li>
            <li> My eye sight isn&#x27;t what it use to be and this mirror really helps. It&#x27;s a simple design that fits in perfectly in my newly remodeled modern bathroom. Stuck it to the mirrors and it hasn&#x27;t let go!</li>
            <li> This mirror is just cheap... in its ability to stick, overall construction and price. I would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror! Perfect size, strong hold and just the right magnification...I am buying a second for a travel mirror!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because I need one to see the pesky eyebrow hairs I can&#x27;t see on my own.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a mirror that will make you scared of your own face, look no further.  This is the best.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars cause I have problems seeing things in it unless I&#x27;m almost touching the mirror.  The suction cup is super strong and holds the mirror in place without my having to worry about it falling.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it were a little bigger though.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not what I received.  I got a flat suction mirror.</li>
            <li> I wanted a magnifying mirror but didn&#x27;t want it to take up room on the counter.  This Rucci suction cup mirror works well inside my mirror medicine cabinet, though sometimes the suction cups slip down.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great mirror!!</li>
            <li> I am not able to use it.  The magnification is bad.  not to mention  the stickers the company used won&#x27;t come off the face of the mirror.  i pitched it.</li>
            <li> Definitely larger than most mirrors of this type, and it&#x27;s amazing how much more you can see!  It&#x27;s so much easier to pluck those unwanted hairs and get your mascara just right!!  I liked this one so much, I bought a second for my daughter.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This mirror works well, but would be much better for me with 20X magnification.&lt;br /&gt;Holds tight to a mirror, but haven&#x27;t tried any other surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing which would make this better is for it to be 10 inch diameter.</li>
            <li> I leave one of these on my glass patio door in the master bedroom. It is great for morning makeup sessions. The quality is good and the price is excellent. The suction cups work well. I will definitely order again when/if this one breaks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled, as I was, by this picture.  It looked to me like it stood away from the mirror a short way, and since it said reverse, thought it might even have a reversible mirror at the end of a short arm -- which is what I wanted and thought I was getting.  Very misleading picture and this is not what I wanted or thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> This is a very good mirror. I have used smaller diameter (3&amp;#34;) 8x and 10x mirrors, but the magnification and clarity in this one is great. I am able to pluck ear hairs that I could have never seen in a smaller less powerful mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Rucci, I will be groomed perfectly!</li>
            <li> Some slight distortion in the mirror. Every once in a while, the suction gives out and the mirror will fall out. Otherwise, good for eyebrow grooming, makeup application, etc.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mirror.  I purchased it and it is the perfect size for my bathroom.  I use it as a handheld mirror for makeup.  I haven&#x27;t tried the suction cups but it is a great size to hold in your hand and the magnification is great as well.</li>
