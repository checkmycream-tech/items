            <li> I had a hard time finding this particular hair clip in stores.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and these are so hard to find even in a big city like Philly.</li>
            <li> My SIL loves these clips and bought every single one she could find in all the stores around here because she is always breaking them somehow.</li>
            <li> but I guess it would only work for half up hairdos or hair that isn&#x27;t slippery?</li>

            <li> I researched a long time for the perfect shape I wanted and these were perfect! Arrived in excellent Condition and on time.</li>
            <li> My SIL loves these clips and bought every single one she could find in all the stores around here because she is always breaking them somehow. I have 2 and never broken one so I don&#x27;t know how she breaks them but she was so happy when I found these on Amazon. I will be ordering her more for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a clip that really grips fine hair and hold&#x27;s for a period of time.  Well, this is the clip!  I have about 8 of them and I love them.  They look nice on and easily hold fine hair medium length.  Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my hair several years ago and loved them! I have very fine hair and other clips just don&#x27;t hold it well. I looked everywhere for them at the beginning of the summer and couldn&#x27;t find any place that sold them. So glad I find them on Amazon! These clips are fantastic for my thin hair! Think I&#x27;m gonna order more to stock up in case I can&#x27;t find them again. They arrived when they were scheduled and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair, and these are so hard to find even in a big city like Philly. I&#x27;ll probably be ordering another three pack since these eventually tend to break (at least the two I have owned did after about a year or two of use.) They do a great job of holding fine hair, though!</li>
            <li> If your hair is baby fine like mine-this will keep it up.  I love these, but I can&#x27;t find them locally.  I was happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best clip ever. Got one for my hair dresser and she agrees. Glad I was able to find it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is not that thick so this style clip works well.  Provides great hold.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these banana ja clips.  I have thin hair and they hold it in place well.</li>
            <li> My hair is average- not too thick. Was hoping it would hold it up but I guess it would only work for half up hairdos or hair that isn&#x27;t slippery?</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and these clips stay in my hair and don&#x27;t fall out.  The 3-pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Best clip for thin hair. I have bought about 20 of these, after some wear and tear, they break.</li>
            <li> These are the best clips I&#x27;ve found for my fine hair! I wear my hair up every day for work, and have always had problems with clips sliding out because I&#x27;m so active. But not these, they work so great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great for fine straight hair. Hard to find in stores. Virtually the only clip I can use that looks nice while actually holding my hair in place</li>
            <li> Nice on hair. Very difficult to find in stores</li>
            <li> I love Amazon reviews to give me real information about a product. I have fine, straight, almost shoulder length hair, and the length of these clips hold it all up. I thought it might not work because of the depth of the clip, but the shorter teeth work better with my hair. I purchased these solely on the purchaser&#x27;s comments.</li>
            <li> Works well for fine hair</li>
            <li> These are the only clips that really work with my fine but thick hair. I had been looking every where for them. Thank u Amazon, i purchased two packs.</li>
            <li> My sister has very fine hair and has trouble getting  clips to stay in her hair.  We found these once at Ingles grocery store.  When they sold out there were never any more and nothing even close to it in any of the other stores.  I found them agiain at Amazon.com.  and I ordered them for her as a surprise because I knew she loved them.  She was elated!!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair clips, the best for fine hair, can&#x27;t find them in any stores!!!</li>
            <li> only clip that stays in my fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding this particular hair clip in stores. I have been looking for around 3 years.They work so well for fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that stays in my thin/fine hair</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and the delivery was quick</li>
            <li> I love these clips. They grip finer hair really well without being TOO tight. The darker colors go better with darker hair.</li>
