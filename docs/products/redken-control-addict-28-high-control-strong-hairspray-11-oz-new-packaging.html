            <li>This is my favorite high control Redken hairspray.</li>
            <li>Great hairspray, but don&#x27;t use too much or there may be build up, so a little goes a long way &amp; the price is so much better than an &amp;#34;in-store&amp;#34; purchase</li>
            <li>The one I got from Amazon was in a silver can, and I wonder if it&#x27;s the older version.  </li>
            <li>I received the old can (silver/grey).</li>
            <li>The ingredients and wording on the can are exactly the same, and it works and smells the same, so I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
            <li>I got the silver edition (which is a complete different type of hairspray)</li>
