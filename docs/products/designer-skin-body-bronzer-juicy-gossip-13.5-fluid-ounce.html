            <li>I am naturally fair skinned</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to all tanners who are originally fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one for the floral scents, so this light peach scent is perfect!</li>

            <li>I  use the lotion every day and the the tanning lotion smells just as good.</li>
            <li>No bronzer but still workes good.</li>
            <li>Super awesome</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find and get so quickly.</li>
            <li>It works better than most lotions I&#x27;ve tried and it smells great!</li>

            <li>Very very pleased.</li>

            <li>I recieved it about a month ago and love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li>And I love how moisturized I feel after!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!  </li>
            <li>I still love it and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li>I tried a sample through the salon and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and the results, while slower than those you get when using a tingle or bronzer, are good.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING, the smell is AMAZING and you will not have problems tanning.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and does the job.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and is not tinted brown</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works well.</li>
            <li>Smells great and my skin feels smooth and hydrated after tanning.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>Bought this product because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read and how everyone said how amazing the smell was.</li>
            <li>It smells like peach and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or skin greasy, and i haven&#x27;t gotten burned wearing it.</li>
            <li>This held my tan and gave me a nice glow.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal lotion, it smells good</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s done nothing for my color.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, kinda fruity.</li>
            <li>lot of moisture and nice smell</li>
            <li>very nice and smell pretty good thank you</li>
            <li>but I am very sure I will love it.</li>
            <li>This lotion does give me some good color, but most of the others I&#x27;ve tried have been better.</li>
            <li>Sooo good, I finally have found a lotion that&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>One of my most favorite NON BRONZER lotions I have ever used!</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I have bought packets from the salon before and loved the way the lotion made my skin smell before and after tanning (light fruity smell).</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, keeps my skin moisturized, and eliminates that after tan odor better than most lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It smells ok but not as nice as most others.</li>
            <li>Great product and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>No bronzer, so won&#x27;t turn you orange, leaves your skin soft and silky with an amazing scent!!</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell the lotion is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell after tanning.</li>
            <li>My first impression with this lotion is its FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, better than salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>i dont like the perfum but the appilcation its ok</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for years and never got such great color without the bronzers!</li>
            <li>Love the lotion, smell, results.</li>
            <li>I really love this product, but after using it for an extended amount of time it started to give me an orange tone.</li>
            <li>Love it, doesn&#x27;t give the burnt smell after tanning</li>
            <li>it has anti after tan smell and anti wrinkling and does not smell like tanning lotion love it</li>
            <li>My fiance even will use it :)</li>
            <li>I love thus lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This white bronzer is perfect for me</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I also love the fruity scent.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>I like Phoenician better.</li>
            <li>I wish they made perfume. :)</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for a couple years now and this is my favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li>i love this product</li>
            <li>Since this is a lotion with NO bronzer in it, it is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth, moisturized and smells AMAZING :)</li>
            <li>Great price, decent lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet peach scent which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I received this lotion 4 days early and it was the EXACT stuff my tanning bed sold just at a great price!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love love love love love love this lotion, the smell, feel, price, ect just wish it came in larger size :)</li>
            <li>Also all natural which is great....</li>
            <li>but I loved juicy gossip because its the 1 st lotion I found where the smell doesn&#x27;t fade too fast.</li>
            <li>Great scent, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>it smells great (fruity, no typical tanning lotion smell),</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that I found out I was allergic to it, It tanned me darker than any other intensifier lotion and the smell is beyond wonderful!</li>
            <li>Applys easily to skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion glides on easily but slips out of your hand easily too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was rather easy to return.</li>
            <li>this was very gentle and helped me get a nice glow before vacation.</li>
            <li>this lotion was a great value, it did a good job for the price, got me dark fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Forgot how comfortable and soothing it was, but yes have this lotion on every time now.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic tho.</li>
            <li>My tan was darker right off the bat, it smelled great before and after tanning and made my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t give you much color!!!</li>
            <li>, this stuff smelled good but not near as good as the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its super popular and is the real product.</li>
            <li>i will be purchasing this lotion again, since it is significantly cheaper online.</li>
            <li>This lotion is good for people who like fruity scents and want to look instantly bronzed.</li>
            <li>,  no greasy feel left after applying, arrived in a timely manner and was packaged good</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t very oily, its more silky.</li>
            <li>Smells great when you put it on, of course after you tan u smell like any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is great; I don&#x27;t smell burnt after tanning as a I do with some other lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed results quickly while using this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was using a gentle DHA tanning lotion, which was supposed to be good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so I have tried the gamut of lotions - hot, tingle, bronzer, so many different brands and there really are a lot of good lotions out there.  </li>
            <li>The after tan smell is not masked but blends well with the fruitiness and becomes slightly less tangy and more sweet and warm.</li>
            <li>However, I absolutely could not buy it at the salon price of $58!!</li>
            <li>Bronze is very light and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Their are 2 prominent fruits of this sweet and tangy cocktail blend, grapefruit and sweet yellow apples.</li>
            <li>far as the lotion goes, i agree with most of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh fragrance and the tanning results</li>
            <li>No bronzors for that more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>price was just right and a bargain compared to salons and others online...</li>
            <li>and I love it, seems to work the same and the smell is amazing, it lasts for a long time after tanning too..</li>
            <li>After tanning with this lotion my skin is super hydrated and soft, and there is absolutely no bad smell at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but it is not much of an intensifier.</li>
            <li>This is my FIRST tanning lotion I ever used ( my first experience in tanning beds )</li>
            <li>At first I thought it will not work because it is just an acelerator</li>
            <li>Not messy or sticky, goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I could tell the first time I used it would buy a gain</li>
            <li>First she asks me where I got it.</li>
            <li>first off, do NOT buy tanning lotion from the salon-</li>
            <li>MUCH CHEAPER THAN PRICE IN SALON!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>It came in a factory sealed package and was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li>Looks, smells, and works exactly like the pricey salon lotion,</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like my Juicy lotion and did nothing for my tan.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I excepted and ordered.  </li>
            <li>Designer Skin is definitely my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>Purchased this yesterday at my gym for $45 wish I would have come here first.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li>No weird smell afterward, and no &amp;#34;sunless tanner&amp;#34; smell before hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Nichole</li>
            <li>Get Juicy first, then that one.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY RECOMMEND &amp; you will love the smell as well.</li>
            <li>A little sticky is ok for me as long as I am getting good color</li>
            <li>Actually the tanning shop&#x27;s manager strongly recommended this one, I purchased this from Amazon right after I used the sample one.</li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It came in a very timely manner</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get much color with this solution.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really get that at all.</li>
            <li>The real lotion was just that, lotion thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The feel.&lt;br /&gt;the real juicy gossip wasn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li>The smell is really fruity, like a peach bellini.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Order come fast.  </li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t really like the tanning lotion</li>
            <li>This intensifier forms very well.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy the full-sized bottle through amazon because it is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice big bottle that will last for awhile. ...</li>
            <li>Putting it on, a tiny bit went a long way and felt so smooth and smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li>I asked my local salon what a good lotion would be since I was just starting back tanning for the season.  </li>
            <li>The price is more than 50% less than what you get it for in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it was ranked 3rd in the top ten indoor tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so smooth, soft, and my skin quality improved instantly.  </li>
            <li>I think I like drama queen by designer skin a little bit more than this lotion though.</li>
            <li>Very absorbant &amp; smells the exact same after tanning, no funky smell change at all!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always go tanning, but recently got a coupon for 2 months worth for the price of 1 week.</li>
            <li>I would say good stuff but not great</li>
            <li>I usually only go tanning 2 times a week and people noticed my tan right away.</li>
            <li>I reccomed this lotion to anyone looking for a nice clean, light scent lotion while building their base tan.</li>
            <li>Im also new to tanning</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was breaking out in itchy hives from almost every lotion I tried.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle and just getting back into tanning.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve had a super cheap lotion I found at the store in the past that smelt the same</li>
            <li>Works really well - inside the tanning bed and outside in natural sun.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain any &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34;, brings out your natural tan color.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say wow.</li>
            <li>I explained I had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered tanning lotions off amazon before and had no trouble.</li>
            <li>but I also rotated it with a natural bronzer every once in a while because I dont like orange color.</li>
            <li>Plus it gives you a fast tan and doesn&#x27;t have that gross after smell when you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li>And makes ur skin really soft.</li>
            <li>Also not a bad or odd smell.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the same as what you would purchase at the salon for double.  </li>
            <li>especially for sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>Although this product is for women, my husband also has been liking this more than any other typical bronzers.</li>
            <li>Not many step one lotions will show a significant difference in one session, but this lotion did for me.  </li>
            <li>i knew i was overpaying at the salon, but needed lotion right away and didn&#x27;t think it would be as much as half off</li>
            <li>and REALLY goes a long way to masking that gross &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t have any artificial bronzers that can turn you yellow or orange</li>
            <li>, you get the dark tan you want, a little really does go a long way AND the price is just right.</li>

            <li> I am naturally fair skinned</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to all tanners who are originally fair skinned.</li>

            <li> Very very pleased.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li> And I love how moisturized I feel after!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!  </li>
            <li> I still love it and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample through the salon and fell in love!  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and the results, while slower than those you get when using a tingle or bronzer, are good.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING, the smell is AMAZING and you will not have problems tanning.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and does the job.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and is not tinted brown</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works well.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my skin feels smooth and hydrated after tanning.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read and how everyone said how amazing the smell was.</li>
            <li> It smells like peach and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or skin greasy, and i haven&#x27;t gotten burned wearing it.</li>
            <li> This held my tan and gave me a nice glow.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal lotion, it smells good</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s done nothing for my color.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, kinda fruity.</li>
            <li> lot of moisture and nice smell</li>
            <li> very nice and smell pretty good thank you</li>
            <li> but I am very sure I will love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion does give me some good color, but most of the others I&#x27;ve tried have been better.</li>
            <li> Sooo good, I finally have found a lotion that&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite NON BRONZER lotions I have ever used!</li>
            <li> It smells delicious and is so soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I have bought packets from the salon before and loved the way the lotion made my skin smell before and after tanning (light fruity smell).</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, keeps my skin moisturized, and eliminates that after tan odor better than most lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It smells ok but not as nice as most others.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> No bronzer, so won&#x27;t turn you orange, leaves your skin soft and silky with an amazing scent!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell the lotion is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell after tanning.</li>
            <li> My first impression with this lotion is its FANTASTIC!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, better than salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> i dont like the perfum but the appilcation its ok</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and never got such great color without the bronzers!</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, smell, results.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, but after using it for an extended amount of time it started to give me an orange tone.</li>
            <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t give the burnt smell after tanning</li>
            <li> it has anti after tan smell and anti wrinkling and does not smell like tanning lotion love it</li>
            <li> My fiance even will use it :)</li>
            <li> I love thus lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This white bronzer is perfect for me</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I also love the fruity scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> I like Phoenician better.</li>
            <li> I wish they made perfume. :)</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a couple years now and this is my favorite lotion ever.</li>
            <li> i love this product</li>
            <li> Since this is a lotion with NO bronzer in it, it is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth, moisturized and smells AMAZING :)</li>
            <li> Great price, decent lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sweet peach scent which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion 4 days early and it was the EXACT stuff my tanning bed sold just at a great price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love love love love love love this lotion, the smell, feel, price, ect just wish it came in larger size :)</li>
            <li> Also all natural which is great....</li>
            <li> but I loved juicy gossip because its the 1 st lotion I found where the smell doesn&#x27;t fade too fast.</li>
            <li> Great scent, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> it smells great (fruity, no typical tanning lotion smell),</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I found out I was allergic to it, It tanned me darker than any other intensifier lotion and the smell is beyond wonderful!</li>
            <li> Applys easily to skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion glides on easily but slips out of your hand easily too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was rather easy to return.</li>
            <li> this was very gentle and helped me get a nice glow before vacation.</li>
            <li> this lotion was a great value, it did a good job for the price, got me dark fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Forgot how comfortable and soothing it was, but yes have this lotion on every time now.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic tho.</li>
            <li> My tan was darker right off the bat, it smelled great before and after tanning and made my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t give you much color!!!</li>
            <li> , this stuff smelled good but not near as good as the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its super popular and is the real product.</li>
            <li> i will be purchasing this lotion again, since it is significantly cheaper online.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good for people who like fruity scents and want to look instantly bronzed.</li>
            <li> ,  no greasy feel left after applying, arrived in a timely manner and was packaged good</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t very oily, its more silky.</li>
            <li> Smells great when you put it on, of course after you tan u smell like any other tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is great; I don&#x27;t smell burnt after tanning as a I do with some other lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed results quickly while using this lotion.</li>
            <li> I was using a gentle DHA tanning lotion, which was supposed to be good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so I have tried the gamut of lotions - hot, tingle, bronzer, so many different brands and there really are a lot of good lotions out there.  </li>
            <li> The after tan smell is not masked but blends well with the fruitiness and becomes slightly less tangy and more sweet and warm.</li>
            <li> However, I absolutely could not buy it at the salon price of $58!!</li>
            <li> Bronze is very light and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Their are 2 prominent fruits of this sweet and tangy cocktail blend, grapefruit and sweet yellow apples.</li>
            <li> far as the lotion goes, i agree with most of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh fragrance and the tanning results</li>
            <li> No bronzors for that more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> price was just right and a bargain compared to salons and others online...</li>
            <li> and I love it, seems to work the same and the smell is amazing, it lasts for a long time after tanning too..</li>
            <li> After tanning with this lotion my skin is super hydrated and soft, and there is absolutely no bad smell at all.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but it is not much of an intensifier.</li>
            <li> This is my FIRST tanning lotion I ever used ( my first experience in tanning beds )</li>
            <li> At first I thought it will not work because it is just an acelerator</li>
            <li> Not messy or sticky, goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> I could tell the first time I used it would buy a gain</li>
            <li> First she asks me where I got it.</li>
            <li> first off, do NOT buy tanning lotion from the salon-</li>
            <li> MUCH CHEAPER THAN PRICE IN SALON!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> It came in a factory sealed package and was exactly how it was described.</li>
            <li> Looks, smells, and works exactly like the pricey salon lotion,</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like my Juicy lotion and did nothing for my tan.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I excepted and ordered.  </li>
            <li> Designer Skin is definitely my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Purchased this yesterday at my gym for $45 wish I would have come here first.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li> No weird smell afterward, and no &amp;#34;sunless tanner&amp;#34; smell before hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Nichole</li>
            <li> Get Juicy first, then that one.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY RECOMMEND &amp; you will love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> A little sticky is ok for me as long as I am getting good color</li>
            <li> Actually the tanning shop&#x27;s manager strongly recommended this one, I purchased this from Amazon right after I used the sample one.</li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It came in a very timely manner</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get much color with this solution.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really get that at all.</li>
            <li> The real lotion was just that, lotion thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The feel.&lt;br /&gt;the real juicy gossip wasn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fruity, like a peach bellini.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Order come fast.  </li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t really like the tanning lotion</li>
            <li> This intensifier forms very well.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the full-sized bottle through amazon because it is much, much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice big bottle that will last for awhile. ...</li>
            <li> Putting it on, a tiny bit went a long way and felt so smooth and smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li> I asked my local salon what a good lotion would be since I was just starting back tanning for the season.  </li>
            <li> The price is more than 50% less than what you get it for in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was ranked 3rd in the top ten indoor tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so smooth, soft, and my skin quality improved instantly.  </li>
            <li> I think I like drama queen by designer skin a little bit more than this lotion though.</li>
            <li> Very absorbant &amp; smells the exact same after tanning, no funky smell change at all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always go tanning, but recently got a coupon for 2 months worth for the price of 1 week.</li>
            <li> I would say good stuff but not great</li>
            <li> I usually only go tanning 2 times a week and people noticed my tan right away.</li>
            <li> I reccomed this lotion to anyone looking for a nice clean, light scent lotion while building their base tan.</li>
            <li> Im also new to tanning</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was breaking out in itchy hives from almost every lotion I tried.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle and just getting back into tanning.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve had a super cheap lotion I found at the store in the past that smelt the same</li>
            <li> Works really well - inside the tanning bed and outside in natural sun.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34;, brings out your natural tan color.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say wow.</li>
            <li> I explained I had sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered tanning lotions off amazon before and had no trouble.</li>
            <li> but I also rotated it with a natural bronzer every once in a while because I dont like orange color.</li>
            <li> Plus it gives you a fast tan and doesn&#x27;t have that gross after smell when you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> And makes ur skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Also not a bad or odd smell.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the same as what you would purchase at the salon for double.  </li>
            <li> especially for sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> Although this product is for women, my husband also has been liking this more than any other typical bronzers.</li>
            <li> Not many step one lotions will show a significant difference in one session, but this lotion did for me.  </li>
            <li> i knew i was overpaying at the salon, but needed lotion right away and didn&#x27;t think it would be as much as half off</li>
            <li> and REALLY goes a long way to masking that gross &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t have any artificial bronzers that can turn you yellow or orange</li>
            <li> , you get the dark tan you want, a little really does go a long way AND the price is just right.</li>
            <li> Overall I would buy again but for now im going to try new products because I&#x27;ve heard if you use a product too much over a long period of time it loses its affects.</li>
            <li> I am very rosy  and freckly and pale (my nick name as a child</li>
            <li> It has a great smell in the bottle, but when you put it on, it changes a little bit...not in a bad way, just not as fruity.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a Tanning bed person anymore and only used this product a handful of times.</li>
            <li> After a long time I think I got sun bleached or something because after years I just stopped getting darker.</li>
            <li> Totally NOT what I expected in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing going on, and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky.</li>
            <li> This a good lotion to build a base tan for people with pale skin and who like natural bronzers.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into dry skin, acts as an lotion.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I saw a major change or improvement with my tan.  </li>
            <li> DOES NOT leave a nasty tanning smell, GREAT intensifier</li>
            <li> Was skeptical because it was so much cheaper than at the tanning salon but was the same as the sample I got from the salon.</li>
            <li> Can even use as a regular everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> Not good if you don&#x27;t like scents that are too sweet or if you like thick lotions.</li>
            <li> I usually use a tingle, but decided to take a break from that and get something different.</li>
            <li> But with other options they&#x27;d leave a residue that made u feel like showering after.</li>
            <li> Im not really that dark at all.</li>
            <li> Designer skin is the only product I&#x27;ll will use because I have never had a negative experience with them.</li>
            <li> It got me superrrrr dark</li>
            <li> Although I think once you get past this stage, the tingle and bronzer lotions are the way to go to get really dark, you can&#x27;t start there if you are casper.  </li>
            <li> It has been a few years since I tanned and couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve picked up a tan in a few visits.</li>
            <li> but for half the price!</li>
            <li> I am pale and this helped.</li>
            <li> i put it on at least an hour before tanning.</li>
            <li> I always check Amazon for my lotions since the salons always mark them up at least $30.  </li>
            <li> Not a good tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t get that weird burnt smell after tanning, but this one doesn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> It spreads really thin but its not oily at all.</li>
            <li> they wouldn&#x27;t freeze in my car), so I needed lotion and was tired of using bronzers to darken my tan.</li>
            <li> But I think the category that falls short a lot of times is in the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; lotions - the step 1 lotion to build a base tan.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tan that well very subtle wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Not only does it look bad, but is very painful!</li>
            <li> No after tan bad smell.</li>
            <li> and so I hesitated on buying it on amazon because of all the rumors that the product is normally bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when told this costs over 70 dollars at the salon.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when Designer Skin stopped making Rapture but decided to try a bottle of this as a replacement</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed in any of their products.  </li>
            <li> so it doesnt give you that &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; look when you are trying to build a base tan.  </li>
            <li> BUT I WAS WRONG!!!!!</li>
            <li> She gave me a sample to try and within 2 hours I was covered in a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave the tanning salon with that awful &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is one of the designer skin juice formulas, and this one has no bronzers in it. After tanning with this lotion my skin is super hydrated and soft, and there is absolutely no bad smell at all. I spell like a juicy peach or a tropical smoothie. It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product because my daughter ordered some and she really likes it. I personally have not tried it but I am very sure I will love it. Smell so good.</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells great going on and still smells great after tanning. Very moisturizing going on, and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or sticky. Excellent value for the price.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase! It came in a very timely manner and I think it&#x27;s a great lotion! Def recommend it- it smells amazing too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, better than salon&#x27;s.  No bronzer, so won&#x27;t turn you orange, leaves your skin soft and silky with an amazing scent!!</li>
            <li> very nice and smell pretty good thank you</li>
            <li> Super awesome and it smells great, not perfumy or over powering. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> i dont like the perfum but the appilcation its ok</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that I found out I was allergic to it, It tanned me darker than any other intensifier lotion and the smell is beyond wonderful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was ranked 3rd in the top ten indoor tanning lotions. The smell is nice but it is not much of an intensifier. Maybe I just got spoiled with a bronzer. I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite NON BRONZER lotions I have ever used! I have been tanning for years and never got such great color without the bronzers! This is where it is at!</li>
            <li> this lotion was a great value, it did a good job for the price, got me dark fairly quick. I would purchase this again. Also not a bad or odd smell.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion. Tons cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> It smells like peach and absorbs nicely into the skin. When I put it on all the girls at the tanning salon recognize it by smell. Its super popular and is the real product. Does not have bronzer but still works well.</li>
            <li> This is my FIRST tanning lotion I ever used ( my first experience in tanning beds ) At first I thought it will not work because it is just an acelerator BUT I WAS WRONG!!!!! This product is AMAZING, the smell is AMAZING and you will not have problems tanning.</li>
            <li> Not the best Bronzer I have used but did a good job with great smell</li>
            <li> amazing smell!!! Love it and works great. Enhances tanning experience!!! I have always enjoyed Designer Skin products and amazon always has great prices compared to the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using lotions before that make me look too orange... this one is perfect! smells great, feels great, and gives a nice bronze tone. Not messy or sticky, goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get much color with this solution. I am not much of a Tanning bed person anymore and only used this product a handful of times. I&#x27;d return it if I could.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion, smell, results. Great starter lotion.... This is my first bottle and just getting back into tanning. Been getting it outdoors until recently. Now back in the bed. Forgot how comfortable and soothing it was, but yes have this lotion on every time now. Applys easily to skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second non-bronzing tanning lotion I have used and I love it, seems to work the same and the smell is amazing, it lasts for a long time after tanning too.. I think I like drama queen by designer skin a little bit more than this lotion though.</li>
            <li> Wife swears by this stuff. Good purchase. Great price.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, but after using it for an extended amount of time it started to give me an orange tone. So I would ust tan with the lotion once a week and it kept me looking nicely tan! I am pale and this helped.</li>
            <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t give the burnt smell after tanning</li>
            <li> Smells great when you put it on, of course after you tan u smell like any other tanning lotion. As well ive learned this lotion is a starter lotion. It doesn&#x27;t tan that well very subtle wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> This a good lotion to build a base tan for people with pale skin and who like natural bronzers. The color of this lotion is an opaque white, and the texture is that of a watery hair conditioner. The lotion glides on easily but slips out of your hand easily too.  I would describe the scent being \\&quot;Fruity Tutti\\&quot; like the lollipops or flavored mexican sodas. Their are 2 prominent fruits of this sweet and tangy cocktail blend, grapefruit and sweet yellow apples. Supposedly it has a peach scent but I don&#x27;t really get that at all. The after tan smell is not masked but blends well with the fruitiness and becomes slightly less tangy and more sweet and warm. I noticed immediate bronzing results 2 hours after I tanned without being orange. I am very rosy  and freckly and pale (my nick name as a child was snow white!),  but the bronzers made me look like I had olive skin...no orange effect at all. This lotion is good for people who like fruity scents and want to look instantly bronzed. FYI the bronzers do wash off after a shower. Not good if you don&#x27;t like scents that are too sweet or if you like thick lotions.</li>
            <li> it has anti after tan smell and anti wrinkling and does not smell like tanning lotion love it</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and does the job.  It is exactly the same as what you would purchase at the salon for double.  My fiance even will use it :)</li>
            <li> Not a good tanning lotion. Smells great but no results when using</li>
            <li> I loved it smells great and works I could tell the first time I used it would buy a gain</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair skinned this was very gentle and helped me get a nice glow before vacation. I would always get asked what smell i was wearing after I had used this in the tanning bed people said i smelled great ...like peaches.</li>
            <li> If I could rate this with zero stars I would! I walk into the tanning salon with this in my hand. I go there regularly so they know me well. First she asks me where I got it. I told her. She precedes to pull out a LEGIT bottle of juicy gossip and shows me the differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell.&lt;br /&gt;yes, this stuff smelled good but not near as good as the real thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The thickness.&lt;br /&gt;this stuff was watery. The real lotion was just that, lotion thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least.&lt;br /&gt;3. The feel.&lt;br /&gt;the real juicy gossip wasn&#x27;t oily. This stuff was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE! We had a discussion about designer skin. They DO NOT allow their products to be sold online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT! I REPEAT DONOT!!!!! BUY THIS KNOCK OFF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was rather easy to return. They didn&#x27;t give me any problems and refunded my money within a week. They didn&#x27;t argue with me that their product wasn&#x27;t legit! That should tell you something by itself!</li>
            <li> Juicy Gossip smells great, but is NOT a bronzer. I like that is does not leave the burnt tanning smell.</li>
            <li> Love thus lotion!!!! Smells and feels just like the salon brand. I love thus lotion</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!! The smell is really fruity, like a peach bellini.  It doesn&#x27;t have that musty tanning bed aftersmell.  I use it in the sun too.  The smell is just awesome!!  It spreads really thin but its not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this and couldnt find it...even at the tanning salon I go to didnt have it. Was very happy to find and get so quickly.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, keeps my skin moisturized, and eliminates that after tan odor better than most lotions I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s so cheap too!</li>
            <li> first off, do NOT buy tanning lotion from the salon- it&#x27;s a rip off! i paid $60 for this lotion when i signed up for my tanning package, and here it is on amazon for $30! i knew i was overpaying at the salon, but needed lotion right away and didn&#x27;t think it would be as much as half off online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as far as the lotion goes, i agree with most of the reviews. it smells great (fruity, no typical tanning lotion smell), goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands or skin greasy, and i haven&#x27;t gotten burned wearing it. i put it on at least an hour before tanning. i will be purchasing this lotion again, since it is significantly cheaper online. i recommend it!</li>
            <li> This lotion does give me some good color, but most of the others I&#x27;ve tried have been better. It smells ok but not as nice as most others. It seems thinner and one benefit of that is that it&#x27;s easier to wash off later.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any &amp;#34;bronzers&amp;#34;, brings out your natural tan color. Moisturizes and protects your skin, smells heavenly. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff in the world!!! Very absorbant &amp; smells the exact same after tanning, no funky smell change at all! Will definitely purchase again soon</li>
            <li> Great scent and moisture.  Not sure that I saw a major change or improvement with my tan.  No after tan bad smell.</li>
            <li> MUCH CHEAPER THAN PRICE IN SALON!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. It smells phenomenal and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This was way cheaper than they want you to pay at the tanning salon. Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought a packet of this at my salon because I forgot my tanning lotions in my house(so they wouldn&#x27;t freeze in my car), so I needed lotion and was tired of using bronzers to darken my tan. Let&#x27;s just say wow. Putting it on, a tiny bit went a long way and felt so smooth and smelled fantastic. Gave me great color and I feel like I took a shower and exfoliated. I&#x27;m so smooth, soft, and my skin quality improved instantly.  Definitely adding this to my collection!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing!!! Shipping was fast! It works better than most lotions I&#x27;ve tried and it smells great! I&#x27;d recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion from Solarium for a great price! I have bought packets from the salon before and loved the way the lotion made my skin smell before and after tanning (light fruity smell). However, I absolutely could not buy it at the salon price of $58!! It came in a factory sealed package and was exactly how it was described. Looks, smells, and works exactly like the pricey salon lotion, but for half the price! This white bronzer is perfect for me and I would recommend it to all tanners who are originally fair skinned. Gives you the color you want without the orange effect. Happy tanning!</li>
            <li> Love it one of my favorites!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and love it</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell the lotion is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell after tanning. I&#x27;ve noticed results quickly while using this lotion. I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning bed lotion. It smells amazing and is not tinted brown so u can actually see the result of your tanning session. I love it</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like my Juicy lotion and did nothing for my tan. I actually got paler.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells great. Absorbs into dry skin, acts as an lotion. Bronze is very light and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Great price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works really well - inside the tanning bed and outside in natural sun. Great scent, super fast shipping. Very very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very good product for someone who just started tanning. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works well. Was skeptical because it was so much cheaper than at the tanning salon but was the same as the sample I got from the salon.</li>
            <li> I never tanned before, and I thought I&#x27;d give this product a shot and it actually gave me the results I was looking for. I am very happy with this bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Smells great and it won&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;after tanning bed&amp;#34; smell. I also used it when I went to the beach and it worked great! Definitely recommend this lotion. The price is great too. Way cheaper to buy it here than at a salon.</li>
            <li> My tanning bed had this lotion for 70 dollars and so I hesitated on buying it on amazon because of all the rumors that the product is normally bad. I received this lotion 4 days early and it was the EXACT stuff my tanning bed sold just at a great price! I would recommend ordering from this company to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Accellerates tanning, and smells delicious! I am extremely thrilled with this purchase! I absolutely LOVE this tanning lotion!!!</li>
            <li> quick shipment and great quality tanning product! thank u! price was just right and a bargain compared to salons and others online... thank u</li>
            <li> Exactly what I excepted and ordered.  Designer Skin is definitely my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Great indoors and outdoors ! :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this yesterday at my gym for $45 wish I would have come here first. My first impression with this lotion is its FANTASTIC!!! I really like it. I have very sensitive skin and it didnt break me out. Im also new to tanning and it was perfect for a beginner. Not to mention it smells AWESOME! I can tell a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li> I usually use a tingle, but decided to take a break from that and get something different. I had several friends that use Juicy Gossip on days off from bronzing. Note: this is NOT a bronzer. It is an intensifier. The smell is great; I don&#x27;t smell burnt after tanning as a I do with some other lotions. It goes on very smoothly and the results, while slower than those you get when using a tingle or bronzer, are good. This held my tan and gave me a nice glow. It took a few tans to really notice the effect of the lotion. I will keep a bottle of this around from now on.</li>
            <li> Order come fast.  But don&#x27;t really like the tanning lotion, doesn&#x27;t give you much color!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was breaking out in itchy hives from almost every lotion I tried. Got the Juicy Gossip and haven&#x27;t had one reaction to it. Smells great and my skin feels smooth and hydrated after tanning. And no reaction at all! Very happy :-)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! The smell, the tanning, the no-streaks... Buy it!</li>
            <li> The girl at my tanning salon recommended this for me. I explained I had sensitive skin and she said this was all natrual. She gave me a sample to try and within 2 hours I was covered in a horrible rash. Not only does it look bad, but is very painful! Be careful if your skin is in any way sensitive because your basically baking Poison into your skin. On the way to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! The smell is amazing. I&#x27;m not one for the floral scents, so this light peach scent is perfect! The scent lasts as well. I don&#x27;t leave the tanning salon with that awful &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell. Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I was getting darker color using the bottle of lotion that I purchased for $10 from Wal Mart. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this lotion again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I asked my local salon what a good lotion would be since I was just starting back tanning for the season.  The girl reccomended this lotion; however I always try out a sample before deciding on one.  I bought the sample of this lotion and got about 3 uses out of it and loved it!  I always check Amazon for my lotions since the salons always mark them up at least $30.  I recieved it about a month ago and love it! It is not a bronzer so it doesnt give you that &amp;#34;orangy&amp;#34; look when you are trying to build a base tan.  I also love the fruity scent.  I reccomed this lotion to anyone looking for a nice clean, light scent lotion while building their base tan.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when Designer Skin stopped making Rapture but decided to try a bottle of this as a replacement and it&#x27;s working well. I like the fresh fragrance and the tanning results are similar to what I had with Rapture.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read and how everyone said how amazing the smell was. To my surprise it does smell good kind of peachy. However I&#x27;ve had a super cheap lotion I found at the store in the past that smelt the same but I loved juicy gossip because its the 1 st lotion I found where the smell doesn&#x27;t fade too fast. They should make all lotions that you can smell them longer than just when your putting them on!</li>
            <li> It smells really good and helps with the tan. It&#x27;s a nice big bottle that will last for awhile. ...</li>
            <li> does not work well as a bronzer but smells great and keeps skin from drying out! I would say good stuff but not great</li>
            <li> Great price, decent lotion</li>
            <li> I used a variety of tanner products before but never had like this one. Actually the tanning shop&#x27;s manager strongly recommended this one, I purchased this from Amazon right after I used the sample one. It&#x27;s very sweet peach scent which is my favorite. Although this product is for women, my husband also has been liking this more than any other typical bronzers. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal lotion, it smells good and I use it for just lotion.,  no greasy feel left after applying, arrived in a timely manner and was packaged good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love love love love love love this lotion, the smell, feel, price, ect just wish it came in larger size :)</li>
            <li> Smells so great! Tans me wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Smells great before AND after tanning! No weird smell afterward, and no &amp;#34;sunless tanner&amp;#34; smell before hand.&lt;br /&gt;-Nichole</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It smells delicious and is so soft and silky! It is the perfect lotion to use before doing a spray!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion for indoor tanning. No bronzors for that more natural looking tan. The price is more than 50% less than what you get it for in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> This was $69 at my salon. I&#x27;ve ordered tanning lotions off amazon before and had no trouble. My salon recommended this product for me since I reached a plateau. I like the way it smells, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s done nothing for my color.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, kinda fruity. Works ok. I like Phoenician better. Get Juicy first, then that one. Smells fantastic tho. Anything from Designer Skin is Awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always go tanning, but recently got a coupon for 2 months worth for the price of 1 week. But I still didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton on lotion. So to amazon I went. Designer skin is the only product I&#x27;ll will use because I have never had a negative experience with them. This intensifier forms very well. I usually only go tanning 2 times a week and people noticed my tan right away. The lotion isn&#x27;t very oily, its more silky. But with other options they&#x27;d leave a residue that made u feel like showering after. This one doesn&#x27;t! It smells so so great I wish they made perfume. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great! And I love how moisturized I feel after!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a couple years now and this is my favorite lotion ever. Bought it for 40+ @ a tanning salon ON SALE so this is a great deal. It got me superrrrr dark but I also rotated it with a natural bronzer every once in a while because I dont like orange color. After a long time I think I got sun bleached or something because after years I just stopped getting darker. Im about medium Im not really that dark at all. Overall I would buy again but for now im going to try new products because I&#x27;ve heard if you use a product too much over a long period of time it loses its affects. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND &amp; you will love the smell as well. Can even use as a regular everyday lotion.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT leave a nasty tanning smell, GREAT intensifier, you get the dark tan you want, a little really does go a long way AND the price is just right. If you are starting with an intensifier -- start with this one.</li>
            <li> lot of moisture and nice smell</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle. i love this product</li>
            <li> Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t have any artificial bronzers that can turn you yellow or orange</li>
            <li> Great Product w/Fast Delivery!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells go good and fruity. Plus it gives you a fast tan and doesn&#x27;t have that gross after smell when you get out of the bed. Sooo good, I finally have found a lotion that&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I worked in a tanning salon for 7 years so I have tried the gamut of lotions - hot, tingle, bronzer, so many different brands and there really are a lot of good lotions out there.  But I think the category that falls short a lot of times is in the &amp;#34;basic&amp;#34; lotions - the step 1 lotion to build a base tan.  This is a very good version of that type of lotion.  I am a very white Irish girl and I only tan sporadically, so I feel like I am chronically at step 1.  Although I think once you get past this stage, the tingle and bronzer lotions are the way to go to get really dark, you can&#x27;t start there if you are casper.  Not many step one lotions will show a significant difference in one session, but this lotion did for me.  You can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!  Also, it smells really good when it&#x27;s going on and REALLY goes a long way to masking that gross &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34; smell.  Reccomended!</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed in any of their products.  I now have both Juicy and Juicy Gossip. The fragrance is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell in the bottle, but when you put it on, it changes a little bit...not in a bad way, just not as fruity. It is also sticky, I have used silicone lotions before and this one seems to be extra sticky. I still love it and plan to buy it again! A little sticky is ok for me as long as I am getting good color and this definitely provides that!</li>
            <li> Juicy is wonderful.  It smells delicious.  I  use the lotion every day and the the tanning lotion smells just as good.</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING! And makes ur skin really soft. No bronzer but still workes good. Also all natural which is great.... especially for sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> Totally NOT what I expected in this product.  I gain NO color off of the uses.</li>
            <li> Since this is a lotion with NO bronzer in it, it is fabulous! Keeps skin smooth, moisturized and smells AMAZING :)</li>
            <li> Smells great before and even after tanning. I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t get that weird burnt smell after tanning, but this one doesn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I was using a gentle DHA tanning lotion, which was supposed to be good for sensitive skin.  After a week of using it, however, I ended up breaking out in a rash anyway.  The girl at my tanning salon recommended juicy gossip tanning lotion.  I tried a sample through the salon and fell in love!  My tan was darker right off the bat, it smelled great before and after tanning and made my skin feel soft and smooth.  I decided to buy the full-sized bottle through amazon because it is much, much cheaper.  Best of all I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions to it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! It is a good lotion &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li> I was shocked when told this costs over 70 dollars at the salon. It has been a few years since I tanned and couldn&#x27;t believe it. I immediately went online and found this. Same lotion! I used the sample from the salon and there is no difference. I haven&#x27;t bed in the sun in over a year and I&#x27;ve picked up a tan in a few visits.</li>
