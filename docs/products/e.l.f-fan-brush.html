            <li> super flimsy. not really useful at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice fan brush for the price. I use it for highlighter.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T PICK UP ANY PRODUCT?</li>
            <li> great brush, amazing price. Perfect brush for adding makeup highlighter</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone, therefore I can only give it 3 stars. With that being said I have not heard whether she likes it or not.</li>
            <li> Great fan brush. I use it for blush. Other blush brushes pick up too much blush. The fan brush allows for better control. All in all a great fan brush and it holds up to multiple washings. I use the second one for my facial self tanner application. It is amazing and perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Very thin....Very disappointedðŸ˜ž. I have about 10+ e.l.f brushes and the quality and density is comparable to brands 4x&#x27;s the cost</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really digging this brush.  I didn&#x27;t need anything special - just a brush for contouring.  This synthetic bristled brush is soft and performs well for the price.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to maintain, and has not shed.</li>
            <li> Awful brush. Flimsy, not good for any kind of application</li>
            <li> Very cheap feeling and is useful</li>
            <li> Love the brand economical  Eco friendly might need past 9 inches otherwise hurray fibers haven&#x27;t an clue if in regulations</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but does a great job. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about 1 mos to apply my blush, bronzer/highlighter. I&#x27;ve hand washed it twice and it seemed to hold up; I did not observe any noticeable loss of bristles. Would definitely recommend. I bought this to see if it was a brush shape I would like and would use. Definitely do!!</li>
            <li> cheap and great! if you&#x27;re not too crazy picky abt your brushes but looking that would fit by this brush :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as any other fan brush.Though the bristles are very think and don&#x27;t pick up a lot of product,it&#x27;s nothing major..</li>
            <li> I wanted a fan brush to apply highlighting powder.  The size is large, and it&#x27;s rather too much in width for my purposes.  The hairs are also more dense than I would like it.  I&#x27;m tempted to pluck/cut the hairs to my liking; otherwise, I have to figure out another use for this.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> nice for highlighter powder.</li>
            <li> Just ok. Will spend the money on a better fan brush soon.</li>

            <li> really nice brush i love it</li>
