            <li>I bought these because I like doing my own nails and getting creative and these turned out GREAT!!!</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s really fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love love love it</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wipe off the tools as you go from color to color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SET</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t wear out easily like brushes and toothpicks do, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing to wipe them off as you go, because it will take so much longer to clean with nail polish remover after the nail polish dries.</li>
            <li>cheap but WELL made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>- Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I know it was cheap</li>
            <li>These work great for not only nail polish (for dots and water marbling) but also for sculpting clay.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy, I don&#x27;t have to fork out professional, manacurist prices every two weeks to keep the designs on her nails, and its fun for me too.    </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not anything special.</li>
            <li>These are good tools for dotting and basically only dotting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dotting, cleaning up around the nails, drawing designs, and picking up little rhinestones and stuff for putting on the nail. :)</li>
            <li>I found this product shipped well enough that it would not be damaged, however a better job could have been done for more protection.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these tools very much.</li>
            <li>They make dotting super easy, and they do it very well.  </li>
            <li>IT LOOKS MORE PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The polish doesn&#x27;t really stick on (trust me</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to put flowers on my nails without using straight pins all the time(ouch).</li>
            <li>these turned out to be the perfect tool for applying acrylic paint to a painting in small, controlled round dots.</li>
            <li>its either too much or not enough.</li>
            <li>but are brand new and excitied to be used the only neg.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they look like nice tools, but I specifically ordered this set because of the curved one and did not receive it.</li>
            <li>Other than that little catch (after a year of use) I love this simple set!</li>
            <li>I mean all of the tips are pretty  much the same,</li>

            <li> this set of 3 is much cheaper than individual spotting brushes usually are!</li>
            <li> - Each tip is a different size, they don&#x27;t seem to repeat, so you&#x27;re getting variety, unlike other sets.  </li>
            <li> Unlike one of the other reviewer I got the curved dotting tool but didn&#x27;t receive the middle one pictured.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to get the right amount of polish on the pins-</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, just got them in today and found that there was one missing.</li>

            <li> is that shippin is so darn expensive.</li>
            <li> but it is disappointing to see that I didn&#x27;t receive all the product that they showed in the description.</li>
            <li> so I could make flowers without having to use a toothpick, but all of the tips have a ball on the end. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These work so well for nail art decorations and they are made to last. I just love using them! Thanks for offering a great product!</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  They make dotting super easy, and they do it very well.  And they&#x27;re afforadable, which is a plus.  I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in the specified time frame &amp; was in great condition inside its packaging.  It worked perfectly for the nail designs that I know how to do, like dots, hearts, flowers, butterflies, marbling, etc.  I&#x27;m certain that as I learn more designs that this product will work perfectly.  It&#x27;s a good thing to wipe them off as you go, because it will take so much longer to clean with nail polish remover after the nail polish dries.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not anything special. I mean all of the tips are pretty  much the same, even the one with a bent end has the same tip, and there is only one with a different larger tip. The polish doesn&#x27;t really stick on (trust me I used a lot of nail polish) and it&#x27;s hard to get consistent sized dots. I was hoping for a tip without a ball on it so I could make flowers without having to use a toothpick, but all of the tips have a ball on the end. :(</li>
            <li> Now I can paint little designs on my daughters nails. She&#x27;s happy, I don&#x27;t have to fork out professional, manacurist prices every two weeks to keep the designs on her nails, and its fun for me too.    Now to practice making designs on my nails - little harder...    Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> These are good tools for dotting and basically only dotting. I could use a tooth pick and get the same results. Its difficult to get the right amount of polish on the pins- its either too much or not enough. I tried to do stripes and french tips and etc. I was sooo dissapointed.</li>
            <li> So these arrived today, and i must say i am impressed with the quality of the product, they look more than what it cost? great quality and I am happy!</li>
            <li> totally fantabuloussss! cheap but WELL made and easy to use. Perfect sizes...it just a dream. I never thought I&#x27;d be so obsessed with \\&quot;nail art\\&quot; that I&#x27;d buy a set of tools....but I thought this was a good compromise...like a \\&quot;starter set\\&quot; but it&#x27;s really fantastic! I love love love it</li>
            <li> - Received this product in a timely manner.  - Description says \\&quot;dotting and marbling\\&quot;, and it&#x27;s great for just that.  - The different size tips allow for different marbling effects.  - Each tip is a different size, they don&#x27;t seem to repeat, so you&#x27;re getting variety, unlike other sets.  - Light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I found this product shipped well enough that it would not be damaged, however a better job could have been done for more protection. Product itself is made well and works wonderfully. Looks like they will last a while.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet, just got them in today and found that there was one missing. The packaging looks unopened but one of the tools isn&#x27;t in there. Unlike one of the other reviewer I got the curved dotting tool but didn&#x27;t receive the middle one pictured. I know it was cheap but it is disappointing to see that I didn&#x27;t receive all the product that they showed in the description.</li>
            <li> I am an artist. I originally bought these for nail art, and they work perfectly on nails. I use a lot of tiny dots in my work, and had a hard time with brushes and toothpicks- these turned out to be the perfect tool for applying acrylic paint to a painting in small, controlled round dots. They don&#x27;t wear out easily like brushes and toothpicks do, and this set of 3 is much cheaper than individual spotting brushes usually are!</li>
            <li> I got three tools that having dotting ends and did not receive the one with the curved end like is shown in the picture. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they look like nice tools, but I specifically ordered this set because of the curved one and did not receive it. Very disappointing. I will use them because they do seem nice and easy to use, but I guess I will have to order another curved one elsewhere</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it almost every time I do my nails (about once a week). It&#x27;s good for dotting, cleaning up around the nails, drawing designs, and picking up little rhinestones and stuff for putting on the nail. :)</li>
            <li> I bought these because I like doing my own nails and getting creative and these turned out GREAT!!! I LOVE them!! I use them everytime I do my nails, you can do anything you can think of! I like drawing flowers on my toes and lines and cutesy stuff!! They&#x27;re great and they make it all easier!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to make designs on my nieces nails and it makes it a lot easier to do when using these tools! They love it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> These are some nice dotter tools. They are a perfect size. They all gave different sizes. Overall a nice product!</li>
            <li> These 6 different tips is all I need. These work great for not only nail polish (for dots and water marbling) but also for sculpting clay. One of the tips did remove from the wooden handle, but that&#x27;s just a matter of dabbing some glue on it and reinserting it. Other than that little catch (after a year of use) I love this simple set!</li>
            <li> the dotters are awesome i havent used them yet but are brand new and excitied to be used the only neg. is that shippin is so darn expensive. oh and this arrivied in 2 days to arizona.......... thanks</li>
            <li> I enjoy these tools very much. It&#x27;s so much easier to put flowers on my nails without using straight pins all the time(ouch). Just be sure to wipe off the tools as you go from color to color.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the girl in your life who likes to do nail art. Great quality, construction, shapes and packaging.</li>
            <li> the needles fall out, I bought this and after a couple of uses the needles of one of the sticks keeps falling out, once I glued it, it happen to the other one</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SET AND THE PRICE IS WONDERFUL..  I LIKETHE FACT THAQT IHE SIZE VARIATION IS SO GOOD AND I LIKETHE WOOD ON IT INSTEAD OF PLASTIC LIKE SOME OTHERS.  IT LOOKS MORE PROFESSIONAL.</li>
