            <li> has a thick texture (like aquaphor) but not as greasy and goes on much smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my dry chapped knuckles as a cure all.</li>
            <li> I needed the balm to help some dry lips.</li>

            <li> We also tried it on his lips (a little dab on your fingers then spread it thin before applying) from time to time when the air is too dry with no observable bad side effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim, and I am now officially addicted.  </li>
            <li> This time, I used Baby Kiss for both my lips and the outer edges of my nose (just dabbed a little on with my finger); I had to apply it 3-4 times a day, at least, during the worst part of my congestion.</li>
            <li> About the time the Baby Kiss Lip Balm was delivered, I came down with a horrible cold that became a sinus infection.  </li>

            <li> love all boudreaux products! i use the baby butt smooth lotion on my sons body and carry this in the diaper bag for his face. has a thick texture (like aquaphor) but not as greasy and goes on much smoother. my baby has very sensitive skin too. i even use it in my own lips sometimes! unscented too.</li>
            <li> I love this chap stick it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> I first bought this from another store, trying to find a balm for my baby&#x27;s cheeks (maybe eczema?) that becomes dry and red and he keeps scratching it. After a day of application, the redness alleviated and skin more supple. I would recommend this to any parent to tryout on their baby with the same symptoms as mine as it would really help. The ingredients are minimal (main: lanolin and pet. jelly with some balsam) which does not give off a strong scent to irritate sensitive baby noses.  We also tried it on his lips (a little dab on your fingers then spread it thin before applying) from time to time when the air is too dry with no observable bad side effect.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find it in the store (sold out) anymore thus I went online to amazon to get it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, can&#x27;t ever find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim, and I am now officially addicted.  About the time the Baby Kiss Lip Balm was delivered, I came down with a horrible cold that became a sinus infection.  Normally, I end up with red, chapped skin all around my nose and mouth from the incessant nose-blowing and coughing.  This time, I used Baby Kiss for both my lips and the outer edges of my nose (just dabbed a little on with my finger); I had to apply it 3-4 times a day, at least, during the worst part of my congestion. And it worked!!  No red skin, no peeling lips, no irritation bumps!  I ordered extra tubes so I can keep one at home, one in my purse, and one at work.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my dry chapped knuckles as a cure all. After numerous infant diaper changes on carpet and hand washings, my knuckles have developed into a dry chapped nightmare. Within a day of using Baby Kisses, my hands have cleared up!</li>
            <li> My baby had the blister on her lip that falls off and comes back, so I ordered this. It took FOREVER to receive, so in the meantime, I used my Lanolin, which worked great. When the Baby Kisses arrived, I tried it and it worked, but no better than the Lanolin.</li>
            <li> We discovered this in 2008 when our first son had gotten very chapped cheeks, it worked wonderfully and we used it all the time for him, we now have a new baby and are so happy this is still on the market! This has no smell &amp; doesn&#x27;t make a greasy mess like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> My 2 month old daughter developed eczema and her face kept flaring up. I tried different moisturizers but I didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I apply aveeno eczema cream and then apply Boudreaux&#x27;s baby kisses. The combination of both is excellent for her face. I apply both about every 3 to 4 hrs...... I&#x27;m not too fond of putting hydrocortisone on her face. Wish it were sold in a larger size.</li>
            <li> We like it for our grandson...he gets dry lips very often.....so its ok..we like most all of boudreaux products. Thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about like Vaseline to me, but it is in a nice small and convenient sized tube. It works just fine for chapped lips though.</li>
            <li> I needed the balm to help some dry lips. It would work well while on my lips but it wore off quickly. It did not absorb and moisturize as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff we use on our two little girls. It&#x27;s like magic when they&#x27;re lips/mouth/cheek areas get chapped from both binky&#x27;s and weather. Just rub it on a couple times a day and it does the trick. Love it!</li>
            <li> My baby loves it, her problems with sensitive chapped lips are gone now.</li>
