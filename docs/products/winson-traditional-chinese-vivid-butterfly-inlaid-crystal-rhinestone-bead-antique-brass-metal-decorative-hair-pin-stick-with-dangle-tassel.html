            <li>I did not expect such quality, but when it arrived I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>

            <li> This is a nice, heavy and pretty hair pn but be sure you have long hair or a thick ponytail to stick this in because it is big. I bought two of them because I thought I would wear them criss-crossed, however, they are so big I only wear one. Its a good six inches long and it hangs out the bottom quite a bit. Still though, it is beautiful and strong. I love it and I am glad I have two of them.</li>
