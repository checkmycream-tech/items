            <li> Hint of fruity limes, but light and refreshing..not over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;Have used over ten years. The French make the best colognes&lt;br /&gt;both for men and women. I love it!</li>
            <li> Happy to buy my product but not enough choices in sizes that can give a prospective costumer.alternatives.Hope you can correct this situation.</li>
            <li> I used to use this . But then it became hard to find . Delighted to find it at Amazon . Very pleasant product . Subtle quality lemon flavor ! Will reorder as necessary.</li>
            <li> I finally found it my favorte cologne for a  long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this eau de cologne and I like it, too.  It reminds him of his father when they both lived in Paris.  The cologne is light but full of character.  And the plastic bottle means nobody breaks it!</li>
            <li> Fresh, crisp and pleasant scent. Perfect for men.</li>
            <li> Perfumes are not original, the Fragrances are lost very quickly after applying perfume, I bought the same fragrances in other sites and I last much longer, I feel cheated. Please return my money...Thanks</li>
            <li> es un perfume tradicional le encanta a mi papa, siempre lo ha usado y no lo cambia por ningna otra marca,</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this fragrance after it was featured in a GQ magazine article. Was disappointed to find it smelled like lemon Pine Sol and I literally threw it away after the first use.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! Manly and yet gentle.</li>
            <li> This spirit-citrus perfume reminds me of my late grandfather and still is my favourite fragrance. I wish it came back in the 1 liter presentation. Excelent and timeless product.</li>
            <li> ...that I grew up with! My mom used it on herself and all her children, and I have done the same. I love the cologne&#x27;s freshness and subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for almost 30 years and it hasn&#x27;t changed in all that time. It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great scent Can&#x27;t go wrong with this - it is light, fresh and good for men or women. Reminds me of the south of France.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my Dad. He&#x27;s 82 and been using this product since I can remember. It&#x27;s the smell of gramps !!! He loves it and you cannot find this in Perfumania any longer. TATA.</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine - bringing back memories of a wonderful 3 star Michelin Restaurant/Inn in Joigny, France (Cote Ste Jacque) several years back where a sampler of this was in our room for us to use and take.  It has a refreshingly woody masculine aroma that lasts several hours.  When I finished it earlier this year I vowed to get it again - hence the reason for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rated it one star less than perfect because, along with purchasing this cologne, I did a lot of research on many colognes and purchased 2 others, which from the ratings of women whom have smelled all 3, rate this as 3rd.  I do not want to diminish the attractiveness of this (Roger and Gallet) cologne - it is wonderful and I will purchase it again when it in finished - but I also have to say that the other scents did rank higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For your interest, in order of ranking - they are (see my ratings of those products):&lt;br /&gt;1. Nuit del Homme - YSL - long lasting, complex, and fragrant - which has brought many amorous/favorable comments from members of the opposite sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pour L&#x27; Homme - Versace - clean and somewhat flowery - subtle - long lasting with very nice releases of other notes throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Roger and Gallet Extra Vieille - wonderful scent - very masculine with woody undertones.</li>
            <li> This is agreat fragrance , I use to buy it in Paris all most every visit .The scent is natural and not overpowering ,so glad to find it again!</li>
