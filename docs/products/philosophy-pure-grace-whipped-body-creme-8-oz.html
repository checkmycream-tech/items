            <li> For some reason this jar of body butter, although the same satiny feel,  just doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance level as all the jars of pure grace whipped body creme I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Having used Pure Grace in the body lotion I was curious about the Whipped form, it is richer and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I believed the reviews and ordered it for myself, and I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to give it to someone as a gift, because it has such a &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Here in Colorado its dry in the summer and even dryer in the winter</li>
            <li> Some smells give me terrible headaches, but this is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed witn the whipped body cream....</li>

            <li> Love this product, it smells so clean and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Philosophy Amazing Grace. Adore it. I heard so much about the scent of Pure Grace, and how it smelled soap and water clean, smelled like Ivory, etc. and I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product 3 stars, because the whipped body crème has a fabulous texture, great moisturization, and I wanted to give credit where credit is due.&lt;br /&gt;The scent, however, to me, is not soap and water clean. I would have been thrilled if it smelled of Ivory, Irish Spring, and dryer sheets. When I put it on my skin, the first scent that came to mind was 1980&#x27;s sunscreen. That is EXACTLY what Pure Grace smells like. It doesn&#x27;t smell shower fresh to me...but more &amp;#34;day at the beach&amp;#34;. This is what I would imagine the scent Cosmo Kramer was trying to push on Seinfeld-where you smell like a day at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the scent...but maybe they should change the description of the scent, so people know what they are getting. If you read other reviews of Pure Grace on the QVC forums and at Sephora-there are others who also think it smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Philosophy Pure Grace Whipped Body Creme. My wife loves this creme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philosophy user for at least five years and have bought many of their products. Every product I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve liked and the Pure Grace Whipped Body Cream is no different. Having used Pure Grace in the body lotion I was curious about the Whipped form, it is richer and a little goes a long way. It has the same clean fresh scent of all the Pure Grace products. I love how it absorbs and isn&#x27;t greasy. It feels like the creme used in massages. My skin feels great, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it gets me through a New England Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she simply loves it. She already uses philoophy products and said this one is also great.</li>
            <li> LOVE the soap and water aroma of Pure Grace!! I wear it every day and it makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> This has almost no fragrance- a far cry the one last one I bought at Ulta.  Very displeased.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It has a light refreshing fragrance and glides on smoothly with no sticky residue</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy.  Pure Grace reminds me of a soft smelling fabric softener.  Even my husband likes it.  Great buy and price.  Shipping was very fast.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product in the Philosophy pure grace line.  For some reason this jar of body butter, although the same satiny feel,  just doesn&#x27;t have the same fragrance level as all the jars of pure grace whipped body creme I have used in the past.  It makes me wonder if this is a knock off. Not sure but I will stick to purchasing directly from Philosophy in the future.</li>
            <li> This product needs no reviews.  The fragrance is unforgettable.  My daughters and I are simply in love with this fragrance.  Its light and summery and many others are complimenting on how good we smell.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Pure Grace. And I wasn&#x27;t disappointed witn the whipped body cream....amazing!  Here in Colorado its dry in the summer and even dryer in the winter so I use tons of lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! the smell is gentle and last all day and leaves your skin soft not greasy! worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  This is my second purchase of this stuff.  It&#x27;s a great body butter.  It is lightly scented, and the scent does fade quickly, but if you want perfume, buy perfume.  Some smells give me terrible headaches, but this is fresh and light.  I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin since I started using this regularly.  This is great for neck and face.  I put it on before I run to prevent wind burn and chafing.  It really softens your skin.  It&#x27;s light to touch, literally like whipped cream.  I could do a commercial for this product.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Almost 5 stars because it smells wonderful and goes on silky and does not leave my skin greasy. However, the smell does go away quickly. I don&#x27;t mind much because I also use the perfume. I will buy again and would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Philosophy products do not disappoint.  The fragrance of Pure Grace is heavenly. I am thoroughly hooked on this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Pure Grace is my favorite fragrance. This body cream is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!!.It really does smell like soap and water clean..  I rub some really rich cream on my arms and around my shoulders before I put on my nightie and the fragrance sort of lulls me sleepy.. It is really lovely and I am glad I believed the reviews and ordered it for myself, and I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to give it to someone as a gift, because it has such a &amp;#34;just out of the shower&amp;#34; clean smell.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use the perfume version of this and love to layer it with this.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, very clean scent and your skin feels fantastic.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy products.</li>
