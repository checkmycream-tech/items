            <li>The sprayer still kicks out a nice mist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with these bottles.</li>
            <li>I got these bottles to use with my own homemade cleaning solutions.  </li>
            <li>The spray nozzle does drizzle a bit with warm contents, but can be adjusted.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice even spray for hair products, these are not for that.</li>
            <li>It is really nice</li>
            <li>I make my own hair and skin tonics.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this because I didn&#x27;t buy them for hair purposes.</li>
            <li>Time will tell - one of them is now kind of clogged up and had to be tossed after using for a month.  </li>
            <li>The spraying mechanism is excellent and is very reliable.</li>
            <li>It worked very well, had a nice spray and the bottles are very attractive.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to carry around when cleaning</li>
            <li>You get a bundle of good quality bottles for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>&amp; it really looks great &amp; tidy.  </li>
            <li>I gave these well priced bottles 5/5 because mine have worked incredibly well for many months of high usage.</li>
            <li>High quality product with excellent, fast shipping and a fair price.</li>
            <li>I did have one bottle that leaks when the trigger is pulled, but I also filled that one with warm water and then screwed it shut.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and they cost significantly more than these.</li>
            <li>Very functional, attractive, and sized well for under the sink storage.  </li>
            <li>:) If you&#x27;ve ever tried mixing dish soap in water to get rid of garden pests, you&#x27;ll know that the soap seems to always clog the spray</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>They are attractive, sturdy and they have a very even spray pattern.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the bottles and was pleased with the quickness of shipment.</li>
            <li>My favorite spray bottles, I have them all around the house for everything.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but it was mostly stream as well and not at all what I was looking for)</li>
            <li>The design does not scratch off and takes more than one layer of paint to cover.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>Packaging was ok and shipped on time.  </li>
            <li>looking-- print some cute labels to stick on</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something more compact but better quality.</li>
            <li>I love this sturdy plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li>The wider spray/mist pattern is better in these cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pump works nicely, perfect for mixes using my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Again, Ok for the money.  </li>
            <li>6 of them for a cheap price!</li>
            <li>The bottles are good quality, and just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust the spray, nice size, easy to hold</li>
            <li>They are much better than the cheapo ones you find at Target &amp; much more attractive in the all clear design.</li>
            <li>I still plan on using them, it seemed like a pretty good price for the size and style</li>
            <li>I loved them at first.  </li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty good quality and don&#x27;t jam or stop working so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li>lol, its not hard.</li>
            <li>I have ordered other more durable spray bottles for that, but they aren&#x27;t as nice looking as these! :P</li>
            <li>Perfectly sized and shaped, the bottle fits comfortably for short or extended duration.  </li>
            <li>They feel nice and sturdy, and the clear color looks good too.</li>
            <li>Durable, works fine for the most part.</li>
            <li>you get the best wide radius spray I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t screw the top on while the contents are hot / warm.  </li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Puts out a nice powerful spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more in the pack than I needed, so I gave half of them to my mom and the three that I used works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The sharp spray which I use on my cat, works great!</li>
            <li>The dial goes from a spray to a stream easily.</li>
            <li>The clarity of the plastic makes it easy to see what level the product is at.</li>
            <li>Easy to unscrew lid.</li>
            <li>Orange Peel Coop Cleaner and Lavender Mint Refresh Spray are easy to spray as needed once strained into these squirt bottles.</li>
            <li>They work just fine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of the others work fine.  </li>
            <li>I replaced that nozzle with an unused one now that the solution has cooled, and it works fine without dripping.  </li>
            <li>I just use these for spraying water in the kitchen, but they work fine</li>
            <li>I keep a light bleach/water mixture in the bathroom for easily removing mildew stains on the grout.</li>
            <li>but it still works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve filled the bottles with camping liquids - dish soap, vinegar, body wash, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(i have bought those cheap $1 ones from walmart before and they were junk.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also like the way they look--simple and clean, easy to label with masking tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good clear spray bottle.</li>
            <li>every once in a while you get a sprayer mechanism that doesn&#x27;t work but on the whole they&#x27;re very useful to have around for making your own cleaning formlas</li>
            <li>These bottles are just right for many uses around the house:  spritzing my hair, lightly dampening clothing to smooth wrinkles, stopping furniture-scratching kittens, washing windows, etc.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean, uniform look of my cleaning products achieved through the use of these bottles.</li>
            <li>I keep white distilled vinegar around the house for cleaning/freshening, and this 6 pack has been put to good use.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>but I knew the volume of it and figured it would be adequate).</li>
            <li>I gave two six month old kittens, and if it were not for these spray bottles, filled with water, I would never be able to control their behavior.  </li>
            <li>so I could have my homemade cleansers easily available in nice spray bottles and these definitely do that.  </li>
            <li>Still finding uses for my new favorite spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought the bottle set, gave some away to friends/family &amp; will definitely reorder if I ever need more!</li>
            <li>So far they have lasted for a week and they drop them all the time. :)</li>
            <li>these are far better than the spray bottles my wife bought at home depot, which stopped spraying mist immediately.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really wide spray (good volume though)</li>
            <li>These met my needs for the most part, but the sprayer tends to drip more than other bottles I have.  </li>
            <li>They squirt well and are just as good as any other spray bottles out there</li>
            <li>Just the right size, sprays well.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size</li>
            <li>Originally bought this bottle 2 mix Eco friendly house cleaners in &amp; lived the shape &amp; clear color of this one.</li>
            <li>Arrived in new condition  I have used 3 of the 6 and they work fine</li>
            <li>These bottles are great quality, for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The compact design, simple but solid construction make them great for what I use them for and they aren&#x27;t an &amp;#34;eye sore&amp;#34; to look at like some spray bottles.</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable for the quality of the bottles.</li>
            <li>The spray is completely adjustable from a stream to a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 packs and found they are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Have not had any problems with leaking &amp; the nozzle works wonderfully both when twisted to spray or stream.</li>
            <li>Not a piece of junk, should last for many years.</li>
            <li>Most are too big or have printing on them.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a longer spray tube so it would get the last bit of liquid better.</li>
            <li>This happened the first day I tried using them.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The trigger and neck are well put together, the plastic isn&#x27;t flimsy either...more solid and better construction.</li>
            <li>I want them to be inside only cats, protected and safe.  </li>
            <li>These bottles were exactly what I needed for my home made cleaners.  </li>
            <li>so I can tell what&#x27;s inside the various ones, and label the ones that I need to pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, well made and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Extremely cheap barely even work</li>
            <li>Same as the other reviewer, I filled one bottle with warm water and then screwed it shut, and that spray nozzle now drips.  </li>
            <li>I use them for water for my plants and certain laundry products when I just need to spray the armpits or stains.</li>
            <li>These bottles are constructed well enough but there isn&#x27;t much between fine mist and laser beam launch.</li>
            <li>I really like the size and style of this squirt bottle.</li>
            <li>Product worked very well for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>Low cost, around $9 for 6 &amp; the shipping was free when I bought mine!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, but 2 of the 6 leak.</li>
            <li>They are working out very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Their uniform size and shape makes storing and transporting them much easier.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li>so I put it on a gentle spray.  </li>
            <li>The sound and just seeing the bottle is enough to keep them away from the front door.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Functionally, these work like I&#x27;d want them to: they have a screw nozzle that can change the spray shape from &amp;#34;wide/mist&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;narrow/jet.&amp;#34; In jet mode they spray a good 6 feet at least.</li>
            <li>I got these for my little girls to use outside and they love them!!</li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;ll find a use for the other 3.  </li>
            <li>The bottles work fine, but they are certainly not clear and look nothing like the product pictured.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really get a fine mist out of it, but it sprays very evenly including in the center of the area I spray.</li>
            <li>The bottles I received are more opaque, taller, have a black top/spray nozzle and have scissors printed all around the bottle.</li>
            <li>They are a decent size too.</li>
            <li>They seem very sturdy and so far I&#x27;ve no issues with breaking or leaking.  </li>
            <li>They seemed very sturdy for my use so far.</li>
            <li>I even keep one in the fridge to cool down on hot summer days.</li>
            <li>They produce either a fine mist, or a sharp stream.</li>
            <li>I might even buy them again if needed due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li>Prior to the arrival of these bottles, they were pretty brazen creatures.</li>
            <li>reviewers mention problems after using hot water, so I likely wont try that.</li>
            <li>Go to your local dollar store and get better quality for half the price.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes have trouble getting a fine mist to spray on some of the bottles I got.</li>
            <li>The bottles I got were larger than the image and had large tacky scissor patterns on them.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just clear and see through.</li>
            <li>Crystal clear spray bottles +</li>
            <li>Each spray bottle is packaged separately in a clear plastic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like the clear, unadorned bottles.  </li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re clear</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak (or hasn&#x27;t yet, at any rate), and it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>I ended up giving them away because I needed clear ones.</li>
            <li>Mine came as pictured with clear plastic.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to mist, but it only comes out in a stream.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve used 3 of these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use 2 of them so far and both of the bottles broke by the threads when I had the sprayer screwed on.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I bought another 6 bottles which I use for different solutions.  </li>
            <li>The different nozzle settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li>used 2 so far.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle is nice, just came with a broken piece.</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I chose these spray bottles was that they were described as clear and pictured as such.</li>
            <li>I put the piece of tape across the flat part of the spray head, and that seems to work very well.    </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the bleach/water used or it&#x27;s just a cheap product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to lug a heavy bottle around but also want enough cleaner to last for more than one or two sessions of house cleaning.</li>
            <li>One other gripe I have is that once you are down to about an inch or more of product, it won&#x27;t spray unless it is level.</li>
            <li>These are hard sided, and the spray attachment works easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m listening to the other reviews and not putting any hot water in it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat heavy and unwieldy when full, but then, you&#x27;re highly unlikely to be performing ballet maneuvers with 16 ounces of liquid in a spray bottle, so that point&#x27;s kind of moot.</li>
            <li>As I am just using these in my home, it is not critical that the bottles are clear, but if I had purchased them for business, they would have not been usable.</li>
            <li>Have only just tried one so far</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is very sturdy and the nozzle has a wide range of spray types.  </li>
            <li>All five of the other bottles are working out very well.</li>
            <li>I like that these are small enough to require more frequent refilling and they take up less space.</li>
            <li>Only complaint that might be relevant to some people is the bottles, whether from shipping or manufacturing method, all have dents that don&#x27;t want to come out.</li>

            <li> Good, stylish bottles.</li>
            <li> The sprayer still kicks out a nice mist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with these bottles.</li>
            <li> I got these bottles to use with my own homemade cleaning solutions.  </li>
            <li> The spray nozzle does drizzle a bit with warm contents, but can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice even spray for hair products, these are not for that.</li>
            <li> It is really nice</li>
            <li> I make my own hair and skin tonics.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this because I didn&#x27;t buy them for hair purposes.</li>
            <li> Time will tell - one of them is now kind of clogged up and had to be tossed after using for a month.  </li>
            <li> The spraying mechanism is excellent and is very reliable.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, had a nice spray and the bottles are very attractive.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to carry around when cleaning</li>
            <li> You get a bundle of good quality bottles for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> &amp; it really looks great &amp; tidy.  </li>
            <li> I gave these well priced bottles 5/5 because mine have worked incredibly well for many months of high usage.</li>
            <li> High quality product with excellent, fast shipping and a fair price.</li>
            <li> I did have one bottle that leaks when the trigger is pulled, but I also filled that one with warm water and then screwed it shut.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and they cost significantly more than these.</li>
            <li> Very functional, attractive, and sized well for under the sink storage.  </li>
            <li> :) If you&#x27;ve ever tried mixing dish soap in water to get rid of garden pests, you&#x27;ll know that the soap seems to always clog the spray</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> They are attractive, sturdy and they have a very even spray pattern.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the bottles and was pleased with the quickness of shipment.</li>
            <li> My favorite spray bottles, I have them all around the house for everything.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> but it was mostly stream as well and not at all what I was looking for)</li>
            <li> The design does not scratch off and takes more than one layer of paint to cover.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?  </li>
            <li> Packaging was ok and shipped on time.  </li>
            <li> looking-- print some cute labels to stick on</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something more compact but better quality.</li>
            <li> I love this sturdy plastic bottle.  </li>
            <li> The wider spray/mist pattern is better in these cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pump works nicely, perfect for mixes using my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Again, Ok for the money.  </li>
            <li> 6 of them for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> The bottles are good quality, and just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li> Easy to adjust the spray, nice size, easy to hold</li>
            <li> They are much better than the cheapo ones you find at Target &amp; much more attractive in the all clear design.</li>
            <li> I still plan on using them, it seemed like a pretty good price for the size and style</li>
            <li> I loved them at first.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are pretty good quality and don&#x27;t jam or stop working so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> lol, its not hard.</li>
            <li> I have ordered other more durable spray bottles for that, but they aren&#x27;t as nice looking as these! :P</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized and shaped, the bottle fits comfortably for short or extended duration.  </li>
            <li> They feel nice and sturdy, and the clear color looks good too.</li>
            <li> Durable, works fine for the most part.</li>
            <li> you get the best wide radius spray I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t screw the top on while the contents are hot / warm.  </li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Puts out a nice powerful spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s more in the pack than I needed, so I gave half of them to my mom and the three that I used works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The sharp spray which I use on my cat, works great!</li>
            <li> The dial goes from a spray to a stream easily.</li>
            <li> The clarity of the plastic makes it easy to see what level the product is at.</li>
            <li> Easy to unscrew lid.</li>
            <li> Orange Peel Coop Cleaner and Lavender Mint Refresh Spray are easy to spray as needed once strained into these squirt bottles.</li>
            <li> They work just fine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the others work fine.  </li>
            <li> I replaced that nozzle with an unused one now that the solution has cooled, and it works fine without dripping.  </li>
            <li> I just use these for spraying water in the kitchen, but they work fine</li>
            <li> I keep a light bleach/water mixture in the bathroom for easily removing mildew stains on the grout.</li>
            <li> but it still works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve filled the bottles with camping liquids - dish soap, vinegar, body wash, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(i have bought those cheap $1 ones from walmart before and they were junk.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I also like the way they look--simple and clean, easy to label with masking tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good clear spray bottle.</li>
            <li> every once in a while you get a sprayer mechanism that doesn&#x27;t work but on the whole they&#x27;re very useful to have around for making your own cleaning formlas</li>
            <li> These bottles are just right for many uses around the house:  spritzing my hair, lightly dampening clothing to smooth wrinkles, stopping furniture-scratching kittens, washing windows, etc.  </li>
            <li> I like the clean, uniform look of my cleaning products achieved through the use of these bottles.</li>
            <li> I keep white distilled vinegar around the house for cleaning/freshening, and this 6 pack has been put to good use.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> but I knew the volume of it and figured it would be adequate).</li>
            <li> I gave two six month old kittens, and if it were not for these spray bottles, filled with water, I would never be able to control their behavior.  </li>
            <li> so I could have my homemade cleansers easily available in nice spray bottles and these definitely do that.  </li>
            <li> Still finding uses for my new favorite spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought the bottle set, gave some away to friends/family &amp; will definitely reorder if I ever need more!</li>
            <li> So far they have lasted for a week and they drop them all the time. :)</li>
            <li> these are far better than the spray bottles my wife bought at home depot, which stopped spraying mist immediately.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really wide spray (good volume though)</li>
            <li> These met my needs for the most part, but the sprayer tends to drip more than other bottles I have.  </li>
            <li> They squirt well and are just as good as any other spray bottles out there</li>
            <li> Just the right size, sprays well.  </li>
            <li> Just the right size</li>
            <li> Originally bought this bottle 2 mix Eco friendly house cleaners in &amp; lived the shape &amp; clear color of this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived in new condition  I have used 3 of the 6 and they work fine</li>
            <li> These bottles are great quality, for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The compact design, simple but solid construction make them great for what I use them for and they aren&#x27;t an &amp;#34;eye sore&amp;#34; to look at like some spray bottles.</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable for the quality of the bottles.</li>
            <li> The spray is completely adjustable from a stream to a fine mist.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 packs and found they are exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Have not had any problems with leaking &amp; the nozzle works wonderfully both when twisted to spray or stream.</li>
            <li> Not a piece of junk, should last for many years.</li>
            <li> Most are too big or have printing on them.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a longer spray tube so it would get the last bit of liquid better.</li>
            <li> This happened the first day I tried using them.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trigger and neck are well put together, the plastic isn&#x27;t flimsy either...more solid and better construction.</li>
            <li> I want them to be inside only cats, protected and safe.  </li>
            <li> These bottles were exactly what I needed for my home made cleaners.  </li>
            <li> so I can tell what&#x27;s inside the various ones, and label the ones that I need to pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, well made and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap barely even work</li>
            <li> Same as the other reviewer, I filled one bottle with warm water and then screwed it shut, and that spray nozzle now drips.  </li>
            <li> I use them for water for my plants and certain laundry products when I just need to spray the armpits or stains.</li>
            <li> These bottles are constructed well enough but there isn&#x27;t much between fine mist and laser beam launch.</li>
            <li> I really like the size and style of this squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> Low cost, around $9 for 6 &amp; the shipping was free when I bought mine!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, but 2 of the 6 leak.</li>
            <li> They are working out very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Their uniform size and shape makes storing and transporting them much easier.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li> so I put it on a gentle spray.  </li>
            <li> The sound and just seeing the bottle is enough to keep them away from the front door.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Functionally, these work like I&#x27;d want them to: they have a screw nozzle that can change the spray shape from &amp;#34;wide/mist&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;narrow/jet.&amp;#34; In jet mode they spray a good 6 feet at least.</li>
            <li> I got these for my little girls to use outside and they love them!!</li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;ll find a use for the other 3.  </li>
            <li> The bottles work fine, but they are certainly not clear and look nothing like the product pictured.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really get a fine mist out of it, but it sprays very evenly including in the center of the area I spray.</li>
            <li> The bottles I received are more opaque, taller, have a black top/spray nozzle and have scissors printed all around the bottle.</li>
            <li> They are a decent size too.</li>
            <li> They seem very sturdy and so far I&#x27;ve no issues with breaking or leaking.  </li>
            <li> They seemed very sturdy for my use so far.</li>
            <li> I even keep one in the fridge to cool down on hot summer days.</li>
            <li> They produce either a fine mist, or a sharp stream.</li>
            <li> I might even buy them again if needed due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li> Prior to the arrival of these bottles, they were pretty brazen creatures.</li>
            <li> reviewers mention problems after using hot water, so I likely wont try that.</li>
            <li> Go to your local dollar store and get better quality for half the price.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes have trouble getting a fine mist to spray on some of the bottles I got.</li>
            <li> The bottles I got were larger than the image and had large tacky scissor patterns on them.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just clear and see through.</li>
            <li> Crystal clear spray bottles +</li>
            <li> Each spray bottle is packaged separately in a clear plastic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like the clear, unadorned bottles.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re clear</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leak (or hasn&#x27;t yet, at any rate), and it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> I ended up giving them away because I needed clear ones.</li>
            <li> Mine came as pictured with clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to mist, but it only comes out in a stream.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve used 3 of these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use 2 of them so far and both of the bottles broke by the threads when I had the sprayer screwed on.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I bought another 6 bottles which I use for different solutions.  </li>
            <li> The different nozzle settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li> used 2 so far.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle is nice, just came with a broken piece.</li>
            <li> One of the main reasons I chose these spray bottles was that they were described as clear and pictured as such.</li>
            <li> I put the piece of tape across the flat part of the spray head, and that seems to work very well.    </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the bleach/water used or it&#x27;s just a cheap product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to lug a heavy bottle around but also want enough cleaner to last for more than one or two sessions of house cleaning.</li>
            <li> One other gripe I have is that once you are down to about an inch or more of product, it won&#x27;t spray unless it is level.</li>
            <li> These are hard sided, and the spray attachment works easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m listening to the other reviews and not putting any hot water in it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat heavy and unwieldy when full, but then, you&#x27;re highly unlikely to be performing ballet maneuvers with 16 ounces of liquid in a spray bottle, so that point&#x27;s kind of moot.</li>
            <li> As I am just using these in my home, it is not critical that the bottles are clear, but if I had purchased them for business, they would have not been usable.</li>
            <li> Have only just tried one so far</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is very sturdy and the nozzle has a wide range of spray types.  </li>
            <li> All five of the other bottles are working out very well.</li>
            <li> I like that these are small enough to require more frequent refilling and they take up less space.</li>
            <li> Only complaint that might be relevant to some people is the bottles, whether from shipping or manufacturing method, all have dents that don&#x27;t want to come out.</li>
            <li> There are two things I especially appreciate about these spray bottles: (1) the nozzle/sprayer is good quality and (2) the smaller size makes them convenient to put in lots of different places around the house.  </li>
            <li> These bottles do not fit into that category - they are the type of quality I would expect if I was purchasing a high quality cleaner from a boutique retailer.  </li>
            <li> I clean my chicken coop with all natural cleaners that I make myself and these bottles</li>
            <li> As long as one can figure out how to work them.</li>
            <li> and so when you dial it back to lessen the volume, the spray gets really wide and results in overspray of the solution.</li>
            <li> Wanted glass, it was not clearly advertised</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ve purchased some poor quality sprayers in the past - where the nozzle is cheap and it doesn&#x27;t spray as hard or consistently as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two sets and have not had a single problem.</li>
            <li> were advertised as CLEAR, got frosted with black sprayers and non-removeable black scissors painted all over the bottles.... not like photo</li>
            <li> They are hard plastic and do not get soft in sunlight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to trash the other 4 bottles since when the bottles crack the sprayer is still in your hand and the bottle falls to the ground spilling its contents creating a big mess.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty enough for stronger chemicals that don&#x27;t clog</li>
            <li> and I was curious about that.</li>
            <li> Not a real problem per say</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I mix my own all natural spider repellent, and slap a label on, and spray away!  </li>
            <li> These bottles are not clear, they are frosted with pictures of black scissors on them.</li>
            <li> The piston too small not enough presure for liquid be spraying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;size is convenient - not too big and not too small</li>
            <li> it came out in stream in one and the other adjusted</li>
            <li> It seems silly to pay so much in shipping for empty plastic bottles.    </li>
            <li> I use these bottles for homemade cleaning solutions &amp; also for just water to keep naughty kitties from jumping up on the kitchen counter.</li>
            <li> I use them for home made cleaning products, some of which have soaps in them that can clog other spray bottles, but these have a little filtering piece at the end of the spray tube that is inside the bottle</li>
            <li> But I also now use a few of these for other purposes -</li>
            <li> They also have black nozzles.</li>
            <li> These bottles are not Lear as advertised...they have images of black scissors going all the way around them...</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I am just using these for some household cleaners, so it isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was disappointed that they weren&#x27;t what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> but I think it could use a little work.</li>
            <li> I do have one bottle (out of 9 that I&#x27;ve bought) which seems to leak a little out of the handle when I spray from it</li>
            <li> All unusable within a few months.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with cracking, clogging or the sprayer failing.</li>
            <li> They are compact (the reservoir is a little small</li>
            <li> My search for small spray bottles found these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tube goes all the way to the bottom, so getting the last drop isn&#x27;t as difficult as it could be.</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> In the past, the sprayers always gave me problems.  </li>
            <li> Horrible quality, after first use, only 1 remained in usable condition.</li>
            <li> thats hard on plastic.</li>
            <li> Short with a wide base prevents it from tipping over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few handles was broken</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to hold and the trigger stopped working after less than 100 pulls.</li>
            <li> They are an opaque white with some some sort of bad &amp;#34;hair styling&amp;#34; clip art.  </li>
            <li> These spray bottles work - they don&#x27;t drip or stop working or do any of the other annoying things that all other spray bottles seem to do.  </li>
            <li> One of the bottles came with a broken sprayer and cant be used.</li>
            <li> These bottles have worked well and they don&#x27;t collapse as bad as other spray bottles I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I stored VINEGAR in mine to use as a spray cleaner and a nasty vinegary scent now permeates the cheap particleboard that comprises the base of my kitchen cabinet.</li>
            <li> However they weren&#x27;t broken, and the sprayers still spray, so despite the fact that they aren&#x27;t terribly aesthetically pleasing (and hold a bit less than they&#x27;re supposed to because of the deformation of the bottles)</li>
            <li> had 2 sprayers go bad, so I down graded my product review to 3 out of 5 stars. :(</li>
            <li> One of them had to be tossed as it dripped so bad it was useless.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing to pay for something that can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> The shape of this bottle makes holding on to them a bit awkward, compared to a bottle with a tapered top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for just water (used it when i was cutting my girls&#x27; hair)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>

            <li> I really like the size and style of this squirt bottle. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any labels or writing on it, it&#x27;s just clear and see through. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t mist. I really wanted it to mist, but it only comes out in a stream. I still plan on using them, it seemed like a pretty good price for the size and style I wanted even though it doesn&#x27;t mist.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is nice, just came with a broken piece. One of the bottles came with a broken sprayer and cant be used. Disappointing to pay for something that can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Great bottles... great value!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and convenient, these bottles are great for a variety of liquids.  I use them for water for my plants and certain laundry products when I just need to spray the armpits or stains.</li>
            <li> Serve their purpose. Bought to make homemade cleaning products</li>
            <li> Great spray. I got these for my little girls to use outside and they love them!! So far they have lasted for a week and they drop them all the time. :)</li>
            <li> All unusable within a few months. Go to your local dollar store and get better quality for half the price.</li>
            <li> Bottles came melted. They still work just topple over some times. The mist function is not so great, which is what I use on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.. but it gets the job done. The sharp spray which I use on my cat, works great!</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering these. after about 1 month, two of the 6 broke but its because I use them for rubbing alcohol and thats hard on plastic.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great value.  Product worked very well for my purposes.  Spray noozle is adjustable and works well when used</li>
            <li> every once in a while you get a sprayer mechanism that doesn&#x27;t work but on the whole they&#x27;re very useful to have around for making your own cleaning formlas</li>
            <li> These are really great spray bottles ... good quality and spray perfectly every time I use them.  No leaks yet!</li>
            <li> The bottles are good quality, and just the right size for me.  I don&#x27;t want to lug a heavy bottle around but also want enough cleaner to last for more than one or two sessions of house cleaning.</li>
            <li> Excellent. The best water spray bottle I have ever used. Turn it one way get a stream. Turn it about in the middle you get the best wide radius spray I have ever seen. I even keep one in the fridge to cool down on hot summer days. Perfect for bed head in the morning, haha!</li>
            <li> I wish these bottles came with the prime shipping option. It seems silly to pay so much in shipping for empty plastic bottles.    That aside, these are very nice bottles. They are a good size, and consistant quality. I did have one bottle that leaks when the trigger is pulled, but I also filled that one with warm water and then screwed it shut. I do not know if the pressure build up had something to do with that.    All five of the other bottles are working out very well. None of them leak when the trigger is pulled, and all are holding up well. I use scotch tape to lable the bottles. I put the piece of tape across the flat part of the spray head, and that seems to work very well.    I like the clean, uniform look of my cleaning products achieved through the use of these bottles. I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good, stylish bottles. No issues with spray.</li>
            <li> these are far better than the spray bottles my wife bought at home depot, which stopped spraying mist immediately. and they cost significantly more than these. recommended for simple home use.</li>
            <li> Very functional, attractive, and sized well for under the sink storage.  Bought 2 packs and found they are exactly as described.  Mahalo!</li>
            <li> Originally bought this bottle 2 mix Eco friendly house cleaners in &amp; lived the shape &amp; clear color of this one. Plus the rating on this item was good too. I ended up using this as not only household cleaner but garden spray also! Great bottle! Heavy duty enough for stronger chemicals that don&#x27;t clog :) If you&#x27;ve ever tried mixing dish soap in water to get rid of garden pests, you&#x27;ll know that the soap seems to always clog the spray nozzle- but not with this one! I bought the bottle set, gave some away to friends/family &amp; will definitely reorder if I ever need more! Just wish it came in a variety of colors for different purposes but a permanent markers works too.</li>
            <li> My search for small spray bottles found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Low cost, around $9 for 6 &amp; the shipping was free when I bought mine!&lt;br /&gt;+ Crystal clear spray bottles + spray nozzles.&lt;br /&gt;+ Each spray bottle is packaged separately in a clear plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;+ Holds 16oz.&lt;br /&gt;+ Short with a wide base prevents it from tipping over.&lt;br /&gt;+ Standard spray nozzle threads, so a standard replacement spray nozzle will fit.&lt;br /&gt;+ The spray pump nozzle is adjustable from off, mist to stream.&lt;br /&gt;+ Puts out a nice powerful spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The shape of this bottle makes holding on to them a bit awkward, compared to a bottle with a tapered top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve used 3 of these.  One for laundry stain remover &amp; 2 for window cleaner that I get in a 1 gallon container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► Update - November 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I had 2 sprayers go bad, so I down graded my product review to 3 out of 5 stars. :(</li>
            <li> Three of the six bottles (in each set; I bought two) arrived dented.  However they weren&#x27;t broken, and the sprayers still spray, so despite the fact that they aren&#x27;t terribly aesthetically pleasing (and hold a bit less than they&#x27;re supposed to because of the deformation of the bottles), they still work for holding homemade cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> There are two things I especially appreciate about these spray bottles: (1) the nozzle/sprayer is good quality and (2) the smaller size makes them convenient to put in lots of different places around the house.  I guess I&#x27;ve purchased some poor quality sprayers in the past - where the nozzle is cheap and it doesn&#x27;t spray as hard or consistently as I&#x27;d like.  These bottles do not fit into that category - they are the type of quality I would expect if I was purchasing a high quality cleaner from a boutique retailer.  Also, since the bottles are not the tall, 32-oz size, they are convenient to put in a lot of places (I keep one under each bathroom vanity).</li>
            <li> You get a bundle of good quality bottles for a cheap price. They squirt well and are just as good as any other spray bottles out there</li>
            <li> Good clear spray bottle. Can&#x27;t really get a fine mist out of it, but it sprays very evenly including in the center of the area I spray. The dial goes from a spray to a stream easily. Good quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I use these bottles for homemade cleaning solutions &amp; also for just water to keep naughty kitties from jumping up on the kitchen counter. They are much better than the cheapo ones you find at Target &amp; much more attractive in the all clear design. Have not had any problems with leaking &amp; the nozzle works wonderfully both when twisted to spray or stream.</li>
            <li> I like that these are small enough to require more frequent refilling and they take up less space. The clarity of the plastic makes it easy to see what level the product is at.</li>
            <li> These spray bottles work - they don&#x27;t drip or stop working or do any of the other annoying things that all other spray bottles seem to do.  So happy to find these on Amazon thanks to your great reviewers!</li>
            <li> Enough said?! They leak when on their side. No, I don&#x27;t intentionally place bottles with liquid in them on their sides, but sometimes stuff gets knocked over in the underworld that is beneath my kitchen sink. Unfortunately, I stored VINEGAR in mine to use as a spray cleaner and a nasty vinegary scent now permeates the cheap particleboard that comprises the base of my kitchen cabinet. Yum!</li>
            <li> I gave these well priced bottles 5/5 because mine have worked incredibly well for many months of high usage. The sprayer still kicks out a nice mist.</li>
            <li> These bottles are great quality, for such a low price. I would absolutely recommend them. Extremely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived in new condition  I have used 3 of the 6 and they work fine</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, but 2 of the 6 leak.</li>
            <li> They are attractive, sturdy and they have a very even spray pattern.  The price is also very reasonable for the quality of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Great spray bottles. I am currently using them for my diy cleaning products. They are working out very well. Good construction for the spray part of the bottle. I like that you can adjust the stream by twisting the end of the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Durable, works fine for the most part. I use it for home made cleaning supplies. I do sometimes have trouble getting a fine mist to spray on some of the bottles I got.</li>
            <li> Ordered a 6 pack and have not tried each one yet, but the 3 I have used work great.  Easy to adjust the spray, nice size, easy to hold and I like the clear, unadorned bottles.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great spray bottle.  Works very well.  Have only just tried one so far but I have no complaints.  Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;This vendor makes great effort to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase.  A pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li> High quality product with excellent, fast shipping and a fair price. Not a piece of junk, should last for many years.</li>
            <li> Work great! I&#x27;ve used them for months and have had no issues with them... great price too.</li>
            <li> Very nice size and the spray head works well.</li>
            <li> These work like a dream. Easy to unscrew lid. Add your liquid replace lid turn nozzle and spray. This is a great value and great size. No problems with clogs or cracks.</li>
            <li> very good product, just as described.  I am pleased with the bottles and was pleased with the quickness of shipment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with these bottles. Most are too big or have printing on them. These are hard sided, and the spray attachment works easily. The tube goes all the way to the bottom, so getting the last drop isn&#x27;t as difficult as it could be. I&#x27;ve filled the bottles with camping liquids - dish soap, vinegar, body wash, etc. Their uniform size and shape makes storing and transporting them much easier.</li>
            <li> My favorite spray bottles, I have them all around the house for everything. And they&#x27;re clear so I can tell what&#x27;s inside the various ones, and label the ones that I need to pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Just started using these bottles, so I can&#x27;t speak to longevity, but they work great for now.  The spray is completely adjustable from a stream to a fine mist.</li>
            <li> I got these bottles to use with my own homemade cleaning solutions.  They work just fine and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  Same as the other reviewer, I filled one bottle with warm water and then screwed it shut, and that spray nozzle now drips.  All of the others work fine.  I replaced that nozzle with an unused one now that the solution has cooled, and it works fine without dripping.  So - lesson learned.  Don&#x27;t screw the top on while the contents are hot / warm.  Wait until it has cooled.  Then you will have no drip problems.</li>
            <li> These are great spray bottles. They are a great size and spray well without leaking.</li>
            <li> These bottles have worked well and they don&#x27;t collapse as bad as other spray bottles I&#x27;ve used. The spray nozzle does drizzle a bit with warm contents, but can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> These bottles are constructed well enough but there isn&#x27;t much between fine mist and laser beam launch. I wanted a nice even spray for hair products, these are not for that. I now use them for cleaning products and homemade febreze. They are a decent size too. One other gripe I have is that once you are down to about an inch or more of product, it won&#x27;t spray unless it is level. I would have preferred a longer spray tube so it would get the last bit of liquid better.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works perfectly. As long as one can figure out how to work them. lol, its not hard.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to hold and the trigger stopped working after less than 100 pulls. I own a sign business and have yet to find the perfect spray bottle for the application fluids I use.</li>
            <li> The piston too small not enough presure for liquid be spraying.</li>
            <li> These bottles are cheap and thin. I&#x27;ve tried to use 2 of them so far and both of the bottles broke by the threads when I had the sprayer screwed on. This happened the first day I tried using them. I&#x27;m just going to trash the other 4 bottles since when the bottles crack the sprayer is still in your hand and the bottle falls to the ground spilling its contents creating a big mess.</li>
            <li> These spray bottles were exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;I currently have 3 of them for various different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1 for just water (used it when i was cutting my girls&#x27; hair)&lt;br /&gt;1 for plants- water and fertilizer&lt;br /&gt;1 for cleaning- water and bleach&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find a use for the other 3.  Since they are individually wrapped, i could even give it to someone if they are looking to get one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far it&#x27;s great.  I can adjust the spray from a stream to a mist giving me flexibility in how i want it to spray.&lt;br /&gt;size is convenient - not too big and not too small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(i have bought those cheap $1 ones from walmart before and they were junk.  I couldn&#x27;t even adjust the spray.. it came out in stream in one and the other adjusted ok but it was mostly stream as well and not at all what I was looking for)</li>
            <li> I just use these for spraying water in the kitchen, but they work fine and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with cracking, clogging or the sprayer failing.</li>
            <li> The bottles work fine, but they are certainly not clear and look nothing like the product pictured. The bottles I received are more opaque, taller, have a black top/spray nozzle and have scissors printed all around the bottle. One of the main reasons I chose these spray bottles was that they were described as clear and pictured as such. Not so. Pretty disappointing. The design does not scratch off and takes more than one layer of paint to cover. As I am just using these in my home, it is not critical that the bottles are clear, but if I had purchased them for business, they would have not been usable.</li>
            <li> These bottles are not clear, they are frosted with pictures of black scissors on them. They also have black nozzles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic spray bottle that functions quite well as a plastic spray  bottle...  What more can I say?  It doesn&#x27;t leak (or hasn&#x27;t yet, at any rate), and it&#x27;s clear so you can see the contents.  It&#x27;s somewhat heavy and unwieldy when full, but then, you&#x27;re highly unlikely to be performing ballet maneuvers with 16 ounces of liquid in a spray bottle, so that point&#x27;s kind of moot.</li>
            <li> The bottles I got were larger than the image and had large tacky scissor patterns on them. I guess I wouldn&#x27;t care if I were planning on using them at a salon, but that is not the case. I ended up giving them away because I needed clear ones.</li>
            <li> were advertised as CLEAR, got frosted with black sprayers and non-removeable black scissors painted all over the bottles.... not like photo</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they would look just like the picture, but they look very different.  They are an opaque white with some some sort of bad &amp;#34;hair styling&amp;#34; clip art.  Thankfully, I am just using these for some household cleaners, so it isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but I was disappointed that they weren&#x27;t what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> Small and they work.  Take writing with Sharpee well.  Packaging was ok and shipped on time.  Now I have 6 and won&#x27;t need any for a while.</li>
            <li> These bottles arrived and look NOTHING like the picture. The ones I received are tall, frosted, with pictures of scissors all over them. I&#x27;ll be returning these.</li>
            <li> As described and arrived on time</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size for a spray bottle for any use, whether for cleaning products or homemade products, etc! It is really nice looking-- print some cute labels to stick on &amp; it really looks great &amp; tidy.  It does have the adjustable nozzle so you can &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;. That wasn&#x27;t in the description and I was curious about that. I was hoping it would. I&#x27;m listening to the other reviews and not putting any hot water in it... I have ordered other more durable spray bottles for that, but they aren&#x27;t as nice looking as these! :P</li>
            <li> I use them all the time!  I mix my own all natural spider repellent, and slap a label on, and spray away!  They do the job.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast delivery, well made and exactly what I needed, well packaged also- thanks</li>
            <li> I loved them at first.  I bought them because I&#x27;m deployed and needed bottles to use for the communal showers.  After about a month or so of use the spray handle depresses and you can&#x27;t use it.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the bleach/water used or it&#x27;s just a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Love these. I use them throughout the house for homemade detergent.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. I keep white distilled vinegar around the house for cleaning/freshening, and this 6 pack has been put to good use. Unlike cheaper spray bottles, these do not leak. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> good quality, very good quality, i love them all.</li>
            <li> I got this spray bottle set to use for homemade solutions (cleaning, hairspray, etc.)  They seem very sturdy and so far I&#x27;ve no issues with breaking or leaking.  I also like the way they look--simple and clean, easy to label with masking tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave four stars instead of five because they only stream; the nozzle can not be adjusted so that it will spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Actually it seems that 3 of the bottles stream, and 3 have a spray nozzle.  So, you do have choices but not within one bottle.</li>
            <li> I had some flimsy spray bottles from another store where the neck kept breaking off. Was looking for something more compact but better quality. These fit the bill great! The trigger and neck are well put together, the plastic isn&#x27;t flimsy either...more solid and better construction. They are compact (the reservoir is a little small but I knew the volume of it and figured it would be adequate). The compact design, simple but solid construction make them great for what I use them for and they aren&#x27;t an &amp;#34;eye sore&amp;#34; to look at like some spray bottles. Only draw back is the nozzle itself....it&#x27;s a really wide spray (good volume though) and so when you dial it back to lessen the volume, the spray gets really wide and results in overspray of the solution. Not a real problem per say but I think it could use a little work.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, sprays well.  I like that you get several per package.</li>
            <li> I love these squirt bottles! I clean my chicken coop with all natural cleaners that I make myself and these bottles make dispensing easy.&lt;br /&gt;My Orange Peel Coop Cleaner and Lavender Mint Refresh Spray are easy to spray as needed once strained into these squirt bottles. The bottles are pretty good quality and don&#x27;t jam or stop working so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Eggs Daily</li>
            <li> Good product at a nice price. I use them for mixing water with essential oils to kill or repel insects and art projects.</li>
            <li> I make my own hair and skin tonics.  I love this sturdy plastic bottle.  The nozzle is perfect for spraying water solutions in my hair.  I like it so much that I bought another 6 bottles which I use for different solutions.  I highly recommend this bottle!</li>
            <li> I gave two six month old kittens, and if it were not for these spray bottles, filled with water, I would never be able to control their behavior.  The spray setting is adjustable so I put it on a gentle spray.  The sound and just seeing the bottle is enough to keep them away from the front door.  They no longer try to scoot outside.  I want them to be inside only cats, protected and safe.  These bottles have saved me a lot of anxiety and have probably saved their lives.  That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I use these bottles for the oils I use in my hair and they are awesome! Just the right size</li>
            <li> A few handles was broken</li>
            <li> I bought these for correcting my animals when they are misbehaving (my birds chew on my shoes, my dog gets on the furniture). Prior to the arrival of these bottles, they were pretty brazen creatures. Now &amp;#34;no means no&amp;#34; -- they hear &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; and fear the bottle. I&#x27;m master of my domain again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally, these work like I&#x27;d want them to: they have a screw nozzle that can change the spray shape from &amp;#34;wide/mist&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;narrow/jet.&amp;#34; In jet mode they spray a good 6 feet at least. Of course for animals, the jet is what we need. But I also now use a few of these for other purposes - I keep a light bleach/water mixture in the bathroom for easily removing mildew stains on the grout. I spray some of my plants with vinegar/dishsoap and water to remove aphids/ants. The wider spray/mist pattern is better in these cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bottles work great for all those purposes. I do have one bottle (out of 9 that I&#x27;ve bought) which seems to leak a little out of the handle when I spray from it but it still works fine. Otherwise they have been totally reliable and functional.</li>
            <li> These bottles are just right for many uses around the house:  spritzing my hair, lightly dampening clothing to smooth wrinkles, stopping furniture-scratching kittens, washing windows, etc.  Perfectly sized and shaped, the bottle fits comfortably for short or extended duration.  Still finding uses for my new favorite spray bottle.</li>
            <li> These are great quality. Sturdy, thicker plastic with a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; spray mechanism. The (homemade) product I put in them has some residue that accumulates at the bottom and I have had no issues with clogging. They work like a champ. Only complaint that might be relevant to some people is the bottles, whether from shipping or manufacturing method, all have dents that don&#x27;t want to come out. They don&#x27;t bother me, nor do the affect the effectiveness, but if you are, for example, buying these to fill and sell, this might prove to be an issue aesthetically.</li>
            <li> Wanted glass, it was not clearly advertised</li>
            <li> Pump works nicely, perfect for mixes using my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Very easy to carry around when cleaning</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Thieves Oil blend.</li>
            <li> These bottles were exactly what I needed for my home made cleaners.  The bottle itself is very sturdy and the nozzle has a wide range of spray types.  They made excellent gifts this year!</li>
            <li> I use these to keep auto detailing chemicals in. Even using them for degreaser does not appear to affect the quality. I ordered two sets and have not had a single problem. They feel sturdy and I like the size a lot for what I use them for. They produce either a fine mist, or a sharp stream.</li>
            <li> These bottles are not Lear as advertised...they have images of black scissors going all the way around them...I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with this because I didn&#x27;t buy them for hair purposes. I just wish I&#x27;d get what I ordered, for once....</li>
            <li> These met my needs for the most part, but the sprayer tends to drip more than other bottles I have.  One of them had to be tossed as it dripped so bad it was useless.  I guess for the price they are meeting my needs.  Time will tell - one of them is now kind of clogged up and had to be tossed after using for a month.  So, I guess you get what you pay for.  Again, Ok for the money.  I might even buy them again if needed due to the cheap price.</li>
            <li> I bought these so I could have my homemade cleansers easily available in nice spray bottles and these definitely do that.  They are good quality and I will update my review when I fill the bottles and use them.  In the past, the sprayers always gave me problems.  I am hoping these won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> received item promptly and as promised thank you</li>
            <li> 6 of them for a cheap price! It worked! there&#x27;s more in the pack than I needed, so I gave half of them to my mom and the three that I used works perfectly. The different nozzle settings makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality, after first use, only 1 remained in usable condition.</li>
            <li> I have owned these spray bottles for about one year and they are excellent. They are hard plastic and do not get soft in sunlight. The spraying mechanism is excellent and is very reliable. Mine came as pictured with clear plastic.</li>
            <li> These were great. I use them for home made cleaning products, some of which have soaps in them that can clog other spray bottles, but these have a little filtering piece at the end of the spray tube that is inside the bottle so no pieces get sucked up and clog the sprayer. They are sturdy and a good size. All of the bottles work beautifully. We have been using them for a while and they are still holding up. No leaking or having the liquid from the bottle dribble out of the sprayer when I&#x27;m using it. They feel nice and sturdy, and the clear color looks good too.</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap barely even work</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for homemade cleaners.  It worked very well, had a nice spray and the bottles are very attractive.  They seemed very sturdy for my use so far.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  Fill them with water, squirt, squirt, squirt the dryness away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only used 2 so far.  Got them to use to mist reptile enclosures and have had no troubles yet.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mention problems after using hot water, so I likely wont try that.</li>
