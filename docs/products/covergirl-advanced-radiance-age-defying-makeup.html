            <li>I got a really good deal here with a coupon on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love!!!  </li>
            <li>Great product  love it</li>
            <li>It goes on smothly and looks great but the scent of the foundation gives me a huge headache.  </li>
            <li>(although sometimes their special coupons are a great deal as well).</li>
            <li>It light and creamy and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Great quality, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines.</li>
            <li>This makeup doesn&#x27;t accentuate them like so many others do.  </li>
            <li>Love how it feels going on.</li>
            <li>I love CoverGirl and will opt for this brand over others.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for years and am still satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I recommend this to my friend, and will order again soon :)</li>
            <li>Love it, and love to buy as an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is my favorite make-up of all time, no exaggeration.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love it.</li>
            <li>There is a plunger mechanism that rises and pushes the makeup to the top as you pump it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Natural looking , great coverage..</li>
            <li>Most likely will be great when it warms up here</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me I have beautiful skin and my face looks younger than I am.  </li>
            <li>I found this make up a perfect match for my skin, very moisturizing and good coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li>It literally felt like a cloud rubbing on my face that jesus himself planted his perfect little feet on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Cover Girl fan, so</li>
            <li>In my opinion,  this covers but has a clean look.</li>
            <li>Really it will give you a radiance, smooth and glowing effect!</li>
            <li>Great coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>Remarkable -- no comparison between Advanced Radiance and any of the others I&#x27;ve tried over the past 10+</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with very large pores.  </li>
            <li>but this worked very very well...</li>
            <li>I have used this makeup for several years now and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advanced Radiance is the one -- it goes on smoothly and does not highlight creases or wrinkles; it does not get blotchy and it does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>no longer have young skin, so finding a make-up that looks natural and enhances my appearance is not as easy as it once was.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Blends very well.</li>
            <li>if you accidentally apply too much, you just need a tissue to get rid of the excess.</li>
            <li>I really like that it is a pump as it is easier to apply.  </li>
            <li>and really don&#x27;t see the advantage of using pricier foundations.....</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it quickly, and as a bonus, I paid less than I did for the last bottle at my local &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; drug store + free shipping.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>It is the right shade for my skin tone and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>And, because you can see through the top half of the bottle, you can always tell exactly how much you have left.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have a pink undertone and even the lightest shade was a bit dark for me in mid-winter months.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and had no issue with the formula.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a soft and natural look.</li>
            <li>i like this product because it matches my natural skin tone.  </li>
            <li>But - wow -</li>
            <li>I love that it has SPF, and it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li>This particular foundation feels cakey when put on, so I usually make sure to use moisturizer underneath and not wait for it to completely dry before applying the foundation.</li>
            <li>and I always know that Classic Ivory by Cover Girl is going to work with my skintone, so this was no different.</li>
            <li>By the next morning my whole face burned and was all red.  </li>
            <li>It does give my skin a soft healthy glow, even when I&#x27;m tired.  </li>
            <li>smoth finish and is very flattering, not too heavy and does not clog pores, looks smoth and natural, thank you</li>
            <li>After stopping at all the major retail drug stores over a period of several months, I decided to try finding it online</li>

            <li> It covered up, but didn&#x27;t cover up too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a product that works and is not too dark.</li>
            <li> I knew that this color would work for me before ordering because I have used Cover Girl foundation in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several years and will be sorry to see it go.  </li>
            <li> hard to purchase on line....</li>
            <li> I wore it only one day, and by afternoon I was itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I am a little disappointed with the amount of coverage this product gives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried very expensive foundations ( chanel, lancome)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this foundation.  I have been cursed with very large pores.  This makeup doesn&#x27;t accentuate them like so many others do.  I do recommend a powder over it if you have oily skin.  My skin looks oily soon after putting it on if I don&#x27;t use powder.  My face does have a tendency to be oily anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years. Everyone tells me I have beautiful skin and my face looks younger than I am.  I have found no reason to switch!</li>
            <li> I have used this makeup for several years now and I love it. It is the right shade for my skin tone and it does not dry out my skin. It gives my skin a soft and natural look. Amazon has the best price out there.</li>
            <li> This makeup was heaven in a bottle. It literally felt like a cloud rubbing on my face that jesus himself planted his perfect little feet on. I&#x27;ve never been so happy in my life. It light and creamy and smells so good. My skin looks so soft and pretty. It covered up, but didn&#x27;t cover up too heavy. I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> I know I have sensitive skin, but I have never had a foundation give me such a bad rash as this one.  I wore it only one day, and by afternoon I was itching like crazy.  By the next morning my whole face burned and was all red.  I have no idea what caused this, but there is no way I can ever use it again.</li>
            <li> I found this make up a perfect match for my skin, very moisturizing and good coverage without being heavy.</li>
            <li> It goes on smothly and looks great but the scent of the foundation gives me a huge headache.  I regret buying this. foundation. Why is it scented I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Awesome skin match. Love how it feels going on.</li>
            <li> Nice product! I have very sensitive skin, and had no issue with the formula. I am fair skinned and have a pink undertone and even the lightest shade was a bit dark for me in mid-winter months. Most likely will be great when it warms up here and I get a bit of sun.</li>
            <li> Been using this a long time, works well for me!</li>
            <li> I have used this color in this brand in all different forms - cream to powder, mousse, liquid, etc. and I like them all.  Will continue to use it - I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have light skin, and this blended perfectly. I have a hard time finding a product that works and is not too dark. I love CoverGirl and will opt for this brand over others.</li>
            <li> Have used this forever it seems and still very happy with its quality, coverage, smooth application. I don&#x27;t even need powder over it to control oil and shine. I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!!!  I&#x27;ve tried very expensive foundations ( chanel, lancome) they don&#x27;t cover as well as this nor do they stay on all day. Cant find this in local stores so Amazon is the only place to get it!  Natural looking , great coverage..no complaints at all!!  Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> hard to purchase on line....(chossing color) but this worked very very well...good product</li>
            <li> I knew that this color would work for me before ordering because I have used Cover Girl foundation in the past. I love that it has SPF, and it&#x27;s not too thick. Blends very well.</li>
            <li> Actually, I am a little disappointed with the amount of coverage this product gives. I feel like the product description was misleading. Si, I will not purchase this product, again, in the future.</li>
            <li> i like this product because it matches my natural skin tone.  then i put on 3 tones of rouge and i&#x27;m done.  it is somewhat oily but it dries in seconds.  if you accidentally apply too much, you just need a tissue to get rid of the excess. i have been using this product for years and am still satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product&amp;#60;3 Really it will give you a radiance, smooth and glowing effect! I recommend this to my friend, and will order again soon :)</li>
            <li> I buy the CG 110 shade regularly so I know what to expect. Love it, and love to buy as an &amp;#34;Add-On&amp;#34; on Amazon because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than CVS (although sometimes their special coupons are a great deal as well).</li>
            <li> This is my favorite make-up of all time, no exaggeration.  It has truer color and a consistency that virtually disappears into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have young skin, so finding a make-up that looks natural and enhances my appearance is not as easy as it once was.&lt;br /&gt;Advanced Radiance is the one -- it goes on smoothly and does not highlight creases or wrinkles; it does not get blotchy and it does not dry out my skin.  But - wow - It does give my skin a soft healthy glow, even when I&#x27;m tired.  And, if I put it on at 7 in the morning, my skin still looks good at 7 pm.  Remarkable -- no comparison between Advanced Radiance and any of the others I&#x27;ve tried over the past 10+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback has been that it&#x27;s hard to find.  After stopping at all the major retail drug stores over a period of several months, I decided to try finding it online (is there anything you can&#x27;t find at Amazon?)  I was thrilled to find it quickly, and as a bonus, I paid less than I did for the last bottle at my local &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; drug store + free shipping.  Gotta love it.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit heavier than I expected--but that was just my preference.  I want a lighter coverage, so I mix this with a primer and it works well.  I&#x27;m a huge Cover Girl fan, so I&#x27;ll try a different CG formula next time.  Also, this was a bit lighter in color than I expected.  Next time, I think I&#x27;ll go one or even two shades darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CG foundation for years, but this liquid foundation bottle design of theirs is the best! There is a plunger mechanism that rises and pushes the makeup to the top as you pump it out of the bottle. When all is said and done, all is used and gone! No more shaking or swabbing the bottle to get that last little bit out. And, because you can see through the top half of the bottle, you can always tell exactly how much you have left.</li>
            <li> If you use this product, consider stocking up on it.  I heard it is being discontinued.  I have used it for several years and will be sorry to see it go.  I really like that it is a pump as it is easier to apply.  The price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great quality, goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t settle into pores or fine lines. Unfortunately, I have super pale Irish skin &amp; this color is too dark for me, giving a mask-like effect.</li>
            <li> smoth finish and is very flattering, not too heavy and does not clog pores, looks smoth and natural, thank you</li>
            <li> I got a really good deal here with a coupon on Amazon. This particular foundation feels cakey when put on, so I usually make sure to use moisturizer underneath and not wait for it to completely dry before applying the foundation. It does an excellent job covering up all my flaws (I have rosacea) and I always know that Classic Ivory by Cover Girl is going to work with my skintone, so this was no different. I prefer the Maybelleine Age Defiance foundation over this one for how it feels, but not for the coloring.</li>
            <li> Great coverage without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and am always happy with it.</li>
            <li> and really don&#x27;t see the advantage of using pricier foundations.....I have had both.  In my opinion,  this covers but has a clean look.</li>
            <li> Great product  love it</li>
