            <li>and everyday I use it or show it off one of my best ::))</li>
            <li>But seemed to come out if tune easily.</li>
            <li>- Amazon was very quick and helpful with the return</li>
            <li>Smooth operation.</li>
            <li>and I recomment this company the fire red cast iron liner works great for the price and weight</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t enjoy it...</li>
            <li>Nice quality product thanks.</li>
            <li>Hope to get a free tattoo as well.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a tube to fit properly...tried everything...just does not work.</li>
            <li>Also the cheap coffin box it comes in looks like there&#x27;s mold on the inside.</li>
            <li>The materials and coils are cheap garbage.</li>
            <li>Got a solid machine for real cheap!</li>
            <li>Better to invest in higher quality gun.</li>
            <li>Also looks pretty rad :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>, If you&#x27;re looking for a cool frame .. go ahead and buy this.</li>
            <li>This tattoo grinder looks cool...</li>
            <li>The design is cool.</li>
            <li>~~~ WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FAST SHIPPING :)))</li>
            <li>Unfortunantly, looks are the only good thing about this machine.</li>
            <li>To everyone who is just starting out you may think it&#x27;s a good machine.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had spare parts that I could put into this thing.</li>
            <li>I love my new tattoo machine I got</li>
            <li>I put new springs in it and it worked ok for a shader machine.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get this stylish new machine.</li>
            <li>I had a little glitch and it was handled quickly with great care</li>
            <li>The coffin case is pretty cool too, except the company put a barcode sticker on the front of it and when I took the barcode sticker off it ripped some of the front of the box off.</li>
            <li>Box was fun as well.</li>
            <li>Very weak coils with a frame too small to mount better coils, at best this gun is a good color packer.</li>
            <li>other than that its a really good gun</li>
            <li>something should be done to make it right.</li>
            <li>had to replace the coils right away</li>
            <li>The 10 wrap coils push just the right amount.</li>
            <li>So, unless buying a cool frame is worth $9 plus what you&#x27;ll spend on new coils, springs, armature bar, binding posts, and contact screw is worth it, than don&#x27;t bother..</li>
            <li>I like this machine very much</li>
            <li>So I got the machine very fast.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much adjusted to the right setting right out of the box.</li>
            <li>In the first 5 min.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well once</li>
            <li>Thanks I would recomended!</li>
            <li>Thanks I would recomended!</li>
            <li>Other than that we love it!</li>
            <li>, it is pretty and it fits in our tattoo machine carrying case.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner or even a seasoned pro</li>
            <li>The paint was pretty chipped up.  </li>
            <li>It does an awesome job and not as heavy as a couple of other ones we have.</li>
            <li>The packaging and the colors on the gun certainly catches the eye.</li>
            <li>Nice little gun and conversation piece.</li>
            <li>Looks badass and works great not much more you could ask for!!</li>
            <li>Fast and.speedy.</li>
            <li>thanks again.  </li>
            <li>It is very well put together.</li>
            <li>but I came in the mail already tuned and ready to go</li>
            <li>very well balanced runs .</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>i was very surprised after just a little tuning the machine runs smooth as silk !!</li>
            <li>The cool coffin case is a customer talk about subject because they find it cool.</li>
            <li>This liner is not only cool looking</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s less visually appealing.</li>
            <li>decent machine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hardware, A-bar and terminals are not the same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even worthy as a display</li>
            <li>but it should at least work for a second or so LOL</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to put on your rubber band before using and make sure you don&#x27;t have it on too tight to avoid over heating.</li>
            <li>This machine is also great for the tattooist that cant afford the expensive machines like myself.</li>
            <li>but i assumed it would at least run on its own.</li>
            <li>Right out of the packaging there are multiple chips in the paint and the machine looks like it had been dropped on the ground.</li>
            <li>obviously I got this as a tattoo apprenticeship this is not for working on human skin don&#x27;t buy these cheap machines unless you&#x27;re using them for learning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more of a dark maroon than black/bright red.</li>
            <li>SO COOL OTHER</li>
            <li>it worked fine for like 2-3 tattoos but halfway through the 4th one the screw that was holding the front coil down fell out &amp; the threads were stripped out!</li>
            <li>it does get hot with long sessions.</li>
            <li>needs a lot of work to be a professional machine but can be done.</li>
            <li>I did receive it early</li>
            <li>All it needs is different springs and rewind the coils with real copper wire.</li>
            <li>it looks cool but it wont hold up under actual use long at all.  </li>
            <li>Poor decision, buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Gun is more purple red than the black and red</li>
            <li>Can (obviously) be used as all in one gun, but with weak coils only would work good as a color packer.</li>
            <li>But based on the average rating, I&#x27;d say you a 50/50 chance of getting something useful.</li>
            <li>Coils have a solder point literally on the outside of the gun, with a capacitor completely visible.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for a xmas present first it did not say it would take extra long time to ship.</li>
            <li>There are cheap plastic washers instead of metal along with a few other pieces that are not what is shown in the picture.</li>

            <li> decent machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hardware, A-bar and terminals are not the same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even worthy as a display</li>
            <li> but it should at least work for a second or so LOL</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to put on your rubber band before using and make sure you don&#x27;t have it on too tight to avoid over heating.</li>
            <li> This machine is also great for the tattooist that cant afford the expensive machines like myself.</li>
            <li> but i assumed it would at least run on its own.</li>
            <li> Right out of the packaging there are multiple chips in the paint and the machine looks like it had been dropped on the ground.</li>
            <li> obviously I got this as a tattoo apprenticeship this is not for working on human skin don&#x27;t buy these cheap machines unless you&#x27;re using them for learning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more of a dark maroon than black/bright red.</li>
            <li> SO COOL OTHER</li>
            <li> it worked fine for like 2-3 tattoos but halfway through the 4th one the screw that was holding the front coil down fell out &amp; the threads were stripped out!</li>
            <li> it does get hot with long sessions.</li>
            <li> needs a lot of work to be a professional machine but can be done.</li>
            <li> I did receive it early</li>
            <li> All it needs is different springs and rewind the coils with real copper wire.</li>
            <li> it looks cool but it wont hold up under actual use long at all.  </li>
            <li> Poor decision, buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Gun is more purple red than the black and red</li>
            <li> Can (obviously) be used as all in one gun, but with weak coils only would work good as a color packer.</li>
            <li> But based on the average rating, I&#x27;d say you a 50/50 chance of getting something useful.</li>
            <li> Coils have a solder point literally on the outside of the gun, with a capacitor completely visible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a xmas present first it did not say it would take extra long time to ship.</li>
            <li> There are cheap plastic washers instead of metal along with a few other pieces that are not what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time was just what expected ONLY PROBLEMTHEY PUT STICKER ON COFFIN BOX THAT TORE BOX WHEN REMOVED,</li>
            <li> I did have a few hiccups at first, the tube holder was too small</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> Was what i expected.</li>
            <li> and what I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I disliked was that I had to buy a  set of metric wrenches to  tighten up the bolts after the 15th use.  </li>
            <li> every tube I put in it keeps slipping toward the motor</li>
            <li> And the coffin box came kinda crushed.</li>
            <li> The machine was wrapped in plastic and also I closed in the coffin case and there was absolutey no damage to it.  </li>
            <li> they wernot wrapped right so they would fail.</li>
            <li> Had to make a  few minor adjustments to it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve shown other people and everyone loves it</li>
            <li> Gun worked good at first doing color but then tried lining and the tattoo turned out bad customer was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> But it comes down to this ....</li>
            <li> Got here in about half the estimated time.</li>
            <li> THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE DISAPOINTING SINCE IT LOOKS</li>
            <li> boy this little guy is heavy made of cast iron</li>
            <li> This gun is heavy and it took some getting used to, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I feel something is missing from this gun cause</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see how someone can sell something so torn up with pieces missing.</li>
            <li> to bad they put the sticker right on the front of the box tho</li>
            <li> got it for the case mostly as a small show piece..</li>
            <li> love the gun but the coffin is a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> I know I read some negative reviews about this gun</li>

            <li> i am not happy with that part of this product.</li>

            <li> Looks like a crap spray paint job.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Horrible, came to my house and all the screws are stripped can&#x27;t even use</li>
            <li> dont look at the price, the quality is horrible!</li>
            <li> Also the vise that holds the stem in place is terrible.</li>

            <li> For the price this is a very nice machine. it does get hot with long sessions. but all in all its a good machine that i would buy again</li>
            <li> Luckily I had spare parts that I could put into this thing. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles for the amount I paid .. but i assumed it would at least run on its own. No such luck. I contacted the seller to see what my options were, they never got back to me.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, If you&#x27;re looking for a cool frame .. go ahead and buy this. otherwise .. find something else.</li>
            <li> boy this little guy is heavy made of cast iron that&#x27;s to be expected obviously I got this as a tattoo apprenticeship this is not for working on human skin don&#x27;t buy these cheap machines unless you&#x27;re using them for learning please have some respect for the person that you&#x27;re working on this is a great practice machine love the box cool design my boss was impressed that it ran pretty well on the clip cord</li>
            <li> Nice little gun and conversation piece.</li>
            <li> After getting this machine today I decided to get it out and run one.Looks are good.So I adjusted it,and off we go.In the first 5 min. I decided to switch back to ole&#x27; Sparky.The machine is a very good machine.But out of the box It needed tuning and adjusting.I opted to replace the springs with spring steel springs.The coils are ten wrap so no change there.After replacing the springs(I do this on all my machines}and tuning it.Off we go.Now it is a great gun for the money.The balance is good.Smooth operation.Worked flawless for 3 hours.No heat buildup,skipping,etc.</li>
            <li> machine is excellent and works great, needed tuning of course but they all do. definately a great machine for the price.</li>
            <li> decent machine. it gets the job done</li>
            <li> This gun is heavy and it took some getting used to, but it works well. The packaging and the colors on the gun certainly catches the eye.</li>
            <li> Was what i expected. Works pretty well once you  tune it a bit.</li>
            <li> Horrible, came to my house and all the screws are stripped can&#x27;t even use</li>
            <li> Like I already wrote reviews on this company and other products I already bought from this company they are awesome and I recomment this company the fire red cast iron liner works great for the price and weight is perfect for me. If you a begginer or advance tattooist it would be a good buy</li>
            <li> Every thing was wonderful.....on time.....and what I expected. Great customer service.....they were very friendly and polite. I had a little glitch and it was handled quickly with great care</li>
            <li> Very weak coils with a frame too small to mount better coils, at best this gun is a good color packer. Can (obviously) be used as all in one gun, but with weak coils only would work good as a color packer. I&#x27;m currently a tattoo apprentice and have had this machine evaluated by several pro artist. Better to invest in higher quality gun. Even if it&#x27;s less visually appealing.</li>
            <li> I love my new tattoo machine I got and everyday I use it or show it off one of my best ::))</li>
            <li> not worth the money and I don&#x27;t enjoy it... I guess you get why you pay for... its good to hang up, but not to use.</li>
            <li> I like this machine very much and after I tuned it the way that I like I&#x27;m happy with it. I did have a few hiccups at first, the tube holder was too small so I had to put a screwdriver in and push it apart slightly (not a big deal). The only things I don&#x27;t like is that the lock screw for the contact screw is plastic, I plan on picking up a metal one from a hardware store. It looks very cool and seems to be built well. The coffin case is pretty cool too, except the company put a barcode sticker on the front of it and when I took the barcode sticker off it ripped some of the front of the box off.</li>
            <li> This tattoo grinder looks cool...its even lite weight .... But it comes down to this .... Its weak  ... It has like no power no matter u adjust the reps ... Not worth it</li>
            <li> Got here in about half the estimated time. She is absolutely beautiful! Had to make a  few minor adjustments to it but she runs beautifully! I am absolutely in love with this machine! Great beginner machine for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this machine.. Looks badass and works great not much more you could ask for!! Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Fast and.speedy. delivery. Nice quality product thanks.</li>
            <li> bought this for my son. actually better than I thought it was going to be. he rebuilds and makes custom tattoo machines and he loved it. to bad they put the sticker right on the front of the box tho</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product, will buy from again, A++!</li>
            <li> This T-mach is awesome I tuned it up and it runs like a champ love the box, thanks again.  happy holidays</li>
            <li> product is good, works fine! It was what I expect.Thanks I would recomended! product is good, works fine! It was what I expect.Thanks I would recomended!</li>
            <li> It worked good the first time after tuning. But seemed to come out if tune easily. Great for the price and great for practicing maintenance. Also looks pretty rad :)</li>
            <li> Out of 4 Liner machines this is the best one that we own! It does an awesome job and not as heavy as a couple of other ones we have. This liner is not only cool looking but it is low maintenance as well. It is very well put together. The only thing that I disliked was that I had to buy a  set of metric wrenches to  tighten up the bolts after the 15th use.  Other than that we love it! The cool coffin case is a customer talk about subject because they find it cool. I like the satin liner, it is pretty and it fits in our tattoo machine carrying case. It is pretty much adjusted to the right setting right out of the box. Don&#x27;t forget to put on your rubber band before using and make sure you don&#x27;t have it on too tight to avoid over heating. The design is cool. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li> I feel something is missing from this gun cause every tube I put in it keeps slipping toward the motor</li>
            <li> Love the gun, great for my son in law Jake Collins ! Hope to get a free tattoo as well.</li>
            <li> I know I read some negative reviews about this gun but I came in the mail already tuned and ready to go I have used it for about 4 tattoos each one varying in time from 2 hours to 5 hours and it works excellent</li>
            <li> dont look at the price, the quality is horrible!</li>
            <li> This machine is Great for the price, One of the best liners I have. This machine is also great for the tattooist that cant afford the expensive machines like myself. If you are a beginner or even a seasoned pro this machine would be a great addition to anyones collection.</li>
            <li> Very good machine 1of my favorite</li>
            <li> it looks cool but it wont hold up under actual use long at all.  got it for the case mostly as a small show piece..</li>
            <li> AWESOME BUY ~~~ WILL PURCHASE AGAIN FAST SHIPPING :)))</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get a tube to fit properly...tried everything...just does not work. And the coffin box came kinda crushed. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Its ok for the price u get what you pay for I guess but it is ok just one more to add  To the collection</li>
            <li> dont buy it it not a really good gun the only thing that i like was the case but the gun its ugly</li>
            <li> Its a great machine frame i don&#x27;t know about right out of the box i changed the coils and springs as soon as i got it. I only wanted the frame</li>
            <li> Got this for my uncle for Christmas he is a tattoo artist haven&#x27;t given it to him yet but I&#x27;ve shown other people and everyone loves it</li>
            <li> Coils have a solder point literally on the outside of the gun, with a capacitor completely visible. Not even an attempt to hide it. Looks like a crap spray paint job. Even the bolt for my needle was on backwards according to the pictures these people have posted. Also, no capacitor in the pictures they show. Gun is more purple red than the black and red the pictures make it look like. Overall just a crap machine. Wont even attempt to use it, and the box, why have a sticker on the top with the upc sharpied out when i can still read it? Cant even use that for anything. Poor decision, buy at your own risk. Could be ok for a paper weight.</li>
            <li> needs a lot of work to be a professional machine but can be done.</li>
            <li> love the gun but the coffin is a piece of crap! i don&#x27;t see how someone can sell something so torn up with pieces missing. the stickers you put on it also tore up the coffin.  i am not happy with that part of this product. something should be done to make it right.</li>
            <li> I put new springs in it and it worked ok for a shader machine. So if you are looking for a back up machine this is the one.</li>
            <li> it worked fine for like 2-3 tattoos but halfway through the 4th one the screw that was holding the front coil down fell out &amp; the threads were stripped out!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a xmas present first it did not say it would take extra long time to ship. I did receive it early but I got it and there is not box with it and it is just in a envolpe with bag around it. I would not order from here again.</li>
            <li> Received this tattoo machine yesterday and tried it out after tuning it for a shader and it works perfectly plus it looks kool.</li>
            <li> Right out of the packaging there are multiple chips in the paint and the machine looks like it had been dropped on the ground. There are cheap plastic washers instead of metal along with a few other pieces that are not what is shown in the picture. It&#x27;s also more of a dark maroon than black/bright red. Also the cheap coffin box it comes in looks like there&#x27;s mold on the inside. I will never buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> item arrived on time was just what expected ONLY PROBLEMTHEY PUT STICKER ON COFFIN BOX THAT TORE BOX WHEN REMOVED, THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE DISAPOINTING SINCE IT LOOKS SO COOL OTHER THAN THAT IT IS GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> had to replace the coils right away they wernot wrapped right so they would fail. other than that its a really good gun</li>
            <li> Sturdy design. I love it. The 10 wrap coils push just the right amount. Box was fun as well.</li>
            <li> Gun worked good at first doing color but then tried lining and the tattoo turned out bad customer was very unhappy. I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> The gun worked for an hour then it cut out and quit working.</li>
            <li> love them ..tune em they work fine</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get this stylish new machine. Unfortunantly, looks are the only good thing about this machine. The materials and coils are cheap garbage. So, unless buying a cool frame is worth $9 plus what you&#x27;ll spend on new coils, springs, armature bar, binding posts, and contact screw is worth it, than don&#x27;t bother..Although i see a lot of mixed reviews about it. Maybe i got a bad one. But based on the average rating, I&#x27;d say you a 50/50 chance of getting something useful. It&#x27;s only $9. But hey, that&#x27;s beer money</li>
            <li> Not as advertised, was painted cast alloy, not cast iron.  If it was cast iron a magnet would stick to it.  Extream vibration when running.&lt;br /&gt;Box was useless, edges were torn, had an inventory sticker on to top that was scribbled out.  Cross sticker was pealing.&lt;br /&gt;Hardware, A-bar and terminals are not the same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not even worthy as a display piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been returned. - Amazon was very quick and helpful with the return</li>
            <li> Amazing quality  , and reliable performance . very well balanced runs . very smooth . i am going to buy another for spare</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage. tried my best to make it work well, but wouldnt happen.</li>
            <li> Nice machine for the price. Definitely worth it! The frame isn&#x27;t as glossy as the pic, but it came with better binding posts and contact screw than what was shown. Nice! All it needs is different springs and rewind the coils with real copper wire. Pretty easy. Got a solid machine for real cheap! Thinking about buying another one!</li>
            <li> Received not working, only 9 buxs but it should at least work for a second or so LOL</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shipping</li>
            <li> machine is very nice looking ! i was&#x27;nt sure how well the machine would run considering the costbut i was very surprised after just a little tuning the machine runs smooth as silk !!</li>
            <li> Works well once tuned.</li>
            <li> So I got the machine very fast. The paint was pretty chipped up.  I ordered it cause I like the paint and a ten wrap coil so why would I buy a chipped up one. The machine was wrapped in plastic and also I closed in the coffin case and there was absolutey no damage to it.  So why would a company send out a machine with chipped paint.  To everyone who is just starting out you may think it&#x27;s a good machine. Also the vise that holds the stem in place is terrible. The stem still moves around even know its tightened to the max.  I&#x27;m in the process of returning it. I&#x27;m actually afraid to use this on a customer.  Hope this company resolves this problem.</li>
            <li> Love the gun! Box is cardboard! Not what I thought!</li>
