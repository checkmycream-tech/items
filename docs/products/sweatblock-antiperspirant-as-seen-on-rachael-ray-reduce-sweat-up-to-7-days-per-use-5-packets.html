            <li>Amazon has the best prices, but then once in awhile I find out that there are times.  </li>
            <li>SweatBlock worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>What can I say about this awesome product!</li>
            <li>But it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Easy, breezy!!!</li>
            <li>The roll-on does great.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It worked great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;SweatBlock is a great product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li>great invention.  </li>
            <li>It smells like something from my great grandmothers house, and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the great reviews on it.  </li>
            <li>because until your skin kind of gets used to it, it BURNS!</li>
            <li>I thought the reviews were exaggerating because if it was THAT good, everybody would use it.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I waited because I found the 5 week supply at Walmart for $6!</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li>I returned the product and everything was handled promptly and courteously.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I went out and bought more cute shirts!  </li>
            <li>I was mostly hoping though, that I could basically stop needing to wash my button downs and nice blouses every time I wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Strongly reccommend!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I love the clove smell, but I deal with it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and will keep using it aslong as my budget will allow.</li>
            <li>Each application lasts over a week though I&#x27;m sure the length of time varies from person to person.  </li>
            <li>I asked him if he had any more</li>
            <li>I have no use for the many deodorants I&#x27;ve tried anymore, this is IT.</li>
            <li>I would just fold the top over and tape</li>
            <li>Maybe she will get something more out of them.  </li>
            <li>And was NOT disappointed!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post more the more I use it.</li>
            <li>Now, I make sure that I sleep in almost freezing conditions after I put it on</li>
            <li>But again, it&#x27;s all worth it in the end to not look like a sweating pig at the most inopportune times!</li>
            <li>: ok, I ordered this product again because after I posted my first review, I used the rest of my package and it worked famously.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m nervous, stressed, or even from a light walk, my face is sweating buckets.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product a couple of days ago-so far, so good.</li>
            <li>- hope everyone else has success - I truly understand!</li>
            <li>I have been using it successfully for almost a year, and I am FINALLY able to wear something besides black!</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the different stick antiperspirants and some helped but most did not help at all.  </li>
            <li>received the product quickly and immediately got a follow-up email from the company asking me to call or email them if the product wasn&#x27;t working so that they could assist me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always wonder why so many products that customers give reviews are all so high - they never seem to work for me...</li>
            <li>Worth evey penny to avoid embarrassment of uncontrollable sweating.</li>
            <li>WORTH</li>
            <li>kind of like gin &amp; pine-sol mixed.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be searching for another product on my endless hunt for a good antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This can burn too though if you don&#x27;t follow directions, ie, do NOT apply right after showering or shaving.</li>
            <li>She uses it according to pkg directions and certainly recommends to anyone with excess perspiration issues!</li>
            <li>So I always double check on the Walmart site - and sure enough.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t matter how hot.</li>
            <li>Really?!?</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>First, it took me FOREVER to begin using it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>These work pretty well for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Able to use them easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Now, she absolutely cannot be without it!  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this at first, but after the first day of using it i cant believe how much IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>I do not think I gave it a real chance though, hence the three star, and on the bright side, I did reuse the same wipe several times.  </li>
            <li>with this product - pretty much I do not, under my arms at least.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do have to say this -</li>
            <li>Since trying the first week, I can say with confidence that SweatBlock works very well</li>
            <li>I wrote a verrrrrrry long review on Certain Dri, that you can look up - I&#x27;ll sum it up by saying although slim -I sweat more than anyone</li>
            <li>But only for a couple of days, and has a tendency to run down your arm when you apply it, which isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Never thought I would find a product that would stop the embarrassment of my soaked arm pits and I have been through quite a few of them, I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li>EVERY PENNY TO BE CONFIDENT AND DRY!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you really let it dry and sleep in conditions in which you would not sweat!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing, I was a heavy sweater before, and now that I use it, I don&#x27;t worry about sweat anymore.</li>
            <li>It is a huge confidence boost and will help my clothes last longer.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to really work.  </li>
            <li>I was absolutely determined I was going to find some way to get a handle on this.</li>
            <li>It really works as well as everyone claims it does.</li>
            <li>works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>I t works very well</li>
            <li>Also, I think it smells really yucky...</li>
            <li>I have struggled with embarrassing under arm sweat for years, and have tried many other  products out there, which never fully worked.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING for excessive sweating.</li>
            <li>and we were playing some sporting games together, and he said , wow, this sweat block my professor gave us students to try really works, look no sweat under my arms!</li>
            <li>I sweat what I would consider more than average.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and was also worried about if I&#x27;d get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>put it on last night when I was cool and unsweaty, an hour before bed, after showering.</li>
            <li>I use a warm wet wash cloth to open up the pores and to clean any left over deodorant, then I just dab it on, ( while its still folded).</li>
            <li>The first time I used this and wore a regular light blue t-shirt with it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>My doctor say not to used them very often because it those truly stop completely your armpit sweat and some times you need to let those toxins out.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I guess I have really powerful sweat glands because this product only worked for about 5 hours maximum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been sitting in bed all morning relaxing with my arms pressed to my sides and still no sweat, when normally this is about the smelliest \\&quot;activity\\</li>
            <li>I just switched to a new job in a new industry and was surprised how much I was sweating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though in the long run the price amounts to about only $2.50 a week, the initial cost is kind of a blow to my wallet.</li>
            <li>Try and look for a new product</li>
            <li>(or as for as whites are concerned, live without.)  </li>
            <li>She has no more underarm embarressments and has much more self-confidence.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I first received this product because it completely combated my excessive sweat!</li>
            <li>When I finally used it properly, I really could not tell if it was working or not.  </li>
            <li>I used the clinical strength deodorant, didn&#x27;t work, I used Certain Dry, it helped for a while.</li>
            <li>I have, like many others out there, been embarrassed and uncomfortable by how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>Really, really, really wish I could get it at a lower price and at a local store too, which would save on the shipping cost, or even if the wipes were sold individually that would help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced  no rashes or bad side</li>
            <li>and it works fantastic - at least for me.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if the temperature was more temperate - but that never mattered, whether it was hot or cold, I perspired!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>(weird but effective) but was balking at paying $800+ twice a year.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical because I am pre-menopausal, and as stated on the Sweatblock website, it may not be as effective in this situation.</li>
            <li>It was my last hope, and i am shocked at how great it is.</li>

            <li> It was my last hope, and i am shocked at how great it is.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for this kind of let down.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t sweat alot, but I started to sweat so much, I was having \\&quot;wet spots\\&quot; on my outside shirts...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think I had a crazy problem with sweating too much, but I definitely pitted out my shirts on the daily.</li>
            <li> though I was going to cry, no nasty wet marks!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a thing of the past - something i thought i was gonna have to just live with.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I found Sweatblock, as well as one other product which came in the form of a roll-on.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never given a review like this on Amazon because I&#x27;ve never felt very passionate about a product until now.  </li>
            <li> I just patted the towelette on until the area was very wet, folded it back up and put it in the foil inside a ziploc bag (to try to squeeze out another use) and let it dry without putting any fabrics over it (if you put on a T-shirt or something while it&#x27;s drying, you can wipe it off).</li>
            <li> It does dry you out a bit</li>

            <li> By contrast, my armpits were 100% dry.</li>
            <li> and I have literally tried every single deodorant there is out there</li>
            <li> you can use weekly but for me i can go a little longer and not using quite so often actually prevents itching.</li>
            <li> it closed.  </li>
            <li> All my shirts were tank tops, and if I had a long sleeve it would be black, because I would sweat.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues other than RELIEF of this embarrassing and</li>

            <li> I am not normally an excessive sweater, but I am on a medication that causes annoying nightsweats.</li>
            <li> oh so frustrating problem.</li>
            <li> I would go to put my deodorant on, and be like, \\&quot;Crap, forgot to use that last night</li>
            <li> I would be sitting in my son&#x27;s basketball game, for example, and start sweating.</li>
            <li> It also stings like crazy for at least 15 minutes if not longer.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>

            <li> I sweat profusely for a girl.  When I&#x27;m nervous, stressed, or even from a light walk, my face is sweating buckets.  I know this isn&#x27;t meant for our face, but I still tried it and it works.  It does dry you out a bit and I notice that on some areas (underarms) it doesn&#x27;t work quite well.  I can&#x27;t say I love the clove smell, but I deal with it.  It also stings like crazy for at least 15 minutes if not longer.  I want to rip my face off b/c it&#x27;s so uncomfortable.  But again, it&#x27;s all worth it in the end to not look like a sweating pig at the most inopportune times!</li>
            <li> I wrote a verrrrrrry long review on Certain Dri, that you can look up - I&#x27;ll sum it up by saying although slim -I sweat more than anyone I know (putting it mildly).&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri did not make a dent in the situation.&lt;br /&gt;Then a miracle.  I always wonder why so many products that customers give reviews are all so high - they never seem to work for me... so I almost had to wonder....&lt;br /&gt;BUT - Sweat Block miraculously works for me.  It truly is unbelievable.  I am still cautious, and I use 2 a week.... but it seems to really work.  I do not know if the temperature was more temperate - but that never mattered, whether it was hot or cold, I perspired!&lt;br /&gt;Not with this product - pretty much I do not, under my arms at least.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do have to say this - I did not get it on-line.  Walmart had just increased their price, but it is still under $7.00.  Just thought I would let you know.  Amazon has the best prices, but then once in awhile I find out that there are times.  So I always double check on the Walmart site - and sure enough.&lt;br /&gt;Well - hope everyone else has success - I truly understand!</li>
            <li> Truly amazing, I was a heavy sweater before, and now that I use it, I don&#x27;t worry about sweat anymore.</li>
            <li> I guess I have really powerful sweat glands because this product only worked for about 5 hours maximum. Try and look for a new product</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says....it blocks the sweat. I have, like many others out there, been embarrassed and uncomfortable by how much I sweat. And it doesn&#x27;t matter how hot. If I get nervous, anxious or upset... I sweat. I was thinking it couldn&#x27;t get any worse, then I hit premenopause!!! Really?!? I didn&#x27;t think it could possibly get worse! I was absolutely determined I was going to find some way to get a handle on this. Tried a LOT of different products, which are now wasting away in the back of a cabinet because they didn&#x27;t work well enough. I wanted to STOP sweating. Finally, I found Sweatblock, as well as one other product which came in the form of a roll-on. The roll-on does great. But only for a couple of days, and has a tendency to run down your arm when you apply it, which isn&#x27;t great because until your skin kind of gets used to it, it BURNS! Not something you want going just anywhere when you use it. Then, I tried Sweatblock!! Easy, breezy!!! This can burn too though if you don&#x27;t follow directions, ie, do NOT apply right after showering or shaving. And dab and press on. Do not rub! This stuff definitely lives up to its name!! Did just what it says!! I STOPPED SWEATING!!! At least where I applied it anyway. And even though I always reapply after 7 days, I still haven&#x27;t gotten to the point of sweating again on the 7th day. So I wonder if it might even go beyond 7 days. But now that I have found a way to stay dry, I&#x27;m not gonna risk it. Every 7 days for me. One gripe though. Even though in the long run the price amounts to about only $2.50 a week, the initial cost is kind of a blow to my wallet. Really, really, really wish I could get it at a lower price and at a local store too, which would save on the shipping cost, or even if the wipes were sold individually that would help. Of course, that probably wouldn&#x27;t work because of the extra packaging involved. But, like a lot of things in life, you get what you pay for. Love this stuff and will keep using it aslong as my budget will allow. Totally worth it!!!</li>
            <li> My doctor say not to used them very often because it those truly stop completely your armpit sweat and some times you need to let those toxins out.&lt;br /&gt;But I could finally wear a white shirt again!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.  having stopped using it since i started a year or so ago.  i used always leave yellow stains in my white blouses and shirts.  now i use these and it&#x27;s a thing of the past - something i thought i was gonna have to just live with.  (or as for as whites are concerned, live without.)  you can use weekly but for me i can go a little longer and not using quite so often actually prevents itching.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve had over active sweat glands especially when wearing silk and it was getting annoying.  I was going to Botox under my arms (weird but effective) but was balking at paying $800+ twice a year.  Anyway thought I would try the sweat block and it works fantastic - at least for me.  Each application lasts over a week though I&#x27;m sure the length of time varies from person to person.  I usually use when traveling to minimize any embarrassment when running through airports or lifting baggage into overhead bins....</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING for excessive sweating. I have been using it successfully for almost a year, and I am FINALLY able to wear something besides black! I was a bit skeptical because I am pre-menopausal, and as stated on the Sweatblock website, it may not be as effective in this situation. I have had no issues other than RELIEF of this embarrassing and oh so frustrating problem. It really works as well as everyone claims it does. I recommend it&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with embarrassing under arm sweat for years, and have tried many other  products out there, which never fully worked. It was a small miracle that I actually stumbled upon sweat block. My college son came home one weekend and we were playing some sporting games together, and he said , wow, this sweat block my professor gave us students to try really works, look no sweat under my arms! I asked him if he had any more so I could try it. He did and I have been using it ever since, with NO embarrassing under arm sweat moments again. I give it 5 stars, and have been using it for 5 plus years!</li>
            <li> while applying this it seemed to have an odd smell but it disappeared. I wouldn&#x27;t get it again only because I prefer the roll on application.</li>
            <li> I sweat what I would consider more than average.  I just switched to a new job in a new industry and was surprised how much I was sweating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended Sweatblock, but I must say I was very skeptical.  I&#x27;ve got pretty sensitive skin and was also worried about if I&#x27;d get a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Sweatblock for the last two months.  After two weeks, two applications I literally don&#x27;t sweat.  It is a huge confidence boost and will help my clothes last longer.  I&#x27;ve experienced  no rashes or bad side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got an alert on my calendar to take a shower and apply Sweatblock once a week.  I&#x27;ve never given a review like this on Amazon because I&#x27;ve never felt very passionate about a product until now.  Sweatblock works, period.  I&#x27;m a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Sweatblock!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I have always been self conscience about sweating through my dress shirts.  I have tried many of the different stick antiperspirants and some helped but most did not help at all.  SweatBlock worked perfectly.  I watched the Rachel Ray show trial on YouTube and thought \\&quot;I&#x27;ll try it but it won&#x27;t work that well\\&quot;. Wrong.  It worked great.  Now I can lean back and relax with no worries of pit stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SweatBlock is a great product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> great invention.  works better than expected.  I will be ordering this product from now on.  I t works very well</li>
            <li> It works very well! I didn&#x27;t think anything would help stop the sweating. I highly recommend this product.  I have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviews were exaggerating because if it was THAT good, everybody would use it. I am not normally an excessive sweater, but I am on a medication that causes annoying nightsweats. I was mostly hoping though, that I could basically stop needing to wash my button downs and nice blouses every time I wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product quickly and immediately got a follow-up email from the company asking me to call or email them if the product wasn&#x27;t working so that they could assist me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on last night when I was cool and unsweaty, an hour before bed, after showering. I just patted the towelette on until the area was very wet, folded it back up and put it in the foil inside a ziploc bag (to try to squeeze out another use) and let it dry without putting any fabrics over it (if you put on a T-shirt or something while it&#x27;s drying, you can wipe it off). It was a bit itchy until I went to sleep, but not even as bad as a wool sweater. Last night was one of the worst nights I&#x27;d had yet in terms of night sweats. The areas I had not applied sweatblock to were soaked and I actually  had to change pants, twice due to sweat. By contrast, my armpits were 100% dry. Not a drop of sweat. I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been sitting in bed all morning relaxing with my arms pressed to my sides and still no sweat, when normally this is about the smelliest \\&quot;activity\\&quot; I do. I went and worked out and STILL NO SWEAT. This product is AMAZING. Why does everyone not use it? I have no use for the many deodorants I&#x27;ve tried anymore, this is IT. Since applying this there has not been one drop of sweat that has come out of my armpits. Not one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT.</li>
            <li> Works great! Never thought I would find a product that would stop the embarrassment of my soaked arm pits and I have been through quite a few of them, I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that helps. Inexpensive and effective. Worth evey penny to avoid embarrassment of uncontrollable sweating. This product does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this at first, but after the first day of using it i cant believe how much IT WORKS. Ive tried everything before this, and nothing seemed to work. It was my last hope, and i am shocked at how great it is. Strongly reccommend!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this awesome product! 5 STARS, follow the directions. I used to sweat while sitting down watching TV, not moving, and yes sweat, sweat, sweat. I used the clinical strength deodorant, didn&#x27;t work, I used Certain Dry, it helped for a while. All my shirts were tank tops, and if I had a long sleeve it would be black, because I would sweat. NOW I WEAR WHATEVER I WANT AND I DO NOT SWEAT! WORTH EVERY PENNY TO BE CONFIDENT AND DRY!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in perspiration. I returned the product and everything was handled promptly and courteously.  I appreciate not having any hassles when returning the product and how simple it was.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think I had a crazy problem with sweating too much, but I definitely pitted out my shirts on the daily. Since trying the first week, I can say with confidence that SweatBlock works very well and I haven&#x27;t had pit stains since applying. It smells like something from my great grandmothers house, and I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. It&#x27;s nothing bad though...</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the great reviews on it.  First, it took me FOREVER to begin using it.  It says to put on the night before, and I kept forgetting to do this.  I would go to put my deodorant on, and be like, \\&quot;Crap, forgot to use that last night, I gotta remember tomorrow\\&quot;.  I usually don&#x27;t sweat alot, but I started to sweat so much, I was having \\&quot;wet spots\\&quot; on my outside shirts...YUCK!  Never had that before.  When I finally used it properly, I really could not tell if it was working or not.  Also, I think it smells really yucky...kind of like gin &amp; pine-sol mixed.  I know I know this smell, but just cannot place it.  I do not like it, and it does linger.  I do not think I gave it a real chance though, hence the three star, and on the bright side, I did reuse the same wipe several times.  I would just fold the top over and tape it closed.  I am keeping one wipe that I have left and giving the rest to a friend to try.  Maybe she will get something more out of them.  If this last wipe or my friends opinion make a difference, I will be back to Update...</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that has controled my sweating! I sweat a lot from my underarm and I have literally tried every single deodorant there is out there but all of them were a waste of money. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical about this product when I got it. Read a ton of reviews on several different websites, so I decided to give it a shot And was NOT disappointed!!! It smells a bit like cloves.  It comes in a folded towlette.  I use a warm wet wash cloth to open up the pores and to clean any left over deodorant, then I just dab it on, ( while its still folded). Just hold your arm up for a minute while it dries, then you can go to bed. Just put the folded towel back in a zip lock and reuse it mid week or at the end of the week.  I still use a clinical strength deodorant with it.  It seems to give extra protection just case.  The first time I used this and wore a regular light blue t-shirt with it I though I was going to cry, no nasty wet marks!!!!!!!!  I went out and bought more cute shirts!  Now...... I was reading online that Walmart has this for  like $8 bucks. Every Walmart I went to was sold out!  $8 verses $20 is a BiG difference. Its getting expensive buying this every month. But it is an awesome product. Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me - caused skin irritation</li>
            <li> These work pretty well for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Able to use them easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not used other products but lot less sweat</li>
            <li> I received two boxes of the stuff..it didnt work. I went thru both boxes within less than 2 months. One of the unopened wipes was completely dry when I opened it :( !! Too expensive for this kind of let down.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of days ago-so far, so good. I have had a problem w/ excessive perspiring for some time now. I would be sitting in my son&#x27;s basketball game, for example, and start sweating. Next thing I knew, I would have sweat stains. After going to the dr and trying prescription antiperspirant, nothing was helping. My next option was to get Botox shots in my underarms and I wasn&#x27;t going to do that. If I&#x27;m going to get Botox anywhere it was going to be on my face. I came across this while Googling remedies for underarm perspiration. I just finished working out pretty heavily for 45 minutes and no sweat under my arms! I almost bought it here on Amazon but I&#x27;m glad I waited because I found the 5 week supply at Walmart for $6! I&#x27;ll post more the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I first received this product because it completely combated my excessive sweat! But after two weeks of continued use, the product stopped working almost entirely on my armpits.. I don&#x27;t know if I am doing something wrong or if my body has just gotten used to it and I need something stronger? I guess I&#x27;ll be searching for another product on my endless hunt for a good antiperspirant. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: ok, I ordered this product again because after I posted my first review, I used the rest of my package and it worked famously. The problem that I think I had was that I hadn&#x27;t turned my AC on before going to sleep and sweated if off during the night. Now, I make sure that I sleep in almost freezing conditions after I put it on so it works. Since then, I have had no issue at all with it! Just make sure you really let it dry and sleep in conditions in which you would not sweat!</li>
            <li> We had tried EVERYTHING for our athletic, teenage daughter.  She found Sweatblock by google and we decided to give it a try.  Now, she absolutely cannot be without it!  She has no more underarm embarressments and has much more self-confidence.  She uses it according to pkg directions and certainly recommends to anyone with excess perspiration issues!</li>
