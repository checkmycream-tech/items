            <li>Always have loved this product</li>
            <li>The price was right and the delivery and packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li>and when I run out and have to get a quick fix spray, I&#x27;m never as happy as when I have this one again.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use very strong hold spray in my hair anymore.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair spray, and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better to keep hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so pleased to find this spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my all-time favorite, because it holds, adds shine and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like a helmet head.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Love the line and the product still today.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Still love this product.</li>

            <li>Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is a time tested product and has been around for many years.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this when I had shorter hair was the ability to style my hair with my fingers after I sprayed it</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray.</li>
            <li>The first can, which I ordered quite awhile ago was great, same smell, held my hair beautifully, loved it.</li>
            <li>and it is super shiny too!  </li>
            <li>I love the Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine super spray.</li>
            <li>Even for those who like a light spray/hold.</li>
            <li>For my rockstar hair to stay that way through the day and into the night to my true loves delight.</li>
            <li>My hair is now straight with maybe a little wave at best</li>
            <li>I DO purchase this for my mother who wears her hair in a cute &#x27;pixie-ish&#x27; cut which she blow dries and a few spritzing here and there and her hair is good to go for the day</li>
            <li>Miss the real thing!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>In the late 80&#x27;s early 90&#x27;s was great when I &#x27;scrunched&#x27; my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year and really like it.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing</li>
            <li>but this works very well for that</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>had been searching online for this particular spray and bought the product at another site.  </li>
            <li>Second order, maybe a year or so later, was very disappointing--it had a very strong possible alcohol odor</li>
            <li>Not too heavy for my fine hair but holds well enough.</li>
            <li>and I could barely stand to use it.</li>
            <li>This is one product the company apparently realized did not need to be &amp;</li>
            <li>This is a super stiff spray really not for every day soft hold but rather used to cement (not kidding)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the second can of what used to be my favorite hairspray which is not available in any stores lately. The first can, which I ordered quite awhile ago was great, same smell, held my hair beautifully, loved it. It lasted a long time. Second order, maybe a year or so later, was very disappointing--it had a very strong possible alcohol odor and I could barely stand to use it. What happened?? Miss the real thing!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray, and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and really like it.  It allows me to not have to worry about how I look all day long because I know that my hair will look the way it did when I left the house.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better to keep hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for years and would not switch&lt;br /&gt;to something else.</li>
            <li> For my rockstar hair to stay that way through the day and into the night to my true loves delight. ;-)</li>
            <li> Lasts all day without being stiff</li>
            <li> This is the real thing and I&#x27;m so pleased to find this spray - I have used Paul Mitchell Freeze &amp; Shine Hair Spray for over 20 years.  It&#x27;s my all-time favorite, because it holds, adds shine and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like a helmet head.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching online for this particular spray and bought the product at another site.  I knew immediately that it was a knockoff, because it didn&#x27;t hold and the smell was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This hair spay to me is a good &#x27;go to&#x27; product if I were in a pinch.  That being said I used to use this spray when my hair was permed and cut into a bob haircut In the late 80&#x27;s early 90&#x27;s was great when I &#x27;scrunched&#x27; my hair.  My hair is now straight with maybe a little wave at best and I don&#x27;t use very strong hold spray in my hair anymore.  All of this being said.....  I DO purchase this for my mother who wears her hair in a cute &#x27;pixie-ish&#x27; cut which she blow dries and a few spritzing here and there and her hair is good to go for the day and it is super shiny too!  Love the line and the product still today.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years, but just now thought to get it from Amazon. I absolutely love it. It lasts all day and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Still love this product. As advertised.  Does not leave residue in hair like other sprays. I have been using this about 10 years and when I run out and have to get a quick fix spray, I&#x27;m never as happy as when I have this one again.  Trusty friend. Even for those who like a light spray/hold.</li>
            <li> Ladies if you have thin hair this is the product for you, I am a hair spray junkie and have tried everything on the market, and I just keep going back to my Freeze &amp; Shine!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine is a time tested product and has been around for many years.  This is a super stiff spray really not for every day soft hold but rather used to cement (not kidding) an Up-Do in place.  It smells great, the sprayer does not clog up and it holds perfectly.  I do find that when I use it I prefer to use a clarifying shampoo afterwards as it does tend to build up, hence my recommendation to not use it every day unless you shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this hair spray since the 80&#x27;s!  It works as well now as it ever did then. This is one product the company apparently realized did not need to be &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; only to ruin it. Has a firm hold without looking like hair spray. My favorite thing about this when I had shorter hair was the ability to style my hair with my fingers after I sprayed it and then it dry and hold that style all day. Usually that&#x27;s done with gels and goop these days but this works very well for that and you don&#x27;t end up with two products in your hair.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and like it. Not too heavy for my fine hair but holds well enough.</li>
            <li> The only hair spray I use! Does what it says--freezes my hair in place!</li>
            <li> Always have loved this product</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for. Use it it refill my little trial size for my purse. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years. It keeps the hair firmly in place and brushes out without any trace of using hair spray. The price was right and the delivery and packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the hairspray. I use to use it years ago. I still works the same.</li>
            <li> I love the Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine super spray. I live in the North and use it year round. Great holding power.</li>
            <li> Boy, if you don&#x27;t want your hair to move, this is the spray for you!!</li>
