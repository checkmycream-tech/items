            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of work, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

            <li>hard to get vitamin a. fast service and great price.</li>
            <li>So beta carotene Vitamin A is good for a daily supplement, since your body will only take advantage of it if it needs it, and turn what it needs into Vitamin A.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin A is one of the lesser vitamin categories, since it&#x27;s easy to find in normal food.</li>

            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s now working for my skin is a combination of Vitamin A and Zinc supplements, a low-sugar diet, along with a topical sulfur/resorcinol cream (like Acnomel), salicylic acid toner (I like Clean &amp; Clear), and Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Masque.  </li>
            <li>there not a bad vender, so be careful, when buying this product.</li>
            <li>Since starting this regimen two months ago, my overall production of blackheads has reduced significantly, and some of the stubborn old clogs have washed away in the shower.  </li>

            <li>The soft gels are small and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>because a single capsule gives fast relief to the eyes.</li>

            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who has stiff joints but would also warn them, if you are taking a vitamin supplement regularly, you should skip taking these soft gels to avoid possible vitamin A toxcidity.</li>
            <li> how long it takes to dissolve.  </li>
            <li> This is how long it will take&lt;br</li>
            <li> long to dissolve, therefore I suggest to my daughters&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> These are small soft gel pills.  </li>
            <li> For Adults 50,000 IU every OTHER day helps get a cough up out of your chest, then gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why, to get rid of a cough, it&#x27;s 50,000 IU every OTHER day...</li>
            <li> I take this along with Vitamin E, Fish oil and other supplements for my arthritis.  </li>
            <li> but I felt extremely dizzy after taking them.</li>
            <li> My doctor prescribed this for me, but it was difficult to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Took these a few times a week, drastically helped my allergies.</li>
            <li> It got rid of my sons acne within a few days.</li>
            <li> One star missing because I thought i pay for 2 bottles</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>

            <li> remember, you can &amp;#34;OD&amp;#34; on pure Vitamin A -- meaning too much is BAD for you.  </li>

            <li> A small bottle and it lasts 3 months.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure what it can do</li>
            <li> Small in size.</li>
            <li> As for the benefits, without blood tests, it is difficult to tell, but I have found that when I stop taking these supplements, my joints are achy and stiff.</li>
            <li> i chose this 5 star rating because these are very hard to buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> However, I like to have it on hand in case of sloppy eating habits or for grandchildren.</li>

            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and vendor</li>
            <li> i chose this 5 star rating because these are very hard to buy in stores.  i recommend buying these tablets only on amazon, choose wisely with the venders on this website.  i emailed the vender that was selling this product to me, and i had to make sure that it was coming on time to my house, and they said they would let me know when it would come, and it came almost late to my house.  some venders are not trust worthy sometimes, so choose wisely.  the vender is called otc master.  there not a bad vender, so be careful, when buying this product.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs vitamin A, and this brand seems to be as good as any on the market. I&#x27;ll continue to order it in the future.</li>
            <li> Vitamin A is one of the lesser vitamin categories, since it&#x27;s easy to find in normal food. However, I like to have it on hand in case of sloppy eating habits or for grandchildren.</li>
            <li> Doctor said I needed extra D in my system to help with joint inflamation and overall health. This product did the trick.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my friend and he is very much happy with it. A small bottle and it lasts 3 months. Nice...</li>
            <li> The Titanic book was for kids.  A waste of money. But it&#x27;s the chance I took for wanting to save money.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it all the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, I take it along my other vitamins in the morning after breakfast.</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin A to help with coughs.  For Adults 50,000 IU every OTHER day helps get a cough up out of your chest, then gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To answer another question asked, beta carotene (from vegetables) is what your body turns INTO Vitamin A when it needs it.  ...So beta carotene Vitamin A is good for a daily supplement, since your body will only take advantage of it if it needs it, and turn what it needs into Vitamin A.  The rest will just flush harmlessly through your system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re trying to mega dose on the Vitamin A (like my family does) to get rid of a hacking cough, then you need Vitamin A from Fish Oil.  That&#x27;s ACTUAL Vitamin A, so you can force your body to have more than it thinks it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember, you can &amp;#34;OD&amp;#34; on pure Vitamin A -- meaning too much is BAD for you.  That&#x27;s why, to get rid of a cough, it&#x27;s 50,000 IU every OTHER day...NOT EVERY DAY!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to help with acne, I have not been taking it everyday so I am not sure what it can do but it is easy to take and a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> By photo of two bottles I took for granted that&#x27;s what I would be getting.  Nope I only received one bottle . My mistake on not fully reading the order. But why do they show 2 bottles ?  We will never now .  I learned my lesson to fully read what I&#x27;m ordering .</li>
            <li> I have used nature made products before and I like the amount of soft gels for the price. The soft gels are small and easy to swallow. As for the benefits, without blood tests, it is difficult to tell, but I have found that when I stop taking these supplements, my joints are achy and stiff. I take this along with Vitamin E, Fish oil and other supplements for my arthritis.  I would recommend them to anyone who has stiff joints but would also warn them, if you are taking a vitamin supplement regularly, you should skip taking these soft gels to avoid possible vitamin A toxcidity.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied as usual!</li>
            <li> this is the first time i have started taking vitamins and there are a few things i like about these~ they are easy to swallow where they are softgels and no aftertaste. overrall a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been hunting for a product that will help shrink my pores and control oil production.  My research led me to Vitamin A supplements.  Since starting this regimen two months ago, my overall production of blackheads has reduced significantly, and some of the stubborn old clogs have washed away in the shower.  My pores appear smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take Nature Made supplements because they are a good balance between quality and price.  They&#x27;re always on sale at my local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s now working for my skin is a combination of Vitamin A and Zinc supplements, a low-sugar diet, along with a topical sulfur/resorcinol cream (like Acnomel), salicylic acid toner (I like Clean &amp; Clear), and Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Masque.  It&#x27;s a lot of work, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> In a couple of days my night vision improved noticeably.  Guess I&#x27;m not getting enough Vit A in my diet.  Only limitation--NOT for PREGNANT WOMEN.  High doses can cause birth defects.  But for an oldie like me, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I always purchase Nature Made vitamins.  Their products&lt;br /&gt;are always &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;, especially their iron pills.  How do you&lt;br /&gt;know if a vitamin or pill is fresh?  Place the pill in water and&lt;br /&gt;see how long it takes to dissolve.  This is how long it will take&lt;br /&gt;to dissolve in your body.  Nature Made&#x27;s products  doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;take long to dissolve, therefore I suggest to my daughters&lt;br /&gt;and friends to look for this brand.  They agree.</li>
            <li> Easy to swallow but I felt extremely dizzy after taking them. Stopped after a couple days. The dosage may of been too high for me.</li>
            <li> Nice vitamin. Good quality. Small in size.</li>
            <li> because a single capsule gives fast relief to the eyes. this is a good product for all human. I love it.</li>
            <li> the benefits of vitamin a are something I am after .i take two of the gel capsuls daily and even if immediately I don&#x27;t get what I want I feel good about taking care of myself !</li>
