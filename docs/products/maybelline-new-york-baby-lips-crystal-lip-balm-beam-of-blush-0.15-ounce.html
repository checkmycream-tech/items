            <li>It feels great on your lips and the hint of color is perfect for casual days when I don&#x27;t feel like full makeup.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s primarily a lip moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>but lips feels smooth, smells like cotton candy</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a sheer moisturizing product this will be great.</li>
            <li>I love the way this looks and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed.</li>
            <li>so when I saw these I was soooo excited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a lip balm fiend, I like to try new lip balms</li>
            <li>This feels amazing on your lips and leaves them very soft.</li>
            <li>she is wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>So far I own Beam of Blush, Peach Kiss, and Quenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love pretty much all the products in the Baby Lips line</li>
            <li>love it very soft smells like candy.</li>
            <li>This is great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got the right amount of glitter</li>
            <li>After loving Peach Kiss and Quenched, I was scared to try Beam of Blush because some reviewers said it was almost sheer and had too much sparkle.</li>
            <li>I have always loved using Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax but wanted to change it up a little and maybe add some color to my lips.</li>
            <li>I have already purchased four, and will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>That being said, there are a few good points too.</li>
            <li>My first time trying this product after hearing so much about it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty light pink color.</li>
            <li>I think it helps with chapped lips and also brings a shine to your lips.i was hoping for a brighter gloss but its fine enough.</li>
            <li>It just looked more shiny, not really sparkly.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>I love that it adds a slight amount of color to your lips without being overbearing</li>
            <li>all Maybelline New York baby Lips is a must to have them with me at all time.</li>
            <li>The colors may look dark but it&#x27;s more of a sheer gloss.</li>
            <li>Maximum coverage, lips feel instantly hydrated and very soft ...</li>

            <li> Maximum coverage, lips feel instantly hydrated and very soft ...</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s really pale and is just really sparkly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really leave a color, and has annoying sparkles in it, that kind of make you think this is for little kids.</li>
            <li> However, when I applied it I was pretty disappointed to discover that It goes on pretty much sheer.</li>
            <li> My lips felt dry and I used this tube and like the product.  </li>
            <li> are very dry, not anymore.  </li>
            <li> Some people might not like it because it does not have a lot of pigmentation, is a sheer color with a little bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking for a deeper pink color for your lips, you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> In the tube this color &amp;#34;beam of blush&amp;#34; looks like an opaque cotton pink.</li>
            <li> The colors are subtle and keep my lips chap-free and soft!</li>
            <li> I even layered it in thickly and only got the slightest tint of pink.</li>
            <li> My personal preference is keep it subtle and that&#x27;s what this pink is when applied.</li>
            <li> I was also sad that the glitter did not stand out and sparkle as much as I assumed it would.</li>
            <li> If you have pale lips or skin, the color should show up with a tinge of pink.</li>
            <li> There is a slight hint of color</li>
            <li> It does have a little sparkle to it too, hence the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; part of the name, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cold outside baby shower as favors</li>
            <li> Not good as a moisturizer/chapstick, and not good as a lip gloss/color tint either!</li>
            <li> Failed on both accounts.  </li>
            <li> I am crazy about this product!</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a lip balm fiend, I like to try new lip balms and I always have to have one in my purse/pocket/desk. I have always loved using Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax but wanted to change it up a little and maybe add some color to my lips. My sister swore by Baby Lips so I had to try it out. I&#x27;m certainly not disappointed. So far I own Beam of Blush, Peach Kiss, and Quenched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lip balm provides good moisture and just a tint of color that I need. After loving Peach Kiss and Quenched, I was scared to try Beam of Blush because some reviewers said it was almost sheer and had too much sparkle. I do not think that is the case. However, if you&#x27;re looking for a deeper pink color for your lips, you may want to look elsewhere. My personal preference is keep it subtle and that&#x27;s what this pink is when applied. It does have a little sparkle to it too, hence the &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; part of the name, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees and Baby Lips are now my go to products.</li>
            <li> love it very soft smells like candy. mmmmmmm</li>
            <li> I am crazy about this product! It feels great on your lips and the hint of color is perfect for casual days when I don&#x27;t feel like full makeup.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve found it I don&#x27;t want to be without. Stays moist for hours. I wanted to test so I put on as I went to bed. My lips were still moist in the morning and not tacky. The colors may look dark but it&#x27;s more of a sheer gloss. Lovely</li>
            <li> it smells like cotton candy i love it</li>
            <li> Very pretty light pink color. It&#x27;s sparkly but not too sparkly.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  There is a slight hint of color and it&#x27;s primarily a lip moisturizer.  My lips felt dry and I used this tube and like the product.  I intend to order this again.</li>
            <li> Probably the second baby lips lip balm I&#x27;ve purchased in my life. Did not disappoint. A+</li>
            <li> Love!!!! Ordering more</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the color and smell!</li>
            <li> Great color and moisture, and just the right amount of sparkles!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason Baby Lips by Maybelline is the only type of lipstick, gloss, balm, etc., that doesn&#x27;t make the skin peel off my lips.  For that alone, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.  The colors are subtle and keep my lips chap-free and soft!</li>
            <li> I love the way this looks and the price is right. I don&#x27;t love the taste - it&#x27;s like putting bubble gum on your lips.</li>
            <li> Nice shimmer, not allot of color but lips feels smooth, smells like cotton candy</li>
            <li> My 13 year old niece loved it as a gift!!</li>
            <li> Some people might not like it because it does not have a lot of pigmentation, is a sheer color with a little bit of sparkle. But for me is perfect not all the time i want to have color in my lips. The product came really fast smell really good and i would totally buy a next one.</li>
            <li> The smell is reminiscent of bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Maybelline&#x27;s products to be a very good choice for people with sensitive skin like me. With this, my lip never breaks out, and it always does it&#x27;s job. If you have pale lips or skin, the color should show up with a tinge of pink. Overall, it&#x27;s really pale and is just really sparkly.</li>
            <li> I just love Baby Lips. Good color and very moisturizing. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday use.  Carry it around for instant moisture.  The name says it all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inlove with all Maybelline New York baby Lips is a must to have them with me at all time.</li>
            <li> I think it helps with chapped lips and also brings a shine to your lips.i was hoping for a brighter gloss but its fine enough. I would recommend this for teens.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my Lola she loves it she is wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product after hearing so much about it. Now I understand the hype. I would recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Love it! The color is not as strong as it seems but it has a nice sheen and shine.</li>
            <li> I love pretty much all the products in the Baby Lips line so when I saw these I was soooo excited.

However, when I applied it I was pretty disappointed to discover that It goes on pretty much sheer. I even layered it in thickly and only got the slightest tint of pink. The crystal part of this balm is loads of opalescent microglitter. I was also sad that the glitter did not stand out and sparkle as much as I assumed it would. It just looked more shiny, not really sparkly. That being said, there are a few good points too. This feels amazing on your lips and leaves them very soft. If you are looking for a sheer moisturizing product this will be great. If you are looking for color....not so much.</li>
            <li> Maximum coverage, lips feel instantly hydrated and very soft ... I love it! !</li>

            <li> This is nice, need to reapply often.</li>

            <li> Thank u will buy again</li>
            <li> Beautifil color, moistens lips - mine are very dry, not anymore.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, plus they have a nice variey of colors.  I have already purchased four, and will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a baby it&#x27;s cold outside baby shower as favors</li>
