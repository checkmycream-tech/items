            <li>I ended up buying 3 more for my mom and aunts.</li>
            <li>Really love this Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, and how it works on my face.</li>
            <li>Love it as I have allergies and this does not cause irritation on the skin or nose.</li>
            <li>THAT MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT WAS ON &amp;#34;THE DOCTORS&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I Love It</li>
            <li>Me and wife will for now on buy only St Ives very good product for the money.</li>
            <li>I like that it was unscented and how light it felt.</li>
            <li>.it is have a smooth skin&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I needed a daytime moisturizer and truthfully I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I look a good 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li>I only wish they made the same product with a suncreen, then it would be the perfect day cream.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and environmentally packed.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li>I will use this until I die or until they stop making it - whichever comes first!</li>
            <li>but I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it&#x27;s made my face.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>very fast.</li>
            <li>I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL TIMES, I LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Really like this it is not greasy but just right</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and is not high price as big brand names.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much results with it</li>
            <li>Very absorbent as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it (just like everyone else)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;3.It&#x27;s a reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I, personally, find the scent quite mild.</li>
            <li>I adore this lotion; it feels extremely smooth, never greasy, doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive face, smells nice but very subtle, and the price on Amazon (for 3!) makes it cost effective to use it on my entire body daily.</li>
            <li>I think I expected it to help with the fine lines I already have.</li>
            <li>The cost is very low for this product and it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to keep on keeping on with this new routine that seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 44 year old woman and have trouble mostly with fat volume loss and drooping skin.</li>
            <li>i use it as a body lotion and it keeps my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and does not leave a heavy greasy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>Wow-</li>
            <li>Firstly, this is a giant tub, this thing is going to last forever.</li>
            <li>Did it give me super firm skin?</li>
            <li>And when you first put it on, it&#x27;s like the day after a facial: you&#x27;ll have a matted glow that suggests you&#x27;re using much more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I bought three tubs of this stuff after paying $125 for a facial at my favorite salon and having my esthetician tell me that the reason my face was starting to look dull, wrinkly and droopy isn&#x27;t age, but dehydration.</li>
            <li>(that I know of, at least), but I really have noticed a difference since using this on a consistent basis wtih the hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just the extra moisturizing in general that&#x27;s working, but if it aint broke, don&#x27;t fix it,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Am glad I found that you can obtain it from Amazon-for it is cheaper there and receive 3 jars vs running around to different drugstores to only be disappointed when being told &amp;#34;we no longer carry this</li>
            <li> She said she uses a hyaluronic acid serum, pats it on, lets it dry and than slathers this St. Ives Timeless Skin lotion on.</li>
            <li> and I still have some I need to get off and let me tell you, loose skin does happen</li>

            <li> You will see results in a few days.</li>
            <li> Started using St Ivesto firm up the chin skin and get a jump on staving off the turkey neck after shaving, and it seems to be a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I have been losing weight for the past year</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re gonna get wrinkles and dull skin</li>
            <li> It works as well as the expensive face creams at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> TOO BAD, WILL LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES OR BY OVERSEAS</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this product... i use it as a body lotion and it keeps my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I found this product at walmart. It was only $6. After reading all the good reviews I decided to give it a try . I&#x27;m very happy about the results. it&#x27;s light and does not leave a heavy greasy feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much results with it but I love how soft it makes my skin feel. I have been losing weight for the past year and I still have some I need to get off and let me tell you, loose skin does happen and I got this to mitigate some of that problem. I like that it was unscented and how light it felt. Did it give me super firm skin? No, but it did give me more supple skin.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent as a moisturizer. I ended up buying 3 more for my mom and aunts.</li>
            <li> Really love this Moisturizer. Am glad I found that you can obtain it from Amazon-for it is cheaper there and receive 3 jars vs running around to different drugstores to only be disappointed when being told &amp;#34;we no longer carry this or we are out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> One jar lasts me 6 months of twice daily use.  It works as well as the expensive face creams at a fraction of the cost.  It helps my sunscreen glide on for day use and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at night.  I bought the 3 pack as the stores on Maui are all out.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for 15+ years and every time I try something else it makes my skin break out... or stings... or clumps. I will use this until I die or until they stop making it - whichever comes first! It&#x27;s nice and light and I, personally, find the scent quite mild. I highly recommend it (just like everyone else)!</li>
            <li> Stuff lasts forever! Did find it cheaper at Wal Mart but still using this one!</li>
            <li> Not so good for my face but good for hands..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. It&#x27;s light and quickly absorbed. A great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Buy them in bulks now. Have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I adore this lotion; it feels extremely smooth, never greasy, doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive face, smells nice but very subtle, and the price on Amazon (for 3!) makes it cost effective to use it on my entire body daily. And my skin loves it! My husband uses it as well, and I couldn&#x27;t get him to use lotion before.</li>
            <li> If you have wrinkles use this! You will see results in a few days. St. Ives. Knock this one out of the park. This cream is soooo good. I am a fan for life.</li>
            <li> I can feel the tightness of my skin. I think I expected it to help with the fine lines I already have. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed a daytime moisturizer and truthfully I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Firstly, this is a giant tub, this thing is going to last forever. I&#x27;m a 44 year old woman and have trouble mostly with fat volume loss and drooping skin. This stuff is a bit of a miracle worker, it plumps up your skin and makes you look a lot younger. Im now using it day and night. I&#x27;m really happy I bought it. I only wish they made the same product with a suncreen, then it would be the perfect day cream.</li>
            <li> Wow- I am so glad I found this product. Perfect for my 50 plus complexion - and super affordable. I love the consistency, and how it works on my face. I use it both morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and is not high price as big brand names.&lt;br /&gt;Betty</li>
            <li> great light  rich moisturizer. Love it as I have allergies and this does not cause irritation on the skin or nose.</li>
            <li> it works great shipment was on timeI&#x27;m very happy with it thank you</li>
            <li> For my combination skin, the only other moisturizers that work as well cost at least five times as much.  This will keep your face moisturized for almost the entire day.  And when you first put it on, it&#x27;s like the day after a facial: you&#x27;ll have a matted glow that suggests you&#x27;re using much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  I am 56 and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Very happy and thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I use it as an all over moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best for me and the wife. It dose what they say it dose and it only took me and the wife 2 days to see the difference. The cost is very low for this product and it is worth every penny.  Me and wife will for now on buy only St Ives very good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I like this St Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer .&lt;br /&gt;bec 1.there was adeliate fragrance of herb.&lt;br /&gt;2 .it is have a smooth skin&lt;br /&gt;3.It&#x27;s a reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Works well and at a price that anyone can afford</li>
            <li> very fast. nice package .excellent as always.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL TIMES, I LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED SINCE I BEGAN ORDERING TWO YEARS AGO.  THAT MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT WAS ON &amp;#34;THE DOCTORS&amp;#34;.  TOO BAD, WILL LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES OR BY OVERSEAS</li>
            <li> ordered a 3 pack of moisturizers.  Got 2 and 1 Apricot scrub, Did not want and won&#x27;t use the scrub so not entirely happy.&lt;br /&gt;What are my options?</li>
            <li> great face moisturizer.  works well.</li>
            <li> I Love It it&#x27;s the best face cream .</li>
            <li> Good price on a 3-pack.  Arrived prompt and intact.  I like this moisturizer for neck and cheeks and also for arms.  As a typical sports-y guy approaching fifty, I had never been one to use any products, but Vanity is taking over with age.  Also, all our outdoor activities take a toll on the skin (dirt, sun, saltwater).  Started using St Ivesto firm up the chin skin and get a jump on staving off the turkey neck after shaving, and it seems to be a noticeable difference.  Not turning back the clock, but i&#x27;ve been maintaining the last year or so.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I like it.</li>
            <li> Arrived safely and in good condition. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Really like this it is not greasy but just right</li>
            <li> I use it for everything. It doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy after feeling and I have no wrinkles, so whether it&#x27;s the cream or genetics I look a good 10 years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> Cheap and fine, good, has been in use!</li>
            <li> Awesome, I won&#x27;t use another brand. I put it on one a day (morning) and I don&#x27;t feel the need to use anymore until the next day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream I&#x27;ve used for years. Delivery was quick and environmentally packed. They don&#x27;t do any animal testing, either.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, makes my skin very soft</li>
            <li> My wife loves this face lotion and this is a great price</li>
            <li> I bought three tubs of this stuff after paying $125 for a facial at my favorite salon and having my esthetician tell me that the reason my face was starting to look dull, wrinkly and droopy isn&#x27;t age, but dehydration. I asked her what she does and she told me that she moisturizes constantly. With what, I asked. She said she uses a hyaluronic acid serum, pats it on, lets it dry and than slathers this St. Ives Timeless Skin lotion on. So, that was about two weeks ago and I have been doing this routine two-three times a day every day since and my skin has noticably improved. It looks glowier, plumper, my pores and wrinkles aren&#x27;t QUITE as noticable. Look, we&#x27;re all aging...we&#x27;re gonna get wrinkles and dull skin and there isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion that&#x27;s going to stop that (that I know of, at least), but I really have noticed a difference since using this on a consistent basis wtih the hyaluronic acid serum. Maybe it&#x27;s just the extra moisturizing in general that&#x27;s working, but if it aint broke, don&#x27;t fix it, right? So I&#x27;m going to keep on keeping on with this new routine that seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2 months now. I love how soft it&#x27;s made my face. Would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
