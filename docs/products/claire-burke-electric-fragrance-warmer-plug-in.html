    <ol>
            <li>this fragrance warmer is the best of everyone made...</li>
            <li>Claire burke electric warmer, best produce been around since I can remember</li>
            <li>My house smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>wonderful scent just wafting through my home...</li>
            <li>Maybe the spice oil isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li>Wouldmake a nice gift basket!</li>
            <li>With the separate purchase of the fragrance, this is a great way to keep your place smelling nice.  </li>
            <li>Christmas Tree\\&quot; and have great hopes that this will perform better.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE everything Claire Burke, this fragrance warmer is really nice because the fragrance bottle sits very snug in it, and the added night-light is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Plus, it is very strong even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Love these plug ins, makes the whole house smell great.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more refined and tasteful fragrance than anything you will find in a supermarket.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find that there was a warmer for Claire Burke!</li>
            <li>Original aroma is pleasing, permeated the air without being overwhelming to the senses.</li>
            <li>Fragrance Warmer Refills - ORIGINAL]], which is my all-time favorite scent (I have reviewed that produst separately).  </li>
            <li>My favorite Clarie Burke original.</li>
            <li>Like the adjustment factor as it&#x27;s not too strong to bear; it also lasts longer on the lower setting</li>
            <li>oil scents with strong smells and beats the others</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that not only did it work as a fragrance warmer, but it was a night light as well !</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Claire Burke Original Fragrance should.</li>
            <li>I purchased three of the Electric Fragrance Warner Plug-Ins to use with the Claire Burke Fragrance Warmer Refills - Original Scent, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Not chintzy like grocery store plug ins, this one is actually very attractive, has a soft light on the front when plugged in, and scents an average size room very well!</li>
            <li>They smell great just a little pricey.</li>
            <li>but I was glad to have found them on Amazon for comparable prices (and Prime eligible, no less!).  </li>
            <li>Started out nice, but after several uses I unplugged it from the wall and there was oil all over it.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be very close to the original fragrance, and liked it well enough to buy the spray and refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The plug-ins are stylish and the three small diamonds on the front light up, not too bright, just enough for a hallway or bathroom night light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but the original fragrance fills my large open plan sitting room with a wonderful scent.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying a few more :)</li>
            <li>really sends the scent into the room!</li>
            <li>Worked ok for several months and then leaked hot oil.  </li>
            <li>There is a switch on the top of the warmer to choose between two different levels of fragrance emission, I only wish that the higher level gave off a bit more scent.  </li>
            <li>, it is a first time for me.  </li>
            <li>I first found these wonderfully scented products in Solvang, California back in the mid &#x27;70s, so that tells you I&#x27;ve been a fan for a long time.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite fragrance warmers - they seem to last longer and don&#x27;t get insanely hot - and the scents available seem so much more subtle and pleasant than your standard Yankee Candle or Bath &amp; Body Shop fragrances.</li>
            <li>and I cam back to this one,.the light on it</li>
            <li>Works great, but only with original (expensive) refills.</li>
            <li>This product for some reason does not work after refilling it with newly purchased refill.  </li>
            <li>gives a little night light effect ,,,,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they just got the mix wrong, but it really is TOO strong</li>

            <li> so I have to take it out and carefully put it upright on a flat surface</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m crushed.  </li>
            <li> I have it set to the double switch and very little fragrance (spice)</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem is, but I haven&#x27;t plugged it back in since.</li>
            <li> The plug is a little loose but manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am using one of the warmers in my small bathroom</li>
            <li> can be noticed in the small bedroom</li>
            <li> But, the Original fragrance I ordered with it was terrible!  </li>
            <li> But for now, I&#x27;m sad.</li>

            <li> Like the adjustment factor as it&#x27;s not too strong to bear; it also lasts longer on the lower setting</li>
            <li> Love these plug ins, makes the whole house smell great. Just wished the fragrance lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This product for some reason does not work after refilling it with newly purchased refill.  I would like to know why</li>
            <li> I LOVE everything Claire Burke, this fragrance warmer is really nice because the fragrance bottle sits very snug in it, and the added night-light is GREAT!

            <li> this fragrance warmer is the best of everyone made...the scent last longer and u can smell it all over a room,,,,I have tried them all even the ones at bath and body works and I cam back to this one,.the light on it gives a little night light effect ,,,,</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that not only did it work as a fragrance warmer, but it was a night light as well !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but the original fragrance fills my large open plan sitting room with a wonderful scent.  My only criticism is that it can&#x27;t be turned off whilst plugged into a socket so I have to take it out and carefully put it upright on a flat surface, otherwise I would be going through a bottle a week.</li>
            <li> Claire burke electric warmer, best produce been around since I can remember&lt;br /&gt;original oil scents with strong smells and beats the others</li>
            <li> Started out nice, but after several uses I unplugged it from the wall and there was oil all over it.  Not sure what the problem is, but I haven&#x27;t plugged it back in since.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite fragrance warmers - they seem to last longer and don&#x27;t get insanely hot - and the scents available seem so much more subtle and pleasant than your standard Yankee Candle or Bath &amp; Body Shop fragrances. Not even mentioning the supermarket ones, like glade ...those scents are &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;gross&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!  My house smells wonderful.  The plug is a little loose but manageable.  Will order refills on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Original aroma is pleasing, permeated the air without being overwhelming to the senses.</li>
            <li> Not chintzy like grocery store plug ins, this one is actually very attractive, has a soft light on the front when plugged in, and scents an average size room very well! I plan on buying a few more :)</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product.I have recommended it to several friends!It really sends the scent into the room!</li>
            <li> Worked ok for several months and then leaked hot oil.  When I pulled it from the wall plug oil and the plug-ins metal like paint was all over my hand. Yuck.</li>
            <li> No, it leaks and has already ruined the finish on the warmer.  Plus, it is very strong even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I remember using this home fragrance years ago and then it just disappeared.  I find it to be very close to the original fragrance, and liked it well enough to buy the spray and refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful scent just wafting through my home...also noticed by  friends/family as soon as they enter my home.  Wouldmake a nice gift basket!</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I was on longer able to purchase Claire Burke fragrance products at my local department store but I was glad to have found them on Amazon for comparable prices (and Prime eligible, no less!).  I purchased three of the Electric Fragrance Warner Plug-Ins to use with the Claire Burke Fragrance Warmer Refills - Original Scent, [[ASIN:B000BIU2W2 Claire Burke Fragrance Warmer Refills - ORIGINAL]], which is my all-time favorite scent (I have reviewed that produst separately).  The plug-ins are stylish and the three small diamonds on the front light up, not too bright, just enough for a hallway or bathroom night light.  There is a switch on the top of the warmer to choose between two different levels of fragrance emission, I only wish that the higher level gave off a bit more scent.  I am using one of the warmers in my small bathroom (approx 6&#x27; x 8&#x27;) and it works well however the scent gets a bit lost where I use it in my living room (approx. 11&#x27;5\\&quot; x 13&#x27; of a larger overall living/dining area measuring 11&#x27;5\\&quot; x 23&#x27;3\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is well made and the plug can be rotated to use in either a vertical or horizontal outlet.</li>
            <li> With the separate purchase of the fragrance, this is a great way to keep your place smelling nice.  It&#x27;s a more refined and tasteful fragrance than anything you will find in a supermarket.  Aromatherapy is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
            <li> My favorite Clarie Burke original. Got the warmer plug-in along with fragrance oil refills. They smell great just a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find that there was a warmer for Claire Burke! I first found these wonderfully scented products in Solvang, California back in the mid &#x27;70s, so that tells you I&#x27;ve been a fan for a long time. However, this product simply doesn&#x27;t disseminate the fragrance like I expected.  I have it set to the double switch and very little fragrance (spice) can be noticed in the small bedroom I decided to try it out in.  So, I&#x27;m crushed.  I did order \\&quot;Oh Christmas Tree\\&quot; and have great hopes that this will perform better.  Maybe the spice oil isn&#x27;t so great, it is a first time for me.  So, I will remain cautiously optimistic. But for now, I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> Works great, but only with original (expensive) refills.</li>
    </ol>
