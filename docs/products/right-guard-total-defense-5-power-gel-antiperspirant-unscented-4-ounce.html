    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>great for deer hunting</li>
            <li>so this is great.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t give it a good score.  </li>
            <li>and it will be a good product.</li>
            <li>Ok, some people are happy to smell like the a perfume factory... scented laundry detergent, deoderant/antiperspirant, shaving gel, aftershave, body wash, shampoo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>I tried it and liked it better than the Mitchum.</li>
            <li>As both a deodorant and antiperspirant it is among the best I have used and it easily lasts for a whole day (24 hours) for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this lasts for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue to buy this deodorant until I find a better unscented one.</li>
            <li>Then, after using it and putting the top on, a number of times, the gel has continued to come out and get all over the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get a better delivery</li>
            <li>This deodorant is safe.</li>
            <li>fragrances (so that they can be detected from greater distances --- &amp;#34;hey,</li>
            <li>It works better than any deodorant and antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t have alluminum in it, but it sure works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite unscented deodorants/antiperspirant</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find the Right Guard option.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is available as unscented because it won&#x27;t clash with my cologne if I choose to wear some.  </li>
            <li>I strongly dislike scented deodorants/anti-perspirants.  </li>
            <li>The anti-perspirant itself is fine.  </li>
            <li>I have some kind of allergy to certain laundry detergents or deodorants.</li>
            <li>Not an accurate claim.</li>
            <li>Would probably be available for three dollars at stores like WalMart or Target, which is what the scented versions go for, but I&#x27;ve been finding that they don&#x27;t carry the unscented version.  </li>
            <li>I had to knock it one star because Right Guard can&#x27;t supply it to Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program any longer for some reason (money, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li>As far as I (and even more so my wife!)</li>
            <li>Not a bad price for it either.</li>
            <li>I tried the equivalent Dry Idea deodorant and that was much more effective to prevent odor, even on my husband.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to be able to use it and not have to worry about (unlike some popular &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorant products that you are lucky if they even last a few hours...)</li>
            <li>They either are watery, leave residue, or simply aren&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li>so this is my preferred Right Guard product.  </li>
            <li>My husband and teenage son both love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Scent free, keeps me dry and smell free.</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty much unobtainable now.  </li>
            <li>Unscented is still available in aerosol from Right Guard, but gels are now limited to &amp;#34;knockout&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The product itself works very well and the only odor is a light alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li>I really like this antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>The are both very active and had a hard time finding one they like and this one was perfect and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>It cost less per ounce and seemed to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>do like getting rid of the fragrance and gunk of normal deodorants, so I&#x27;ll continue buying it.</li>
            <li>it works good (although I have yet to use it in the 100 degree summer heat here in Texas) and it has only a slight initial smell that is not a fragrance and is not objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems to work exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I bought a different brand unscented from the store - the only other non-scented I could find and interestingly my wife didn&#x27;t like the smell!  </li>
            <li>No issues, and it&#x27;s readily available for less money.</li>
            <li>It seems to remain clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve shifted over to \\&quot;Dry Idea Advanced Dry Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, 72 Hr, Unscented\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>First, the holes at the top are awkward as the deodorant doesn&#x27;t come out evenly through them when I turn the dial and when I open it up the next day some product has usually squeezed out of the tube and is sitting on top - more than I usually want to use.  </li>
            <li>I think I smell Bob coming down the street!&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>There is no easy or clean way to get the right amount of gel to come up through the small holes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave long term white residue or buildup on clothes like other deoderants.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>But finding it at local stores is a difficult task, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, where I ordered out multiple units for future use.</li>
            <li>It always seems to be too much or too little.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s made by the same company, with the same list of active and inactive ingredients.  </li>

            <li> Except for the going on wet and having to wait for it to dry part, which I don&#x27;t care for especially during the colder months, this product tends to work quite well.  </li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t think the deodorant will last as long as a traditional stick, both because of gel and some of it being wasted from container mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problems I&#x27;ve had with this deodorant are due to the container itself.  </li>
            <li> I think due to something related to the scents.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I discovered that I paid $6.49 for a single item.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white stains on pullover shirts and black t-shirts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just not ready yet.  </li>
            <li> For years and years I have used an unscented deodorant/antiperspirant, but it has become harder and harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the unscented deodorants/antiperspirants at a few local grocers.</li>
            <li> If you read reviews of other brands you&#x27;ll note that none of the unscented gels compare to this product.  </li>
            <li> The trend in men&#x27;s deodorant is extremely florid scents.  </li>
            <li> The price was way to expensive especially for someone of a fixed income.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money to return, so</li>
            <li> Feel free to let me know if you&#x27;ve found other unscented brands that work well without annoying chemical aromas.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty with the gel getting messy when the cap of this deodorant is removed or it is stored upside down.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find on store shelves.  </li>
            <li> of us like to minimize the artificial smells, and some people are allergic to the perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Prices online when you can find it are just stupid expensive (70 bucks for 6 sticks?</li>
            <li> I hate stinky deodorants</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the fact that this lasts for 24 hours. It&#x27;s great to be able to use it and not have to worry about (unlike some popular &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; deodorant products that you are lucky if they even last a few hours...)</li>
            <li> I have difficulty with the gel getting messy when the cap of this deodorant is removed or it is stored upside down. I like the actual product, but the container needs a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t think the deodorant will last as long as a traditional stick, both because of gel and some of it being wasted from container mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like getting rid of the fragrance and gunk of normal deodorants, so I&#x27;ll continue buying it. The only scent I want to wear is from my cologne, if anything at all.</li>
            <li> My husband and teenage son both love this deodorant. The are both very active and had a hard time finding one they like and this one was perfect and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Except for the going on wet and having to wait for it to dry part, which I don&#x27;t care for especially during the colder months, this product tends to work quite well.  I can&#x27;t handle the aromas on scented products so this is my preferred Right Guard product.  Very hard to find at any store in the unscented version.  Would probably be available for three dollars at stores like WalMart or Target, which is what the scented versions go for, but I&#x27;ve been finding that they don&#x27;t carry the unscented version.  It&#x27;s hard to find unscented versions of any brand at the stores nowadays.  Feel free to let me know if you&#x27;ve found other unscented brands that work well without annoying chemical aromas.</li>
            <li> The product itself works very well and the only odor is a light alcohol smell.  The only problems I&#x27;ve had with this deodorant are due to the container itself.  First, the holes at the top are awkward as the deodorant doesn&#x27;t come out evenly through them when I turn the dial and when I open it up the next day some product has usually squeezed out of the tube and is sitting on top - more than I usually want to use.  Second, I can never get all of the product out of the tube when I&#x27;m getting to the bottom, quite a bit remains that I can&#x27;t get out and I have to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are both minor annoyances and I&#x27;ll continue to buy this deodorant until I find a better unscented one.</li>
            <li> The anti-perspirant itself is fine.  It works as advertised.  However, the delivery mechanism is so flawed, I can&#x27;t give it a good score.  There is no easy or clean way to get the right amount of gel to come up through the small holes.  It always seems to be too much or too little.  Then, after using it and putting the top on, a number of times, the gel has continued to come out and get all over the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just not ready yet.  Get a better delivery and it will be a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long time for a product that wouldn&#x27;t leave any white residue under my arms or discoloring my shirts (especially white ones).  I love that it is available as unscented because it won&#x27;t clash with my cologne if I choose to wear some.  As both a deodorant and antiperspirant it is among the best I have used and it easily lasts for a whole day (24 hours) for me.  It is advertised as protecting 48 hours from odor and 24 hours from wetness but I have not tried going longer than 24 hour without a bath so I cannot vouch for that.</li>
            <li> I have some kind of allergy to certain laundry detergents or deodorants. I think due to something related to the scents. This deodorant is safe. If you have issues like me, get this one.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work well at all to prevent odor.  I tried the equivalent Dry Idea deodorant and that was much more effective to prevent odor, even on my husband.</li>
            <li> Discontinued.  If you read reviews of other brands you&#x27;ll note that none of the unscented gels compare to this product.  They either are watery, leave residue, or simply aren&#x27;t effective.  Unscented is still available in aerosol from Right Guard, but gels are now limited to &amp;#34;knockout&amp;#34; fragrances (so that they can be detected from greater distances --- &amp;#34;hey, I think I smell Bob coming down the street!&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I will never purchase any product from this company again.  What I thought I was ordering was 4 containers of this product.  What I got was 1 container.  The price was way to expensive especially for someone of a fixed income.  I felt totally ripped off.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave white stains on pullover shirts and black t-shirts. Doesn&#x27;t have a weird perfume smell. Package promises 48 hour protection. Not an accurate claim. It will not keep you from smelling dirty two whole days after you put it on. But you should have taken a bath before then anyway.</li>
            <li> great for deer hunting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my deodorant to compete with my cologne. This works well.</li>
            <li> I really like this antiperspirant.  I had to knock it one star because Right Guard can&#x27;t supply it to Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program any longer for some reason (money, I&#x27;m sure). It is now 3 times the price. I won&#x27;t pay that!</li>
            <li> I swear by this deoderant!&lt;br /&gt;It truly is unscented, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave long term white residue or buildup on clothes like other deoderants.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I hate stinky deodorants so this is great. Scent free, keeps me dry and smell free. I buy it regularly.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment today.  Imagine my surprise when I discovered that I paid $6.49 for a single item.  This is twice the price in my local stores.  Looking over the item description, I see that it never actually mentions a three-pack.  However, with the inflated price, and the picture of three items, I assumed that this was a three-pack.  It&#x27;s not worth the money to return, so I&#x27;ll go with it.  However, this vendor will get no more orders from me.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years,  just what I want in an Antiperspirant  like that it is unscented and does not clash with my fragrance  I personally like the gel,  some people do not like it.  It seems to remain clear</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smell and this stuff is awesome. It works better than any deodorant and antiperspirant I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores so I get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t have alluminum in it, but it sure works. Not a bad price for it either. yep.</li>
            <li> Ok, some people are happy to smell like the a perfume factory... scented laundry detergent, deoderant/antiperspirant, shaving gel, aftershave, body wash, shampoo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of us like to minimize the artificial smells, and some people are allergic to the perfumes.  This deodorant stops perspiration without reeking of perfume.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find on store shelves.  I bought 4 sticks from Amazon, to last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/07/2014:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty much unobtainable now.  Prices online when you can find it are just stupid expensive (70 bucks for 6 sticks? Getouttahere!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shifted over to \\&quot;Dry Idea Advanced Dry Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, 72 Hr, Unscented\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s made by the same company, with the same list of active and inactive ingredients.  It seems to work exactly the same.  No issues, and it&#x27;s readily available for less money.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike scented deodorants/anti-perspirants.  Finding unscented options is not easy.  I have been using Mitchum for years, but was looking for something else.  I was very pleased to find the Right Guard option.  I tried it and liked it better than the Mitchum. It cost less per ounce and seemed to do a better job.  But finding it at local stores is a difficult task, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, where I ordered out multiple units for future use.</li>
            <li> For years and years I have used an unscented deodorant/antiperspirant, but it has become harder and harder to find in the stores.  I bought a different brand unscented from the store - the only other non-scented I could find and interestingly my wife didn&#x27;t like the smell!  As far as I (and even more so my wife!) am concerned the scented men&#x27;s products are way too overpowering or smell downright terrible.&lt;br /&gt;This product is from the same manufacturer as the product I had used for years... it works good (although I have yet to use it in the 100 degree summer heat here in Texas) and it has only a slight initial smell that is not a fragrance and is not objectionable.&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores - I have seen this brand everywhere, but not the unscented version.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  It&#x27;s my favorite unscented deodorants/antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found so far.  I&#x27;ve tried all the unscented deodorants/antiperspirants at a few local grocers.</li>
            <li> The trend in men&#x27;s deodorant is extremely florid scents.  I like an unscented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Recommended.</li>
