            <li>They used to have it in a mousse, but have not been able to find it, so don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Works better than Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and none of them worked.</li>
            <li>Love the aroma of this serum.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but u have to make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot because your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves it shining and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair serums for my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon by this provider is really good and the shipment  was fast.</li>
            <li>easy to carry around,&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective.   </li>
            <li>Your hair is frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Great product for maintaining flat ironed hair.  </li>
            <li>Tames the hair and makes hair look smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I use maybe 2-3 drops of this on my hand with a small conjunction of grapeseed oil or another heat protection and since I have section that is coarser (4B) it needs more product and this serum helps it a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The use of the oil really make a difference in the healthy appearance of the hair.</li>
            <li>smells really nice and helps with shine, softness, and helps keep my hair soft from heat.</li>
            <li>While I often alternate between using Bain de terre (really good with a nice, light scent, has lots of good for you ingredients, works well on my long, thick hair) and garnier fructis (still really good</li>
            <li>I cannot find a happy medium between not enough and too much.</li>
            <li>When I wake up, the serum is fully absorbed and my hair is pretty soft and nice to touch.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and soft when dried and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I love how this product makes my dry flyaway curly hair shine and show lovely curls without being all sticky.</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to try sulfate free anti frizz to see</li>
            <li>I put it on my hair after i styled it and it looks so soft and healthy to when i dont put it on.</li>
            <li>Worth all five stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they replaced it with the new one.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 20 month old daughter who has soft but very cute curls that need detangling.</li>
            <li>we got it at the first time, it was damaged,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Unlike the vanilla and shea, the pomegranate doesn&#x27;t have a funny undertow smell.    </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, free of knots, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Although they need to pack it better next time for shipping.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to over do it when you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I am not impressed as it could be lighter and more easily applied evenly, as the latest Paul Mitchell equivalent.  </li>
            <li>Love the pomegranate green tea light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love it, finally a product that really works.</li>
            <li>I find that this product works very well without having to use very much.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, but it kind of makes my hair feel to greasy if I put a lot, just a SMALL dab is enough</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than I would have paid at CVS or Walgreens or Sallys &amp; I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like the product, it does keep the frizz under control, very minimum is needed, otherwise the hair will be too oily</li>
            <li>I also really try to avoid using a lot of unnatural products on my hair, but</li>
            <li>it smells very fruity and girly</li>
            <li>looks very shiny....</li>
            <li>I live in a small town with no stores with good hair products.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I got fed up with frizz-ease not being very effective, but this was worse.</li>
            <li>I think this would only work good on straight or slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my dry, naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>they changed the formulation, a bit thin feeling, but a great help on rainy days), which I generally use after heat appliances</li>
            <li>Be careful what you select because the picture can be deceiving and be sure to double check your invoice and the emailed invoice I did not and got something I did not order intially.</li>
            <li>They will offer a refund but by the time you pay shipping cost and the restocking fee what exactly are you getting back.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding it, so was glad to find it here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sleeker, shiner and soft.  </li>
            <li>I feel like either there is not enough in my hair to make any difference at all, or there is way too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick serum but one won&#x27;t end up being oily if used lightly e.g. one or two whole drops.</li>
            <li>I expected a slightly feminine smell, but it is very strong and not gender-neutral at all.</li>
            <li>With other serums I have tried, if you use too much your hair looks greasy but at least it feels nice still.</li>
            <li>Really maintains the frizz for blow drying or flat ironing as I like.  </li>
            <li>I can use 6-7 pumps of this in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, which isn&#x27;t even down to her shoulders and it only keeps it smooth until it dries, then it&#x27;s back to normal.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it while my hair was wet</li>
            <li>The only disappointment I have with this product is that it&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much -- half a pump is more that enough for me.</li>
            <li>It is a little greasy, but it controls my hair when it is freshly cleaned.</li>
            <li>I did this with blow dring and letting it dry naturally.  </li>

            <li> Apparantly sulfates dull the hair amongst other things, and I make sure they aren&#x27;t in any of my other products.   </li>
            <li> When I flat ironed my hair</li>
            <li> A bottle will last a very long time for me since i use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again once the current bottle approach to be empty.</li>
            <li> Keeps it hat way all day long.  </li>
            <li> When my wife use it is after blowing her hair dry .</li>
            <li> I also tried while my hair was dry and again it looked as though i hadnt washed ot in weeks.</li>
            <li> gave my hair extra shine without looking or feeling weighed down</li>
            <li> I have short, straight hair that likes to puff out and look like a silly, spherical helm on my head.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve finished styling it for the day, being careful to use it sparingly so that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> Again I have long, thick hair, which is naturally curly, but I use heat appliances every few days or so...  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Ive tried using less with no success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so you only need to use very little for short hair.</li>
            <li> I have two biracial daughters and they have thick tight curls, but their hair isn&#x27;t coarse.</li>
            <li> You need to only use a very small amount of this serum or else your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a thick oil, so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As with all these serums, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all of the reviews I read said only use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> This one is not as heavy as the vanilla or shea serums.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t smell as heavy either, but it smells like citrus or sugar.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try pomegranate and green tea anti frizz serum by organix for a while.</li>
            <li> but then it was greasy when dried.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is hard to get it to be thick enough, but not too thick.  </li>
            <li> This product seems too thick.</li>
            <li> I only tried a few times, but every time i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product smoothed out my hair and significantly decreased volume!</li>
            <li> With this product, your hair not only looks awful, it feels disgusting too.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Like this product a lot!  Really maintains the frizz for blow drying or flat ironing as I like.  I use maybe 2-3 drops of this on my hand with a small conjunction of grapeseed oil or another heat protection and since I have section that is coarser (4B) it needs more product and this serum helps it a great deal.  When I flat ironed my hair it&#x27;s sleeker, shiner and soft.  Not to mention the frizz was non-existent.</li>
            <li> love this product for my hair</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter love this serum.&lt;br /&gt;When we got it at the first time, it was damaged,&lt;br /&gt;but as soon as we wrote e-mail to them,&lt;br /&gt;they replaced it with the new one.&lt;br /&gt;Good smell, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also easy to carry around,&lt;br /&gt;no need to worry about it liking,&lt;br /&gt;because it has the on-and-off cap.</li>
            <li> I ordered coconut milk and got something else. Be careful what you select because the picture can be deceiving and be sure to double check your invoice and the emailed invoice I did not and got something I did not order intially. They will offer a refund but by the time you pay shipping cost and the restocking fee what exactly are you getting back. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I live in a small town with no stores with good hair products.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  It was much cheaper than I would have paid at CVS or Walgreens or Sallys &amp; I did&#x27;nt have to drive 40 miles to find it.  Excellent deal!!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells nice but that&#x27;s about it. I am no stranger to hair serum. I have tried a ton of different anti-frizz serums. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I decided to try this because I got fed up with frizz-ease not being very effective, but this was worse. With other serums I have tried, if you use too much your hair looks greasy but at least it feels nice still. With this product, your hair not only looks awful, it feels disgusting too. This product seems too thick. I cannot find a happy medium between not enough and too much. I feel like either there is not enough in my hair to make any difference at all, or there is way too much and my hair is dirtier than before I washed it.</li>
            <li> Love the pomegranate green tea light fragrance.  They used to have it in a mousse, but have not been able to find it, so don&#x27;t think they make it anymore.  You need to only use a very small amount of this serum or else your hair will feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This one is not as heavy as the vanilla or shea serums. This one doesn&#x27;t smell as heavy either, but it smells like citrus or sugar. Unlike the vanilla and shea, the pomegranate doesn&#x27;t have a funny undertow smell.    I haven&#x27;t used this one to try and blow out my hair, but I do use it every night before bed. When I wake up, the serum is fully absorbed and my hair is pretty soft and nice to touch.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and my son. They use to get it in the drugstore but for some reasons they no longer sale it . The price on Amazon by this provider is really good and the shipment  was fast. The bottle came well protected without any spill. When my wife use it is after blowing her hair dry . The use of the oil really make a difference in the healthy appearance of the hair. I will buy it again once the current bottle approach to be empty.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Love the product, brings a great shine to my hair. Three people even asked, what I did to my hair after the 1st time I used it. Works better than Argan oil. Holds a curl/set well. Very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight hair that likes to puff out and look like a silly, spherical helm on my head. This product smoothed out my hair and significantly decreased volume! Be careful not to use too much -- half a pump is more that enough for me. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the product, it does keep the frizz under control, very minimum is needed, otherwise the hair will be too oily</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try pomegranate and green tea anti frizz serum by organix for a while. While I often alternate between using Bain de terre (really good with a nice, light scent, has lots of good for you ingredients, works well on my long, thick hair) and garnier fructis (still really good even tho they changed the formulation, a bit thin feeling, but a great help on rainy days), which I generally use after heat appliances, I really wanted to try sulfate free anti frizz to see it&#x27;s effects on my hair  I also really try to avoid using a lot of unnatural products on my hair, but anti frizz serum is just one of those exceptions. I do, however, try to use ones with as much good stuff in it as possible--like Bain de terre  Apparantly sulfates dull the hair amongst other things, and I make sure they aren&#x27;t in any of my other products.   I find that this product works very well without having to use very much. Again I have long, thick hair, which is naturally curly, but I use heat appliances every few days or so...  It has a nice scent that is what another reviewer called sugary. I find that it blocks quite a bit of humidity even on a rainy northeast day, gave my hair extra shine without looking or feeling weighed down and I didn&#x27;t have to use much for it to be effective.   As with all these serums, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing. I put it on my hair after i styled it and it looks so soft and healthy to when i dont put it on. it smells very fruity and girly which i like, i would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Love it, finally a product that really works. I&#x27;ve tried many products and none of them worked. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Your hair is frizz free.  Keeps it hat way all day long.  I will always want to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the aroma of this serum. It&#x27;s very thick, so you only need to use very little for short hair. It definitely defeats the frizz I get in humid Austin, Texas summers.</li>
            <li> smells really nice and helps with shine, softness, and helps keep my hair soft from heat.</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful!  It&#x27;s quite a thick oil, so a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s easy to over do it when you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Great product for maintaining flat ironed hair.  Kept hair shiny, moisturized, and manageable while in the desert.  Worth all five stars.</li>
            <li> Great product! It works well and the aroma is nice!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it for his beard.  Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My daughter and I both have curly hair and it keeps the frizz away all day!</li>
            <li> it is hard to get it to be thick enough, but not too thick.  I am not impressed as it could be lighter and more easily applied evenly, as the latest Paul Mitchell equivalent.  You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> As a hair product, this works well enough. It is a little greasy, but it controls my hair when it is freshly cleaned. My biggest issue is that I am a guy and this stuff smells like the scratch n&#x27; sniff from the folder of a 4-year-old girl. I expected a slightly feminine smell, but it is very strong and not gender-neutral at all. I am giving it to my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Tames the hair and makes hair look smooth and clean. Nice smell too, use generous amounts and makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I loved this. It&#x27;s great right after shampoo, softens and prevents breakage. I also use it on my 20 month old daughter who has soft but very cute curls that need detangling. It&#x27;s a thick serum but one won&#x27;t end up being oily if used lightly e.g. one or two whole drops. Do not use it on the roots or you&#x27;ll complain of that oily look.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, but it kind of makes my hair feel to greasy if I put a lot, just a SMALL dab is enough</li>
            <li> This is a Great product. Works as it indicates. Leaves hair soft, free of knots, and shiny. The hair smells great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but u have to make sure you don&#x27;t use a lot because your hair will look greasy. This product works to control frizzy hair. A bottle will last a very long time for me since i use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I love how this product makes my dry flyaway curly hair shine and show lovely curls without being all sticky. I have a hard time finding it, so was glad to find it here. Although they need to pack it better next time for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry, naturally wavy/curly hair.  It leaves it shining and more manageable.  I put it on my hair after I&#x27;ve finished styling it for the day, being careful to use it sparingly so that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  The only disappointment I have with this product is that it&#x27;s becoming more and more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I only tried a few times, but every time i was disappointed. The first time i used it while my hair was wet but then it was greasy when dried. I did this with blow dring and letting it dry naturally.  I have long, thick, wavy hair so im used to serums and products.  I also tried while my hair was dry and again it looked as though i hadnt washed ot in weeks. Ive tried using less with no success. I wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair. I use this after almost every shower on damp hair. It makes my hair nice and soft when dried and smells amazing! Happy customer for sure.</li>
            <li> I have two biracial daughters and they have thick tight curls, but their hair isn&#x27;t coarse. I just wanted something to keep their curls defined and not frizzy. I&#x27;m not sure why all of the reviews I read said only use a very small amount. I can use 6-7 pumps of this in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, which isn&#x27;t even down to her shoulders and it only keeps it smooth until it dries, then it&#x27;s back to normal. I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. I think this would only work good on straight or slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I had a Keratin treatment&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks great ......  just do not over do it.Just a drop or two....&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks very shiny....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what its supposed to! A waste of money.</li>
            <li> great to get rid of frizz</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me for Christmas. I&#x27;ve used many hair serums for my frizzy hair. I love this one! Smells good and takes care of my frizz. No Cons about this one!</li>
