            <li> one of our favorites, it has been discontinued .  we were glad to find it.</li>
            <li> This perfume has been on my to get list for a while. I clearly remember being at Sunglass Hut and the girl working there smelled great so I asked her what she was wearing and she told me Passion by ET. Sweet. Okay so I order this stuff and it is AWFUL. Maybe it just doesnt work well with my body chemistry. It was so strong and overwhelming and I couldn&#x27;t get the granny smell off of me even after showering. NOT for me but maybe for you. TEST at the store before you purchase. UGH</li>
            <li> I am glad you sell this product!I don&#x27;t like strong aromas, but the body lotion is milder. Thank You for selling it by itself.</li>
            <li> Passion products are my preference of the Elizabeth Taylor products.</li>

            <li> Passion has been a favorite of mine for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> Love it! Awsome product.</li>
            <li> This product has always agreed with my body chemistry and  never bothers my allergies. I get a lot of complements on this product.</li>
            <li> Not as sweet as white diamonds. It last about 6 hr in our Texas heat. Has a woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> for the price this is well worth it,i come from australia and perfume and creams like this are expensive but i would buy again</li>
            <li> The wife loves this lotion and I love the way it makes her smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use under the matching eau de toilette.  The texture is smooth, silky and leave my skin lightly moisturized and scented.</li>
            <li> Love how this smells like perfume</li>
            <li> Right up there with the perfume. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance. The delivery was amazing</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for myself not really into perfume last i like it get lots of positive feedback from it i normally wear Victoria Secrets</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  I always get compliments when I wear it.  I also have the fragrance and body wash.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is as it says very good smell and it last.  This  is what I always look for.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. I just can&#x27;t use it. You get a very large size for the money. Others may find it okay. Reminds me of older women who love strong perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s products, so I thought I would try a lotion first. This lotion is kind of loud for my taste. I&#x27;m sure if the lotion smells this loud, the perfume is worse. I have to wear just a little of it so it doesn&#x27;t  over power me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this size for a while.  Good price, great product</li>
            <li> The same as before.  This product has been open I can&#x27;t use this product because of that , again why open it.</li>
            <li> I found this and ordered from seller.Received quick and in great condition.I love The Passion Fragrance by Elizabeth Taylor.Have used for a long time.Recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Fabulous compliment to Passion perfume. Keeps my skin soft, smooth, and smelling great! Absolutely love this product! Perfect finish to my morning routine!</li>
            <li> Great. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Got one in a gift box with the perfume last Christmas. Hard to find this sold separately, as I use the lotion more than the perfume. I bought four tubes to stock up. It is very reasonably priced. Also, I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me when I apply it. :)</li>
            <li> I really love it.  It is not too perfummy and I get lots of compliments on the smell.  I have given some away to friends and girl grandchildren.</li>
            <li> it was a gift she loved it</li>
            <li> I bought for my sister and she has used it for many years and this is the only body stuff she will use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this body lotion for many many years; have been through more tubes than I could count. The fragrance suits my preference for a subtle scent. In addition to the scent, Passion by ET keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great body lotion after showering, to help moisturizer your skin. I layer this with the body powder and perfume for an all day subtle fragrance. I can&#x27;t smell it after I first put it on as I&#x27;ve become somewhat used to it,  but others say it&#x27;s very light during the day and really pleasant. I use it as my signature fragrance and have had many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the perfume!  I can&#x27;t even use it as it just smells rancid when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is my fragrance!!!  Very happy with the cost of body lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years because it blends so well with my own sence. I add a little baby lotion to it and the mixture is heaven for me.</li>
