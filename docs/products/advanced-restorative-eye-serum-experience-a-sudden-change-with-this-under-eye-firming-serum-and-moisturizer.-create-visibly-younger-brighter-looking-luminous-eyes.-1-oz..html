            <li>But might work better for others.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered some more for myself and some family members on their website...</li>
            <li>I love that it is really easily applied.</li>
            <li>I love that it glides on as easily as a moisturizer would, which is a must when it comes to my requirements for eye cream.</li>
            <li>My eyes look more rested and the skin is much more smooth.</li>
            <li>but I found this too strong for my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to see my fine lines around my eyes to go away</li>
            <li>This has helped with adding moisture and my makeup looks smooth.  </li>
            <li>This eye serum is smooth, non-greasy, and quick-absorbing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>pump is also very useful and sanitary.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I love the packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth, and fresh.</li>
            <li>it felt cool and a bit tingly on my skin.</li>
            <li>No bad reaction.</li>
            <li>great not too thick,  very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>on I was lucky to have witnessed</li>
            <li>This is the best eye serum I have tried so far for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture &amp; it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This does feel cool and tingly at first which I love and does not irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to open the bottle in order to use it.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>I love that this one dries much more quickly, allowing me to actually apply it in the early morning.</li>
            <li>I was eargeres to use my product right away however when I opened it and tried to use the product from the pump</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t say that I used this for the anti-aging feature, but rather more so for the puffiness that I get around my eyes when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep at night.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY when I was scheduled to arrive.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied the serum,  </li>
            <li>The HA helps tighten and lift the loosened skin under and around the eyes, giving you a younger, more refreshed look..</li>
            <li>I love the pump, it doesnt pump to much like some products do, its just enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with eye serums.</li>
            <li>It feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li>this does make a difference on your skin thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really recommend this eye serum.</li>
            <li>makes me skin feel soft under and feel fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pretty young</li>
            <li>I would recommend to try this for sure, It did wonders for my dark circles and bags.</li>
            <li>I am only 25 and have just begun using anti-aging products (after a brief stint of drugstore garbage during my early teenage years) and am doing a lot of research regarding effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I only have so much time to get ready before rushing to work.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, so I&#x27;m also happy that this will last.</li>
            <li>I am currently using and I really like the consistency of this product.  </li>
            <li>I may have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Please let me note that I normally have VERY sensitive skin (especially around the eyes).</li>
            <li>I can definitely see a difference in the skin around my eyes and the fine lines that I had are alot less visible.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen visible results in reducing fine lines yet, but my eyes feel significantly less puffy and dry when I wake up.</li>
            <li>, it glides on smooth not like a thick cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles in a morning anymore and fine lines around eye area much less visible...</li>
            <li>It does dry fast so you do not have to wait long to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for, has made my eye puffiness go down and smoother after each application!</li>
            <li>and I must say my dark circles under my eyes have gotten much lighter.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for approximately two days and haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes, but definitely will continue to use it as it is rare to find an eye serum that doesn&#x27;t burn the shit out of my eye area after I apply it.</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m extremely particular about the products I test or use everyday.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few days so far, but like it!</li>
            <li> Good products are hard to find,  and I was always skeptical about the reviews,  but after trying this product I am a believer in miracles</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not really old, I can already see lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that the cover closes well and doesnt have any weird loose openings</li>
            <li> I feel like you only need a little bit to go a long way, and this bottle is a lot and will last very long.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes can get dry and when I put makeup on it looks caked on.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I refrained from using eye creams in the morning simply because they took too long to dry, and I couldn&#x27;t want that long to start putting on eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday morning and night and definitely noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also,  a plus is a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Combined with concealer, this eye cream makes my eyes look wide awake and much less puffy.</li>
            <li> With this serum, my dark circles started disappearing</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried Biore Enliven Eye Gel, and boy was that a mistake- Sticky, didn&#x27;t absorb well at all, and had these strange sparkles suspended throughout.</li>
            <li> but that will take a little longer to see</li>
            <li> I had little faith in a product that would solve the problem,  </li>
            <li> I opened it up to find that the straw part that guides the  product was missing.</li>
            <li> It looks very expensive and is reminiscent of other products I have previously purchased from high-end department stores.</li>
            <li> You just have to use a small amount of this.</li>
            <li> I found my forever potion for my eyes,  I always suffer from Puffy tired looking eyes with bags and dark circles underneath. .  </li>
            <li> Well at least It did when I used it.</li>
            <li> We are addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive creams that did nothing for me before.</li>
            <li> I have serious issues with waking up with puffy eyes in the morning, or getting puffy eyes when I am sick with colds or allergies.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had been trying this product for a week by now and I have to say that I love it! The look it gives to your eyes it&#x27;s amazing. I like that the circles are going away as well as some of the lines that I&#x27;m starting to show...good product buy it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 days now &amp;, of course, don&#x27;t see a difference quite yet. I really like the texture &amp; it goes on smoothly. I will update in 2 weeks after more use.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used it everyday morning and night and definitely noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes. People have complimented how alert and youthful I look now. Great formula and does not sting (contact wearer) or leave a greasy feeling. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product.  Under my eyes can get dry and when I put makeup on it looks caked on.  This has helped with adding moisture and my makeup looks smooth.  Also,  a plus is a little bit goes a long way!  Good product!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 months now with no results or changes.</li>
            <li> I am currently using and I really like the consistency of this product.  It goes on very smoothly and provides a bit of tightening around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Feels good on your face!</li>
            <li> Received my product today. Shipping was quick. I was eargeres to use my product right away however when I opened it and tried to use the product from the pump nothing will come out. I opened it up to find that the straw part that guides the  product was missing. It would be nice if I didn&#x27;t have to open the bottle in order to use it.</li>
            <li> Prime eye serum&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;m not really old, I can already see lines under my eyes. And it scares me to see it. Thus serum is different from the ones I used before. It&#x27;s  like a cream. It has a cooling effect when you apply it. Well at least It did when I used it. It is thicker in consistency but once you apply it it doesn&#x27;t feel that way. It&#x27;s  very light. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks and I can already serum the lines fading. I don&#x27;t expect it to work like magic but serumeeeeing a change means it&#x27;s working. I would definitely recommend  it. You don&#x27;t have to have lines to use it. I think it&#x27;s  better to use it without so you can prevent it. That&#x27;s  my opinion though. Hopefully it works for you as it did with me. I bought this for a discounted price in exchange  for my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now and can see some noticeable results. A small amount goes a long way, so I&#x27;m also happy that this will last.</li>
            <li> I Love this product :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for, has made my eye puffiness go down and smoother after each application!</li>
            <li> great not too thick,  very comfortable to use. I have seen improvements while using this.&lt;br /&gt;The pump is also very useful and sanitary. I feel like you only need a little bit to go a long way, and this bottle is a lot and will last very long. I also enjoy that the cover closes well and doesnt have any weird loose openings</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 4 days but I like it. You can feel the difference in your skins hydration. I am hoping to see my fine lines around my eyes to go away but that will take a little longer to see so I will keep everyone updated on that.   Now that i have been using the product longer I can definitely see a difference in the skin around my eyes and the fine lines that I had are alot less visible. This product does work. My eyes look more rested and the skin is much more smooth. I would recommend this product to a friend. Good Product!!</li>
            <li> Love it.awesome product</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling smooth, and fresh.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I&#x27;ve used expensive creams that did nothing for me before. With this serum, my dark circles started disappearing and I&#x27;m noticing gratitude skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my eyes!! I love the way it makes my eyes look and feel! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good products are hard to find,  and I was always skeptical about the reviews,  but after trying this product I am a believer in miracles I found my forever potion for my eyes,  I always suffer from Puffy tired looking eyes with bags and dark circles underneath. .  I had little faith in a product that would solve the problem,  this is it... This Is the only solution that has ever helped me..  Try it...  This is my go to product from now on I was lucky to have witnessed it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> I just going to say im amazing with this eye serum i saw a different 3 days after using prive eye serum..it tightens lifts moisturizers the skin..and reduces puffiness...love it i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with eye serums. I am only 25 and have just begun using anti-aging products (after a brief stint of drugstore garbage during my early teenage years) and am doing a lot of research regarding effective ingredients. I don&#x27;t ever expect an eye lift in a bottle, but this stuff is pretty great. I love that it is really easily applied. In the past, I tried Biore Enliven Eye Gel, and boy was that a mistake- Sticky, didn&#x27;t absorb well at all, and had these strange sparkles suspended throughout. This eye serum is smooth, non-greasy, and quick-absorbing. I have serious issues with waking up with puffy eyes in the morning, or getting puffy eyes when I am sick with colds or allergies. This stuff makes me look like I got a great night&#x27;s sleep and feel confident in my skin&#x27;s appearance. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I love the packaging of this product. It looks very expensive and is reminiscent of other products I have previously purchased from high-end department stores. It comes in a great-looking bottle that I couldn&#x27;t wait to use. I&#x27;m still pretty young so I wouldn&#x27;t say that I used this for the anti-aging feature, but rather more so for the puffiness that I get around my eyes when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep at night. I use this both when I wake up and before I go to sleep at night. In the morning, I only have so much time to get ready before rushing to work. Previously, I refrained from using eye creams in the morning simply because they took too long to dry, and I couldn&#x27;t want that long to start putting on eye makeup. I love that this one dries much more quickly, allowing me to actually apply it in the early morning. Combined with concealer, this eye cream makes my eyes look wide awake and much less puffy. I love that it glides on as easily as a moisturizer would, which is a must when it comes to my requirements for eye cream. Overall a great purchase - very effective and easy to use.    I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> So far so good. No bad reaction. Will update once I&#x27;ve used it a bit.</li>
            <li> I work in the beauty industry so I&#x27;m extremely particular about the products I test or use everyday. Decided to try this after spotting a good deal. Really impressive natural ingredients from the get go. Feels and goes on quite luxuriously with a non-tacky, non-greasy texture. I haven&#x27;t seen visible results in reducing fine lines yet, but my eyes feel significantly less puffy and dry when I wake up. It feels very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I am happy worth this product to date. I received the eye serum EXACTLY when I was scheduled to arrive. The container fits easily in the palm of your hands, which makes for easy travel and great storage.  The eye serum has a &amp;#34;pump style&amp;#34; applicator which makes it very easy to pump out the perfect amount needed. The first time I applied the serum,  it felt cool and a bit tingly on my skin. Please let me note that I normally have VERY sensitive skin (especially around the eyes). However,  this serum did not burn or irritate my eye area. I have been using it for approximately two days and haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes, but definitely will continue to use it as it is rare to find an eye serum that doesn&#x27;t burn the shit out of my eye area after I apply it. I will results in the future. I have been taking &amp;#34;progress&amp;#34; pictures to note results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to review it.  I may have sensitive skin but I found this too strong for my eyes.  Kinda stung.  But might work better for others.  Good seller</li>
            <li> All of those creams we see on tv can&#x27;t touch this!</li>
            <li> this does make a difference on your skin thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really recommend this eye serum. I don&#x27;t have dark circles in a morning anymore and fine lines around eye area much less visible...</li>
            <li> Help reduce bags and swelling under eyes.. Especially after short nights of rest.. The HA helps tighten and lift the loosened skin under and around the eyes, giving you a younger, more refreshed look.. Just ordered some more for myself and some family members on their website... We are addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye serum I have tried so far for my dark circles. I use this twice a day, morning and night under my makeup. It does dry fast so you do not have to wait long to apply makeup. This has no unpleasant order at all and feels great on! makes me skin feel soft under and feel fresh, it glides on smooth not like a thick cream. This does feel cool and tingly at first which I love and does not irritated my sensitive skin at all. I love the pump, it doesnt pump to much like some products do, its just enough. You just have to use a small amount of this. A little goes a long way. I did recieve this at a discounted rate in exchange for honest feedback so the price was great. I would recommend to try this for sure, It did wonders for my dark circles and bags. I notice the difference in 2 days time</li>
            <li> Have only used it a few days so far, but like it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks and I must say my dark circles under my eyes have gotten much lighter.</li>
