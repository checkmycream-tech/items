            <li> I love the cologne.  Very fresh scent.  Lasts a long time.  Only complaint is that the seller sent perfume with a spray top not attached that didn&#x27;t fit.  I had to fix it.</li>
            <li> Awesome . Smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Great fragrance... One of my very favorites... It&#x27;s a must buy...</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.  But hasn&#x27;t made it into my rotation.  Reminds me of the old Polo cologne that came in a green bottle.</li>
            <li> Not what i thought it would be.  Didn&#x27;t really like it.  Most fragrances i  don&#x27;t care for i just put on my dog.  This one i don&#x27;t even want to smell on him (the dog). Smells medicinal........</li>
            <li> The perfect scent for a foodie!</li>
            <li> great cologne! The seller got it to me in a timely fashion and I got many compliments on this one. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of the Jo Malone colognes</li>
            <li> I love it, only wish I could find a larger bottle</li>
            <li> Love Jo Malone products. This is such a clean smelling scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the Nordys counter, great scent! Not overpowering and adds an oomph to an already easy/positive vibe.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, clean, and fresh!</li>
            <li> not what I thought it to be very cheap smelling not the real stuff</li>
            <li> I do NOT like this smell.  It reminds me of floor cleaner.</li>
            <li> Bottle was clearly labeled &amp;#34;Not for Sale&amp;#34;.  Just curious why i had to pay for it.  Liked the fragrance but not pleased that I paid for something that was clearly a free sample.</li>
            <li> Jo Malone fragrances are way over rated in my opinion.  This don&#x27;t detect anything in this fragrance but some Basil and what smells like a faded version of orange.  Very masculine scent - not even a clean scent to me.  I&#x27;ve tried many Jo Malone fragrances and have never been impressed.</li>
            <li> Fragrance too strong. Am wondering where this came from since bottle says not for sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice,but not that great.Will try a different scent next time</li>
            <li> Authentic stuff, great transaction! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the purse.  Bottle is non refillable.  :(</li>
