    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and the issue I had with a piercing began to resolve itself after a couple of baths.</li>
            <li>and that this would be the perfect addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great but the expense is too steep.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I was also happy to see that the tub rinsed out without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this means if you follow instructions one container of salt will be good for two uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful in the jar but the lavender scent dissipates fairly quickly once it&#x27;s dissolved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been soaking my foot in a tub of warm water and epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), which feels good and is supposed to help the healing.</li>
            <li>It still smells nice and my skin feels good after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On opening the jar, I smelled a very pleasant aroma of soap and a mild lavender scent.</li>
            <li>Lovely to soak out your aches and pains!</li>
            <li>It would certainly help and I&#x27;d be a very loyal customer!!!!</li>
            <li>But, it remains a nice treat for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li>She liked the way her skin felt after getting out of the bath and drying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They have a wonderful relaxing lavender aroma and really do work to soften your skin.  </li>
            <li>It just smelled nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Relaxing, Nice aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice lavender part to the smell.</li>
            <li>This tub has a nice mixture of ingredients to help relax away a stressful day.</li>
            <li>I Olely is putting together their own web site, so</li>
            <li>Very satisfied :-)</li>
            <li>My wife took her bath with a cup of the salts added to the bath water, and the warm water seemed to release more of the lavender scent, turning her bath into almost an aromatherapy session.</li>
            <li>label says that in addition to the salt and milk, the bath soak contains vitamin E, olive oil, almond oil (all great for your skin), chamomile (helps calm skin issues) and lavender for its relaxing aromatherapy qualities.  </li>
            <li>This is a very fine blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It’s practical packaging, but not what I’d call elegant or “gifty” if you’re looking to give this as a gift.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with Olely Salt and will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love nothing more then to sit in a nice jacuzzi and enjoy the relaxing retreat.</li>
            <li>Of course the jacuzzi needs to have bath salts in it, and my favorite smell is lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can not use it more than two times as per recommended dosage.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately the entire bathroom smelled wonderfully of lavender!  </li>
            <li>ignore the instructions on how much to use, I just pour salts in the water until I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t run into too many bath products that leave a ring or stain on my tub.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent of lavender</li>
            <li>and I love to soak in a tub.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>really liked this product, and think it was worth the price!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s not as rigorous of a salt treatment as others I’ve used, but the mild nature is a nice change, and more relaxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent of lavender immediately filled the room, but not in any overwhelming way.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly it is not the best soak, it disappears really quickly and offers mild skin conditioning.</li>
            <li>formula contains lavender essential oil and chamomile extract, which give the hot water and steamy air a wonderful scent that calms the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth.</li>
            <li>This one is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>The bath was neither rich nor creamy.  </li>
            <li>lavender scent is nice – not too strong, but enough that it’s clearly there and pleasant.</li>
            <li>In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards, I enjoy a quick rinse under the shower followed by a pot of tea and a manicure and pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling and smelling clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the salt or the milk, but I felt relaxed, clean and pampered.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it made any big difference, but it did feel good, and the skin on my toes felt a bit softer afterward.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it but have tried another one that I like better.  </li>
            <li>This jar is good for two full baths but you can use it for multiple foot or hand soaks.</li>
            <li>If the smell isn&#x27;t strong enough, I pour more in.</li>
            <li>May not be worth the price</li>
            <li>The salts dissolve quickly in a tub of hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked Olely salt it dissolved quickly, it has a nice scent, but not a very strong scent, it left my skin feeling softer.</li>
            <li>I like the smell very much.</li>
            <li>makes you feel like you are in a day spa, as you smell and watch the  salts begin to dissolve in the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have pretty purple flowers in it.</li>
            <li>And the pretty lady does not come with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thus, I was delighted when I was offered the this [[ASIN:B00IRBY2R6 Lavender Dead Sea Salts &amp; Milk Bath Soak]]  to try.  </li>
            <li>and I liked the other product because of the lavender aroma.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that I like better than the scent of lavender, so much so that I surround myself with it whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>So when I decide it&#x27;s time for a long soaky bath with a locked door and a good book, I like to make it as decadent as possible by adding bath salts to the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After weeks of back and forth to the hospital,  a couple of nights ago I decided that I deserved a good long soak in a real bath</li>
            <li>It is very soothing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use as much as they recommend and I still like the effect in my bath</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a reasonably priced bath salt.</li>
            <li>received the Olely dead sea salt for evaluation and an honest review.</li>
            <li>you do get in this nice cold cream sized jar, is a nicely scented bath salt that makes a very soft bath, somewhere between the feel of a bubble bath and pure Epsom salts.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting twist on the typical bath salts in that it includes milk proteins.</li>
            <li>These are high end bath salts.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my well earned bath did leave my skin nice and soft, I was surprised that this one container (16 ounces) holds only enough soak for two baths.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy Mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to soak in the tub very often.  </li>
            <li>felt like a new person when I got out of the jacuzzi.  </li>
            <li>was surprised by the dosage recommended in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>calcium lactate;  and vitamin E, almond, and olive oils soothe irritated skin and leave it soft and silky, without pruning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in larger quantities at a more economical price.  </li>
            <li>Once I grudgingly got out of the bath, I could see that my skin was soft, and hydrated, and especially the patch of eczema on my elbow was calmed and happy.  </li>
            <li>had the opportunity to sneak away for a long bath last weekend and added a cup of this product to the hot water.  </li>
            <li>The water was slightly milky and slippery, and I could feel my stress draining away as I sunk down into the water and let the ingredients do their magic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Lavender Dead Sea Salts and Milk Bath Soak for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I like using it for my feet which leaves them soft and ready for a little exfoliating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo17ADML1VD8HJ3]]I have to start by saying that I do hot baths very frequently as they help my bad back and let me sleep better.  </li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Salt &amp; Milk lavender mineral bath soak from OLELY transforms a hot bath into a spa.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product, leaves skin feeling silky, and the scent is very calming, although I suggest cutting back on the recommended individual usage amount.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water).</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17ADML1VD8HJ3]]I have to start by saying that I do hot baths very frequently as they help my bad back and let me sleep better.  </li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Salt &amp; Milk lavender mineral bath soak from OLELY transforms a hot bath into a spa.  </li>
            <li> Lovely product, leaves skin feeling silky, and the scent is very calming, although I suggest cutting back on the recommended individual usage amount.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water).</li>
            <li> only downsides is that it is a bit pricey compared with other Dead Sea salt soaks I’ve used, and the packaging is pretty basic – just a simple plastic tub with a screw-off lid.</li>
            <li> I recently had minor surgery on one of my big toes.</li>
            <li> The grains are small and dissolve readily.</li>
            <li> Worse, I also found myself confused by the marked lack of that spectacular lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different salts and Olely bath salts rank high among them.</li>
            <li> (A single bath requires an entire cup of the soak.)  </li>
            <li> I feel that this product is a little overpriced, as the jar only contains enough for two baths.  </li>
            <li> Besides, I&#x27;m usually responsible for any rings left behind, not the salts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have used slightly over the half of the container at my reduced dosage rate.</li>
            <li> My soak had no particular odor at all, never mind lavender.  </li>
            <li> The healing has taken longer than I expected, which concerned me just a bit, since I&#x27;m diabetic.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, the Lavender Dead Sea Salts does not make the bath water look like a white milk bath.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the usual amount I use for a big bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this to give as a gift, but it arrived looking scuffed and unpresentable.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath soak because it contained dead sea salt and lavender.The lavender being calming and dead sea salt will draw away impurities out of your skin.It worked wonderfully and the issue I had with a piercing began to resolve itself after a couple of baths.I only wish they made this in a larger size, because I am already almost out of this.I would definitely recommend and purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting twist on the typical bath salts in that it includes milk proteins. No, you won’t be tempted to bring some cereal along when you’re taking a bath, but rather the milk, plus the added oils (see ingredient list below) takes the edge off the typical skin drying nature of bath salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender scent is nice – not too strong, but enough that it’s clearly there and pleasant. The grains are small and dissolve readily. The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Sea Salt&lt;br /&gt;Milk proteins&lt;br /&gt;Calcium Lactate&lt;br /&gt;FD&amp;C coloring&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E oil&lt;br /&gt;Almond oil&lt;br /&gt;Olive oil&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label states that it is made in the US from local and imported ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s not as rigorous of a salt treatment as others I’ve used, but the mild nature is a nice change, and more relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides is that it is a bit pricey compared with other Dead Sea salt soaks I’ve used, and the packaging is pretty basic – just a simple plastic tub with a screw-off lid. It’s practical packaging, but not what I’d call elegant or “gifty” if you’re looking to give this as a gift. But, it remains a nice treat for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> On opening the jar, I smelled a very pleasant aroma of soap and a mild lavender scent. My wife took her bath with a cup of the salts added to the bath water, and the warm water seemed to release more of the lavender scent, turning her bath into almost an aromatherapy session. She liked the way her skin felt after getting out of the bath and drying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a different use for the bath salts. I recently had minor surgery on one of my big toes. The healing has taken longer than I expected, which concerned me just a bit, since I&#x27;m diabetic. I&#x27;ve been soaking my foot in a tub of warm water and epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), which feels good and is supposed to help the healing. One night, I added a heaping tablespoon of the lavender Dead Sea salts to the water. I can&#x27;t say that it made any big difference, but it did feel good, and the skin on my toes felt a bit softer afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recommended amount to use for a bath is one cup, and the jar contains about two cups, so using the recommended amount, you&#x27;ll get two baths from a 16-ounce jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> These are high end bath salts.  They have a wonderful relaxing lavender aroma and really do work to soften your skin.  They are in no way a bargain product though as as a cup is recommended for each use making them relatively costly.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17ADML1VD8HJ3]]I have to start by saying that I do hot baths very frequently as they help my bad back and let me sleep better.  I have tried many different salts and Olely bath salts rank high among them. I liked Olely salt it dissolved quickly, it has a nice scent, but not a very strong scent, it left my skin feeling softer. There is no problem with staining the bath tub, using these salts that not generate any extra work in terms of cleaning.  The scent is noticeable but not overwhelming and it airs out quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salt comes in a plastic jar which is 3.375\\&quot; tall and 3.5\\&quot; in diameter.  It hold 16 oz of salt.  The instructions on the label say to use one cup of salt per use.  One cup is 8 oz, and the container contains 16 oz of salt.  So this means if you follow instructions one container of salt will be good for two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by the dosage recommended in the instructions.  Based on my previous experience with other salts I am using less.  I would estimate that I use 2-3 oz per use.  It still smells nice and my skin feels good after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Olely dead sea salt for evaluation and an honest review. So far I have used slightly over the half of the container at my reduced dosage rate. In addition to making my bath soaks more pleasant I noticed another other benefit. I noticed that the calluses on my feet are easier to treat after the soak in the bath with salts (compared to the soak in plain hot water). It takes fewer strokes with a pumice sponge to get my feet totally smooth. I am pleased with Olely Salt and will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Salt &amp; Milk lavender mineral bath soak from OLELY transforms a hot bath into a spa.  A half-hour of of soaking in it leaves me feeling relaxed and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula contains lavender essential oil and chamomile extract, which give the hot water and steamy air a wonderful scent that calms the mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral salts from the Dead Sea;  milk proteins;  calcium lactate;  and vitamin E, almond, and olive oils soothe irritated skin and leave it soft and silky, without pruning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I enjoy a quick rinse under the shower followed by a pot of tea and a manicure and pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for review by OLELY.</li>
            <li> I love nothing more then to sit in a nice jacuzzi and enjoy the relaxing retreat. Of course the jacuzzi needs to have bath salts in it, and my favorite smell is lavender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a 16 ounce jar or lavender Dead Sea salt &amp; milk bath soak by Olely, which I put in my jacuzzi.  The scent of lavender immediately filled the room, but not in any overwhelming way.  It just smelled nice and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender mixed with the salt,  makes you feel like you are in a day spa, as you smell and watch the  salts begin to dissolve in the hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my cares, aches and pains start to dissolve as I unwind for 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like a new person when I got out of the jacuzzi.  This is a very fine blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product, and think it was worth the price!  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that I like better than the scent of lavender, so much so that I surround myself with it whenever possible.  Used in aromatherapy for relaxation and stress relief, I&#x27;ve also been using lavender for over fifteen years for migraine relief.  For me it works faster than any drug - without the side effects.  Thus, I was delighted when I was offered the this [[ASIN:B00IRBY2R6 Lavender Dead Sea Salts &amp; Milk Bath Soak]]  to try.  After weeks of back and forth to the hospital,  a couple of nights ago I decided that I deserved a good long soak in a real bath (if I never see another shower again it might be too soon!) and that this would be the perfect addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my well earned bath did leave my skin nice and soft, I was surprised that this one container (16 ounces) holds only enough soak for two baths. (A single bath requires an entire cup of the soak.)  The bath was neither rich nor creamy.  In fact, the soak simply disappeared into the water. Worse, I also found myself confused by the marked lack of that spectacular lavender scent. My soak had no particular odor at all, never mind lavender.  The only distinguishable ingredient that I could either see or smell was powdered milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 -  There is a difference between high end and simply expensive.  I&#x27;m hoping that the problems I saw with this bath soak are simply a one-off quality control issue, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to stock this in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your call.</li>
            <li> The sea salt work for my purposes. I used less than the recommended amount in order to extend the value. A bit pricy for the number of time it can be used.</li>
            <li> This bath salts is a milky looking salts when you put it in the bath.  I really like it but have tried another one that I like better.  It is very soothing and I liked the other product because of the lavender aroma.</li>
            <li> Relaxing, Nice aroma therapy.  Stress busting. Leaves you feeling and smelling clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lovely to soak out your aches and pains!</li>
            <li> This is great but the expense is too steep. You can not use it more than two times as per recommended dosage.</li>
            <li> I now have a spa bathroom !</li>
            <li> Lovely product, leaves skin feeling silky, and the scent is very calming, although I suggest cutting back on the recommended individual usage amount.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use as much as they recommend and I still like the effect in my bath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy Mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to soak in the tub very often.  So when I decide it&#x27;s time for a long soaky bath with a locked door and a good book, I like to make it as decadent as possible by adding bath salts to the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity to sneak away for a long bath last weekend and added a cup of this product to the hot water.  Almost immediately the entire bathroom smelled wonderfully of lavender!  The water was slightly milky and slippery, and I could feel my stress draining away as I sunk down into the water and let the ingredients do their magic.  Once I grudgingly got out of the bath, I could see that my skin was soft, and hydrated, and especially the patch of eczema on my elbow was calmed and happy.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the salt or the milk, but I felt relaxed, clean and pampered.  I was also happy to see that the tub rinsed out without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says that in addition to the salt and milk, the bath soak contains vitamin E, olive oil, almond oil (all great for your skin), chamomile (helps calm skin issues) and lavender for its relaxing aromatherapy qualities.  I feel that this product is a little overpriced, as the jar only contains enough for two baths.  I often use plain epsom salts for my soaks, which is quite a bit cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of Lavender Dead Sea Salts and Milk Bath Soak for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, the Lavender Dead Sea Salts does not make the bath water look like a white milk bath. It doesn&#x27;t have pretty purple flowers in it. And the pretty lady does not come with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you do get in this nice cold cream sized jar, is a nicely scented bath salt that makes a very soft bath, somewhere between the feel of a bubble bath and pure Epsom salts. I like the smell very much. There is a nice lavender part to the smell. There is a sort of Dove soap smell going on also - to me that&#x27;s a good thing. The salts dissolve quickly in a tub of hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ignore the instructions on how much to use, I just pour salts in the water until I&#x27;m happy. If the smell isn&#x27;t strong enough, I pour more in. In this case, I used about a quarter or maybe less of the jar. That&#x27;s about the usual amount I use for a big bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a reasonably priced bath salt. The softness of the bath is due to vitamins, oils, and milk proteins in the salts. I haven&#x27;t run into too many bath products that leave a ring or stain on my tub. This is no exception; it didn&#x27;t leave a mark on the tub. Besides, I&#x27;m usually responsible for any rings left behind, not the salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad the purple flowers weren&#x27;t in the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft and smooth. Too bad the jar isn&#x27;t larger. I purchased 2. Very satisfied :-)</li>
            <li> May not be worth the price</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of lavender and I love to soak in a tub. This tub has a nice mixture of ingredients to help relax away a stressful day. Admittedly it is not the best soak, it disappears really quickly and offers mild skin conditioning. It smells wonderful in the jar but the lavender scent dissipates fairly quickly once it&#x27;s dissolved. This jar is good for two full baths but you can use it for multiple foot or hand soaks. I like using it for my feet which leaves them soft and ready for a little exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for testing out.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Other Dead Sea Salts without any additional skin conditioning oils will dry out your skin.  This one is FANTASTIC.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in larger quantities at a more economical price.  I Olely is putting together their own web site, so I&#x27;ll wait and see if they offer this product in bulk.  It would certainly help and I&#x27;d be a very loyal customer!!!!</li>
