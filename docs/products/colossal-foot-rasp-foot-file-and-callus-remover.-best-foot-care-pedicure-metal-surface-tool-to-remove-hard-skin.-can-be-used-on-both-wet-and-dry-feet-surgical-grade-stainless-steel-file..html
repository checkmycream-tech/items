            <li>I know it&#x27;s exciting to get those heals looking smooth but beware!!</li>
            <li>I really did not expect Colossal Foot Rasp File and Callus Remover to be as big as it was, but I was happy that it was because this is the perfect foot filer.</li>
            <li>but I am happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I got mine for free and I must say I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I received the Colossal Foot Rasp File at no charge for my honest review</li>
            <li>My feet looked amazing afterwards and were nice and soft!</li>
            <li>You can get cut easily on this.  </li>
            <li>Well at first I was kind of nervous to use this.</li>
            <li>They were cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve always bothered me, and I&#x27;m really happy to have finally gotten a foot file to try to get rid of this problem.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free gift for a review.</li>
            <li>It made by feet softer but didn&#x27;t make them smooth,</li>
            <li>I Received this product to review for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>It removes the callus and it will remove the good stuff, too if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve  ever used the stuff that came off my feet was unbelievable</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, don&#x27;t hesitate it is completely worth it!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I were so excited to try this product</li>
            <li>This purchase is definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li>The stainless steel surface is very fine</li>
            <li>It really makes getting those crunchy heals easy as pie!</li>
            <li>and I washed it every time i used to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>This foot rasp, however, has completely done its job plus more!</li>
            <li>When i first received this in the mail, i was surprised by the shear size of it, LOL Colossal is right!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, didn&#x27;t have to apply too much pressure, easy to clean afterwards, and didn&#x27;t cut my skin.  </li>
            <li>good size product surface, light weight, easy to use, minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that it is so good, you have to pay attention or can make your foot sore.</li>
            <li>How many advertised products really do that?  </li>
            <li>I recieved the Colossal Foot Rasp File for free and I will say this file is the best I&#x27;ve ever used in 35 yrs!I removes callus dry buildup on your heels in just a few minutes!I liked the size of it,it was comfortable to hold!You</li>
            <li>I always have rough feet during the summer from wearing flips flops or going barefoot and this has been by far one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I totally love this product and Highly recommend it to any who want the spa results at home.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>this is the first exfoliator that I could find that worked on my feet!</li>
            <li>I received it as a free sample, but I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They say not to rush in one treatment and they are right.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this my feet soften right up.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a sturdy product!</li>
            <li>Even after the first day you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Love how it takes dead skin and callous off easily</li>
            <li>So, if you want a really large foot file that really works, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li>The humongous size of the file allows it to cover more of your foot so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to soften your soles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure is the last foot file I will EVER had to purchase!I highly RECOMEND</li>
            <li>I love the long handle!</li>
            <li>and that was so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying the product works really well.</li>
            <li>After using the file one or two times, my feet felt SO much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise this worked very well.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t really do their jobs.</li>
            <li>I am excited to have received it, and I just know it is built to last!</li>
            <li>I live in flip flops or barefoot, so my feet constantly take a beating, and after just the first use my feet are smooth and soft again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about you all, but I sure don&#x27;t like wearing backless shoes when my heals look like a cracked up mess.</li>
            <li>It is kind of big and really sharp.</li>
            <li>live in Arizona</li>
            <li>The only thing I actually didn&#x27;t like was that this thing is HUGE.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in over 2 years, &amp; it made my feet look &amp; feel so soft!</li>
            <li>The first thing that i noticed is that there is a 30 day money back guarantee, which shows me that the company believes in their product and that it would work for you.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Its big and the large handle helps to move around the desired foot area.</li>
            <li>it got all the dead skin and kept my skin nice and smooth which is very hard to find in a product</li>
            <li>This rasp fixed that problem up in a jiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had calluses pretty much as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>This product actually works really well.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend using this on wet feet because it really helps the dead skin pretty much just fall off of your feet.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Make sure not to file too hard on the same area of your foot because it can cause sensitivity and break the skin.</li>
            <li>It actually takes off yucky dead skin &amp; leaves heals smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had that no other foot scrub could.</li>
            <li>I did have thick build up on my heels but after using this for a few days and followed up with moisturizer, my heels are super smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great gift for those who have ugly feet.  </li>

            <li> Make sure not to file too hard on the same area of your foot because it can cause sensitivity and break the skin.</li>
            <li> It actually takes off yucky dead skin &amp; leaves heals smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had that no other foot scrub could.</li>
            <li> I did have thick build up on my heels but after using this for a few days and followed up with moisturizer, my heels are super smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for those who have ugly feet.  </li>
            <li> The inner side that&#x27;s used for filing is actually flat..</li>
            <li> Give your feet a few days to acclimate to their new soles.</li>
            <li> I have very calloused feet and every other product Ive tried could never get all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet almost all day long</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how much dead skin was just falling off.</li>
            <li> must check every few swipes because it is very sharp and removes cracked buildup fast</li>
            <li> My feet have the same feel as if I went and spent $50 at the salon!</li>
            <li> and we both highly recommend it if you have hard calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li> My feet are terribly dry and are cracked.</li>
            <li> I chose to use this after my shower while my feet were still wet, but it does say you can use it on dry feet also.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> This works on feet either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> and I just feel great knowing that terrible buildup is</li>
            <li> I tried mine on wet feet</li>
            <li> And it actually removed the dead skin</li>
            <li> Well being a girl I don&#x27;t like my feet to be rough.</li>
            <li> One warning, please be careful while filing your feet, it has not happened to me</li>
            <li> I didnt even soak my feet and then use it like I had with other products, this one did it with my feet being dry!</li>
            <li> I have learned that a little pressure can go a long way though.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous because the filer itself is probably about 8-9 inches long</li>
            <li> I will say this product is sharp and quality so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products in the past with so-so results.</li>
            <li> After every other tried remedy, THIS one handled the callus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you could only see the amount of dead skin it takes off, you&#x27;d be amazed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products like this one</li>
            <li> My feet were looking and feeling very rough.</li>
            <li> but this is a very sharp product.</li>
            <li> It did take a few days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over do it or your feet will feel raw and sore!</li>
            <li> Man this got the job done on my always thick skinned bottom of the feet.  </li>
            <li> It is scary when you are filing your feet because you just dont expect that much dead skin.</li>
            <li> Holy dead skin!!!</li>
            <li> and I was so desperate to get rid of those dried off skin.</li>
            <li> Well there not around anymore, because I have broken them in the course of applying the pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wrong product.</li>
            <li> My husband has a very tough callus that&#x27;s been on his foot for a couple years, and he&#x27;s tried everything to get it off of there with no luck.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how bad my feet were until I used this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Totally Recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is THE foot file i was looking for. My feet were in the worst condition one can ever think of and I was so desperate to get rid of those dried off skin. This product did like wonders:) It gave me the same finish as if I am back from a salon. There are instructions with this file that are so helpful as to how to use it correctly. I tried mine on wet feet and that was so much easier to use. Its big and the large handle helps to move around the desired foot area. I used mine for a week and i am so so happy .I got one for my nephew and sister after seeing the results . They say not to rush in one treatment and they are right. Used it patiently and got the best results I wasnâ€™t even thinking of.The stainless steel surface is very fine and I washed it every time i used to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Holy dead skin!!! This thing does the job y&#x27;all!!! I have very calloused feet and every other product Ive tried could never get all the dead skin off. This thing did it amazingly well! I didnt even soak my feet and then use it like I had with other products, this one did it with my feet being dry! Its amazing! It really works!! I got this for free in return for my HONEST review of the product.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how bad my feet were until I used this. It was a bit intimidating when I got it because of the size, but I am inlove. My feet are so smooth&amp;free of callous&amp;dead skin. I HIGHLY recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Love how it takes dead skin and callous off easily</li>
            <li> So this has got to be my favorite foot tool yet. I&#x27;ve tried the ped egg and used to swear by it but haven&#x27;t been able to find replacements. I have also used a razor, and the electronic foot shaver but none get the results I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Arizona so in the summer my heels are terribly cracked so using this gets the yuck off. The only &amp;#34;issue&amp;#34; is that it is so good, you have to pay attention or can make your foot sore.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I love the size and how well it works! Would def recommend to anyone with feet problems.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this foot rapper. Sure, I have owned some of these before. Well there not around anymore, because I have broken them in the course of applying the pressure. They were cheaply made. Not this one, Boy! I am excited to have received it, and I just know it is built to last! Thanks for a sturdy product!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! I haven&#x27;t had a pedicure in over 2 years, &amp; it made my feet look &amp; feel so soft! I received it as a free sample, but I would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Product shipped fast and this is amazing!  My husband has terrible feet and I bought this with the callus remover and they worked amazing together!</li>
            <li> excellent with removing calluses</li>
            <li> This thing works like magic! Just a word of advice-- I know it&#x27;s exciting to get those heals looking smooth but beware!! Don&#x27;t over do it or your feet will feel raw and sore! So easy does it, sisters!  Pros: I love the long handle! It really makes getting those crunchy heals easy as pie! I don&#x27;t know about you all, but I sure don&#x27;t like wearing backless shoes when my heals look like a cracked up mess. This rasp fixed that problem up in a jiff. No lady should be without one of these cheese graders!!</li>
            <li> Man this got the job done on my always thick skinned bottom of the feet.  Quality.  I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. It removes the callus and it will remove the good stuff, too if you&#x27;re not careful. Use cautiously, and don&#x27;t try to remove everything all at once. Give your feet a few days to acclimate to their new soles. Have something underneath your feet. You will create a pile of callus.</li>
            <li> This foot file definitely gets the job done! The humongous size of the file allows it to cover more of your foot so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to soften your soles. Make sure not to file too hard on the same area of your foot because it can cause sensitivity and break the skin. It&#x27;s worth the purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to see if this will be a great product . I  Just bought it I will update how well it works once I receive it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had calluses pretty much as long as I can remember. They&#x27;ve always bothered me, and I&#x27;m really happy to have finally gotten a foot file to try to get rid of this problem. Let me start by saying the product works really well. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything, and it actually works at reducing the calluses on my feet. I really recommend using this on wet feet because it really helps the dead skin pretty much just fall off of your feet. After using the file one or two times, my feet felt SO much softer and nicer. The only thing I actually didn&#x27;t like was that this thing is HUGE. I know some people would actually like that, but I&#x27;d actually prefer something smaller and easier to handle. So, if you want a really large foot file that really works, this is what you&#x27;re looking for! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I received the Colossal Foot Rasp File at no charge for my honest review and I love it. It is summer and I am in sandals all day every day and that does a number on my feet, especially my heels. I have used similar products in the past with so-so results. This foot file is a keeper. I appreciated that there were instructions included so you could get the best results. I chose to use this after my shower while my feet were still wet, but it does say you can use it on dry feet also. I will say this product is sharp and quality so a little goes a long way. I did have thick build up on my heels but after using this for a few days and followed up with moisturizer, my heels are super smooth. It feels like I just left the spa, but didn&#x27;t have to spend all the $. I totally love this product and Highly recommend it to any who want the spa results at home.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free gift for a review. It made by feet softer but didn&#x27;t make them smooth, like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best callus remover!!! It is amazing! I live in flip flops or barefoot, so my feet constantly take a beating, and after just the first use my feet are smooth and soft again. This beats any pedicure with callus remover. It was easy to use, didn&#x27;t have to apply too much pressure, easy to clean afterwards, and didn&#x27;t cut my skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Works great</li>
            <li> I Received this product to review for free for my unbiased opinion. This is a sturdy handle And it actually removed the dead skin I had that no other foot scrub could.</li>
            <li> After every other tried remedy, THIS one handled the callus&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I recieved the Colossal Foot Rasp File for free and I will say this file is the best I&#x27;ve ever used in 35 yrs!I removes callus dry buildup on your heels in just a few minutes!I liked the size of it,it was comfortable to hold!You must check every few swipes because it is very sharp and removes cracked buildup fast and I ended up with scant bleeding on a area of my heel.My heels look like baby&#x27;s feet now!I put lotion on after and I just feel great knowing that terrible buildup is gone!This I&#x27;m sure is the last foot file I will EVER had to purchase!I highly RECOMEND you purchase this Foot Rasp File!</li>
            <li> Well at first I was kind of nervous to use this. It is kind of big and really sharp. But to my surprise this worked very well. I&#x27;m on my feet almost all day long so calluses are always around. Well being a girl I don&#x27;t like my feet to be rough. Since I have started using this my feet soften right up. Even after the first day you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I always have rough feet during the summer from wearing flips flops or going barefoot and this has been by far one of the best products I&#x27;ve purchased. You can use it wet or dry it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve  ever used the stuff that came off my feet was unbelievable this thing work wonders great product I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> My feet are terribly dry and are cracked. this is the first exfoliator that I could find that worked on my feet! My feet looked amazing afterwards and were nice and soft!</li>
            <li> This product was great it got all the dead skin and kept my skin nice and smooth which is very hard to find in a product definitely would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Rejoice with me!  This product actually works really well.  How many advertised products really do that?  It actually takes off yucky dead skin &amp; leaves heals smooth.  I have learned that a little pressure can go a long way though.  I bought a second one as a backup.  This tool is a good size too!.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! And it didn&#x27;t take a lot of effort. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> When I received this package, It came sealed in plastic with instructions. The first thing that i noticed is that there is a 30 day money back guarantee, which shows me that the company believes in their product and that it would work for you. I really did not expect Colossal Foot Rasp File and Callus Remover to be as big as it was, but I was happy that it was because this is the perfect foot filer. I was a little nervous because the filer itself is probably about 8-9 inches long and then it has a handle but it is so lightweight. This works on feet either wet or dry. It is scary when you are filing your feet because you just dont expect that much dead skin. I was surprised with how much dead skin was just falling off. One warning, please be careful while filing your feet, it has not happened to me but this is a very sharp product. You can get cut easily on this.  It did take a few days but I am happy with the results so far. I am very happy with this purchase and I will purchase this for family members and friends. I definitely recommend this product 100% This is a great gift for those who have ugly feet.  I am very happy with this product and I received this product for discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> WOW! My feet were looking and feeling very rough. I have bought many many items over the years and this one is the best. I received this for free and will for sure be buying another! My feet have the same feel as if I went and spent $50 at the salon!</li>
            <li> Used with callus eliminator!! So happy about this purchase!! Finally nice heels at home!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My feet are feeling awesome now!!! I don&#x27;t have to hide my feet!</li>
            <li> If you could only see the amount of dead skin it takes off, you&#x27;d be amazed! So glad I decided to try this out! I got mine for free and I must say I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve tried other products like this one but they didn&#x27;t really do their jobs. This foot rasp, however, has completely done its job plus more! My husband has a very tough callus that&#x27;s been on his foot for a couple years, and he&#x27;s tried everything to get it off of there with no luck. He tried getting the callus off with this foot rasp and it was like magic! I love the size of it, too! Definitely a good product. I highly recommend it!! I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. When i first received this in the mail, i was surprised by the shear size of it, LOL Colossal is right! I am however very pleased with this product, my feet have never been so happy! If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, don&#x27;t hesitate it is completely worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it just can&#x27;t be good. The inner side that&#x27;s used for filing is actually flat..It&#x27;s just wrong product.</li>
            <li> I made a review video on this product here:&lt;br /&gt;http://youtu.be/fkW8AbFsiE0&lt;br /&gt;This is by far one of the best foot files I have encountered.  For around $10 you can give yourself a wonderful pedicure as often as needed. My boyfriend and I were so excited to try this product and we both highly recommend it if you have hard calluses on your feet. Pros: good size product surface, light weight, easy to use, minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: makes a mess&lt;br /&gt;Solution: use outside, over a garbage can or the tub. This purchase is definitely worth the cost!</li>
