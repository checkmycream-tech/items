            <li> It&#x27; not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> gave it a four because its not outstanding.</li>
            <li> Another product that us hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This lotion carries a very delicate scent as it softens the skin.  </li>
            <li> Staying power is not great though.</li>
            <li> unable to get used to the smell</li>

            <li> Very good....&lt;br /&gt;I like this...smell good , moisture is good</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice by applying on skin or smelling. Just a little bit expensive. But worth it if u life Green tea&#x27;s smell. Quickly absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  The scent is light, the lotion is a good moisturizer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Gift for my wife.  This is her favorite lotion.  It smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a lover of green tea scent,  I got it for my mother but she didn&#x27;t like it, so that made more for me.  Excellent quality not to strong of a scent.  Not greasy, absorbs quickly. I will buy it again.  I liked the pump on the bottle as well.</li>
            <li> Smell good, same as the perfume. The weather in Chicago is dry, this body lotion is not that moisten. I need to use more. But I think it&#x27;s good in summer and autumn.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing Green Tea perfume for years, and was excited when I saw this.  Unfortunately, the lotion&#x27;s scent is far afield from the perfume.  I actually got up in the middle of the night to take a shower because I couldn&#x27;t stand another whiff of this.  I hope someone shopping at Goodwill appreciates it more than I did. And, dangit, I bought 2 of them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite daily &amp;#34;after shower&amp;#34; body lotion.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and highly recommend its refreshing body lotion feel and smell. I will continue to buy it--as long as it is available. I can only find it on Amazon.Com.  And, I thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and layer it with the cologne. I always get told that I smell great. It is a nice light fresh smelling daytime fragrance.</li>
            <li> great smell!!! love it! maybe not the best moisturizer out there but gives you a nice scent for the whole day :)</li>
            <li> Green Tea Lotion is a great way to wear my favorite scent every day.  It also keeps my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent, not to heavy.  Makes my skin feel great and the scent lasts a long time.  Have lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27; not overwhelming.  It is not drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this... but at first the scent is very strong... just a little WOW the first couple of times I used it. It&#x27;s not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed this &amp;#34;summertime&amp;#34; fragrance for a long time.  It seems a bit more intense than it used to be.  Could just be my imagination!!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time ,high quality product, excellent protection and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is good and it moisturizes skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT!  HAPPY LADY!  YOU GET DOUBLE FOR THE COST OF A  WONDERFUL SCENT.&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET TWO BOTTLES FOR A GREAT PRICE.  I PLAN BUYING MORE.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, if you like green tea I think you should try it. It is not very sticky but smooth your skin.</li>
            <li> Discovered this several years ago at the PX at Fort Bragg I get it anytime I see it.  I have never had any problems with the pump.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. It really does a good job of making my skin feel moist without feeling really weighed down and I LOVE the light citrus sent. I recommend</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift to 60 year old lady and she loves it.  Light smelling, and she says it last pretty much all day.  She wears it all the time.  She prefers the lotion to actual perfume.  Seems I did good!</li>
            <li> Smells so good.....going to be buying the honey tea one soon.....love it love love it&lt;br /&gt;Love it love love it</li>
            <li> I have not worn this scent for a few years.  Starting wearing it again and got lots of compliments.  Staying power is not great though.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion with a terrific scent.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I took a chance by ordering this lotion without ever trying it before, solely based on the good reviews, and boy! what a great purchase that was!!, this body lotions smells like heaven, what a wonderful, delicate, relaxing and amazing fragrance, so fresh and relaxing, wow!!, the texture is also excellent, non-greasy or heavy, but very smooth and light, after applied it your skin feels hydrated, soft and smells wonderful. This is right now my favorite body lotion, I want to buy many more in case one day they stop producing it (please don’t!!) LOL, so yes, do get this, it’s perfection.</li>
            <li> i like the scent. it makes me feel so relaxed. the lotion is not too oily and works well on my skin.</li>
            <li> Another product that us hard to find in stores now. I love the scent although it seems to me that it doesn&#x27;t last like it used to. People used to comment on the scent but it seems to dissipate very quickly.</li>
            <li> Fragrances very nice.  Just very light. Will be perfect for middle of summer sweltering heat. Especially layered with the perfume.</li>
            <li> Smooth lotion, not sticky as some are. Great scent and long lasting. Quick delivery. Plan on ordering again! A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. At a great price, Elizabeth Arden Green Tea body lotion is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I live in a very dry climate and this lotion is wonderful without being too greasy feeling.  The fragrance is not too overpowering, either.  Smells clean, feels good.</li>
            <li> Fast service great product..</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom. It smells like green tea and flower, not too much smelling. It makes the skin very soft.</li>
            <li> my husband loved the lotion. did leak a little bit when i received it. however, it is a good product.</li>
            <li> last a long long time</li>
            <li> unable to get used to the smell</li>
            <li> I have allergies and this doesn&#x27;t bother them. I&#x27;ve used it for years and no adverse reactions. Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the jar.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the scent in a lotion doesn&#x27;t match the cologne, but this one does. I like it, and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to go with the Green Tea fragrance I like to wear. Because the Green Tea perfume is so light, I found the lotion helps extend the fragrance. What I didn&#x27;t expect was what a very good lotion this is. Of course, since it is made by Elizabeth Arden, I should have known that. However, I would buy the lotion for its quality and not just for the scent.</li>
            <li> gift for a friend, I get it every year and they love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most exquisite smells that I have ever tried.  I use this lotion daily and I really love it so much that I went out shopping for the perfume to go with it.  I can&#x27;t describe the scent well enough, but I&#x27;ll give it a try.  It smells crisp and clean and elegant at the same time as though you&#x27;re walking through a garden, with a light perfume smell all around you. It also leaves your skin quite soft too, especially because perfumed lotions usually dry out your skin.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I forgot to buy lotion at the store and did not have time to run to the store again before I was going to run out of lotion.  I live in Colorado where lotion is a must.  However, if it is too greasy it also can cause you to break out. I decided to try this and was delighted with this product.  This did not cause me to break out. I love the way it smells.  I also like the feel when I put it on.</li>
            <li> moisturizing and light scent. Large bottle which should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a four because its not outstanding.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price! Fast delivery! I have ordered this product several times and every time I am just as satisfied.</li>
            <li> Real nice and refreashing.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.... I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Scent does not stay long</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for yrs. now and love it. Goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li> This is a great, light, lotion with a refreshing scent. Not overpowering</li>
            <li> Nice scent and feels great</li>
            <li> Lotion scent is a bit strong and does not absorb very well.  Okay in the bathroom to use on your hands after washing them.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for years and still love it. I do prefer the &amp;#34;honey drops&amp;#34; green tea lotion that comes in the tub, but this was a good price. Very silky non greasy feel with the fresh scent. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This lotion carries a very delicate scent as it softens the skin.  It is one of my favorites.  I love getting this huge bottle for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I use this every morning or night after my shower. It absorbs very quickly and it&#x27;s pretty lightweight, not thick and goopy, and the scent stays all day. I only have to reapply it to my hands on occasion. It&#x27;s so light and sweet and feminine, I&#x27;ve already gotten a bunch of compliments on it. Very happy with this lotion and I will most likely purchase the other Green Tea products from this line soon!</li>
