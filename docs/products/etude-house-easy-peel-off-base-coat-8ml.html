            <li>and it works great!</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>but, for the price i am happy</li>
            <li>This works great for what it is described for.</li>
            <li>So not to happy bout tht.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>The product is great, you can use any nail polish on it, and when you want to remove it, it will be easy!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It also works great to use on the skin around the nails for easy clean up after painting.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to carry out activities without getting smudges or dings.</li>
            <li>just make sure not to bump your nails together while its drying because then they will stick to themselves</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off easy</li>
            <li>I got this for the skin around my nails so that my manicures look clean</li>
            <li>love this product, works really well on my nails</li>
            <li>but when I used this it made my skin look like I had super glue all over it.</li>
            <li>Worth the try though.</li>
            <li>Instead, it coats the nail so the polish slides right off as soon as there is any trauma to the nail, nail bed, or cuticle.</li>
            <li>The product is a ok, but it peels only aliylttle at a time.</li>
            <li>However, if anything should bump your nails, even after the polish has been on for days, it will just peel right off in chunks or the whole</li>
            <li>Did not work as expected or as well as mini many moo.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>And for the price i expected something better.</li>
            <li>If you are very careful and don&#x27;t let anything bump your nails, then you are fine and the polish works as expected, it peels of very easily;  </li>
            <li>This worked great for a peel off base and its dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I would recommend applying a VERY thin layer, otherwise it might peel off on it&#x27;s own way sooner than you are expecting!</li>
            <li>It will peel off leaving no mess!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll completely ruin your nail</li>
            <li>you have to wait like 10 minutes for it to dry before adding any other polish on top, because if you do and this is wet</li>
            <li>But I realized i can actually make this at home for a much cheaper price without the long wait.</li>

            <li> Apply and let dry, then apply any glitter polish.</li>
            <li> you want a look that only needs to last a few hours</li>
            <li> This polish is very thick, so maybe I accidently put too much on.</li>
            <li> Paint on a thin coat, let dry completely,.</li>
            <li> Maybe works a little TOO well.</li>
            <li> I Even did a few dishes and my mani survived I would give this five stars</li>
            <li> The first time I used this on my nails, everything peeled off about 3 hours later, so I was definitely a little disappointed!</li>
            <li> so it makes it just a tad bit more difficult than other peel off base coats</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing or soaking your hard-to-remove glitter polish off.</li>
            <li> bet it is hard to get a formula that will resist peeling off inadvertently.</li>
            <li> I hated this polish.</li>
            <li> polish(it&#x27;ll clump up nasty).</li>
            <li> This base makes removing glitters a piece of cake!</li>

            <li> The product is a ok, but it peels only aliylttle at a time.</li>
            <li> Omg this is awesome.  Lol. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miraculous. Paint on a thin coat, let dry completely,. and then put on any glitter polish you like. It will peel off leaving no mess! No more scrubbing or soaking your hard-to-remove glitter polish off. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected or as well as mini many moo.  Worth the try though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off easy</li>
            <li> You can make it your self only using elemers glue and water</li>
            <li> The product is great, you can use any nail polish on it, and when you want to remove it, it will be easy! I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and it works great!</li>
            <li> This worked great for a peel off base and its dirt cheap. I was able to carry out activities without getting smudges or dings. I Even did a few dishes and my mani survived I would give this five stars but it does not peel off in one piece so it makes it just a tad bit more difficult than other peel off base coats but, for the price i am happy</li>
            <li> This works great for what it is described for. It also works great to use on the skin around the nails for easy clean up after painting. Just peels off after painting.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that it would replace the OPI version. The only problem is that this formula does not bond to the surface of the nail at all. Instead, it coats the nail so the polish slides right off as soon as there is any trauma to the nail, nail bed, or cuticle. The product also starts to peel when it&#x27;s exposed to water for a prolong period of time (spa, swimming pool, or beach water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a look that only needs to last a few hours then this is your product.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my in home nail salon. But I realized i can actually make this at home for a much cheaper price without the long wait. IF you are not looking to make it yourself, then i guess this would be for you</li>
            <li> I hated this polish. you have to wait like 10 minutes for it to dry before adding any other polish on top, because if you do and this is wet it&#x27;ll completely ruin your nail polish(it&#x27;ll clump up nasty). And for the price i expected something better.</li>
            <li> excellet.  Used to keep nail polish off the skin on the sides of the nails as well.</li>
            <li> it peels off, and it peels off!  If you are very careful and don&#x27;t let anything bump your nails, then you are fine and the polish works as expected, it peels of very easily;  However, if anything should bump your nails, even after the polish has been on for days, it will just peel right off in chunks or the whole nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet it is hard to get a formula that will resist peeling off inadvertently.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t peel as advertised</li>
            <li> Apply and let dry, then apply any glitter polish. Mine lasted 3+ says then peeled off with no damage to my nails. It&#x27;s the only way I&#x27;ll wear glitter!</li>
            <li> love this product, works really well on my nails just make sure not to bump your nails together while its drying because then they will stick to themselves</li>
            <li> I got this for the skin around my nails so that my manicures look clean but when I used this it made my skin look like I had super glue all over it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not realizing it was coming from South Korea but I&#x27;m glad I did! Now, I don&#x27;t dread wearing glitters. This base makes removing glitters a piece of cake!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do well at all. It pulled my skin off tho. So not to happy bout tht.</li>
            <li> Does not peel off. Also it comes in a different bottle than the picture. It took awhile to get to me.</li>
            <li> Maybe works a little TOO well. The first time I used this on my nails, everything peeled off about 3 hours later, so I was definitely a little disappointed! I was hoping it would last 3 days, not 3 hours.  This polish is very thick, so maybe I accidently put too much on. I would recommend applying a VERY thin layer, otherwise it might peel off on it&#x27;s own way sooner than you are expecting!</li>
