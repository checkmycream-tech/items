            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic customer service!</li>
            <li>However, most Vitamin E oils do not contain all eight forms and some have soy.</li>
            <li>helpful benefits from vitamin E oil are not as encouraging as most people think.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get myself into.</li>
            <li>This is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product I use it from top to bottom, I mix it with my lotion every night.</li>
            <li>I dripped it out of bottle and it worked OK.</li>
            <li>but I am giving it more days (weeks ?)</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not at all an oil, more like a gel.</li>
            <li>I would give that one 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>It helped considerably, much more than Eucerin, Lubriderm, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s wait more time to see results.</li>
            <li>Item as described shipping was safe</li>
            <li>Vitamin E oil has so many uses.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Perhaps a plastic bottle with a squeezed top.</li>
            <li>This is more like a vitamin e paste than an oil.</li>
            <li>It just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I suppose it works ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just put in an order for 2 more bottles (because I don&#x27;t want to EVER run out).</li>
            <li>If I could GET THE OIL OUT OF THE BOTTLE I&#x27;d be more inclined to give it more stars.</li>
            <li>*&#x27;s from the teensy bit I&#x27;ve been able to use,</li>
            <li>I am satisfied thank you</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will see results just like me :)</li>
            <li>I personally love this and give it a 5 star for the product</li>
            <li>Love itn</li>
            <li>Love the fact there are no fillers,</li>
            <li>I was solely relying on Vitamin C serum since it whitens my skins and produces more collagen.  </li>
            <li>Needs better bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this oil works better than the supplement, but it does help relieve the dryness overnight.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I wake up and wash my face and my face feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love my Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>For a week or more nights, I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge extended thirst relief after I&#x27;ve cleansed and used toner.</li>
            <li>It is sticky out of the bottle, but as it warms up on your skin, it becomes more liquidy and easier to spread.  </li>
            <li>I used a bit more in my lotions.</li>
            <li>Can be used in many DIY skincare.</li>
            <li>yea I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>This appears to give the most IUs for the dollar.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a liquid that resembled more like oil.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my facial masks!</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>Cococare &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I just started back using Vit E because I had scalp issues and it is WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li>I believe a different cap would be more beneficial to squirt drops of this wonderful product</li>
            <li>Best thing I could&#x27;ve ever brought for my face, my face would break out often and this was the only thing that cleared it up.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Item just as described and I love using it in my lotion bars.</li>
            <li>I make sure I&#x27;m not sweating or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am sure as the sensitivity lessens, I will use this product but until then.....</li>
            <li>Bring this overseas (Eastern Europe) often and always asked for more.</li>
            <li>most of them are a lot thinner</li>
            <li>so you can carry it in your purse when you go out or even a jacket pocket. :)</li>
            <li>and I think the synthetic form is in most beauty products since it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I look younger, skin is perfect shade</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>The fading hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but I will repurchase, based on how much more youthful my skin appears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I guess I need to purchase this oil in the 400 iu  in order to be able to apply it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find 100% Vitamin E oil anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Most others I&#x27;ve found contain lots of fillers.</li>
            <li>The more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; it is...</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go in to allll the many uses of vitamin E oil...</li>
            <li>and I have both read MANY ingredients labels in-store(s) and purchased dozens online...</li>
            <li>I mix it with a honey face lotion I use and works fantastic!</li>
            <li>&amp; I really love the shape &amp; size of the bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to use it and put it on many things.</li>
            <li>I believe it helps my nails grow as well. :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for making various home remedies and am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>Could ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It looks better.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a week, but it already has impressed me.  </li>
            <li>but i guess the product itself is okay.</li>
            <li>Pure Vitamin E Oil - can&#x27;t get any better than this!!</li>
            <li>Very very rich and lovely for all of your needs</li>
            <li>I found that I did overuse it because it was much easier than capsules, but that&#x27;s okay!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This comes in a great package-- glass bottle, and highly concentrated-</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and taking a stab at preventing some lovely marks!</li>
            <li>I also recycle and the bottle is really nice to use for some special gift</li>
            <li>I then put the concoction in the refrigerator to cool and solidify and then whip it with a mixer to get a nice whipped cream-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I have purchased two more bottles because of the great results so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to break the top.</li>
            <li>Tattoo healed up really quick and still looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily, but that&#x27;s OK-</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and even though comes in a glass bottle i love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I never usually leave reviews, but I&#x27;m soooo happy with this</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry hair season esp this freezing winter!</li>
            <li>I like the idea of using pure products on my body, and this one is good quality</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s probably not real vitamin E oil, but whatever is in it works great for me!</li>
            <li>I am comfortable ordering more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I have seen a difference yet because I have great genes and my skin is crystal clear</li>
            <li>my skin is soft and the scar is healing great.</li>
            <li>Shipping takes about 3 days and wrapping is safe &amp; secure, order with confidence.</li>
            <li>It is nice to purchase something that is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This was a very effective oil for treating and lightening old scars.</li>
            <li>and i have noticed very quickly all over improvements to my skin,</li>
            <li>Great deal for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I tend to mark up really easily</li>
            <li>It does not pour out easily.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a vitamin E oil that contains nothing but Tocopheryl Acetate, aka vitamin E.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to anybody who is looking for good Vit E oil.</li>
            <li>My first time trying Vit E oil on my granddaughter&#x27;s eczema and my own winter dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in homemade chapstick... seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I have also used this product on the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine</li>
            <li>The product works fine</li>
            <li>yep!~~~ Improvement for fine lines...</li>
            <li>My curly hair is fine and thinning.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and was just what I wanted Thank you!</li>
            <li>Quick arrival too!</li>
            <li>This is super!  </li>
            <li>Love product and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>far I am loving my new beauty and hair routine and this product has played a great role in that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>so it is definitely 100% pure vitamin e oil and i very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Packs a huge punch.</li>
            <li>We will see if this makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>my lips to soften them at night and smooth on my neck for all day moisture.  </li>
            <li>(3 Pack) which is available on Amazon also.  </li>
            <li>However, vitamin E help protect the skin from free radicals which can damage skin and accelerate aging.  </li>
            <li>Love looking in the mirror in the am after my face has absorbed it</li>
            <li>FABULOUS OIL.</li>
            <li>Delivered in 10 days, but was free.  </li>
            <li>It went fabulously with the body scrubs and lip balms I created.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is odor free and does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this product to put on a scar from a recent surgery and it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with fabulously glowing, hydrated skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>While there is still a light discoloration..</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and toned.</li>
            <li>Wish it was cheap to buy a lot of this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for straight vitamin E to use by itself or to make your own products with you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li>Strech marks got really light.</li>
            <li>I would be happy with the product but when i received my package not only had my product been opened, but someone done spilt it all over the box.</li>
            <li>Have not had a chance to use much of the oil yet, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I also read it&#x27;s good for treating wrinkles so even though Im 30, I started putting it next to my eyes to prevent wrinkles :)</li>
            <li>Great packaging and fast fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to be buying more when I need!!</li>
            <li>To me, this is a very strong pure vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>I love that this is 100% pure Vitamin E oil!  </li>
            <li>Use this wisely because if you use too much your hair will not feel pretty.</li>
            <li>so it would spread better and didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps, which is very unusual for me even when using moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine, and this seemed to be the most affordable source of pure vitamin E that I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>*Update to my original review.</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>I will say that the consistency of the oil is that of a gel, not very tough to get out of the bottle like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I made my own moisturizer using Shea butter, coconut oil and vitamin e oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because it was quick for my wife who just had a operation, and it was the purest synthesized version Amazon had available.  </li>
            <li>I made several natural cosmetics with it and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product works great for people with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li>Loved it, better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a pure lovely product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is magical pure oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure and I love it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this oil on any of my scars because each of those scars has a special memory attached to it</li>
            <li>a Normal oil is suppose to, and it being inside of a glass bottles doesn&#x27;t make it very easy for it to come out.</li>
            <li>Hard to get out of the bottle, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li>REAL vitamin E oil should be a light golden color and smooth like oil (hence the name!).</li>
            <li>But, I love it so much that I use it</li>
            <li>What I like about this Vitamin E Oil is that it helped me slowly reduce my scars over time and it works perfect on scabs or cuts</li>
            <li>Make sure you really want want just 1oz.</li>
            <li>It helped my skin come back good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can not say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li>The walmar blend stuff was ok, but this was the real thing and healed a scar on my face.  </li>
            <li>After those ingredients are melted and combined, I leave out to cool, but not solidify, and then add in 1 tsp of vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>your going to do blush and bronzer for a nice natural covered feeling</li>
            <li>I love it, worked really well for my homemade bug spray</li>
            <li>Vitamin E oil is so good for your skin overall.</li>
            <li>Thick and absolutely wonderful for the lips!!</li>
            <li>It will be good to have, I can use on several gifts.</li>
            <li>Good for hair mask with combination of castor oil or simple olive oil, egg whites and lemon squeeze.</li>
            <li>At least I am taking great care of my skin in the mean-time, can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE merchants that care so much about customer service after they&#x27;ve already taken your money...</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s about the only thing that is good about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and wonderful, in my salves.  </li>
            <li>I used it very generously and glad I did.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its great for hair strength,</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to be a great addition to the lip balm I used it in.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and is as described.  </li>
            <li>oh SO SMOOTH!Because of the super syrupy consistency</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it by itself, I tried and my skin was super oily</li>
            <li>The company shipped is quickly</li>
            <li>Shipped and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I applied a lighter weight oil (argon) to my skin and quickly followed with this vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, and I recommend this seller to others.</li>
            <li>so many uses and applications I love it, will definitely be reordering when it comes time!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>The item was just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I received this quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend dabbing it generously onto clean hands, rubbing palms together quickly to create warmth and then spreading it on your freshly cleansed skin/face/hands/nails (wherever you want it).</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am using it in my breast aug scars and am already seeing quick healing.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>it was SHIPPED quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>OK this is my first bottle of pure Vitamin E Oil but is so sticky it can&#x27;t be used on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky, does not spread easily.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to see when the oil is running out.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to control how much I need each time.</li>
            <li>ready to use vitamin e !!</li>
            <li>I truly love all natural products!</li>
            <li>DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li>Hard to spread but very good quality.</li>
            <li>I mixed the vitamin E oil with glycerin and the effects were AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The fact that my skin feels so much softer, even after removing the product, was a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li>it has a distinct smell I like too.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and the ingredient is the real deal, I use this on my natural hair to make sure its smooth and moisturized, will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li>This made for an intense moisturizing treatment that I&#x27;ve really been enjoying.</li>
            <li>Awesome, removed a spot under my eye that another cream made worse.  </li>
            <li>I am sure some people will not react but if you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I also wanted to switch to a more natural solution and tried coconut oil and shea butter, but these did not work.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL AROUND FAVORITE PRODUCTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li>Most natural I can find.  </li>
            <li>I figured applying the vitamin directly to my skin could work better.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own facial products.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips and skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>My beautician applied the coconut oil she uses at her salon and my skin absorbed all that she applied.  </li>
            <li>i started to use it on my brow and laugh lines too...</li>
            <li>I have no trouble getting it out as most people here claim.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>came as expected and was good quality</li>
            <li>different application would be nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really is the best Vitamin E Oil available since it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t diluted with other ingredients (soybean oil, safflower oil, etc.).</li>
            <li>it healed my scabs pretty quick</li>
            <li>I sometimes will warm the bottle in hot water in my sink which makes it pour out a little more rapidly.  </li>
            <li>Good to add to other stuff...</li>
            <li>but, other than that it works good.</li>
            <li>It is goopy, as described in other reviews, so don&#x27;t use your good pillowcases.  </li>
            <li>do it right before I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I even put it on blemishes, which it clears them right up.</li>
            <li>Using it on scars &amp; stretch marks &amp; by my eyes at night.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothies everything right out.</li>
            <li>and I feel as though my body is sucking it right up.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>and they also included a note on my invoice asking that if I had any problems or was dis-satisfied with my purchase in any way...to please inform them right away so that they could ensure my satisfaction with their service/product immediately.</li>
            <li>and I used it to make sunscreen, noticeable positive difference in my skin when I have used this!</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute and small I liked that</li>
            <li>For full disclosure, I applied this oil on top of an acne treatment location by AcneFree, mixed with a pea-sized amount of Amlactin</li>
            <li>one.~~~Fading of sun/age spots...still waiting for full results but looking VERY promising!~~~Fading scaring...</li>
            <li>I also use an exfoliator twice a week on my skin and at times I use shea butter on my skin, both of which are good for erasing dark marks.</li>
            <li>If you give it a few or couple minutes you&#x27;ll love the results because your blush and bronzer will go on smooth and to me much more vibrant and noticeably...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll lie down and work it into the skin on my face with a massaging motion; this is a good bed-time regimen.</li>
            <li>I only use a little bit of this in my lotions that I make and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL product purchased due to red bumps and used for 2 weeks straight and bumps are gone.</li>
            <li>Pure vitamin E is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
            <li>I warmed the vitamin E up as much as I could in my hands and worked quickly to spread the serum around, one section of the skin at a time.</li>
            <li>Nice thick oil.. seems to help with clarifying my skin.. love the thickness.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, guess would have to continue using it for some time before I can say for sure how much i like it.</li>
            <li>Best thick vitamin E oil out there!!</li>
            <li>Best Vitamin E Oil I have purchased thus far, absorbs quickly and no smell, so it mixes well with other oils and essential oils</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even put very much on it.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>This is very, very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I wish this came with a stopper to make precise drops instead of an open container, it would be much easier to measure as it is much thicker than most liquid oils.</li>
            <li>Helped my son&#x27;s scar under his lip heal very fast.</li>
            <li>Very Much.  </li>
            <li>It is thick stuff, so I put Pure Emu Oil on the area right after I put the Vitamin E Oil on the marks to make sure it spreads nicely.</li>
            <li>no other Vitamin E has been as good, it is pure and no other fillers.</li>
            <li>vitamin E oil which I have not used yet, would do well to have a larger opening at the top although other than that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li>Like other customers said Oil is very tick, which is good for me.  </li>
            <li>my nails are hard and have grown and have never looked this great.</li>
            <li>The Russian and Jewish ladies in my neighborhood swear by vitamin E on the face 2x/day and their skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>This is first time ever</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and i will definitely order  more of it.</li>
            <li>First time buying and using Vitamin E Oil.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter has had eczema since birth, we have tried many commercial lotions.</li>
            <li>Much better than having to use individual Vit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like a honey consistency and just as sticky.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>The recipe and instructions to make the lotion for those that are interested:</li>
            <li>I try to use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night though most days I only remember to put it on once.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no miracle worker, just be consistent</li>
            <li>Definitely needs a wider mouth top.</li>
            <li>I first ordered the 1/2 ounce to see how it worked.</li>
            <li>Exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>If I had written a review when first received the product, I would have given it a one star sine</li>
            <li>No broken bottle!</li>
            <li>Thought it would be more like an essential oil consistency.  </li>
            <li>In just under 2 weeks we&#x27;ve seen more improvement than the last year.</li>
            <li>I first used this oil in my lip balms.</li>
            <li>Exactly as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Sticky and thick (like honey), but makes a great inexpensive night cream.</li>
            <li>, I use it on my face as a moisturizer, I mix it with my regular moisturizer, it does so much more than make</li>
            <li>Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen results within 2 months with consistent use.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it on her hair mixed with almond oil and the results have been great...glossy sheen, much better than the mineral oil she was using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and works great in lotions, soaps, and facewash.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely made the skin on my hands softer and more</li>
            <li>/&gt;But overall, LOVE this.</li>
            <li>Exactly like opening a capsule, without the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Vitamin E isn&#x27;t yellow like most people think.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>It works ask well as when I bust open vit e capsules but is a better price.  </li>
            <li>I do agree that a squeeze bottle would be better, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the efficiency of the actual product.</li>
            <li>Go figure she willing to use oil but not Eucerin lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky like honey, but once it dries my face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Are ya ready for the loooong list of ingredients for this oil?!?</li>
            <li>the more of a yellow color it&#x27;s supposed to have.</li>
            <li>Gave it two stars because perhaps a super thick vitamin e paste could be good for something?</li>
            <li>It acts as great lubricant for dry sensitive skin and does a good job of lightening old scars without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Pure vitamin E is extremely light sensitive and should be stored in amber bottles.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because although I was kind of satisfied with the product inside,I was kind of disappointed at the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as nice to put on as other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>, I apply it before applying lipstick to smooth and protect my lips, and I apply it to clean dry lips and scars each evening before bed as a restorative treatment.  </li>
            <li>No problems with delivery, exactly as was described and it&#x27;s very high quality.</li>
            <li>yeah, safe to say, that one is gone long time ago.</li>
            <li>True E-Oil should have a yellowish tint and should not be clear.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what was pictured,  shipping was very timely.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E is a very important vitamin that your body needs every single day</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the stickiness of the oil, and it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle if you don&#x27;t cover the entire opening with your finger.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really know if with how much is in the chapstick will really help, but it can&#x27;t hurt!)</li>
            <li>I love it for dry spots or sore areas.</li>
            <li>it does absorb quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and last a while.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin-E Oil Ultra Pure 0.5oz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure Vitamin E, unlike what I bought from Walmart;s heath and beauty section.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin E oil in this product is 100% pure and rest assured this one is not synthetic.</li>
            <li>I mix this product with Aubrey 100 pure aloe Vera, it works wonders on my skin...</li>
            <li>I googled what pure forms of VITAMIN E oil there are and toco(forgot how to spell it) was one of the types.</li>
            <li>Bought this thinking it was PURE vitamin e oil</li>
            <li>Pure and quality product.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying 100% pure vitamin oil</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure and</li>
            <li>This is pure vitamin e oil, although it is a GMO, otherwise this would be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>Pure vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li>purely Vit E only!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is pure and seems to be of a very high quality ingredient.  </li>
            <li>the other reviews have pretty well covered most of them, but..............</li>
            <li>This Vitamin E Oil exceeded expectations, very high quality.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much anyways as this is PURE vitamin e</li>
            <li>having used E oils with fillers previously like Trader Joes, I find the minimal amount needed of this totally make up for the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this oil, great at reducing wrinkles and the appearance of scars.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find good quality vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick though and would&#x27;ve been better with another top - even a dropper.</li>
            <li>thought it might help a little, but happy and surprised when it completely cleared up eczema</li>
            <li>I think that maybe having it in a squeezy bottle or something might have worked better as it can be hard to pour a precise amount of it out of a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this...</li>
            <li>and he immediately started asking me to remind him to use it because of how much of an improvement he saw.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>sturdy pkg, item as described, fast shipment.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this for a hand cream being that it soaks in fast</li>
            <li>One must be patient to get the oil out of it&#x27;s container because it is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps anyone suffering from this as much as it has helped me.  </li>
            <li>This really works well to resolve that issue.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>never used vitamin e oil before so didnt really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast service.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this Vitamin E oil, ordering it as an add on to the free shipping make</li>
            <li>it is very sticky and I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very sticky</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my surgical scars and it really helps soften them.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m treating the some stubborn pimples and I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li>The oil seems to me to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li>Using Vitamin E in my lotions really helps heal my skin.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li>This is an essential product for me, as it is useful for so many different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isnt real 100% vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>Real 100% vitamin E oil is amber in color.</li>
            <li>This seems to be the real deal</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything to say about this except,</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>The bubble moves around quite fast.</li>
            <li>this is really sticky like syrup.</li>
            <li>Seller offered to send me the proper product and a free shipping label to return this oil; however i decided to keep it and try it out on my Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really use it alone...</li>
            <li>It works really well on stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I could really see the difference after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>Be forewarned that it is very gooey.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it really helps grow lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>VERY thick.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful quality.</li>
            <li>Oil meets expectations and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>just let a few drops in the palm of my had warm up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite thick, a good quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really thick, but is good.</li>
            <li>Thick and seems to be good for helping with scars</li>
            <li>This is good and thick.</li>
            <li>i think the nice thin layer of protection keeps it all from being absorbed into your skin leaving you with a more LONG LASTING and SMOOTH look :</li>
            <li>I also use a mascara wand to put it on my lashes and it makes my lashes look great, in fact I&#x27;ve started using it (very sparingly, a little goes a long way) as a replacement for my mascara and my lashes look longer and fuller already.</li>
            <li>I have sun spots that appear to be fading out and the overall look of my skin is vibrant and smooth.</li>
            <li>is it good for?&lt;br /&gt;Treats wrinkles and helps prevent, moisturizes dry skin, heals scars, lighten brown spots/sun spots, heals and prevents stretchmarks, and moisturizes and treats dry</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a very thick oil when first applied but doesn&#x27;t feel oily or cause breakouts (for me, and my skin is very finicky) and absorbs very nicely leaving skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Many others I looked at were other oils with a bit of vitamin E added.</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I would reorder this brand, some of the other vitamin e products are mostly filler and contain soybean oil.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to treat an acne scar above my cupid&#x27;s arrow and</li>
            <li>Other than that it has been ok</li>
            <li>Very thick, almost gel like.....seems pretty good and time will tell if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>is sticky but is normal, vitamin E is always sticky and is hard to find  in liquid,  good quality ...</li>
            <li>You can also mix this in with a organic raw shea butter and jojoba oil to make a nice skin lotion, sans perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this as my first &#x27;CLEAR&#x27; v.</li>
            <li>bottles pretty frequently</li>
            <li>thought this was going to perhaps have a better texture than regular Vit E oil but its just as thick and sticky, not my favorite</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the glass bottle, but I can live with it !</li>
            <li>Originally I bought it to help keep new from forming and it has definitely worked for me on that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil for this use and there is no better place to purchase it own line that I know of than OxKom / Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have newly diagnosed autoimmune disorders and the acne on my face all these years, is really ulcers (blisters) from sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I dilute it with grapeseed oil and it spreads better that way and found less outbreaks.</li>
            <li>The immediate effects were softer skin with more moisture, and less need for moisturizer during the day</li>
            <li>smaller than i expected but nice product that i look forward to using</li>
            <li>This product is decent.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in so many products such daily skin care and homemade hair products.</li>
            <li>I always look for natural products, and ordered this after internet research and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps clear your skin!</li>
            <li>Good for growing ur weak edges and strengthens hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This oil is a highly concentrated source of Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>this is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality vitamin oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone taking off acrylics or just in need to strengthen their nails.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it is 100% pure Vitamin E, no other oils.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin, this treatment has significantly reduced my acne occurrences if not entirely.  </li>
            <li>I now get little sores on the top of my head if I even expose it for a bit to the sun.  </li>
            <li>This is very thick and goes a long way, I personally use this at night because you should put on Vitamin E if your going in the sun, But I mainly use this for my Nails, works wonderful they grow fast and cleaner for it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of hard to dispense since it&#x27;s glass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which is a natural vitamin E oil and has a very high concentration of vitamin oil per ounce.  </li>
            <li>My package had a tracking number, arrived early, was VERY well wrapped &amp; protected for transit</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second one, which is rare for me because I tend to jump from product to product.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick...</li>
            <li>If you want to use this as an extremely limited/targeted spot treatment it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality of Vitamin E, but the container it comes in is glass, and vitamin E liquid is thick, it took sometime to remove all the liquid from that glass container, other then that I love the product.</li>
            <li>It is a little tacky for a few minutes, but then it is great to feel your moisture skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend this product now after the new discovery.</li>
            <li>My new &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; moisturizer recipe calls for Almond Oil, Aloe Vera Gel, beeswax and Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>I got this to use on relatively new stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are fading and so are fine lines.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, my husband developed guttate psoriasis after an illness and despite trips to the dermatologist and them saying it would clear up quickly with various prescription and OTC creams.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those looking for a natural way to remove scars.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was only trying to calm down my skin after the vitamin c irritation,  but now it becomes my routine skin care.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night only because it&#x27;s thick but it;s great for dry skin although it takes a while to really sink in.</li>
            <li>as expected the bottle came cracked from top and whole envelope was wet with oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to say I am a fan of this so far!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever found any where the only listed ingredient was vitamin E oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried various natural options (okay, tons of them) with minimal improvement.</li>
            <li>My feet are soft, even my heals!</li>
            <li>and it has even made the old ones fade!</li>
            <li>Mix it with my natural products and homemade lotions!</li>
            <li>When it was delivered to my house along with my other orders I was so excited until I opened it.</li>
            <li>but my mother/babysitter would not use Eucerin because, as she puts it, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s an adult lotion&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>also love that it can be mixed with other natural products.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this product for some of my scars that are relatively new as was recommended.</li>
            <li>, I have some black spots which appeared after my Baby&#x27;s birth, I love my new skin, got my confidence back...</li>
            <li>and I mix this into my daily face moisturizer, night facial cream, and body lotion to help get a full body even skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different prescription creams and while some of them did work, they&#x27;d leave my skin dark and discolored after healing.</li>
            <li>The lips were chapped and the corner cracked from dry mouth of unknown origin, other than the catch-all, &amp;#34;age.&amp;#34; The product has a high viscosity, which is good.</li>
            <li>One thing I will say about this product is to be aware that it is SUPER concentrated and SUPER thick!!</li>
            <li>and this means one that does not say Vitamin E acetate unless you cannot get the pure vitamin E oil quickly enough.</li>
            <li>I both this product online because I was looking for a pure vitamin E oil not realising that this was synthetic as it only had Tocopherol Acetate on the bottle and nothing to indicate that it was dl -alpha and not d - alpha.</li>
            <li>The only ingredient is Vitamin E, pure and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil because it is actually pure vitamin E oil, that&#x27;s the only ingredient, no fillers.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is very thick and hard to spread, but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, very thick.</li>
            <li>only product that helps with my dry skin during winter, it also help keep my beard clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>it says clearly 1OZ.  </li>
            <li>I am now using a different vitamin E oil that is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised with how well this works.</li>
            <li>If you use too much of this oil you make have sporadic bumps appear especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li>but so far it has helped to reduce the appearance of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I also switched facial cleansers  to the Johnson&#x27;s purpose gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>and this has seemed to workout for me so far.  </li>
            <li>have completely faded and are gone.</li>
            <li>It APPEARS to be just a great product from the teensy bit I can manage to get out, but WHY such a TINY opening for such a THICK liquid?</li>
            <li>A bigger opening would have solved the whole issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started dabbing on the vitamin E oil directly to the areas of my face that had the eczema outbreak at night before bed.</li>
            <li>I add it to my natural beauty products with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>However, after 6 months of Vitamin C serum, I have developed skin irritation and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Up to this point we&#x27;ve been applying it directly to skin, no dilution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sent two messages to Amazon asking for a replacement but have heard nothing so far.</li>
            <li>so it was not a waste</li>
            <li>It is a natural preservative, but does not inhibit self degradation.</li>
            <li>I use it for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added it to hand creams, applied it to nails directly, my sons chapped face and even my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>I apply a dab directly to underneath my eyes or mix a spot of it in with my night cream and put it all over my face.</li>
            <li>I have been putting it on old acne scars and after 2 weeks I can see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Far easier than poking Vit E Oil capsules with a pin.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use than breaking Vit E capsules open!!  </li>
            <li>I use topical acne medications which are VERY drying</li>
            <li>and this is keeping me from completely peeling and looking like a reptile.</li>
            <li>I plan to mix it with whatever I concoct for my hair since i cut a lot of dead ends off recently and what to grow out my hair as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was worth it to order on-line for the same price S &amp; H included and it was bigger.  </li>
            <li>This is kind of a pain, as I would prefer to mix it in with a lotion to thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li>This is slowly but surely helping some of my scars fade.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, very sensitive skin and while this feels at first like you are putting honey on your face</li>
            <li>Available at same price in other stores as well, if you do not want to wait for shipping.</li>
            <li>and I put this oil on after applying the creams (and letting it dry first)</li>
            <li>I had a very dark scar and within about 2-3weeks it had faded significantly.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way with this, so one little bottle should last you a good while!</li>
            <li>I add to my homemade products and a little goes a long way :-)</li>
            <li>In the future, I&#x27;d like to see a darkened bottle only because I feel as if a dark bottle preserves contents better.</li>
            <li>I have really dry, bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and legs, and using a sugar scrub with olive oil and tea tree oil already helped, but the vitamin e gives it that extra kick and makes my skin that much softer and smoother for much longer.</li>
            <li>great wish they made this 3 times the size i would have no complaints besides it being so small and thick.</li>
            <li>It is a glass bottle with a small opening and regular screw top</li>
            <li>The pro is it has a light scent and its small</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, and as expected.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you its not what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky but soaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me and my spouse&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>the oil is a bit thick, I have been using it at night time on my face and have been waking with a smooth soft face.</li>
            <li>Really for the price you could get a larger amount with a different brand.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product at a local drugstore in the smaller, .5 oz size and nearly paid as much ($6.99) as Amazon charges for the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>oil is thick and I&#x27;m interested in trying out the Trader Joe&#x27;s 100% pure vitamin oil after I finish with this bottle to compare how the texture is like for the Trader Joe&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>Before adding to my other oils, I tested a patch on some dark marks on my face two days in a row and it has already faded them and I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction!</li>
            <li>Product seems to be of good quality, small bottle but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about this product being very sticky and hard to apply so at first</li>
            <li>I have really bad acne scar on my chest and this GREATLY reduced the appearance of it.</li>
            <li>I generally use gel capsules but this made life easier.</li>
            <li>Also, medical pages I looked at described the oil as extremely thick and heavy and this oil matches the descriptions found on a few different websites perfectly.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep purchasing, hoping to fade old scars infinitely</li>
            <li>Have only been using for a week so far</li>
            <li>This stuff really is straight to the point, not much I can say about it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and gets rashes on her face from contact with food and subsequently being wiped off.</li>
            <li>The bottle was covered with sticky vitamin e oil and was not completely closed.</li>
            <li>my skin soft, tiny scars are disappearing, skin is clearer, healthier, wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>Mine are only about 3 years old though</li>
            <li>I found it too thick to smooth onto my face.</li>
            <li>Most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle.</li>
            <li>The oil is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is more of a blob of sticky substance, not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li>I put a little dab of your Vitamin E oil on them and they heal right away.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and my face was super soft and plump after using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated, but it will last very long, I can already tell.</li>
            <li>This product is pure vitamin E, no fillers like some other products.</li>
            <li>Try turning the bottle upside down before use, when you open the cap the oil is right there.</li>
            <li>This lotion soaks right into my skin in a few minutes without leaving my skin feeling greasy and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>Thick and rich.  </li>
            <li>Thick, rich creamy.</li>
            <li>Bit thick and sticky making it difficult to apply, I mix with a touch of baby oil which helps to apply more easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky and thick and it does spread on your face very well like</li>
            <li>the texture and thickness definitely bothers me, but no other complains.</li>
            <li>I wear this product everyday on my face and on a big scar on my arm, which is diminishing slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>and i also feel like i&#x27;ve been seen WAY less tiny little blackheads on my skin which I&#x27;d been seeing much more the last couple of months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scar was hard and peeling - he recommended that I put a Q-tip full of this on her neck couple times a week</li>
            <li>Beauty is supposed to be painful anyway, right? :)</li>
            <li>product is fine, super sticky, impossible to spread.  </li>
            <li>, my laugh lines are starting to look less defined, and the smaller stretchmarks lines I have are fading, but the bigger ones are still there.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter, all scars or dark spots have healed or faded, and my complexion is much improved.</li>
            <li>6 months later you can barely see where the incisions were.  </li>
            <li>There is still two acne marks that are slightly bigger that have, they have lightened up a bit but are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>so I use barely any for my daily spritzer.</li>
            <li>Same with putting this on my starting wrinkles, I just put a little on my ring fingers and pat it under my eyes very very gently because the sticky consistency tends to stick well and pull the skin up.</li>
            <li>I am waiting at the hospital clinic right now due to a severe allergic reaction on my face and I am not very pleased as I have used the natural version before</li>
            <li>It works well to clear up dry skin patches.</li>
            <li>and I found this to be easy to use and less messy then having to deal with breaking open capsules etc.</li>
            <li>My entire face is cleared up and barely a mark has been left to be seen.  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased to add a few drops to my face cleansing oil, but now I plan to use it as much as as I can!</li>
            <li>It is super thick.</li>
            <li>Its Super thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>Goopy and super thick.</li>
            <li>but it is so thick that you should not finish it quickly.</li>
            <li>Super thick and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>even used it my self after a facial where I sat the entire vitamin E bottle in hot water during my facial and use a little on my face after I was done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging was a little much.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet because im a little concerned as to whether or not this product is the real deal.</li>

            <li> Fantastic customer service!</li>
            <li> However, most Vitamin E oils do not contain all eight forms and some have soy.</li>
            <li> helpful benefits from vitamin E oil are not as encouraging as most people think.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get myself into.</li>
            <li> This is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this product I use it from top to bottom, I mix it with my lotion every night.</li>
            <li> I dripped it out of bottle and it worked OK.</li>
            <li> but I am giving it more days (weeks ?)</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not at all an oil, more like a gel.</li>
            <li> I would give that one 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> It helped considerably, much more than Eucerin, Lubriderm, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s wait more time to see results.</li>
            <li> Item as described shipping was safe</li>
            <li> Vitamin E oil has so many uses.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Perhaps a plastic bottle with a squeezed top.</li>
            <li> This is more like a vitamin e paste than an oil.</li>
            <li> It just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I suppose it works ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just put in an order for 2 more bottles (because I don&#x27;t want to EVER run out).</li>
            <li> If I could GET THE OIL OUT OF THE BOTTLE I&#x27;d be more inclined to give it more stars.</li>
            <li> *&#x27;s from the teensy bit I&#x27;ve been able to use,</li>
            <li> I am satisfied thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will see results just like me :)</li>
            <li> I personally love this and give it a 5 star for the product</li>
            <li> Love itn</li>
            <li> Love the fact there are no fillers,</li>
            <li> I was solely relying on Vitamin C serum since it whitens my skins and produces more collagen.  </li>
            <li> Needs better bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this oil works better than the supplement, but it does help relieve the dryness overnight.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I wake up and wash my face and my face feels nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love my Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> For a week or more nights, I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge extended thirst relief after I&#x27;ve cleansed and used toner.</li>
            <li> It is sticky out of the bottle, but as it warms up on your skin, it becomes more liquidy and easier to spread.  </li>
            <li> I used a bit more in my lotions.</li>
            <li> Can be used in many DIY skincare.</li>
            <li> yea I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> This appears to give the most IUs for the dollar.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a liquid that resembled more like oil.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my facial masks!</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> Cococare &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I just started back using Vit E because I had scalp issues and it is WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li> I believe a different cap would be more beneficial to squirt drops of this wonderful product</li>
            <li> Best thing I could&#x27;ve ever brought for my face, my face would break out often and this was the only thing that cleared it up.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Item just as described and I love using it in my lotion bars.</li>
            <li> I make sure I&#x27;m not sweating or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am sure as the sensitivity lessens, I will use this product but until then.....</li>
            <li> Bring this overseas (Eastern Europe) often and always asked for more.</li>
            <li> most of them are a lot thinner</li>
            <li> so you can carry it in your purse when you go out or even a jacket pocket. :)</li>
            <li> and I think the synthetic form is in most beauty products since it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I look younger, skin is perfect shade</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> The fading hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but I will repurchase, based on how much more youthful my skin appears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I guess I need to purchase this oil in the 400 iu  in order to be able to apply it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find 100% Vitamin E oil anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Most others I&#x27;ve found contain lots of fillers.</li>
            <li> The more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; it is...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go in to allll the many uses of vitamin E oil...</li>
            <li> and I have both read MANY ingredients labels in-store(s) and purchased dozens online...</li>
            <li> I mix it with a honey face lotion I use and works fantastic!</li>
            <li> &amp; I really love the shape &amp; size of the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to use it and put it on many things.</li>
            <li> I believe it helps my nails grow as well. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for making various home remedies and am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I love.</li>
            <li> Could ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It looks better.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week, but it already has impressed me.  </li>
            <li> but i guess the product itself is okay.</li>
            <li> Pure Vitamin E Oil - can&#x27;t get any better than this!!</li>
            <li> Very very rich and lovely for all of your needs</li>
            <li> I found that I did overuse it because it was much easier than capsules, but that&#x27;s okay!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This comes in a great package-- glass bottle, and highly concentrated-</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and taking a stab at preventing some lovely marks!</li>
            <li> I also recycle and the bottle is really nice to use for some special gift</li>
            <li> I then put the concoction in the refrigerator to cool and solidify and then whip it with a mixer to get a nice whipped cream-like consistency.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I have purchased two more bottles because of the great results so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to break the top.</li>
            <li> Tattoo healed up really quick and still looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily, but that&#x27;s OK-</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and even though comes in a glass bottle i love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I never usually leave reviews, but I&#x27;m soooo happy with this</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry hair season esp this freezing winter!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using pure products on my body, and this one is good quality</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s probably not real vitamin E oil, but whatever is in it works great for me!</li>
            <li> I am comfortable ordering more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I have seen a difference yet because I have great genes and my skin is crystal clear</li>
            <li> my skin is soft and the scar is healing great.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes about 3 days and wrapping is safe &amp; secure, order with confidence.</li>
            <li> It is nice to purchase something that is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was a very effective oil for treating and lightening old scars.</li>
            <li> and i have noticed very quickly all over improvements to my skin,</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I tend to mark up really easily</li>
            <li> It does not pour out easily.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a vitamin E oil that contains nothing but Tocopheryl Acetate, aka vitamin E.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend to anybody who is looking for good Vit E oil.</li>
            <li> My first time trying Vit E oil on my granddaughter&#x27;s eczema and my own winter dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in homemade chapstick... seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> I have also used this product on the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine.</li>
            <li> and it works fine</li>
            <li> The product works fine</li>
            <li> yep!~~~ Improvement for fine lines...</li>
            <li> My curly hair is fine and thinning.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was just what I wanted Thank you!</li>
            <li> Quick arrival too!</li>
            <li> This is super!  </li>

            <li> so it is definitely 100% pure vitamin e oil and i very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Packs a huge punch.</li>
            <li> We will see if this makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> my lips to soften them at night and smooth on my neck for all day moisture.  </li>
            <li> (3 Pack) which is available on Amazon also.  </li>
            <li> However, vitamin E help protect the skin from free radicals which can damage skin and accelerate aging.  </li>
            <li> Love looking in the mirror in the am after my face has absorbed it</li>
            <li> FABULOUS OIL.</li>
            <li> Delivered in 10 days, but was free.  </li>
            <li> It went fabulously with the body scrubs and lip balms I created.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is odor free and does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this product to put on a scar from a recent surgery and it seems to be working great.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with fabulously glowing, hydrated skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> While there is still a light discoloration..</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and toned.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheap to buy a lot of this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for straight vitamin E to use by itself or to make your own products with you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Strech marks got really light.</li>
            <li> I would be happy with the product but when i received my package not only had my product been opened, but someone done spilt it all over the box.</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use much of the oil yet, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I also read it&#x27;s good for treating wrinkles so even though Im 30, I started putting it next to my eyes to prevent wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> Great packaging and fast fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to be buying more when I need!!</li>
            <li> To me, this is a very strong pure vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I love that this is 100% pure Vitamin E oil!  </li>
            <li> Use this wisely because if you use too much your hair will not feel pretty.</li>
            <li> so it would spread better and didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps, which is very unusual for me even when using moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine, and this seemed to be the most affordable source of pure vitamin E that I could find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> *Update to my original review.</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> I will say that the consistency of the oil is that of a gel, not very tough to get out of the bottle like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I made my own moisturizer using Shea butter, coconut oil and vitamin e oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because it was quick for my wife who just had a operation, and it was the purest synthesized version Amazon had available.  </li>
            <li> I made several natural cosmetics with it and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product works great for people with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> Loved it, better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pure lovely product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is magical pure oil.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure and I love it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this oil on any of my scars because each of those scars has a special memory attached to it</li>
            <li> a Normal oil is suppose to, and it being inside of a glass bottles doesn&#x27;t make it very easy for it to come out.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the bottle, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> REAL vitamin E oil should be a light golden color and smooth like oil (hence the name!).</li>
            <li> But, I love it so much that I use it</li>
            <li> What I like about this Vitamin E Oil is that it helped me slowly reduce my scars over time and it works perfect on scabs or cuts</li>
            <li> Make sure you really want want just 1oz.</li>
            <li> It helped my skin come back good as new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can not say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li> The walmar blend stuff was ok, but this was the real thing and healed a scar on my face.  </li>
            <li> After those ingredients are melted and combined, I leave out to cool, but not solidify, and then add in 1 tsp of vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> your going to do blush and bronzer for a nice natural covered feeling</li>
            <li> I love it, worked really well for my homemade bug spray</li>
            <li> Vitamin E oil is so good for your skin overall.</li>
            <li> Thick and absolutely wonderful for the lips!!</li>
            <li> It will be good to have, I can use on several gifts.</li>
            <li> Good for hair mask with combination of castor oil or simple olive oil, egg whites and lemon squeeze.</li>
            <li> At least I am taking great care of my skin in the mean-time, can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE merchants that care so much about customer service after they&#x27;ve already taken your money...</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s about the only thing that is good about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and wonderful, in my salves.  </li>
            <li> I used it very generously and glad I did.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its great for hair strength,</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to be a great addition to the lip balm I used it in.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is as described.  </li>
            <li> oh SO SMOOTH!Because of the super syrupy consistency</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it by itself, I tried and my skin was super oily</li>
            <li> The company shipped is quickly</li>
            <li> Shipped and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> After the shower, I applied a lighter weight oil (argon) to my skin and quickly followed with this vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, and I recommend this seller to others.</li>
            <li> so many uses and applications I love it, will definitely be reordering when it comes time!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly</li>
            <li> The item was just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I received this quickly in the mail.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend dabbing it generously onto clean hands, rubbing palms together quickly to create warmth and then spreading it on your freshly cleansed skin/face/hands/nails (wherever you want it).</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am using it in my breast aug scars and am already seeing quick healing.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> it was SHIPPED quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> OK this is my first bottle of pure Vitamin E Oil but is so sticky it can&#x27;t be used on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Very sticky, does not spread easily.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to see when the oil is running out.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to control how much I need each time.</li>
            <li> ready to use vitamin e !!</li>
            <li> I truly love all natural products!</li>
            <li> DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li> Hard to spread but very good quality.</li>
            <li> I mixed the vitamin E oil with glycerin and the effects were AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The fact that my skin feels so much softer, even after removing the product, was a huge selling point for me.</li>
            <li> it has a distinct smell I like too.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and the ingredient is the real deal, I use this on my natural hair to make sure its smooth and moisturized, will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> This made for an intense moisturizing treatment that I&#x27;ve really been enjoying.</li>
            <li> Awesome, removed a spot under my eye that another cream made worse.  </li>
            <li> I am sure some people will not react but if you have sensitive skin beware.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to switch to a more natural solution and tried coconut oil and shea butter, but these did not work.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL AROUND FAVORITE PRODUCTS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Most natural I can find.  </li>
            <li> I figured applying the vitamin directly to my skin could work better.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own facial products.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips and skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> My beautician applied the coconut oil she uses at her salon and my skin absorbed all that she applied.  </li>
            <li> i started to use it on my brow and laugh lines too...</li>
            <li> I have no trouble getting it out as most people here claim.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> came as expected and was good quality</li>
            <li> different application would be nice.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This really is the best Vitamin E Oil available since it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t diluted with other ingredients (soybean oil, safflower oil, etc.).</li>
            <li> it healed my scabs pretty quick</li>
            <li> I sometimes will warm the bottle in hot water in my sink which makes it pour out a little more rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Good to add to other stuff...</li>
            <li> but, other than that it works good.</li>
            <li> It is goopy, as described in other reviews, so don&#x27;t use your good pillowcases.  </li>
            <li> do it right before I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I even put it on blemishes, which it clears them right up.</li>
            <li> Using it on scars &amp; stretch marks &amp; by my eyes at night.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothies everything right out.</li>
            <li> and I feel as though my body is sucking it right up.</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> and they also included a note on my invoice asking that if I had any problems or was dis-satisfied with my purchase in any way...to please inform them right away so that they could ensure my satisfaction with their service/product immediately.</li>
            <li> and I used it to make sunscreen, noticeable positive difference in my skin when I have used this!</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute and small I liked that</li>
            <li> For full disclosure, I applied this oil on top of an acne treatment location by AcneFree, mixed with a pea-sized amount of Amlactin</li>
            <li> one.~~~Fading of sun/age spots...still waiting for full results but looking VERY promising!~~~Fading scaring...</li>
            <li> I also use an exfoliator twice a week on my skin and at times I use shea butter on my skin, both of which are good for erasing dark marks.</li>
            <li> If you give it a few or couple minutes you&#x27;ll love the results because your blush and bronzer will go on smooth and to me much more vibrant and noticeably...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll lie down and work it into the skin on my face with a massaging motion; this is a good bed-time regimen.</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit of this in my lotions that I make and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL product purchased due to red bumps and used for 2 weeks straight and bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin E is where it&#x27;s at!</li>
            <li> I warmed the vitamin E up as much as I could in my hands and worked quickly to spread the serum around, one section of the skin at a time.</li>
            <li> Nice thick oil.. seems to help with clarifying my skin.. love the thickness.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, guess would have to continue using it for some time before I can say for sure how much i like it.</li>
            <li> Best thick vitamin E oil out there!!</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin E Oil I have purchased thus far, absorbs quickly and no smell, so it mixes well with other oils and essential oils</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even put very much on it.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> This is very, very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I wish this came with a stopper to make precise drops instead of an open container, it would be much easier to measure as it is much thicker than most liquid oils.</li>
            <li> Helped my son&#x27;s scar under his lip heal very fast.</li>
            <li> Very Much.  </li>
            <li> It is thick stuff, so I put Pure Emu Oil on the area right after I put the Vitamin E Oil on the marks to make sure it spreads nicely.</li>
            <li> no other Vitamin E has been as good, it is pure and no other fillers.</li>
            <li> vitamin E oil which I have not used yet, would do well to have a larger opening at the top although other than that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Like other customers said Oil is very tick, which is good for me.  </li>
            <li> my nails are hard and have grown and have never looked this great.</li>
            <li> The Russian and Jewish ladies in my neighborhood swear by vitamin E on the face 2x/day and their skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> This is first time ever</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and i will definitely order  more of it.</li>
            <li> First time buying and using Vitamin E Oil.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter has had eczema since birth, we have tried many commercial lotions.</li>
            <li> Much better than having to use individual Vit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like a honey consistency and just as sticky.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> The recipe and instructions to make the lotion for those that are interested:</li>
            <li> I try to use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night though most days I only remember to put it on once.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no miracle worker, just be consistent</li>
            <li> Definitely needs a wider mouth top.</li>
            <li> I first ordered the 1/2 ounce to see how it worked.</li>
            <li> Exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> If I had written a review when first received the product, I would have given it a one star sine</li>
            <li> No broken bottle!</li>
            <li> Thought it would be more like an essential oil consistency.  </li>
            <li> In just under 2 weeks we&#x27;ve seen more improvement than the last year.</li>
            <li> I first used this oil in my lip balms.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Sticky and thick (like honey), but makes a great inexpensive night cream.</li>
            <li> , I use it on my face as a moisturizer, I mix it with my regular moisturizer, it does so much more than make</li>
            <li> Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen results within 2 months with consistent use.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it on her hair mixed with almond oil and the results have been great...glossy sheen, much better than the mineral oil she was using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and works great in lotions, soaps, and facewash.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely made the skin on my hands softer and more</li>
            <li> /&gt;But overall, LOVE this.</li>
            <li> Exactly like opening a capsule, without the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Vitamin E isn&#x27;t yellow like most people think.</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky when I first apply it.</li>
            <li> It works ask well as when I bust open vit e capsules but is a better price.  </li>
            <li> I do agree that a squeeze bottle would be better, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the efficiency of the actual product.</li>
            <li> Go figure she willing to use oil but not Eucerin lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky like honey, but once it dries my face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Are ya ready for the loooong list of ingredients for this oil?!?</li>
            <li> the more of a yellow color it&#x27;s supposed to have.</li>
            <li> Gave it two stars because perhaps a super thick vitamin e paste could be good for something?</li>
            <li> It acts as great lubricant for dry sensitive skin and does a good job of lightening old scars without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin E is extremely light sensitive and should be stored in amber bottles.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because although I was kind of satisfied with the product inside,I was kind of disappointed at the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nice to put on as other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> , I apply it before applying lipstick to smooth and protect my lips, and I apply it to clean dry lips and scars each evening before bed as a restorative treatment.  </li>
            <li> No problems with delivery, exactly as was described and it&#x27;s very high quality.</li>
            <li> yeah, safe to say, that one is gone long time ago.</li>
            <li> True E-Oil should have a yellowish tint and should not be clear.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was pictured,  shipping was very timely.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E is a very important vitamin that your body needs every single day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the stickiness of the oil, and it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle if you don&#x27;t cover the entire opening with your finger.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really know if with how much is in the chapstick will really help, but it can&#x27;t hurt!)</li>
            <li> I love it for dry spots or sore areas.</li>
            <li> it does absorb quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and last a while.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin-E Oil Ultra Pure 0.5oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure Vitamin E, unlike what I bought from Walmart;s heath and beauty section.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin E oil in this product is 100% pure and rest assured this one is not synthetic.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with Aubrey 100 pure aloe Vera, it works wonders on my skin...</li>
            <li> I googled what pure forms of VITAMIN E oil there are and toco(forgot how to spell it) was one of the types.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it was PURE vitamin e oil</li>
            <li> Pure and quality product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying 100% pure vitamin oil</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pure and</li>
            <li> This is pure vitamin e oil, although it is a GMO, otherwise this would be a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li> purely Vit E only!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is pure and seems to be of a very high quality ingredient.  </li>
            <li> the other reviews have pretty well covered most of them, but..............</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Oil exceeded expectations, very high quality.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much anyways as this is PURE vitamin e</li>
            <li> having used E oils with fillers previously like Trader Joes, I find the minimal amount needed of this totally make up for the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this oil, great at reducing wrinkles and the appearance of scars.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find good quality vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick though and would&#x27;ve been better with another top - even a dropper.</li>
            <li> thought it might help a little, but happy and surprised when it completely cleared up eczema</li>
            <li> I think that maybe having it in a squeezy bottle or something might have worked better as it can be hard to pour a precise amount of it out of a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this...</li>
            <li> and he immediately started asking me to remind him to use it because of how much of an improvement he saw.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> sturdy pkg, item as described, fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY think oil.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is a has a very GLOSSY SHINE.</li>
            <li> It really speeds up any healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this for a hand cream being that it soaks in fast</li>
            <li> One must be patient to get the oil out of it&#x27;s container because it is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps anyone suffering from this as much as it has helped me.  </li>
            <li> This really works well to resolve that issue.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> never used vitamin e oil before so didnt really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast service.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this Vitamin E oil, ordering it as an add on to the free shipping make</li>
            <li> it is very sticky and I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very sticky</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my surgical scars and it really helps soften them.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m treating the some stubborn pimples and I&#x27;m really liking the results.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to me to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences in my skin after using it.  </li>
            <li> Using Vitamin E in my lotions really helps heal my skin.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li> This is an essential product for me, as it is useful for so many different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isnt real 100% vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> Real 100% vitamin E oil is amber in color.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the real deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to say about this except,</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> The bubble moves around quite fast.</li>
            <li> this is really sticky like syrup.</li>
            <li> Seller offered to send me the proper product and a free shipping label to return this oil; however i decided to keep it and try it out on my Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really use it alone...</li>
            <li> It works really well on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I could really see the difference after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> Be forewarned that it is very gooey.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it really helps grow lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> VERY thick.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful quality.</li>
            <li> Oil meets expectations and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> just let a few drops in the palm of my had warm up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thick, a good quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, but is good.</li>
            <li> Thick and seems to be good for helping with scars</li>
            <li> This is good and thick.</li>
            <li> i think the nice thin layer of protection keeps it all from being absorbed into your skin leaving you with a more LONG LASTING and SMOOTH look :</li>
            <li> I also use a mascara wand to put it on my lashes and it makes my lashes look great, in fact I&#x27;ve started using it (very sparingly, a little goes a long way) as a replacement for my mascara and my lashes look longer and fuller already.</li>
            <li> I have sun spots that appear to be fading out and the overall look of my skin is vibrant and smooth.</li>
            <li> is it good for?&lt;br /&gt;Treats wrinkles and helps prevent, moisturizes dry skin, heals scars, lighten brown spots/sun spots, heals and prevents stretchmarks, and moisturizes and treats dry</li>
            <li> All in all, it is a very thick oil when first applied but doesn&#x27;t feel oily or cause breakouts (for me, and my skin is very finicky) and absorbs very nicely leaving skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Many others I looked at were other oils with a bit of vitamin E added.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I would reorder this brand, some of the other vitamin e products are mostly filler and contain soybean oil.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to treat an acne scar above my cupid&#x27;s arrow and</li>
            <li> Other than that it has been ok</li>
            <li> Very thick, almost gel like.....seems pretty good and time will tell if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> is sticky but is normal, vitamin E is always sticky and is hard to find  in liquid,  good quality ...</li>
            <li> You can also mix this in with a organic raw shea butter and jojoba oil to make a nice skin lotion, sans perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my first &#x27;CLEAR&#x27; v.</li>
            <li> bottles pretty frequently</li>
            <li> thought this was going to perhaps have a better texture than regular Vit E oil but its just as thick and sticky, not my favorite</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the glass bottle, but I can live with it !</li>
            <li> Originally I bought it to help keep new from forming and it has definitely worked for me on that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil for this use and there is no better place to purchase it own line that I know of than OxKom / Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have newly diagnosed autoimmune disorders and the acne on my face all these years, is really ulcers (blisters) from sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I dilute it with grapeseed oil and it spreads better that way and found less outbreaks.</li>
            <li> The immediate effects were softer skin with more moisture, and less need for moisturizer during the day</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected but nice product that i look forward to using</li>
            <li> This product is decent.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in so many products such daily skin care and homemade hair products.</li>
            <li> I always look for natural products, and ordered this after internet research and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really helps clear your skin!</li>
            <li> Good for growing ur weak edges and strengthens hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil is a highly concentrated source of Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality vitamin oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone taking off acrylics or just in need to strengthen their nails.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it is 100% pure Vitamin E, no other oils.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin, this treatment has significantly reduced my acne occurrences if not entirely.  </li>
            <li> I now get little sores on the top of my head if I even expose it for a bit to the sun.  </li>
            <li> This is very thick and goes a long way, I personally use this at night because you should put on Vitamin E if your going in the sun, But I mainly use this for my Nails, works wonderful they grow fast and cleaner for it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of hard to dispense since it&#x27;s glass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which is a natural vitamin E oil and has a very high concentration of vitamin oil per ounce.  </li>
            <li> My package had a tracking number, arrived early, was VERY well wrapped &amp; protected for transit</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second one, which is rare for me because I tend to jump from product to product.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick...</li>
            <li> If you want to use this as an extremely limited/targeted spot treatment it will be fine.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality of Vitamin E, but the container it comes in is glass, and vitamin E liquid is thick, it took sometime to remove all the liquid from that glass container, other then that I love the product.</li>
            <li> It is a little tacky for a few minutes, but then it is great to feel your moisture skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend this product now after the new discovery.</li>
            <li> My new &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; moisturizer recipe calls for Almond Oil, Aloe Vera Gel, beeswax and Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on relatively new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are fading and so are fine lines.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, my husband developed guttate psoriasis after an illness and despite trips to the dermatologist and them saying it would clear up quickly with various prescription and OTC creams.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those looking for a natural way to remove scars.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was only trying to calm down my skin after the vitamin c irritation,  but now it becomes my routine skin care.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night only because it&#x27;s thick but it;s great for dry skin although it takes a while to really sink in.</li>
            <li> as expected the bottle came cracked from top and whole envelope was wet with oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a fan of this so far!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever found any where the only listed ingredient was vitamin E oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried various natural options (okay, tons of them) with minimal improvement.</li>
            <li> My feet are soft, even my heals!</li>
            <li> and it has even made the old ones fade!</li>
            <li> Mix it with my natural products and homemade lotions!</li>
            <li> When it was delivered to my house along with my other orders I was so excited until I opened it.</li>
            <li> but my mother/babysitter would not use Eucerin because, as she puts it, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s an adult lotion&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> also love that it can be mixed with other natural products.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product for some of my scars that are relatively new as was recommended.</li>
            <li> , I have some black spots which appeared after my Baby&#x27;s birth, I love my new skin, got my confidence back...</li>
            <li> and I mix this into my daily face moisturizer, night facial cream, and body lotion to help get a full body even skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different prescription creams and while some of them did work, they&#x27;d leave my skin dark and discolored after healing.</li>
            <li> The lips were chapped and the corner cracked from dry mouth of unknown origin, other than the catch-all, &amp;#34;age.&amp;#34; The product has a high viscosity, which is good.</li>
            <li> One thing I will say about this product is to be aware that it is SUPER concentrated and SUPER thick!!</li>
            <li> and this means one that does not say Vitamin E acetate unless you cannot get the pure vitamin E oil quickly enough.</li>
            <li> I both this product online because I was looking for a pure vitamin E oil not realising that this was synthetic as it only had Tocopherol Acetate on the bottle and nothing to indicate that it was dl -alpha and not d - alpha.</li>
            <li> The only ingredient is Vitamin E, pure and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because it is actually pure vitamin E oil, that&#x27;s the only ingredient, no fillers.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick and hard to spread, but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, very thick.</li>
            <li> only product that helps with my dry skin during winter, it also help keep my beard clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> it says clearly 1OZ.  </li>
            <li> I am now using a different vitamin E oil that is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised with how well this works.</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this oil you make have sporadic bumps appear especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li> but so far it has helped to reduce the appearance of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I also switched facial cleansers  to the Johnson&#x27;s purpose gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> and this has seemed to workout for me so far.  </li>
            <li> have completely faded and are gone.</li>
            <li> It APPEARS to be just a great product from the teensy bit I can manage to get out, but WHY such a TINY opening for such a THICK liquid?</li>
            <li> A bigger opening would have solved the whole issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started dabbing on the vitamin E oil directly to the areas of my face that had the eczema outbreak at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I add it to my natural beauty products with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> However, after 6 months of Vitamin C serum, I have developed skin irritation and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Up to this point we&#x27;ve been applying it directly to skin, no dilution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sent two messages to Amazon asking for a replacement but have heard nothing so far.</li>
            <li> so it was not a waste</li>
            <li> It is a natural preservative, but does not inhibit self degradation.</li>
            <li> I use it for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added it to hand creams, applied it to nails directly, my sons chapped face and even my chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> I apply a dab directly to underneath my eyes or mix a spot of it in with my night cream and put it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have been putting it on old acne scars and after 2 weeks I can see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Far easier than poking Vit E Oil capsules with a pin.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use than breaking Vit E capsules open!!  </li>
            <li> I use topical acne medications which are VERY drying</li>
            <li> and this is keeping me from completely peeling and looking like a reptile.</li>
            <li> I plan to mix it with whatever I concoct for my hair since i cut a lot of dead ends off recently and what to grow out my hair as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was worth it to order on-line for the same price S &amp; H included and it was bigger.  </li>
            <li> This is kind of a pain, as I would prefer to mix it in with a lotion to thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li> This is slowly but surely helping some of my scars fade.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin and while this feels at first like you are putting honey on your face</li>
            <li> Available at same price in other stores as well, if you do not want to wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> and I put this oil on after applying the creams (and letting it dry first)</li>
            <li> I had a very dark scar and within about 2-3weeks it had faded significantly.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this, so one little bottle should last you a good while!</li>
            <li> I add to my homemade products and a little goes a long way :-)</li>
            <li> In the future, I&#x27;d like to see a darkened bottle only because I feel as if a dark bottle preserves contents better.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and legs, and using a sugar scrub with olive oil and tea tree oil already helped, but the vitamin e gives it that extra kick and makes my skin that much softer and smoother for much longer.</li>
            <li> great wish they made this 3 times the size i would have no complaints besides it being so small and thick.</li>
            <li> It is a glass bottle with a small opening and regular screw top</li>
            <li> The pro is it has a light scent and its small</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, and as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky but soaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It works very well for me and my spouse&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> the oil is a bit thick, I have been using it at night time on my face and have been waking with a smooth soft face.</li>
            <li> Really for the price you could get a larger amount with a different brand.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product at a local drugstore in the smaller, .5 oz size and nearly paid as much ($6.99) as Amazon charges for the 1 oz.</li>
            <li> oil is thick and I&#x27;m interested in trying out the Trader Joe&#x27;s 100% pure vitamin oil after I finish with this bottle to compare how the texture is like for the Trader Joe&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> Before adding to my other oils, I tested a patch on some dark marks on my face two days in a row and it has already faded them and I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction!</li>
            <li> Product seems to be of good quality, small bottle but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product being very sticky and hard to apply so at first</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scar on my chest and this GREATLY reduced the appearance of it.</li>
            <li> I generally use gel capsules but this made life easier.</li>
            <li> Also, medical pages I looked at described the oil as extremely thick and heavy and this oil matches the descriptions found on a few different websites perfectly.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep purchasing, hoping to fade old scars infinitely</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a week so far</li>
            <li> This stuff really is straight to the point, not much I can say about it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and gets rashes on her face from contact with food and subsequently being wiped off.</li>
            <li> The bottle was covered with sticky vitamin e oil and was not completely closed.</li>
            <li> my skin soft, tiny scars are disappearing, skin is clearer, healthier, wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li> Mine are only about 3 years old though</li>
            <li> I found it too thick to smooth onto my face.</li>
            <li> Most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is more of a blob of sticky substance, not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I put a little dab of your Vitamin E oil on them and they heal right away.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and my face was super soft and plump after using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated, but it will last very long, I can already tell.</li>
            <li> This product is pure vitamin E, no fillers like some other products.</li>
            <li> Try turning the bottle upside down before use, when you open the cap the oil is right there.</li>
            <li> This lotion soaks right into my skin in a few minutes without leaving my skin feeling greasy and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich.  </li>
            <li> Thick, rich creamy.</li>
            <li> Bit thick and sticky making it difficult to apply, I mix with a touch of baby oil which helps to apply more easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sticky and thick and it does spread on your face very well like</li>
            <li> the texture and thickness definitely bothers me, but no other complains.</li>
            <li> I wear this product everyday on my face and on a big scar on my arm, which is diminishing slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> and i also feel like i&#x27;ve been seen WAY less tiny little blackheads on my skin which I&#x27;d been seeing much more the last couple of months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scar was hard and peeling - he recommended that I put a Q-tip full of this on her neck couple times a week</li>
            <li> Beauty is supposed to be painful anyway, right? :)</li>
            <li> product is fine, super sticky, impossible to spread.  </li>
            <li> , my laugh lines are starting to look less defined, and the smaller stretchmarks lines I have are fading, but the bigger ones are still there.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, all scars or dark spots have healed or faded, and my complexion is much improved.</li>
            <li> 6 months later you can barely see where the incisions were.  </li>
            <li> There is still two acne marks that are slightly bigger that have, they have lightened up a bit but are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> so I use barely any for my daily spritzer.</li>
            <li> Same with putting this on my starting wrinkles, I just put a little on my ring fingers and pat it under my eyes very very gently because the sticky consistency tends to stick well and pull the skin up.</li>
            <li> I am waiting at the hospital clinic right now due to a severe allergic reaction on my face and I am not very pleased as I have used the natural version before</li>
            <li> It works well to clear up dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> and I found this to be easy to use and less messy then having to deal with breaking open capsules etc.</li>
            <li> My entire face is cleared up and barely a mark has been left to be seen.  </li>
            <li> I initially purchased to add a few drops to my face cleansing oil, but now I plan to use it as much as as I can!</li>
            <li> It is super thick.</li>
            <li> Its Super thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> Goopy and super thick.</li>
            <li> but it is so thick that you should not finish it quickly.</li>
            <li> Super thick and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> even used it my self after a facial where I sat the entire vitamin E bottle in hot water during my facial and use a little on my face after I was done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging was a little much.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet because im a little concerned as to whether or not this product is the real deal.</li>
            <li> it really does help and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Because it does go a long way, this tiny bottle got added to my daily skin regimen, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> I had a pimple forming, dabbed this bad boy and by the next day it completely shrunk! :-)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely erase the scars, but it does make them less obvious.</li>
            <li> it was well worth the money, not watery, thick and works for dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> It does not seam to help me much with my skin issues (very dry skin) but does help make my skin feel a little softer</li>
            <li> Received order timely and started using it immediately to help clear up dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this on scars and dark spots for a couple of weeks and have noticed a considerable change in the color and texture of the skin I have applied it to.</li>
            <li> My minor sunspots lightened within a week of using this and the really tiny ones I had are all gone now.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time and a product you want in your medicine cabinet, probably.  </li>
            <li> It will last for a long time at my rate.</li>
            <li> last a long time/</li>
            <li> Though I am not fond of the glass bottle because of the small opening, it actually does pour out at a decent rate.</li>
            <li> Eczema - I get the occasional outbreak of eczema/extremely dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a noticeable fading happening and a few of them have already almost disappeared completely and it&#x27;s only been 2 months since the surgery.</li>
            <li> I can finger dab this on once a day for a few days and their little noses are right as rain.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it is to find pure vitamin e oil</li>
            <li> It has made such difference to my dry skin that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go without it!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased vitamin E oil, so I&#x27;m not sure if it comes in a glass bottle with other brands also.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick, and that (I&#x27;m assuming) is because it is Pure Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and gooey, hard to come off.</li>
            <li> The oil is too hard to get out of the bottle and is very viscous.</li>
            <li> The oil has completely evened out my skin tone from head to toe (I had off-colored knees and elbows, but they weren’t very dark.</li>
            <li> This is not natural vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate)</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, if you use it for this purpose.</li>
            <li> The redness and the outbreaks had completely disappeared after a few days of using this oil.</li>
            <li> so I am not completely surprised.</li>
            <li> 1 Ounce of Vitamin E goes a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as solid as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Very tacky and thick.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E oil is very sticky, thick, and has no scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, so don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement and less irritation in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about two months and my blemishes have cleared and my scalp doesn&#x27;t dry out all day long.</li>
            <li> I also mix a few drops of this oil with pure Argan Oil and use it as an everyday lip balm and nighttime lip treatment.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit so the small bottle is all that is necessary</li>
            <li> Mixed well with other carrier oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not mixed with lots of other oils.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish it had a different cap on it  - or a bottle that you could just squeeze a little out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a patch of dry skin on my leg that looks like a rash.</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also used it on some dry skin I had on my knees (hazards of obstacle course racing).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with severely dry skin before this winter.</li>
            <li> I started putting this Vit E oil on her dry patches with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> and I was taking a vitamin E supplement to combat the dry skin, but</li>
            <li> I put it on during the day instead of chapstick when my lips are feeling dry</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even rub it in because my skin there is so dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands</li>
            <li> I put it up and forgot about it until I ran across it looking for something to cure my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single one , so I can&#x27;t testify to that</li>
            <li> It has no scent and will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so far, not sure if it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Finally this is a vitamin E oil that is not diluted in a carrier oil like soybean or olive oil, which just ruins the purpose of vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small and careful not to tilt too much or everything comes pouring out regardless of how sticky it is...</li>
            <li> Its as described, actually, not knowing or using vitamin E in its raw form before, its a lot thicker than regular oil.</li>
            <li> i have noticed that the oil is very slow to drain from the bottle and suspect that when i am down to the end much oil will be left in bottle which will be such a waste - maybe different style container?</li>
            <li> Pure vitamin e oil, but very hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find pure vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As for wrinkles it has smoothed my small ones that were starting underneath my eyes (started seeing results bout the 3rd week)</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for a while, and I definitely reccomend it to anyone dealing with slight to severe acne scarring.</li>
            <li> What I have used itmost for is my homemade lotion concoction that I use both on my face and body both in the morning and at night as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people of all ages with dry skin especially if you have been through a rough winter like we have!!!</li>
            <li> I use this version to fade my acne scars that have become flat but dark on my skin and</li>
            <li> It is very thick, which is the  way pure vitamin E is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very, very thick and tacky in pure form.</li>
            <li> Only need a little anyway.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little at a time.</li>
            <li> However, the little bit that I did manage to pour out mixed well with my shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of scars from a surgery last year that I am trying to fade, and I have to mix this stuff up for it to even spread out a little</li>
            <li> but the product is very very thick and is very sticky.  </li>
            <li> for a finishing touch, I massage some of the Cococare 100% Vitamin E oil in the affected areas and other dry skin.</li>
            <li> I tried several products to grow/harden my nails with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails being the only one that came close to making that happen.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have the T-zone and breakout monthly, so I have to be careful with products and use a non-oily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues pouring it from the bottle, but there is no real way to measure the amount poured out that way.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my deep conditioners for my hair c:</li>
            <li> after a few days of actually using this product I couldn&#x27;t help but to not be so bothered by it being sticky</li>
            <li> They inadequately padded the envelope that they sent it in...and it came to me crushed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this everyday on my scars for the last month.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use one of my daughters extra medicine syringes to get it out instead of waiting forever to get a few drops.</li>
            <li> Since this is pasty and oily, you have to be careful not to touch anyone or anything.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful with the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Arrive on time, as expected.</li>
            <li> I received it in the time frame expected.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Now armed with my \\&quot;Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil, I am not afraid of the approaching winter season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My last order of three bottles of cococare vitamin e oil was so poorly packaged that one bottle got broken on transit and messed up the package.</li>
            <li> I received the oil sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I got what I expected</li>
            <li> Not really what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Item is just as expected.</li>
            <li> It is really thick, so I try to only apply it at night, but I have only been using it for a week now and can see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is all natural because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worked with vitamin E before, and I was surprised at how thick it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within one week, each facial line was noticeably less pronounced!</li>
            <li> For any scars that I’m treating, I put it directly on the spot (just a little on each spot… this product is thick and just a little goes a long way) and pat it several times till I know the oil is evenly spread on the area.</li>
            <li> This small bottle of Vitamin E Oil will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> You only need small amounts so it has lasted me a very long time already</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not absolutely certain that this isn&#x27;t a synthetic vitamin E oil, based on the color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and hard to get out of the little jar opening though.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased pure vitamin e oil in the past and it has never been this sticky and thick.  </li>
            <li> Other than the texture thing, the formula worked well and as expected (moisturized, evened skin tone/texture, increased luminosity and skin felt a bit firmer).</li>
            <li> The nourishing vitamin E oil healed my dry, chapped lips in a day and it seems to be helping my scar from a previous burn.  </li>
            <li> I cleanse my face with Ghanaian black soap, so I like how the oil keeps my skin from feeling too dry and stripped.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping which is a plus however the bottle is small and i like the fact that it&#x27;s thick instead of being runny</li>
            <li> Because of that, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this oil goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Use a little to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Only a few uses and my less severe stretch marks are already fading.</li>
            <li> was not able to use it as nothing was left in bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This other one is Fruit Of The Earth</li>
            <li> Used it with other ingredients in a dog paw salve.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottle like other reviews.  </li>
            <li> was experiencing extreme Dryness and peeling</li>
            <li> I guess they didn&#x27;t want all the other mail getting soiled.  </li>
            <li> use small amounts around my eyes, lips, and nails several times a week,</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend all day waiting for it like some of the other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now ordering the 1 ounce, so you can see it works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> You will only need a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> I combine it with other oils or lotions each time I moisturize.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottle came in plastic bag along with the other things I ordered in the box.</li>
            <li> Now, I apply Vitamin E Oil as soon as they start to heal and it leaves absolutely NO mark!</li>
            <li> only gripes are the small size and the packaging.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about the product and was about to remove it from my shopping cart</li>
            <li> This product tackles dryness with a vengence without a cloying fragrance or other ingredients to dilute it ..</li>
            <li> Thicker than other brands of vitamin E oil</li>
            <li> This Vit E oil was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I use it twice day day and only need a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> It does say 100% vitamin E, tocopheryl acetate and not the dl-alpha (synthetic) as other say.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil to mix with other oils to make a hair, scalp, and body oil.</li>
            <li> I basically set the bottle into another container upside down at an angle and it literally took overnight in order to empty into a container I could use.</li>
            <li> My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, so it helps moisturize her scalp and advances hair growth, in combination with a few other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so it&#x27;s not easy to apply it pure on skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday, helps alleviate dry skin on face, elbows and heels.  </li>
            <li> Cococare&#x27;s bottle seem small, but a little goes a long way and it takes a long time to use up the bottle of oil.  </li>
            <li> The only con is how sticky it feels on the hands I usually have to wipe my hands down with a towel</li>
            <li> I usually purchase vitamin E oil from CVS, but this stuff is a lot less sticky and the opening is smaller than on the CVS bottle</li>
            <li> My face is usually red and I mixed this with a little tea tree oil and BOOM no more redness!!</li>
            <li> This Cococare oil is CLEAR, yet VERY thick and sticky-tacky (as it&#x27;s also supposed to be in it&#x27;s purest form) and the ingredients list states</li>
            <li> only thing is that the oil is so hard to come out of the bottle. ..</li>
            <li> My only complain is that since the bottle is glass it&#x27;s hard to get the oil out</li>
            <li> I usually apply it with a q-tip (or mascara wand) or just simply pour a little out into my palm.</li>
            <li> Very Thick, will last a long Time.</li>
            <li> However...this oil works danged well at helping to heal recent wounds rather quickly and hardly any scaring left behind at all!!!  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, but difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be draining this into a bottle with a wider neck or at least a dropper or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (shaving in winter is NOT fun...)</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it took me so long to try using this vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t had any real impact on fading the scars unfortunately</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s helped the dark skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Since it did not break me out [like the dark colored v.</li>
            <li> When I got the product I was shocked at how small it was, but I should have paid more attention</li>
            <li> Keep it dark.</li>
            <li> night, I applied it to dark spots on my face, as well as my deepening nasolabial folds, the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> skin is smoother and my dark spots (from acne) are disappearing.</li>
            <li> (I never use this product on my entire face as it is thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a secret remedy to get rid of my old stretchmarks and this product helps them fade like nothing else.</li>
            <li> (feels like a glob since its so thick) on the back of my hand and use a foundation brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only Vitamin E Oil I have found that is this thick....</li>
            <li> it was thick and sticky almost like the Generic Brand of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Serum that I bought from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store except</li>
            <li> Its a little slow coming out of the bottle but its done wonders for the dry skin on my face, especially since the winter has been so harsh.</li>
            <li> I have made a few batches and I am not even down to half a bottle because a little bit goes a really long way.  </li>
            <li> And redness goes down A LOT.</li>
            <li> I also use it on the stretch marks on my thighs and hips and hope it will break down the scar tissue like people say.</li>
            <li> if you turn the bottle upside down, it may take a couple of minutes for 2-3 drops to flow out.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just turn it upside down.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didnt like was a little hard to get out but solved that with a eye dropper</li>
            <li> the bottle is small but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and in the nighttime I dab less than a pea-size amount all over my face.</li>
            <li> I typical</li>
            <li> Holy Cow!</li>
            <li> Not permanently gone but lighten and less visible.</li>
            <li> It is a VERY SMALL Container - I wish they sold a little larger of a bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny little bottle but the oil is so thick that it lasts about a month if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The product is tasteless, neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is only synthetic and bad for your skin, it will do the opposite and actually age your skin!</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works for everyone else, but for me I have to be careful as my face breaks out with it.</li>
            <li> it was a mess</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help with fading a few dark marks.</li>
            <li> Was not quite as thick as was expected from other reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as tight and as irritated anymore</li>
            <li> Any who, yes, it is extremely thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am shocked it heals so quickly.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the small package size.</li>
            <li> I wash my face at night, apply toner, vitamin c serum, after it is dry, I apply s thick layer of vitamin e oil.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the bottles are small.</li>
            <li> Really thick and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I rubbed a little in each incision each night before bed.</li>
            <li> So a little goes</li>
            <li> I either use a Q-tip, or pour a little of the oil onto my finger.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs noses when they get a little chapped or cracked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also taken to mixing a little bit in with lotion on my hands at night</li>
            <li> It is a thicker consistency (and a little sticky), but rubs in well and lasts on the skin.</li>
            <li> I mix a little of this with argan oil and use on my face, neck, hands, and hair.</li>
            <li> but, if you do use this product use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I apply a little bit all over my face before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> The little glass bottle that this comes in also reminds me of old-world perfume bottles--</li>
            <li> Its very thick and hard to get every single last drop out.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips and it is a lot easier than cutting open tiny pills.</li>
            <li> a few minutes my body temp.</li>
            <li> So if you plan on using it everyday I would recommend buying 2.</li>
            <li> I hope it does as well in the harsh winter when my hands are severely chapped and cracked.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I started get eczema on my face.</li>
            <li> As recommended by my doctor, I started using hydrocortisone cream, but every time I stopped using the cream, the eczema would come back and sometimes worse.</li>
            <li> Using just alittle bit twice per day and I have seen results in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I have wasted a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d come across a few posts and articles talking Vitamin E Oil and decided, why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for now, I&#x27;ll buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> What I received was a messy package dripping with oil.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday ine the morning and at night for 2-3weeks.</li>
            <li> I work with the purest form of vitamin E in a research lab everyday.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or messy when I pour the oil out.</li>
            <li> I got the order as expected although, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so thick.  </li>
            <li> I would usually have dark circles under my eyes because of that.</li>
            <li> i am eighty and have a few skin problems that i hope will improve with use.  </li>
            <li> but it soaks into skin and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> I massage my incision everyday.</li>
            <li> Lastly, as others have mentioned the opening is very small and a dropper would not fit inside although I think this oil would be too thick for a dropper anyhow.</li>
            <li> It is very thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i did have to use a baby&#x27;s medicine syringe to get the oil out of the vitamin E bottle because it is extremely too thick.</li>
            <li> I mix a little foundation with my usual amount of lotion and add about one drop</li>
            <li> I put some after a blemish pops, chapped lips, dry skin or even over my nose when I have a cold just to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
            <li> I had them already pretty bad on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Little hard to get out but not a huge issue.</li>
            <li> It flows slowly so that the the amount is controllable with little waste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the opening of the bottle is too small (the bottle itself is very small, which was to be expected with a 1 ounce package) to use the transfer pipettes I currently have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick but has no scent and</li>
            <li> It is a little thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure  what it could be used for</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is restoring my skin tone</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my mom so not sure how it is working for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the packaging.</li>
            <li> not sure it is sanitary</li>
            <li> This product is really thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure if it&#x27;s working tho..</li>
            <li> I usually mix it in my lotion and my hair moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But as for size, I was not expecting it to be that small.</li>
            <li> but I want to see a difference in the minute small lines I see in my face.</li>
            <li> NOT order capsules and waste time opening those!  </li>
            <li> That is not cheap!</li>
            <li> Quite viscous, you&#x27;ve got to nurse it out of the small vial it comes in.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I can wear it under my makeup.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> it is really a small bottle.</li>
            <li> The cap is small</li>
            <li> and I stick like a small plastic stick to get some out to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> but so thick I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> very thick but after awhile it seems to be less sticky</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much smaller and less painful today.</li>
            <li> Hard to take out from the glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results since it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spread</li>
            <li> It is hard to rub on the surgery area.  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply to skin even after warming it between my fingers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard to get of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Due to its sticky consistency it’s very hard to get it out of the opening the bottle has and very hard to spread on areas where you plan on putting it on.</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick and sticky, and the neck of this bottle is too narrow to pour the oil out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really really thick and hard to get out</li>
            <li> Really thick and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> However,  it blends well with my shea butter mix and we haven&#x27;t seen any bad reactions from it so far...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with the way the oil is dispensed.  </li>
            <li> i like oils in the purest, least diluted forms*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed some people complained that they could not get it out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was so thick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil was definitely thick like a lot of the reviews say.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know vitamin E supposed to be so thick.</li>
            <li> Comes on a thick glass jar as well.</li>
            <li> This is a thick oil</li>
            <li> It is so thick and sticky and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs.</li>
            <li> When I try to use it I have to sit and wait for it to slowly ooze out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that thick.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and makes skin supple.</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of glass and solution is thick.</li>
            <li> Also REALLY thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, so it stays where it needs to.</li>
            <li> Thick but moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li> I think it would thin out with heat, but I don&#x27;t want to destroy the vitamin, so</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also fairly thick</li>
            <li> But thick glass incase u drop it.</li>
            <li> Also, this stuff is thick..</li>
            <li> it is thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick oil... will not &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; well (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting).</li>
            <li> Extremely thick and sticky and doesn&#x27;t mix well with a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Thick oil that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> the texture is really thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, as everyone has already said, this oil is THICK (think honey in the wintertime).</li>
            <li> It comes out thick and slow, so once you get to the bottom of the jar, you have to tip it for a while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SO thick</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is to thick.  </li>
            <li> It is so thick and sticky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s veerrrrrryyyyyyyy thick though which might not work for some people but didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I mix it with another oil to not make it so thick.</li>
            <li> Thick consistency</li>
            <li> I mean, it is THICK.</li>
            <li> Not very attractive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a few drops 2x per day on the marks for about 2 weeks and they&#x27;ve already gotten noticeably lighter in color!!</li>
            <li> There is a relatively small amount of oil in the bottle but it is VERY thick, to the point of being almost sticky, when you use it undiluted.  </li>
            <li> I add it to my lotion after shaving, and dab VERY small amount to my face after washing it and it makes my skin</li>
            <li> I use this on my eyelashes and it makes them grow crazy long.</li>
            <li> very small bottle.</li>
            <li> I was just developing from prolonged dry air and cold of this winter.</li>
            <li> It gave my face a subtle &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that people comment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> It is very thick which makes it hard to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is how hard it is to get it out of the glass container.</li>
            <li> ** hard to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get out!</li>
            <li> In the past when I&#x27;ve had pimples, after healing, they would leave an ugly dark mark that wouldn&#x27;t go away for months.</li>
            <li> Very thick but surprisingly not greasy oil.  </li>
            <li> Packaging really sucks!</li>
            <li> Small bottle opening makes it difficult to access with a dropper.</li>

            <li> Very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, though, and comes out of the bottle very slowly.</li>
            <li> Consumers should know it&#x27;s VERY thick and concentrated,</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> Very very thick.....</li>

            <li> Just be advised that this is very thick.</li>

            <li> It is VERY THICK.</li>
            <li> This is very thick in form but it works well.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit thick &amp; difficult to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li> Glass bottle arrived broken...</li>
            <li> My rashes immediately stop itching and being irritating.</li>
            <li> No filler or unnecessary oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused.  </li>
            <li> but the oil wasn&#x27;t thin like baby oil</li>
            <li> that I get when I furrow my brows, and the forehead lines that continue to get worse with time.</li>
            <li> and I am not really happy with it...  </li>
            <li> Due to his OCD his hands are really bad.</li>
            <li> Used this in connection with alpha hydrox lotion and though stretch marks seriously run in my family, I didn&#x27;t get any on my stomach during pregnancy!  </li>
            <li> There was no seal on the bottle when I received it, which makes me very uncomfortable using it and even when I did put a small dab in my palm</li>
            <li> Being winter, my package was out in the cold, so this oil was extremely thick and the glass bottle prevented me from getting any oil out until it had warmed up.</li>
            <li> this was very thick very gluey</li>
            <li> The worst part was how it shattered in my hand and cut me pretty badly.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin E oil is thick and almost impossible to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shows how careless the person was who sent a glass bottle in paper envelope without any protection maybe he/</li>
            <li> she was drunk.</li>
            <li> Difficult to dispense.</li>
            <li> Before this, I used to tear open vitamin E capsules to run on a terrible after-wax skin burn on my face and it helped fade it within 2 months.</li>
            <li> like I have make-up on, even though I had some horrible night&#x27;s sleep several days in a row</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re now cutting it with coconut oil and have continued to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and it stinks.</li>
            <li> The stuff is very thick!!</li>
            <li> This was very difficult to get the vitamin E oil out because it was so sticky.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this on an area I badly scarred :-/&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it though.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll I had a bad breakout and based on the reviews, I purchased this product.  </li>

            <li> Very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I hate hats.</li>

            <li> The burns looked terrible and were painful.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it came in the mail.  </li>
            <li> is the worst winter I remember from living in Michigan for 25 years.</li>
            <li> This is a very annoying product to attempt to use.</li>
            <li> Please do your research and do not buy this nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> Esp for this incoming brutal and ash inducing winter !</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t fault the product for my horrible skin issues as almost nothing has works.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. I also recycle and the bottle is really nice to use for some special gift</li>
            <li> this was very thick very gluey I&#x27;m not sure  what it could be used for</li>
            <li> I really like this...it has a distinct smell I like too. I&#x27;ve been applying this on an area I badly scarred :-/&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a patch of dry skin on my leg that looks like a rash. Not very attractive and I&#x27;ve been applying this to it to make it go away. It has restored a lot of moisture and seems to help with the breaking. I have to say I am a fan of this so far! The bottle is very small and careful not to tilt too much or everything comes pouring out regardless of how sticky it is...</li>
            <li> This is the only item I have found that is 100% vitamin e oil. All others have added carrier oils, like soybean oil or others. I have purchased this item multiple times now and am hooked! Thank you for providing such an awesome product that is free of added oils!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my scalp to help grow my edges back. After 2 months, I have definitely seen an improvement with a peach fuzz where there was no hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard it is to find pure vitamin e oil but this is it! Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Used this in connection with alpha hydrox lotion and though stretch marks seriously run in my family, I didn&#x27;t get any on my stomach during pregnancy!  I had them already pretty bad on my legs.  There is no explanation for why I wouldn&#x27;t get marks.  I have to give credit to this oil.  LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I should have done my research on the ingredients before buying. This is not natural vitamin E (tocopheryl acetate) and it is a supplement that is considered toxic to the skin and potentially cancerous. Beware putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was so thick.I have to use a qtip to remove oil from bottle.</li>
            <li> Can you use it in conjunction with mens body wash while showering?</li>
            <li> I make homemade lotion and use this as an additive in my lotions. It works very well for me and my spouse&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is first time ever i found that a seller can send glass bottle in paper envelope without any box or wrapping around the glass bottle with liquid in it.&lt;br /&gt;And as expected the bottle came cracked from top and whole envelope was wet with oil.&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to use it as nothing was left in bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shows how careless the person was who sent a glass bottle in paper envelope without any protection maybe he/she was drunk.</li>
            <li> I mixed the vitamin E oil with glycerin and the effects were AMAZING. My skin glowed like I had never seen before.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and is as described.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I add this to my night cream and i have noticed very quickly all over improvements to my skin, and this is the only addition to my skincare. My skin is brighter, all scars or dark spots have healed or faded, and my complexion is much improved. I also suggested to my husband that he try it and he immediately started asking me to remind him to use it because of how much of an improvement he saw. Love this vitamin E oil!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in making lip balm and lotion bars. It worked just fine, and this seemed to be the most affordable source of pure vitamin E that I could find on Amazon. Many others I looked at were other oils with a bit of vitamin E added.</li>
            <li> My three-year-old son had irritated skin underneath his nose from all the wiping. It looked as though he had a red mustache. My wife put on the Vitamin E Oil last night and the irritation is gone today. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Its very thick and hard to get every single last drop out.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and was just what I wanted Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own lip balm and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> One thing I will say about this product is to be aware that it is SUPER concentrated and SUPER thick!! Because of that, a little goes a long way. I add it to my lotion after shaving, and dab VERY small amount to my face after washing it and it makes my skin oh SO SMOOTH!Because of the super syrupy consistency, I recommend putting it into a container that&#x27;s big enough to use a q-tip. That&#x27;s what I did. I basically set the bottle into another container upside down at an angle and it literally took overnight in order to empty into a container I could use. Well worth it. The vitamin E is perfect for all areas of skin. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it by itself, I tried and my skin was super oily and I didn&#x27;t even put very much on it. But to each their own. Because it does go a long way, this tiny bottle got added to my daily skin regimen, lotions, etc. Great product!! The company shipped is quickly and I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> prompt delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lip balm. It is super thick.</li>
            <li> Very thick but that&#x27;s why I like it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love that this is 100% pure Vitamin E oil!  Fast shipment.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I bought it to mix with Camelia oil and Primrose oil for skin care.  But, I love it so much that I use it&lt;br /&gt;on my lips to soften them at night and smooth on my neck for all day moisture.  It&#x27;s really a pure lovely product.  No chemicals…yay!!</li>
            <li> Depending what you&#x27;re looking for, this is not oil-like but paste-like, sticky and syrupy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I read the reviews before buying so I knew it was thick.&lt;br /&gt;I just let a few drops in the palm of my had warm up.  Then I spot it around my eyes, chin, cheeks, forehead.&lt;br /&gt;In a few minutes my body temp. makes it&#x27;s easier to spread.  It is a little tacky for a few minutes, but then it is great to feel your moisture skin.&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for homemade cosmetics. Hard to get out of the bottle, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I found it too thick to smooth onto my face. I returned it. I am now using a different vitamin E oil that is much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite thick, a good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is all Vitamin E.  It is very thick which makes it hard to get out of the bottle.  It could use an applicator to get the oil out easier</li>
            <li> Product came as expected.  It&#x27;s super thick and hard to get out of the little jar opening though.  Looking forward to the benefits.</li>
            <li> Fantastic customer service! Shipped and arrived quickly. Great product, I use it every night and can already feel and see a difference!</li>
            <li> Wife burned her fingers.  The burns looked terrible and were painful.  I ordered this Vitamin E Oil from OxKom (Amazon Marketplace).  They shipped immediately and I received it two days later.  My wife applied it to her burns and the very next day there was noticeable healing of her burns!  I highly recommend Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil for this use and there is no better place to purchase it own line that I know of than OxKom / Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great transaction, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is good oil.  However, it is D-Tocopherol Acetate which is a synthesized version of Vitamin E.  The best is pure D-Tocopherol.  Vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta- tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta –tocotrienol). Tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements. However, most Vitamin E oils do not contain all eight forms and some have soy. I purchased this one because it was quick for my wife who just had a operation, and it was the purest synthesized version Amazon had available.  I ordered another vitamin E oil product at the same time which took a couple of days longer to be delivered which is a natural vitamin E oil and has a very high concentration of vitamin oil per ounce.  This other one is Fruit Of The Earth Vitamin-E Oil Ultra Pure 0.5oz. (3 Pack) which is available on Amazon also.  I must have purchased the last three bottles because it is out of stock now.  This Cococare Oil is good for a substitute until the Fruit of the Earth is available again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The helpful benefits from vitamin E oil are not as encouraging as most people think.  However, vitamin E help protect the skin from free radicals which can damage skin and accelerate aging.  Therefore, try it and see what happens.  However some get skin irritation from using it so watch how your skin reacts.  Get the purest vitamin E oil you can and this means one that does not say Vitamin E acetate unless you cannot get the pure vitamin E oil quickly enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, but is good. Since using this oil, I&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
            <li> only product that helps with my dry skin during winter, it also help keep my beard clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Packaging really sucks! Product is good but takes forever to get out...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipping was fast, and the ingredient is the real deal, I use this on my natural hair to make sure its smooth and moisturized, will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> One nice addition would be a dropper in the bottle to use the product..</li>
            <li> What I like about this Vitamin E Oil is that it helped me slowly reduce my scars over time and it works perfect on scabs or cuts it healed my scabs pretty quick</li>
            <li> This oil is nice and potent. Thick!  I love it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not organic. Contains Genetically Modified Organisms!!</li>
            <li> I have been applying this on scars and dark spots for a couple of weeks and have noticed a considerable change in the color and texture of the skin I have applied it to. I have biracial medium toned skin and I was pleasantly surprised with how well this works. The product is sticky so I use a q-tip to apply.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother and he loves the stuff. Rubs it into his shaved scalp and now uses it as an after shave. His wife is now a fan of the stuff too. She says she always gets complements when she&#x27;s used it in the morning.</li>
            <li> To me, this is a very strong pure vitamin E oil. I have the T-zone and breakout monthly, so I have to be careful with products and use a non-oily moisturizer. I used this Vitamin E oil around my eyes to see if would work on lines, but I started to break out a bit, so I stopped using it on my face. I now mix it with my body moisturizer and use it that way. Not sure how it works for everyone else, but for me I have to be careful as my face breaks out with it.</li>
            <li> Item as described, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Hard to take out from the glass bottle. Make sure you really want want just 1oz.</li>
            <li> Alright, I read a lot of the reviews for this and I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was going to get myself into. I wanted a vitamin E serum for my body to condition my skin before the impending summer (I did not try this on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil was definitely thick like a lot of the reviews say. Other than the texture thing, the formula worked well and as expected (moisturized, evened skin tone/texture, increased luminosity and skin felt a bit firmer). Again, I did not try this on my face but did on the rest of my body. I found that this workled best after a shower which included rigorous exfoliation with a pumace stone. After the shower, I applied a lighter weight oil (argon) to my skin and quickly followed with this vitamin E oil. I warmed the vitamin E up as much as I could in my hands and worked quickly to spread the serum around, one section of the skin at a time. On some occasions, I would even put a reagular moisturizer over the oils. This made for an intense moisturizing treatment that I&#x27;ve really been enjoying.</li>
            <li> Received order timely and started using it immediately to help clear up dark spots. It is really thick, so I try to only apply it at night, but I have only been using it for a week now and can see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and service</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin E ever, I use it by itself and also mixed with my hand lotion.  Makes a huge difference for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> smaller than i expected but nice product that i look forward to using</li>
            <li> great item.  use it in my home made skin lotion.</li>
            <li> IT  is very  thick so it is definitely 100% pure vitamin e oil and i very happy with it. It keeps your body moist because i work in air condition office  and i will definitely order  more of it. I also want to know do you all have bigger bottles. Packaging was good everything came in one piece.</li>
            <li> Correct stuff on time arrival</li>
            <li> This is ok.  I&#x27;m not thrilled with the way the oil is dispensed.  It only lets a tiny drop out at a time.</li>
            <li> sturdy pkg, item as described, fast shipment. Thank you. Have not had a chance to use much of the oil yet, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love it. Used it with other ingredients in a dog paw salve.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it from top to bottom, I mix it with my lotion every night. Good for growing ur weak edges and strengthens hair. And evening skin tone. I will definitely keep purchasing, hoping to fade old scars infinitely</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this oil you make have sporadic bumps appear especially around the eye area. I dilute it with grapeseed oil and it spreads better that way and found less outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Use this product in my face &amp; body lotions.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is all natural because it is so thick.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the bottle like other reviews.  Is a great price for the size.  Use in my face moisturizer. Will last a while but will definitely purchase again. Packaged great.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I mix it with coconut oil to combat t he stickiness.  It turns out perfectly.</li>
            <li> Received the product as planned. Used it for about 5 days and it seems to be working wonders. I have sun spots that appear to be fading out and the overall look of my skin is vibrant and smooth.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for DIY cosmetics w/o having a lot on hand.  Only need a little anyway.  The bottle came in wrapped well but still a littlenoily on the outside of the bottle as it had leaked a bit.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> best vitamin e oil I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have order this product, wonderful just wonderful has really helped me with the healing process</li>
            <li> Very hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Have only been using for a week so far but so far it has helped to reduce the appearance of stretch marks. The only negative is the small package size. So if you plan on using it everyday I would recommend buying 2.</li>
            <li> Purchased as an ingredient for soap making, worked well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having Laparoscopic surgery.  I used it on the two incisions once the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; came off.  This stuff is AWESOME!  6 months later you can barely see where the incisions were.  As in there is almost no scars there.  I rubbed a little in each incision each night before bed. I also used it on some dry skin I had on my knees (hazards of obstacle course racing).  It helped my skin come back good as new.&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick which is why I think it works so well.  So a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I can not say enough good things about this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is a superior product and has been extremely effective on scar therapy.</li>
            <li> Small bottle opening makes it difficult to access with a dropper. I dripped it out of bottle and it worked OK.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Works great!</li>
            <li> I use this in making a vitamin C lotion, easy to use, good size.  You only need a tiny bit so the small bottle is all that is necessary</li>
            <li> Very thick vitamin E oil. A little bit goes a long way and my face was super soft and plump after using this. I used a steamer after applying it to my face at night.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and gooey, hard to come off. I didn&#x27;t know vitamin E supposed to be so thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure Vitamin E, unlike what I bought from Walmart;s heath and beauty section.  The walmar blend stuff was ok, but this was the real thing and healed a scar on my face.  skin almost like &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; (sic) again.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY think oil.  I have not had any issues pouring it from the bottle, but there is no real way to measure the amount poured out that way.  Unfortunately, the opening of the bottle is too small (the bottle itself is very small, which was to be expected with a 1 ounce package) to use the transfer pipettes I currently have so I am thinking about finding some smaller ones to use with this.  But otherwise I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> First time buying and using Vitamin E Oil.  Very moisturizing, but difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> A good quality Vitamin E Oil - very happy! Quick arrival too!</li>
            <li> it was well worth the money, not watery, thick and works for dry skin and hair. you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> This stuff really is straight to the point, not much I can say about it. Arrived quicker than expected. The stuff is very thick!! But what else do you expect with 100% tocopheryl acetate? I add a few drops to my deep conditioners for my hair c:</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is restoring my skin tone but I am giving it more days (weeks ?)</li>
            <li> Been using this oil to reduce coloration of some acne scars and I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable improvement and less irritation in general. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product, quick shipping</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product being very sticky and hard to apply so at first I was hesitant to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;But after a few days of actually using this product I couldn&#x27;t help but to not be so bothered by it being sticky&lt;br /&gt;I was experiencing extreme Dryness and peeling so I applied this every night since I purchased it and I started or notice that my face was being restored. It&#x27;s not as tight and as irritated anymore I also switched facial cleansers  to the Johnson&#x27;s purpose gentle cleanser and this has seemed to workout for me so far.  Love looking in the mirror in the am after my face has absorbed it and I can see the difference in my skin and how it&#x27;s taking a liking to this stuff. However  I do recommend putting a towel on your pillow when you sleep.</li>
            <li> This is super!  It fits in your purse and you can take it anywhere. It&#x27;s great for gift bags, too, for parties or favors for ladies groups.  The bottle branding is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions, cremes, salves, etc. and use this oil for it&#x27;s soothing and healing effects.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It worked a miracle on my hands. I hope it does as well in the harsh winter when my hands are severely chapped and cracked.</li>
            <li> Awesome, removed a spot under my eye that another cream made worse.  This stuff saved my face.</li>
            <li> Very helpful oil. Helps with different  skin problems. This oil is a has a very GLOSSY SHINE. A little goes a long way. Some may prefer to use at night or day or both. FABULOUS OIL.</li>
            <li> Very tacky and thick.</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend this product. Lines around my eyes have DRASTICALLY reduced. Great to leave on overnight bc it is greasy.</li>
            <li> Not at all an oil, more like a gel. Very sticky, does not spread easily.  I figured id give it a try, wish I had listened to the reviews.  Bottle did not come with a seal on it.  I ended up buying Nature&#x27;s Bounty oil, and it is truly an oil, not sticky.  I would give that one 5 stars for sure. FYI, you can not return this item.  I did get a refund since the bottle was not sealed.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thought bottle would be larger however no issues with this oil, love it!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff on scars and it works amazing.  I know it&#x27;s probably not real vitamin E oil, but whatever is in it works great for me!</li>
            <li> On time great product</li>
            <li> Great product, cannot wait to make some DIY beauty products with this!</li>
            <li> Nice thick oil.. seems to help with clarifying my skin.. love the thickness. Comes on a thick glass jar as well.</li>
            <li> Great vitamin E oil. It is very thick, which is the  way pure vitamin E is supposed to be. A little goes a long way. I use it with my essential oils and for skin care.</li>
            <li> Packs a huge punch. I bought this for a friend who needed help with a scar but I ended up keeping it for myself. I used it for all things skin related. I put some after a blemish pops, chapped lips, dry skin or even over my nose when I have a cold just to add an extra layer of protection. It really speeds up any healing process.</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin E oil in almost all of my homemade beauty products.  This is a thick oil so I never accidentally over measure.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I recently had foot surgery, and now (after six weeks in a boot) I have to massage my foot twice a day. This oil smoothes the massage and helps to reduce scar tissue.</li>
            <li> My first time trying Vit E oil on my granddaughter&#x27;s eczema and my own winter dehydrated skin. I&#x27;m very impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst winter I remember from living in Michigan for 25 years. I&#x27;ve never had problems with severely dry skin before this winter. I always look for natural products, and ordered this after internet research and the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it might help a little, but happy and surprised when it completely cleared up eczema I was just developing from prolonged dry air and cold of this winter. My granddaughter has had eczema since birth, we have tried many commercial lotions. I started putting this Vit E oil on her dry patches with a q-tip. It helped considerably, much more than Eucerin, Lubriderm, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer suggested using the oil at night for a moisturizer, especially around the eyes and even the eyebrows for hair growth. Again, it works! It gave my face a subtle &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that people comment on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is magical pure oil. The thickness doesn&#x27;t bother me, I figure it&#x27;s teaching me patience. Try turning the bottle upside down before use, when you open the cap the oil is right there.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this for a hand cream being that it soaks in fast so i purchased it however I use it on my face and under my eyes and love it!!</li>
            <li> Just read a review on another product that this was a synthetic oil. The person called Cococare to get the ingredients, since it just says Vitamin E on the label. Well, its synthetic Vitamin E. Bummer, I used to buy this all the time.</li>
            <li> Very Thick, will last a long Time. No complaints with is product at all. Good to add to other stuff...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I heard this kind of oil was good for you.  I was very disappointed when it came in the mail.  They inadequately padded the envelope that they sent it in...and it came to me crushed.  The PO peeps put it in a plastic garbage bag and delivered it to me...I guess they didn&#x27;t want all the other mail getting soiled.  I.am.disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this on my eyelashes and it makes them grow crazy long. Just a small amount goes a long way. The bottle lasts a long time, if you use it for this purpose. I just ordered my second one, which is rare for me because I tend to jump from product to product. I am very happy with this product and hope to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Too sticky to use. Could not even rub it aross the skin. It felt like tar. Then once I got it on, it was so sticky that everything started sticking to it.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil that came in a 1 oz glass bottle. I have been using this product for a month now in different skincare routines I do daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is it good for?&lt;br /&gt;Treats wrinkles and helps prevent, moisturizes dry skin, heals scars, lighten brown spots/sun spots, heals and prevents stretchmarks, and moisturizes and treats dry cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the product like?&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin E oil is very sticky, thick, and has no scent. Due to its sticky consistency it’s very hard to get it out of the opening the bottle has and very hard to spread on areas where you plan on putting it on. (Tip: I take a q-tip and rip the cotton off one of its ends as best as I can and dip it into the bottle to get the liquid out or a toothpick) The Vitamin E oil in this product is 100% pure and rest assured this one is not synthetic. I found that this product does not clog my pores nor has it made me break out, but everyone’s skin is different and will react differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used this oil&lt;br /&gt;I use this Vitamin E oil in several of my skin care routines. For any scars that I’m treating, I put it directly on the spot (just a little on each spot… this product is thick and just a little goes a long way) and pat it several times till I know the oil is evenly spread on the area. Same with putting this on my starting wrinkles, I just put a little on my ring fingers and pat it under my eyes very very gently because the sticky consistency tends to stick well and pull the skin up. (I never use this product on my entire face as it is thick and I have oil/dry combination skin. I don’t want to make my t-zone area too oily.) I have also mixed this Vitamin E oil with essential oils to make an oil treatment for my stretchmarks and I mix this into my daily face moisturizer, night facial cream, and body lotion to help get a full body even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;This product works well and my skin takes to it quite nicely. (no breakouts/allergic reaction to this) I found that within a week the acne scars that I’ve had for several months have completely faded and are gone. There is still two acne marks that are slightly bigger that have, they have lightened up a bit but are barely noticeable. My minor sunspots lightened within a week of using this and the really tiny ones I had are all gone now. The oil has completely evened out my skin tone from head to toe (I had off-colored knees and elbows, but they weren’t very dark. As for wrinkles it has smoothed my small ones that were starting underneath my eyes (started seeing results bout the 3rd week), my laugh lines are starting to look less defined, and the smaller stretchmarks lines I have are fading, but the bigger ones are still there.</li>
            <li> I both this product online because I was looking for a pure vitamin E oil not realising that this was synthetic as it only had Tocopherol Acetate on the bottle and nothing to indicate that it was dl -alpha and not d - alpha. I am waiting at the hospital clinic right now due to a severe allergic reaction on my face and I am not very pleased as I have used the natural version before and I had no problems. I am sure some people will not react but if you have sensitive skin beware. Perhaps they should add this to their packaging in future.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the other reviewers. The product itself is wonderful - I have been using it in my homemade sugar scrubs and can tell the difference in my skin after each use. I have really dry, bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and legs, and using a sugar scrub with olive oil and tea tree oil already helped, but the vitamin e gives it that extra kick and makes my skin that much softer and smoother for much longer. Trying to get it out of the bottle, however, is a slow-moving nightmare... I will definitely be draining this into a bottle with a wider neck or at least a dropper or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/23/14:&lt;br /&gt;I just found out that this is great for razor burn (shaving in winter is NOT fun...) - I mixed this with some lotion so it would spread better and didn&#x27;t get any razor bumps, which is very unusual for me even when using moisturizers. I also found that this works great for pimples - I had one last night and put some of this on it and it&#x27;s much smaller and less painful today. Very happy with this product, despite the bottle.</li>
            <li> This was ordered for my mom so not sure how it is working for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this several times - no other Vitamin E has been as good, it is pure and no other fillers. Moisturizes and heals my skin and scars</li>
            <li> Product seems to be of good quality, small bottle but a little bit goes a long way. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> One must be patient to get the oil out of it&#x27;s container because it is very thick.&lt;br /&gt;I use small amounts around my eyes, lips, and nails several times a week,</li>
            <li> Mixed well with other carrier oils. Was not quite as thick as was expected from other reviews. Would buy again</li>
            <li> Delivered in 10 days, but was free.  Like other customers said Oil is very tick, which is good for me.  My face skin is mix, but I like it.  Even next morning my face was still moisture.  Let&#x27;s wait more time to see results.</li>
            <li> Very good vitamin E oil.  Feels great on the skin, look forward to seeing some results in an attempt to lighten a scar using this.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using pure products on my body, and this one is good quality but it is a bit thick &amp; difficult to spread on my skin.</li>
            <li> Item as described shipping was safe</li>
            <li> I use vitamin e oil on my face, skin, scalp and hair.  This is perfect to mix in your favorite lotion or cream - or make your own beauty mix!  Vitamin E oil has so many uses. I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!  :)</li>
            <li> vitamin E oil which I have not used yet, would do well to have a larger opening at the top although other than that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine. Perhaps a plastic bottle with a squeezed top.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in homemade chapstick... seems to work fine.  Don&#x27;t notice anything weird about the chapstick. :-)</li>
            <li> Very thick. Only need a little at a time. No smell. Appears to be of good quality. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good price &amp; easy to use for adding to lotions &amp; lip balms for a moisturizing preservative.  And adding to my dogs food for support to heal after knee surgery. Much better than having to use individual Vit. E capsules.</li>
            <li> I always mix some vitamin e oil with my face moisturizer. This is more like a vitamin e paste than an oil. It is so thick and sticky and it doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs. It just sits on top of your skin. When I try to use it I have to sit and wait for it to slowly ooze out of the bottle. It&#x27;s that thick. Gave it two stars because perhaps a super thick vitamin e paste could be good for something? It just wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like the vitamin E oil. I don&#x27;t mind the stickiness of the oil, and it&#x27;s easy to get out of the bottle if you don&#x27;t cover the entire opening with your finger. I either use a Q-tip, or pour a little of the oil onto my finger. Item arrived quickly, and I recommend this seller to others.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my lotions.</li>
            <li> This was not what I was expecting. I was impressed by the glass bottle when it arrived, but when I used it, the oil is not an oil consistency at all. It&#x27;s exactly like a honey consistency and just as sticky. I suppose it works ok but I don&#x27;t like to use it because its so sticky, so Im moving on</li>
            <li> This oil is a highly concentrated source of Vitamin E.  I mix a couple of drops of it in the almond oil I use as a body moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve just put in an order for 2 more bottles (because I don&#x27;t want to EVER run out).</li>
            <li> If I could GET THE OIL OUT OF THE BOTTLE I&#x27;d be more inclined to give it more stars. It APPEARS to be just a great product from the teensy bit I can manage to get out, but WHY such a TINY opening for such a THICK liquid? I think the oil may be 5*&#x27;s from the teensy bit I&#x27;ve been able to use, but I won&#x27;t be buying again. A bigger opening would have solved the whole issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As suggested by a comment, I tried a Q-tip, and it works beautifully. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t think of this myself, thank you! Changing this to 5 stars now!</li>
            <li> Very nice product&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I am satisfied thank you</li>
            <li> is sticky but is normal, vitamin E is always sticky and is hard to find  in liquid,  good quality ...</li>
            <li> I would give this 4 stars if it had not come in a glass bottle.  This was very difficult to get the vitamin E oil out because it was so sticky.  So I had to shake the jar with my hand and in the process, it broke and shattered all over my bathroom.  The worst part was how it shattered in my hand and cut me pretty badly.  Most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and so far I love it. I&#x27;m not sure why people are complaining about the packaging. You bought this product for its contents, not the packaging. Any who, yes, it is extremely thick so a little goes a long way. I have acne scars and in the nighttime I dab less than a pea-size amount all over my face. Prior to that, I apply 3 drops of organic jojoba oil. The 2 work great together and my skin absorbs the vitamin e oil beautifully! Trust me, when you wake up in the morning your skin looks and feels rejuvenated. I&#x27;m hoping this product lightens my acne scars. P.s. I had a pimple forming, dabbed this bad boy and by the next day it completely shrunk! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it! I initially purchased to add a few drops to my face cleansing oil, but now I plan to use it as much as as I can! Before adding to my other oils, I tested a patch on some dark marks on my face two days in a row and it has already faded them and I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction! It&#x27;s very thick though and would&#x27;ve been better with another top - even a dropper. Nonetheless, I will be ordering again - soon!</li>
            <li> used this in my lip balm recipe! worked great......thanks</li>
            <li> I had ACL surgery and I&#x27;ve used this everyday on my scars for the last month. There&#x27;s a noticeable fading happening and a few of them have already almost disappeared completely and it&#x27;s only been 2 months since the surgery. I also use it under my eyes as an overnight eye mask. Very happy with the results, fine lines have been reduced about 20% I&#x27;d say. Great deal for the price, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more. It&#x27;s a tiny little bottle but the oil is so thick that it lasts about a month if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because although I was kind of satisfied with the product inside,I was kind of disappointed at the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> I bought this as a part of my DIY projects. The oil is thick and makes skin supple. It went fabulously with the body scrubs and lip balms I created. I will be restocking soon!</li>
            <li> This is very, very sticky.  It is very difficult to wash off of your fingers.  I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> Good project. Purchased for my daughter to use for her homemade lip balm. It worked great and did the job.</li>
            <li> not sure it is sanitary</li>
            <li> I use this on my dogs noses when they get a little chapped or cracked. I can finger dab this on once a day for a few days and their little noses are right as rain. Who knew?</li>
            <li> This product is really thick and heavy.  I didn&#x27;t see any results since it&#x27;s hard to use.</li>
            <li> The oil leaked all in the pkg. it was a mess</li>
            <li> Great stuff better than anything store bought</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it&#x27;s working tho..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. My skin looks good so eh. I usually mix it in my lotion and my hair moisturizer.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Only a few uses and my less severe stretch marks are already fading. I absolutely love it. It is a very thick sticky liquid so I decided to use one of my daughters extra medicine syringes to get it out instead of waiting forever to get a few drops. That works perfectly and I can spread it all over before I rub it in. I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> It is vitamin E, so it works great. But as for size, I was not expecting it to be that small. But it&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I have found this product cheaper on Amazon.  The bottle is made of glass and solution is thick. It is very difficult to pour vit. E out because of its thickness and bottle design.</li>
            <li> **Update to my original review. A few months ago, I started get eczema on my face. As recommended by my doctor, I started using hydrocortisone cream, but every time I stopped using the cream, the eczema would come back and sometimes worse. I also wanted to switch to a more natural solution and tried coconut oil and shea butter, but these did not work. I am not sure why it took me so long to try using this vitamin E oil. I started dabbing on the vitamin E oil directly to the areas of my face that had the eczema outbreak at night before bed. The VERY NEXT day, the redness and the outbreaks had noticeably lessened. The redness and the outbreaks had completely disappeared after a few days of using this oil. So happy and relieved!  I know that eczema is a big issue for a lot of people.  I hope this helps anyone suffering from this as much as it has helped me.  Original review: I ordered this product to use in my regular skin care routine. I am really enjoying this vitamin E oil. This is the first time I have ever found any where the only listed ingredient was vitamin E oil so I was definitely not used to the feel of it, which is a honey-like consistency, but that feeling goes away quite rapidly. Though I am not fond of the glass bottle because of the small opening, it actually does pour out at a decent rate. I don&#x27;t spend all day waiting for it like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I sometimes will warm the bottle in hot water in my sink which makes it pour out a little more rapidly.  So far I have used this product for some of my scars that are relatively new as was recommended. This hasn&#x27;t had any real impact on fading the scars unfortunately and I have been using it daily for 3 months now. I tend to mark up really easily so I am not completely surprised. I have also used this product on the fine lines around my eyes. This really works well to resolve that issue. Regardless of how I have used this product, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all.  What I have used itmost for is my homemade lotion concoction that I use both on my face and body both in the morning and at night as I have very dry skin. This lotion soaks right into my skin in a few minutes without leaving my skin feeling greasy and hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out. The recipe and instructions to make the lotion for those that are interested: I heat up and combine 1 cup of shea butter, 1/2 cup of coconut oil, and 1/2 cup of almond oil in a double boiler. After those ingredients are melted and combined, I leave out to cool, but not solidify, and then add in 1 tsp of vitamin E oil. I then put the concoction in the refrigerator to cool and solidify and then whip it with a mixer to get a nice whipped cream-like consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m halfway through the bottle and I can say that it&#x27;s helped. I try to use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night though most days I only remember to put it on once.  I also use an exfoliator twice a week on my skin and at times I use shea butter on my skin, both of which are good for erasing dark marks. This product def helps but IT TAKES TIME. it&#x27;s no miracle worker, just be consistent and I&#x27;m sure you will see results just like me :)</li>
            <li> This is a very annoying product to attempt to use. The Vitamin E oil is thick and almost impossible to get out of the container. Definitely needs a wider mouth top.</li>
            <li> ready to use vitamin e !! Good</li>
            <li> Thick and seems to be good for helping with scars</li>
            <li> great product and ship time and customer service. The only thing I didnt like was a little hard to get out but solved that with a eye dropper</li>
            <li> I  like the Vitamin Oil a lot...... but.....i had difficulties with the vendor and shipping it to me.  I had to follow up after a month on where is my product.  After exchanging numerous emails i finally got it.  Maybe my order fell thru the cracks i dont know, but hopefully this wont happen again, but i do like the Oil...</li>
            <li> Glass bottle arrived broken... Thanks</li>
            <li> I personally love this and give it a 5 star for the product it&#x27;s self. But the glass it&#x27;s in is so fragile I dropped it once and the cap broke off so now I have it rigged to where I can still use the product. I use it for my ears since I&#x27;m stretching my ears it works almost as well as my stretching balm I have and it&#x27;s easier to get on the Q-tip to put into my ear hole to help my ear heal.</li>
            <li> Perfect to use with my home made hand sanitizer! Love itn</li>
            <li> This Vitamin E Oil exceeded expectations, very high quality. It is a bit smaller than I thought - but that is my mistake.</li>
            <li> never used vitamin e oil before so didnt really know what to expect. the oil is a bit thick, I have been using it at night time on my face and have been waking with a smooth soft face. I like it so far, guess would have to continue using it for some time before I can say for sure how much i like it.</li>
            <li> I just got this product and I&#x27;m in love! I have skin problems from acne, stretch marks, nickel allergys (rashes) rosacea, and even razor burn. It helps all of those problems! It&#x27;s very concentrated, but it will last very long, I can already tell. A little goes a long way! I just dip a q-tip in and either mix it with tea tree oil or lotion or even by its self and put it on my problem areas. My rashes immediately stop itching and being irritating. And redness goes down A LOT. My face is usually red and I mixed this with a little tea tree oil and BOOM no more redness!! Ive tried many things to help my red tint to my face and this by far is the best, immediate result s and leaves my skin feeling great! I never usually leave reviews, but I&#x27;m soooo happy with this I have to share! My stretch marks and acne scars are already fading, just after one night with it on. Definitely recommend this and will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I first ordered the 1/2 ounce to see how it worked. I&#x27;m now ordering the 1 ounce, so you can see it works extremely well for me. I bought it to use on my cuticles because nothing else I tried worked. This works beautifully. Then I had a rash on my neck that nothing else helped. Again, this worked beautifully. Again, a sore on my lip that wouldn&#x27;t heal. This worked. I also use it if I have chapped lips. I really appreciate that it is 100% pure Vitamin E, no other oils. Yes, it is thick, and that (I&#x27;m assuming) is because it is Pure Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Great price for 100% Vitamin E oil. My daughter has sensitive skin and gets rashes on her face from contact with food and subsequently being wiped off. The pediatrician recommended Vitamin E oil, so we tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is odor free and does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is glass, so you can&#x27;t squeeze it to get the product out. Took me a bit to figure out how to hold a squirming toddler and deal with the bottle, but I eventually did.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast service. Exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> Using for after my surgery....results TBD.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the bottle would be glass so I can&#x27;t squeeze it out, just takes some patience to wait for it to slowing pour out the bottle</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this Vitamin E oil, ordering it as an add on to the free shipping make this the best priced high quality E oil I have found.  Love the fact there are no fillers, having used E oils with fillers previously like Trader Joes, I find the minimal amount needed of this totally make up for the price difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this oil, great at reducing wrinkles and the appearance of scars.  I add it to my natural beauty products with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish it came in larger sizes!</li>
            <li> This is very thick and goes a long way, I personally use this at night because you should put on Vitamin E if your going in the sun, But I mainly use this for my Nails, works wonderful they grow fast and cleaner for it.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with Aubrey 100 pure aloe Vera, it works wonders on my skin... reduced my pores and gives me a glowing face..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to lessen my scars from recent dermotology removals on my face, leg and back and this is doing the trick! Using just alittle bit twice per day and I have seen results in just a few weeks. I am very happy with the price, the bottle and the arrival time. Highly recommend for those looking for a natural way to remove scars. I also read it&#x27;s good for treating wrinkles so even though Im 30, I started putting it next to my eyes to prevent wrinkles :)</li>
            <li> If I had written a review when first received the product, I would have given it a one star sine it is very sticky and I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.  After research, I learned that Vitamin E oil works best with Victsmin C serum.  I was solely relying on Vitamin C serum since it whitens my skins and produces more collagen.  However, after 6 months of Vitamin C serum, I have developed skin irritation and sensitivity.  I researched and found vitamin e is e best companion for vitamin c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did wonders to me.  Yeah!!!  I wash my face at night, apply toner, vitamin c serum, after it is dry, I apply s thick layer of vitamin e oil.  Since this is pasty and oily, you have to be careful not to touch anyone or anything.  I typical do it right before I go to sleep.  Originally, I was only trying to calm down my skin after the vitamin c irritation,  but now it becomes my routine skin care.  I have sensitive and acne prone skin, this treatment has significantly reduced my acne occurrences if not entirely.  In the morning, I can feel the oil was almost fully absorbed by the skin, and feels really smooth!!!  I recommend this product now after the new discovery.</li>
            <li> Difficult to dispense. Needs better bottle.</li>
            <li> 1 Ounce of Vitamin E goes a long way and I found this to be easy to use and less messy then having to deal with breaking open capsules etc. Works for me</li>
            <li> I mix this in my beauty products. Works great on sunburn. I love this stuff for anything to do with my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I wish this came with a stopper to make precise drops instead of an open container, it would be much easier to measure as it is much thicker than most liquid oils.</li>
            <li> The oil is too hard to get out of the bottle and is very viscous. It does not pour out easily. However, the little bit that I did manage to pour out mixed well with my shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a secret remedy to get rid of my old stretchmarks and this product helps them fade like nothing else. I use a combination of grapeseed, this vitamin e oil, jojoba, emu oil, and shea butter every night and my scars and stretchmarks disappear overtime. So thankful for this product, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Great, nana loved it!</li>
            <li> This is good and thick. Pure vitamin e oil, but very hard to get out of the bottle. I would but again but only in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF MY ALL AROUND FAVORITE PRODUCTS SO FAR. LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH AND BEAUTIFUL. I ALSO LIKE THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Perfect for the body butter I&#x27;m going to be making this Christmas for friends and family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was a little much. Bubblewrap with tape encompassing it. Had to fight with the scissors in order to open it, but hey! No broken bottle!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Vitamin E product.  I use it when I make my own Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I got this product to put on a scar from a recent surgery and it seems to be working great. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this! Ordering more!</li>
            <li> I used the tip from another reviewer and use a Q-tip with the end removed and it works for me.  Last forever too..</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> Great product I bought for stretching my ears and it works great! I also use it on the stretch marks on my thighs and hips and hope it will break down the scar tissue like people say. Also REALLY thick</li>
            <li> Great product. Helped my son&#x27;s scar under his lip heal very fast. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find pure vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;I use this under my eyes, also for scraps and bruises.  Nice and thick...&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase this again</li>
            <li> It is very sticky so I do use a towel on the pillow when I go to sleep but I think it&#x27;s helped my nails and I think it&#x27;s helped the dark skin around my eyes.  It doesn&#x27;t tighten skin up at all and it&#x27;s not a miracle oil or anything but I like it and think it helps some.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick. You will only need a small amount at a time. I have been using this on my surgical scars and it really helps soften them. My doctor even commented on how well they are healing.</li>
            <li> This small bottle of Vitamin E Oil will last a very long time.  It is the consistency of syrup.  Order or have an eye dropper to apply.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I googled what pure forms of VITAMIN E oil there are and toco(forgot how to spell it) was one of the types. Also, medical pages I looked at described the oil as extremely thick and heavy and this oil matches the descriptions found on a few different websites perfectly. *i like oils in the purest, least diluted forms*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add a couple drop globs to whatever im putting on my face, such as: face lotion &amp; foundation. It helps my make up go on quite dewy and gives me a non oily glow on my skin and i also feel like i&#x27;ve been seen WAY less tiny little blackheads on my skin which I&#x27;d been seeing much more the last couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my face lotion when I&#x27;m not putting on my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m putting my foundation on I mix a little foundation with my usual amount of lotion and add about one drop (feels like a glob since its so thick) on the back of my hand and use a foundation brush to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going to do blush and bronzer for a nice natural covered feeling go put on your pants of fix your hair so that it can just set. If you give it a few or couple minutes you&#x27;ll love the results because your blush and bronzer will go on smooth and to me much more vibrant and noticeably... i think the nice thin layer of protection keeps it all from being absorbed into your skin leaving you with a more LONG LASTING and SMOOTH look :D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair I added almost a teaspoon to my sheabutter and oil cream I made and also to my flaxseed gel I made. I plan to mix it with whatever I concoct for my hair since i cut a lot of dead ends off recently and what to grow out my hair as healthy as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am loving my new beauty and hair routine and this product has played a great role in that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would give five stars but it just doesnt feel riht</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my first &#x27;CLEAR&#x27; v.E oil to test. I did like it alot, especially paired with my v.C serum. Since it did not break me out [like the dark colored v.E oil] I am comfortable ordering more.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and smooth. I made several natural cosmetics with it and it blends perfectly. I even applied it to a scrapes and it seems to help the healing process.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin E Oil on the market.  Most natural I can find.  Only got 4 stars because I couldn&#x27;t get the excess amount from the bottom of the bottle so I feel like I have wasted a bit.</li>
            <li> Really for the price you could get a larger amount with a different brand. I used this one in lip balm, had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil. It is very thick so a little goes a long way. I have just started using it but my skin feels a lot smoother</li>
            <li> I love it, worked really well for my homemade bug spray</li>
            <li> Perfect for serums or just as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s a little sticky but soaks in rather quickly. It has no scent and will last a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bit thick and sticky making it difficult to apply, I mix with a touch of baby oil which helps to apply more easily. I do like this oil and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I truly love all natural products! 100% vitamin E oil! Vitamin E oil is so good for your skin overall. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I use this under my eyes and on my forehead at night. Works great and leaves my skin looking moist and plump.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely perfect. I use it for my homemade hand creams. Highly recommend this product. Just be careful with the bottle itself. Easy to break the top.</li>
            <li> This product is pure vitamin E, no fillers like some other products. I would reorder this brand, some of the other vitamin e products are mostly filler and contain soybean oil.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely but the product is very very thick and is very sticky.  Can&#x27;t see a difference with using the product.  Thought it would be more like an essential oil consistency.  Very difficult to get it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Cococarecare work for me perfectly...&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that the oil is so hard to come out of the bottle. ..</li>
            <li> I had this to my homemade lotions and hair lotions and its a very good additon to healthy skin and hair. im in the process of learning how to make deoderants and i will be adding this to it as well...the bottle is small but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my fingers and I was taking a vitamin E supplement to combat the dry skin, but I figured applying the vitamin directly to my skin could work better. I can&#x27;t say this oil works better than the supplement, but it does help relieve the dryness overnight. I wish it weren&#x27;t so sticky, so I could wear it during the day, but it&#x27;s affordable and works, so I&#x27;m content with the results.</li>
            <li> OK this is my first bottle of pure Vitamin E Oil but is so sticky it can&#x27;t be used on the skin.  Even diluted in another oil it&#x27;s so sticky and the stickiness doesn&#x27;t wash off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, my husband developed guttate psoriasis after an illness and despite trips to the dermatologist and them saying it would clear up quickly with various prescription and OTC creams. I&#x27;d tried various natural options (okay, tons of them) with minimal improvement. I&#x27;d come across a few posts and articles talking Vitamin E Oil and decided, why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seemed to have the highest rating, be the purest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has paid off. In just under 2 weeks we&#x27;ve seen more improvement than the last year. Up to this point we&#x27;ve been applying it directly to skin, no dilution. We&#x27;re now cutting it with coconut oil and have continued to see improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the bottles are small. Even a 2 ounce bottle would be just big enough- but for now, I&#x27;ll buy a few at a time.</li>
            <li> so many uses and applications I love it, will definitely be reordering when it comes time!</li>
            <li> It works well to clear up dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use when I make lotion</li>
            <li> The bottle was covered with sticky vitamin e oil and was not completely closed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m 28 and starting to see the age creeping up on me. I put this on every night generously and go to sleep. I wake up and wash my face and my face feels nice and smooth. Don&#x27;t know if I have seen a difference yet because I have great genes and my skin is crystal clear but I want to see a difference in the minute small lines I see in my face. We will see if this makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine. We bought it as an ingredient for homemade lip balms. However, the bottle the oil comes in has such a skinny neck it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the oil out.</li>
            <li> I got this as an add on so it was a good price.  I mix it with Coconut oil on my face after a chemical peel and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil just for three days twice a day and I can  see the results, I have some black spots which appeared after my Baby&#x27;s birth, I love my new skin, got my confidence back...I recommend it to everyone....</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great service!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Works as a moisturizer, sun tan remover. I can feel the purity is good. Available at same price in other stores as well, if you do not want to wait for shipping.</li>
            <li> Love my Vitamin E. I combine it with other oils or lotions each time I moisturize. I generally use gel capsules but this made life easier. I found that I did overuse it because it was much easier than capsules, but that&#x27;s okay!!</li>
            <li> I like it but its a pain to get out of the bottle.  It takes a while to come out.  But I guess that&#x27;s a good thing.  It works great though.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it was PURE vitamin e oil, what a fool I was. Within days of using this product my skin had began to look thrice my age. Will do myself a favor and skip this synthetic garbage.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own facial products. I first used this oil in my lip balms. Worked great!&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT order capsules and waste time opening those!  This makes everything a breeze!!&lt;br /&gt;  I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Loved it, better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. The bottle is very sturdy and it&#x27;s easy to see when the oil is running out.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing.  I use it on my face and OMG this is great.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect shipping!</li>
            <li> I used this as a recommendation of my dog&#x27;s vet for a scar on my rescue pugs neck.  The scar was hard and peeling - he recommended that I put a Q-tip full of this on her neck couple times a week and it has softened up and actually started to grow back some fur! She was a rescue dog and god knows what the scar is from - but it is healing nicely and looking better!</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture shows. Great for scar massage.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL product purchased due to red bumps and used for 2 weeks straight and bumps are gone.</li>
            <li> For a month now, I&#x27;ve been getting these pimples on my temple area, probably because of the food I&#x27;m eating and for whatever reasons pimples are forming. For a week or more nights, I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s moisture surge extended thirst relief after I&#x27;ve cleansed and used toner. for a finishing touch, I massage some of the Cococare 100% Vitamin E oil in the affected areas and other dry skin. I&#x27;ve adapted it into my nightly skin care routine and every morning the pimples have diminished. Soon, I hope to recover my flawless skin. I believe it is what helps the blemishes go away faster than leaving it untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is thick and I&#x27;m interested in trying out the Trader Joe&#x27;s 100% pure vitamin oil after I finish with this bottle to compare how the texture is like for the Trader Joe&#x27;s version. Cococare&#x27;s bottle seem small, but a little goes a long way and it takes a long time to use up the bottle of oil.  I originally bought it to treat an acne scar above my cupid&#x27;s arrow and yeah, safe to say, that one is gone long time ago. Now I&#x27;m treating the some stubborn pimples and I&#x27;m really liking the results. The pimples are healing and getting smaller. Awesome! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and I used it to make sunscreen, noticeable positive difference in my skin when I have used this!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it to mix with oils. I even put it on blemishes, which it clears them right up.</li>
            <li> Arrive on time, as expected.</li>
            <li> Am loving it! I use it around my eyes at night and it does a great job. Much better then any expensive eye cream. Pure and quality product.</li>
            <li> Worked well on mty scar.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday, helps alleviate dry skin on face, elbows and heels.  I took the advice of a reviewer and added it to my face creams and lotions, works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use with my DIY body washes and soaps. Its as described, actually, not knowing or using vitamin E in its raw form before, its a lot thicker than regular oil. It works for what I&#x27;m using it for so I&#x27;m very happy with it. I received it in the time frame expected. All is good.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to me to be the real thing.  It is sticky out of the bottle, but as it warms up on your skin, it becomes more liquidy and easier to spread.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any differences in my skin after using it.  I have been using it for about a month now.  I also take the Vitamin E pills.  You can also mix this in with a organic raw shea butter and jojoba oil to make a nice skin lotion, sans perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle came in plastic bag along with the other things I ordered in the box.</li>
            <li> This is very good stuff! The only thing I hate is how hard it is to get it out of the glass container. It takes forever!</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, so it stays where it needs to. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Holy Cow! Pure vitamin E is where it&#x27;s at! I only use a little bit of this in my lotions that I make and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful. I have tattoos and when my last one was healing I used a bit more in my lotions. Tattoo healed up really quick and still looks amazing. Using Vitamin E in my lotions really helps heal my skin. My feet are soft, even my heals! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Sticky and thick (like honey), but makes a great inexpensive night cream.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, fast shipping.  Thanks</li>
            <li> works great wish they made this 3 times the size i would have no complaints besides it being so small and thick. Really helps clear your skin!</li>
            <li> great product, I had surgery over 2 month ago, did not use anything before,  used it 3 times and huge change! my skin is soft and the scar is healing great.</li>
            <li> The item was just as described and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!! Best thick vitamin E oil out there!! I add to my homemade products and a little goes a long way :-) will buy again when my bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is pure and seems to be of a very high quality ingredient.  The nourishing vitamin E oil healed my dry, chapped lips in a day and it seems to be helping my scar from a previous burn.  I also mix a few drops of this oil with pure Argan Oil and use it as an everyday lip balm and nighttime lip treatment.  I put it on during the day instead of chapstick when my lips are feeling dry, I apply it before applying lipstick to smooth and protect my lips, and I apply it to clean dry lips and scars each evening before bed as a restorative treatment.  It makes my lips and skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for about three months now and find it absolutely wonderful on my skin. It has made such difference to my dry skin that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go without it! Now armed with my \\&quot;Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil, I am not afraid of the approaching winter season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My last order of three bottles of cococare vitamin e oil was so poorly packaged that one bottle got broken on transit and messed up the package. What I received was a messy package dripping with oil. I&#x27;ve sent two messages to Amazon asking for a replacement but have heard nothing so far. I just want to let you know that I&#x27;m still waiting for for my replacement.I paid over $5 for one ounce of oil. That is not cheap!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of Vitamin E, but the container it comes in is glass, and vitamin E liquid is thick, it took sometime to remove all the liquid from that glass container, other then that I love the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this, along with castor oil, to put on my eyelashes for growth and it works great ! My only complain is that since the bottle is glass it&#x27;s hard to get the oil out</li>
            <li> As advertised and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT !!!! No filler or unnecessary oils. I don&#x27;t care for the glass bottle, but I can live with it ! Thanks</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time. Nice item. Would recommend this and will use this supplier ahain in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; section, only to find out it is not Organic. It is a synthetic dl-alpha. I have contacted Amazon about GMO items being in the Organic section. NOW brands has a d-alpha, vegan, non synthetic e oil for about the same price. True E-Oil should have a yellowish tint and should not be clear.</li>
            <li> Can be used in many DIY skincare.</li>
            <li> It is what the description says it is. I haven&#x27;t worked with vitamin E before, and I was surprised at how thick it is. I think that maybe having it in a squeezy bottle or something might have worked better as it can be hard to pour a precise amount of it out of a glass bottle. Otherwise, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Very thick. Its a little slow coming out of the bottle but its done wonders for the dry skin on my face, especially since the winter has been so harsh.</li>
            <li> Amazing! wish I had discovered vitamin E oil 20 years ago, I use it on my face as a moisturizer, I mix it with my regular moisturizer, it does so much more than make my skin soft, tiny scars are disappearing, skin is clearer, healthier, wrinkles are diminishing. great for under eyes...love it!</li>
            <li> Before this, I used to tear open vitamin E capsules to run on a terrible after-wax skin burn on my face and it helped fade it within 2 months. I use this version to fade my acne scars that have become flat but dark on my skin and so far, not sure if it&#x27;s working. It will last a long time and a product you want in your medicine cabinet, probably.  This comes in a great package-- glass bottle, and highly concentrated- I mean, it is THICK. Try using a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> Thick but moisturizing oil. Use this wisely because if you use too much your hair will not feel pretty. It is like a syrup so I use barely any for my daily spritzer. It will last for a long time at my rate.</li>
            <li> I got this to moisturize my cuticles. The oil is very thick and sticky, and the neck of this bottle is too narrow to pour the oil out. I think it would thin out with heat, but I don&#x27;t want to destroy the vitamin, so I dip a q-tip into the bottle instead. This is kind of a pain, as I would prefer to mix it in with a lotion to thin it out a bit. The oil itself is doing its job preventing hangnails.</li>
            <li> Thick and rich.  Exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s really really thick and hard to get out</li>
            <li> Excellent value and feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. Good price.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying 100% pure vitamin oil but this is not it. However,  it blends well with my shea butter mix and we haven&#x27;t seen any bad reactions from it so far...</li>
            <li> Been using this for stretch marks. Originally I bought it to help keep new from forming and it has definitely worked for me on that and it has even made the old ones fade! Mine are only about 3 years old though so maybe if you&#x27;ve had yours longer it may not work as well or take longer to work but I&#x27;ve seen results within 2 months with consistent use. It&#x27;s hard to spread so I use along with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> yea I love it my face loves it!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I mix it with coconut oil and use on my shaved head and face. I&#x27;ve been using for about two months and my blemishes have cleared and my scalp doesn&#x27;t dry out all day long. My wife uses it on her hair mixed with almond oil and the results have been great...glossy sheen, much better than the mineral oil she was using. One bottle lasts the two of us about a month. I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles. Shipping takes about 3 days and wrapping is safe &amp; secure, order with confidence.</li>
            <li> By far, the best vitamin E oil I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s not mixed with lots of other oils. It&#x27;s thick and works great in lotions, soaps, and facewash. Love it!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is the real deal</li>
            <li> Great product....i definitely will be a repeat buyer. I was impressed with the purity of the product. It is nice to purchase something that is well worth the price. Try it...you will like it.</li>
            <li> Hard to spread but very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is an essential product for me, as it is useful for so many different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Scar treatment - In the past when I&#x27;ve had pimples, after healing, they would leave an ugly dark mark that wouldn&#x27;t go away for months. Now, I apply Vitamin E Oil as soon as they start to heal and it leaves absolutely NO mark! I&#x27;ve also used it on burns from my curling iron and the effect is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Hydration - Just a drop or two added to my night cream and I wake up with fabulously glowing, hydrated skin in the morning. I&#x27;ve also taken to mixing a little bit in with lotion on my hands at night and it&#x27;s definitely made the skin on my hands softer and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Eczema - I get the occasional outbreak of eczema/extremely dry patches on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried so many different prescription creams and while some of them did work, they&#x27;d leave my skin dark and discolored after healing. This Vitamin E Oil has changed my life. Not only does it miraculously cure my eczema, but it makes it so that there is no darkness or discoloration after it heals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is the best Vitamin E Oil available since it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t diluted with other ingredients (soybean oil, safflower oil, etc.). The only ingredient is Vitamin E, pure and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripes are the small size and the packaging. I go through these 1 oz. bottles pretty frequently and it&#x27;s kind of hard to dispense since it&#x27;s glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, LOVE this.</li>
            <li> This crap is synthetic and bad for your skin!  REAL vitamin E oil should be a light golden color and smooth like oil (hence the name!). This stuff is only synthetic and bad for your skin, it will do the opposite and actually age your skin! Please do your research and do not buy this nasty stuff. Try buying an oil with A, D C and e. Best combination in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This appears to give the most IUs for the dollar. It improves the health of my lips and a corner of my mouth. The lips were chapped and the corner cracked from dry mouth of unknown origin, other than the catch-all, &amp;#34;age.&amp;#34; The product has a high viscosity, which is good. It flows slowly so that the the amount is controllable with little waste. The container is attractive—glass, not plastic. The product is tasteless, neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> product is fine, super sticky, impossible to spread.  If you want to use this as an extremely limited/targeted spot treatment it will be fine.  I was hoping for a liquid that resembled more like oil.</li>
            <li> Looooove it. Purchase for my mom, sister and myself; just to help prevent crow&#x27;s-feet. We love it. Especially the thickness of the serum.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my facial masks! Nice sturdy glass bottle and it&#x27;s also fairly thick but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Seems like a quality product. Like the fact there are no filler oils in it. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This isnt real 100% vitamin E oil. Its Super thick and sticky. Real 100% vitamin E oil is amber in color. With that being said it still did get the job done. So I am keeping it but probably wont buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this and it is a great value. I received this quickly in the mail.  I will defiantly order again.&lt;br /&gt;Mrs. Red Martin</li>
            <li> Very thick. But 100% vitamin e&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Thick, rich creamy. Using it on scars &amp; stretch marks &amp; by my eyes at night.&lt;br /&gt;Smoothies everything right out.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Exactly like opening a capsule, without the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I found this to be as advertised and shipping was prompt.  This is a great product</li>
            <li> Very good oil. Really thick and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about the product and was about to remove it from my shopping cart but I decided to buy it anyways. I will say that the consistency of the oil is that of a gel, not very tough to get out of the bottle like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I made my own moisturizer using Shea butter, coconut oil and vitamin e oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot complain at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put in a shampoo I was making for my furbaby. This is great!</li>
            <li> this did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I will definitely be repurchasing this. There is a reason it is a number 1 seller. GET IT! Lasts forever....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused.  I have purchased pure vitamin e oil in the past and it has never been this sticky and thick.  This seems to be the real deal so I&#x27;m wondering if I was fooled before when purchasing from a different company.  I will have to do further research and maybe mix it with another oil for easier use.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good for skin care! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I got the product I was shocked at how small it was, but I should have paid more attention it says clearly 1OZ.  You don&#x27;t need much anyways as this is PURE vitamin e which is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s a little thick but has no scent and the bottle is glass. But thick glass incase u drop it.</li>
            <li> Quite viscous, you&#x27;ve got to nurse it out of the small vial it comes in. Seems effective, I&#x27;ve been putting it on a patch of skin that needs attention. Smells nice. I like to mix it with a drop or two of tea tree oil from Plantlife.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had a very dark scar and within about 2-3weeks it had faded significantly. While there is still a light discoloration..but nothing like it was before. Also, this stuff is thick..you do not need a lot. I used it everyday ine the morning and at night for 2-3weeks.</li>
            <li> I use this on my lips and it is a lot easier than cutting open tiny pills. Works great, much better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> cococare 100% Vitamin E oil.. This is some very good oil. it is thick but if you don&#x27;t tilt the bottle up all the way you won&#x27;t have any problem getting the oil out. use it all the titme. last a long time/</li>
            <li> Good product and good service.</li>
            <li> Seeing improvement in scars after a couple weeks!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to say about this except, IT WORKS! I love it! Thanks Cococare &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Thick and absolutely wonderful for the lips!! Esp for this incoming brutal and ash inducing winter !</li>
            <li> Mix it with my natural products and homemade lotions! Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great !! I use it for a recent skin cancer removal area!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin tone and scar very easily.  I have tried numerous products, including Bio-Oil, cocoa butter, mederma, etc., but nothing works as well as vitamin E oil.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have added ingredients.  It is a thicker consistency (and a little sticky), but rubs in well and lasts on the skin.</li>
            <li> I just started back using Vit E because I had scalp issues and it is WONDERFUL.  I used to use it years ago and just started back using it again.  It was worth it to order on-line for the same price S &amp; H included and it was bigger.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> This product tackles dryness with a vengence without a cloying fragrance or other ingredients to dilute it .. I believe a different cap would be more beneficial to squirt drops of this wonderful product</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, very thick.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a recipe I found for making chapstick with EOs and I love it so far. I would recommend this product. Vitamin E has a lot of good benefits to your health (I don&#x27;t really know if with how much is in the chapstick will really help, but it can&#x27;t hurt!) and I&#x27;ve read it can help in prevention/repair for sunburns! A little bit of this oil goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Best thing I could&#x27;ve ever brought for my face, my face would break out often and this was the only thing that cleared it up. Get compliments all the time now on hoe great my skin looks. It is very thick but I just put it on a Make up pad and it works fine</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have to say I do not like this product because it leaves a sticky residue on my skin.  I had to throw it out.  Will purchase 100% coconut oil.  My beautician applied the coconut oil she uses at her salon and my skin absorbed all that she applied.  Will never purchase your product again.</li>
            <li> This product is thick!  It does absorb into your skin but takes hours.  Use a little to go a long way.  It does not seam to help me much with my skin issues (very dry skin) but does help make my skin feel a little softer so it was not a waste so I can&#x27;t fault the product for my horrible skin issues as almost nothing has works.</li>
            <li> Crows feet  -- after having tried a handful of products to no avail, I tried this. Its been 4-5 days and i LOVE it. I dont know if its the &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34; of the product or bc its vitamin e ..watever it is .. it works and lightens the appearance of lines around the eyes... i started to use it on my brow and laugh lines too...</li>
            <li> Very thick but surprisingly not greasy oil.  I mix a little of this with argan oil and use on my face, neck, hands, and hair. My skin feels smooth and toned.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> I would buy again, but it&#x27;s d*** hard to get it out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> Very thick, almost gel like.....seems pretty good and time will tell if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I work with the purest form of vitamin E in a research lab everyday. This product is decent. Vitamin E isn&#x27;t yellow like most people think. My only issue is the container. Pure vitamin E is extremely light sensitive and should be stored in amber bottles. It is a natural preservative, but does not inhibit self degradation. Keep it dark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick oil... will not &amp;#34;drip&amp;#34; well (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re expecting). Nothing bad to say about it though.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet because im a little concerned as to whether or not this product is the real deal. Everyone here is saying to &amp;#34;Beware! It&#x27;s very thick&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Not in my case. It&#x27;s not as solid as I expected it to be. It comes out nicely. The bubble moves around quite fast. I have no trouble getting it out as most people here claim. Should I be concerned?</li>
            <li> Good on skin and hair</li>
            <li> purchased this vitamin e oil for my itchy stomach while being pregnant and it is great! it really does help and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Using this to make own cocoa butter lotion. Is scentless and  mixes in great</li>
            <li> great product works very well in my products!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 2 days and it has made my face softer. I only use it at night before bed as it is sticky and I&#x27;m not sure I can wear it under my makeup. I&#x27;m hoping it will remove acne scars on my face so we&#x27;ll see in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and quality. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Item just as described and I love using it in my lotion bars.</li>
            <li> No problems with delivery, exactly as was described and it&#x27;s very high quality. Look, it&#x27;s vitamin E and it&#x27;s very, very thick and tacky in pure form. It&#x27;s not as nice to put on as other moisturizers. I would recommend dabbing it generously onto clean hands, rubbing palms together quickly to create warmth and then spreading it on your freshly cleansed skin/face/hands/nails (wherever you want it). I make sure I&#x27;m not sweating or it won&#x27;t work. I also don&#x27;t attempt to put it on when I&#x27;m in a rush. I&#x27;ll lie down and work it into the skin on my face with a massaging motion; this is a good bed-time regimen. The Russian and Jewish ladies in my neighborhood swear by vitamin E on the face 2x/day and their skin looks amazing! So I tolerate the difficulty getting it out of the bottle. Beauty is supposed to be painful anyway, right? :)</li>
            <li> Received when stated &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Excellent packing. No spills. Great quality Vitamin E!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It seems to work well in my homemade products. It is very thick, though, and comes out of the bottle very slowly. It is a VERY SMALL Container - I wish they sold a little larger of a bottle. In the future, I&#x27;d like to see a darkened bottle only because I feel as if a dark bottle preserves contents better.</li>
            <li> It is an ingredient I will use to make Christmas gifts with. It will be good to have, I can use on several gifts.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, and as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not greasy or messy when I pour the oil out.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheap to buy a lot of this stuff. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got the order as expected although, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so thick.  It is hard to rub on the surgery area.  I am sure as the sensitivity lessens, I will use this product but until then.....</li>
            <li> Thicker than other brands of vitamin E oil but Im sure it works just as effectively.  It is a bit sticky when I first apply it.</li>
            <li> Bring this overseas (Eastern Europe) often and always asked for more.</li>
            <li> This is the only Vitamin E Oil I have found that is this thick....most of them are a lot thinner and some have a yucky smell to them. I love it for dry spots or sore areas.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering Cococare 100% Vitamin E Oil, and I&#x27;ve got to tell you its not what I expected. When it was delivered to my house along with my other orders I was so excited until I opened it. The bottle is cute and small I liked that but when I took the lid off and tried to pour out the liquids inside it wouldn&#x27;t come out..I tried again and it did but the oil wasn&#x27;t thin like baby oil it was thick and sticky almost like the Generic Brand of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Serum that I bought from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Store except this is really sticky like syrup. The product works fine and that&#x27;s all that matters I guess. I apply this under my eyes after doing my Fenugreek mask I learned from FarahDhukai on youtube. The only con is how sticky it feels on the hands I usually have to wipe my hands down with a towel but, other than that it works good. I do recommend this product its good for wrinkles under eyes but, if you do use this product use a little bit at a time. The pro is it has a light scent and its small so you can carry it in your purse when you go out or even a jacket pocket. :)</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin E Oil I have purchased thus far, absorbs quickly and no smell, so it mixes well with other oils and essential oils</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at the suggestion of my surgeon for my knee replacement scar. I see improvement to date.&lt;br /&gt;But I have only been using for approx 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Three stars because the product does not specify that this is indeed the synthetic version of Vitamin E oil, di-alpha tocopherol acetate.  That being said I have had no irritation from it and I think the synthetic form is in most beauty products since it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product at a local drugstore in the smaller, .5 oz size and nearly paid as much ($6.99) as Amazon charges for the 1 oz. size.  Consumers should know it&#x27;s VERY thick and concentrated,if you turn the bottle upside down, it may take a couple of minutes for 2-3 drops to flow out.  (There are ways around this though -- you can create a makeshift applicator and dip it in.)  The product itself is wonderful for any type of skin abrasion or discoloration and it softens wrinkles as well as many of the premium products I&#x27;ve tried.  As for lighter-textured Vit. E creams that claim to have similar amounts of Vit. E. Units -- I&#x27;ve tried several and they don&#x27;t address any of the skin problems that Cococare Vit. E. Oil does.  They were similar to Jergens or Basic Vaseline lotion, only more expensive.  Thumbs up on this one!</li>
            <li> I have to get a Q-Tip to insert in and get the product. It is a good quality product though.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I love it.  It is just what I was looking for.  I am likely to order it again and tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Great for preserving herbal oil, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product. Would have returned it if allowed. There was no seal on the bottle when I received it, which makes me very uncomfortable using it and even when I did put a small dab in my palm it isn&#x27;t usable anyways. Extremely thick and sticky and doesn&#x27;t mix well with a carrier oil. Do Not Buy!</li>
            <li> A lot of vitamin E oil at a good price.  I add it to soaps to extend the shelf life; it seems to work well.  The end.</li>
            <li> Awesome E oil. I put it anywhere I need some deep healing and repair at night. I put it around my eyes and within days people are saying I look way younger than I am (I&#x27;m 34)....and my dermatologist told me that, btw. I look younger, skin is perfect shade like I have make-up on, even though I had some horrible night&#x27;s sleep several days in a row...I would usually have dark circles under my eyes because of that.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the Vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this Vitamin E Oil to my acne scars every night after moisturizing for a couple months now, and I have definitely noticed fading of my scars. I will continue to use this for a while, and I definitely reccomend it to anyone dealing with slight to severe acne scarring. It&#x27;s not an overnight process, but it definitely has been working! A little bit goes a long way with this, so one little bottle should last you a good while! Just keep up with it applying once or twice a day, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> the texture and thickness definitely bothers me, but no other complains.</li>
            <li> Thick oil that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> great product for softening healing medicinally</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt; Purchase this oil and it feels good the quality is very good, thick, I can put it on my hairline and the difference is awesome, then on the soles of my feet, excellent for moisturizing the entire body,</li>
            <li> The reason why this product did not get all five stars is because of the texture of the vitamin E oil and the fact that it came in a glass bottle. It&#x27;s very sticky and thick and it does spread on your face very well like a Normal oil is suppose to, and it being inside of a glass bottles doesn&#x27;t make it very easy for it to come out. Other than that it has been ok I just bought it three days ago and now I&#x27;m just waiting to see the results!</li>
            <li> came as expected and was good quality</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. Product came as described.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick. A little goes a long way though</li>
            <li> Great pure vitamin e oil. I use it for my sensitive eye area. My dark circles are fading and so are fine lines.</li>
            <li> Just bought it a couple days ago and received it says earlier. The consistency is very thick and hard to spread, but otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I received the oil sooner than I expected.  I noticed some people complained that they could not get it out of the bottle, I had no problem. You can&#x27;t just turn it upside down.  It is very thick so you have to work with the air bubble</li>
            <li> This is truly 100% vitamin e oil and it works well balancing out skin imperfections. Only issue is the packaging...the texture is really thick so it&#x27;s a bit tricky getting it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to help with fading a few dark marks. The results were so amazing, I had to leave a comment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, as everyone has already said, this oil is THICK (think honey in the wintertime). It doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easily, but that&#x27;s OK- it&#x27;s pure and once it&#x27;s applied, it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell, but it does have a bit of a &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; texture when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night, I applied it to dark spots on my face, as well as my deepening nasolabial folds, the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; that I get when I furrow my brows, and the forehead lines that continue to get worse with time. I also applied it to my delicate eye area, focusing on the area under the eye as well as the area where laugh lines develop. I cleanse my face with Ghanaian black soap, so I like how the oil keeps my skin from feeling too dry and stripped. The immediate effects were softer skin with more moisture, and less need for moisturizer during the day (my skin is combination/oily, and the oily patches felt greasy but not moisturized at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within one week, each facial line was noticeably less pronounced! The fading hasn&#x27;t happened quite yet, but I will repurchase, based on how much more youthful my skin appears. I saw an enormous difference, and even my mother noticed that my face looked fresher and smoother. The nasolabial folds saw the best results: this has seemed to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; those lines a lot. The fact that my skin feels so much softer, even after removing the product, was a huge selling point for me. For full disclosure, I applied this oil on top of an acne treatment location by AcneFree, mixed with a pea-sized amount of Amlactin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it can be mixed with other natural products. I will be adding it to my coconut oil and shea butter to make an allover smoothing/fading cream. I LOVE this product! I will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> I received this product accidentally, I ordered cococare coconut oil, received this instead. Seller offered to send me the proper product and a free shipping label to return this oil; however i decided to keep it and try it out on my Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference by morning. I Will have to add this product to my regular skincare regiment.</li>
            <li> Pure Vitamin E Oil - can&#x27;t get any better than this!! I bought this to use in my sunscreen recipe. It comes out thick and slow, so once you get to the bottom of the jar, you have to tip it for a while. I&amp;#34;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got what I expected so I&#x27;m happy with this product. There are lots of choices so, shop around for the best price and quality.</li>
            <li> Great product. I added this to shea butter to make my own body butter and the condition of the product was top notch.</li>
            <li> Very very thick.....it&#x27;s pure and I love it but so thick I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it. It doesn&#x27;t move on your face, it&#x27;s so thick! I mixed it with one of my serums and that helped. I would recommend mixing it with aloe Vera but it dries your face out if used every day (it did mine anyways). This would be good for crows feet or just a spot treatment, not all over.&lt;br /&gt;Great product but if your looking for something that spreads this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size. I guess I did not pay close attention to the ounce measure. Nevertheless I have purchased two more bottles because of the great results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 months and LOVE it.  It works ask well as when I bust open vit e capsules but is a better price.  I&#x27;ve added it to hand creams, applied it to nails directly, my sons chapped face and even my chapped lips.  If you need Vit E this is a high quality product.  my mom loved it too and I got one for her.</li>
            <li> Wanted a quality oil in a travel size. This is it. Great size and oil feels great. Bottle is sturdy</li>
            <li> I do agree that a squeeze bottle would be better, but it doesn&#x27;t take away from the efficiency of the actual product. Love it. I apply a dab directly to underneath my eyes or mix a spot of it in with my night cream and put it all over my face.</li>
            <li> This was a second purchase of this product from this same seller. Love the product, great service!</li>
            <li> Love product and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great product &amp; the shipping was right on time. I got it for my brother. Due to his OCD his hands are really bad.</li>
            <li> I used the Cococare vitamin e oil in my mixture when I created my own shea butter and coconut oil moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, but it&#x27;s great for your hair, scars, etc. My daughter has type 4c hair and its usually dry, so it helps moisturize her scalp and advances hair growth, in combination with a few other products. It makes her hair happy. It was also packaged properly. I will probably purchase from this seller again. Make your own hair care products that contain vitamin e oil and save money! Watch my tutorial. DIY: How to Make Shea Butter Coconut Oil Moisturizer: http://youtu.be/1FgExPr8zc0 Natural hair rocks! :-)</li>
            <li> This product works great for people with dry skin or eczema. My daughter has eczema and eucerin works well but my mother/babysitter would not use Eucerin because, as she puts it, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s an adult lotion&amp;#34;! My baby would break out in rashes by the time she returns home a couple days later. I ask my mom to stop using all baby lotions and later having to confiscate the bottles she had, and now when I send her to grandma&#x27;s I put mineral oil and vitamin E oil mixed in a bottle and sent it for her to use. No rash issues since. Go figure she willing to use oil but not Eucerin lotion. So when the baby is home I still use Eucerin and at grandma&#x27;s she gets oiled. i did have to use a baby&#x27;s medicine syringe to get the oil out of the vitamin E bottle because it is extremely too thick. I&amp;#34;ve even used it my self after a facial where I sat the entire vitamin E bottle in hot water during my facial and use a little on my face after I was done. I recommend this to people of all ages with dry skin especially if you have been through a rough winter like we have!!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased and happy i got this vitamin e oil. it is easy to use and even though comes in a glass bottle i love everything about it.</li>
            <li> Good for hair mask with combination of castor oil or simple olive oil, egg whites and lemon squeeze. Perfect for dry hair season esp this freezing winter!</li>
            <li> This is a very thick oil that stays on quite well.&lt;br /&gt;I used it after a knee replacement surgery and only needed one bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a TINY jar and it&#x27;s a PAIN to get out. I have to shove the end of my makeup wand and pull it out. it&#x27;s SO thick</li>
            <li> My new &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; moisturizer recipe calls for Almond Oil, Aloe Vera Gel, beeswax and Vitamin E oil. The recipe is perfect and this Vitamin E oil works well. My skin is responding well to the moisturizer without a oil breakout reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, so it&#x27;s not easy to apply it pure on skin. To make it easier, I put two or three drops on my palm and mix with a bit of my body cream.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It worked after only one week of nightly applications on my skin.  Nothing else has!</li>
            <li> Good quality item and the seller shipped asap.</li>
            <li> Goopy and super thick. Hard to apply to skin even after warming it between my fingers.</li>
            <li> i received vitamin e oil two days ago and it seems to be a good product.  i am eighty and have a few skin problems that i hope will improve with use.  am hoping my wrinkles will disappear!!!!!!! not likely.  i have noticed that the oil is very slow to drain from the bottle and suspect that when i am down to the end much oil will be left in bottle which will be such a waste - maybe different style container?</li>
            <li> This Vit E oil was just what I expected! I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> Finally this is a vitamin E oil that is not diluted in a carrier oil like soybean or olive oil, which just ruins the purpose of vitamin E oil. Highly recommended. Just be advised that this is very thick.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price and excellent service! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> While this oil IS very thick and sticky, I mix it with Coconut oil to use for my face and hair.  It works greats!</li>
            <li> I use this at night only because it&#x27;s thick but it;s great for dry skin although it takes a while to really sink in.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil because it is actually pure vitamin E oil, that&#x27;s the only ingredient, no fillers.  I am using it as a preservative for homemade beauty products such as shampoo and hair gel.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it on my eyelash, and it helps my eyelash growing longer than before. I will recommend it</li>
            <li> I wear this product everyday on my face and on a big scar on my arm, which is diminishing slowly but surely! My face also looks smoother and I have not had any pimples since using this product. Only thing that I notice is that the price has gone up.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  Item as described.  Works well for the defined purpose.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery, nice product</li>
            <li> this is a great vitamin after taking this I cant describe to you how well I felt. Vitamin E is a very important vitamin that your body needs every single day</li>
            <li> I apply a little bit all over my face before going to sleep. All I have to say is try it for yourself. Im definitely going to purchase another one!</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is to thick.  I can&#x27;t apply it to my face it is to tacky and it doesn&#x27;t absorb like I thought it would.  I guess I need to purchase this oil in the 400 iu  in order to be able to apply it and maybe it will absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find 100% Vitamin E oil anywhere else. I like to put it on my face after I shower. It&#x27;s sticky like honey, but once it dries my face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> arrived on time. very small bottle. The product is very nice but the bottle is what made me give it three star rating. it&#x27;s hard to get out! different application would be nice.</li>
            <li> This is pure vitamin e oil, although it is a GMO, otherwise this would be a 5 star product. I have very dry, very sensitive skin and while this feels at first like you are putting honey on your face it does absorb quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft. I have been putting it on old acne scars and after 2 weeks I can see a noticeable difference. I also use a mascara wand to put it on my lashes and it makes my lashes look great, in fact I&#x27;ve started using it (very sparingly, a little goes a long way) as a replacement for my mascara and my lashes look longer and fuller already. At night I&#x27;ll use it around my nose and I don&#x27;t even rub it in because my skin there is so dry. I just slather it on to keep my skin moisturized and it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs or burning sensations as other moisturizers have, even all natural ones! I was using it on my lips too but stopped as it isn&#x27;t a pleasant taste if it gets in your mouth. All in all, it is a very thick oil when first applied but doesn&#x27;t feel oily or cause breakouts (for me, and my skin is very finicky) and absorbs very nicely leaving skin feeling soft and hydrated. It acts as great lubricant for dry sensitive skin and does a good job of lightening old scars without harsh chemicals. A very good buy and for those of you that aren&#x27;t concerned about gmo&#x27;s I would recommend. It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a vitamin E oil that contains nothing but Tocopheryl Acetate, aka vitamin E. Most others I&#x27;ve found contain lots of fillers. Lastly, as others have mentioned the opening is very small and a dropper would not fit inside although I think this oil would be too thick for a dropper anyhow. I usually apply it with a q-tip (or mascara wand) or just simply pour a little out into my palm. If you&#x27;re looking for straight vitamin E to use by itself or to make your own products with you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipment. It is hard to find good quality vitamin e oil. I am very happy with my purchase and will be buying again. I am using it in my breast aug scars and am already seeing quick healing. I use it twice day day and only need a small amount each time.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and taking a stab at preventing some lovely marks! What it truly great is it does not stick and I feel as though my body is sucking it right up. At least I am taking great care of my skin in the mean-time, can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> THE SOLUTION FOR MAY NAILS</li>
            <li> I use a lot of oils and this is by far the best and the one I use the most.  The price is right.  The product is easy to use and last a while.  I use this oil in so many products such daily skin care and homemade hair products.</li>
            <li> Finally!! I&#x27;ve found a vitamin E oil that doesn&#x27;t have ANY filler compounds, additional carrier oils (especially SOY oils) or added chemicals and I am so pleased with this Cococare product!! Are ya ready for the loooong list of ingredients for this oil?!? Here it is....Tocopheryl Acetate. THAT&#x27;S IT..DONE..FINITO!  However....Here&#x27;s the one thing that bothers me about this product,....everything I&#x27;ve read &amp; researched about \\&quot;pure\\&quot; vitamin E oil states that in it&#x27;s purest form, it has a \\&quot;yellow-ish\\&quot; color. The more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; it is...the more of a yellow color it&#x27;s supposed to have. This Cococare oil is CLEAR, yet VERY thick and sticky-tacky (as it&#x27;s also supposed to be in it&#x27;s purest form) and the ingredients list states ONLY Tocopheryl Acetate (vitamin E) is in this bottle. So I&#x27;m not absolutely certain that this isn&#x27;t a synthetic vitamin E oil, based on the color. Whether it&#x27;s synthetic or not has no bearing on it&#x27;s effectiveness,though...because it works! I won&#x27;t go in to allll the many uses of vitamin E oil...the other reviews have pretty well covered most of them, but..............Smoother skin...yep!~~~ Improvement for fine lines...yep!~~~Improvement for stretch-marks...I don&#x27;t have a single one , so I can&#x27;t testify to that one.~~~Fading of sun/age spots...still waiting for full results but looking VERY promising!~~~Fading scaring...I haven&#x27;t used this oil on any of my scars because each of those scars has a special memory attached to it and I plan to die with &#x27;em just as they are. However...this oil works danged well at helping to heal recent wounds rather quickly and hardly any scaring left behind at all!!!  All in all...this is the BEST \\&quot;pure\\&quot; vitamin E oil that I&#x27;ve found so far and I have both read MANY ingredients labels in-store(s) and purchased dozens online... in my never-ending search for  \\&quot;pure\\&quot; oils. BTW...I purchased from \\&quot;Ameritex Linen\\&quot; and they are an outstanding seller! My package had a tracking number, arrived early, was VERY well wrapped &amp; protected for transit and they also included a note on my invoice asking that if I had any problems or was dis-satisfied with my purchase in any way...to please inform them right away so that they could ensure my satisfaction with their service/product immediately. I absolutely LOVE merchants that care so much about customer service after they&#x27;ve already taken your money...so very rare to find nowadays!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Little hard to get out but not a huge issue. I use it with my eyelash serum and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have had this a while now and I am not really happy with it...  It is so thick and sticky you can&#x27;t really use it alone... I put it on a q-tip and then on my face but then use coconut oil over it so that I can rub it in.  Not really what I wanted.  It does say 100% vitamin E, tocopheryl acetate and not the dl-alpha (synthetic) as other say. But that&#x27;s about the only thing that is good about it.</li>
            <li> It works really well on stretch marks. I could really see the difference after using it for a week. Strech marks got really light. Not permanently gone but lighten and less visible. I also used it on some scars but I don&#x27;t think it worked on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this! It is sticky and think but what I do is I mix it with a honey face lotion I use and works fantastic! I have noticed a good deal of improvement on my skin on my face.</li>
            <li> My wife did not get any stretch mark in her entire pregnancy , only because of this product...</li>
            <li> Item is just as expected. Pure vitamin e oil. It is very thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on relatively new stretch marks. I&#x27;ve been using a few drops 2x per day on the marks for about 2 weeks and they&#x27;ve already gotten noticeably lighter in color!! It is thick stuff, so I put Pure Emu Oil on the area right after I put the Vitamin E Oil on the marks to make sure it spreads nicely. Definitely going to be buying more when I need!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick , but I like the consistency. &amp; I really love the shape &amp; size of the bottle it&#x27;s so cute!</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great packaging and fast fast shipment. I purchased the oil to mix with other oils to make a hair, scalp, and body oil. It works great.</li>
            <li> I would order this again.  It&#x27;s thick and wonderful, in my salves.  Dolores</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Just started using this nightly so no idea if it will work on stretch marks yet but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great service</li>
            <li> I thought the size of the bottle, could&#x27;ve been bigger. Other than that, its great for hair strength,</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is more of a blob of sticky substance, not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> great packaging. even though i know it says it&#x27;s one ounce...it is really a small bottle. but it is so thick that you should not finish it quickly. i used like 25-30 drops and it doesn&#x27;t even look like i have touched it.</li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scar on my chest and this GREATLY reduced the appearance of it. I&#x27;m continuing to use it and put it on many things. It&#x27;s veerrrrrryyyyyyyy thick though which might not work for some people but didn&#x27;t bother me. You only need small amounts so it has lasted me a very long time already</li>
            <li> I am using this for stretch marks I&#x27;ve seen it work on scars so hopefully this works</li>
            <li> High quality vitamin oil. I have dry hands and I have been using it before I go to bed. So far so good! The cap is small so it is easy to control how much I need each time. I also use it to massage my cuticles. I believe it helps my nails grow as well. :)</li>
            <li> My only set back is the glass bottle. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever purchased vitamin E oil, so I&#x27;m not sure if it comes in a glass bottle with other brands also. Being winter, my package was out in the cold, so this oil was extremely thick and the glass bottle prevented me from getting any oil out until it had warmed up. Other than that, it seems to be a great addition to the lip balm I used it in.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping which is a plus however the bottle is small and i like the fact that it&#x27;s thick instead of being runny but it&#x27;s so hard to get of the bottle. I have to beat the bottle into my hands before I can get it out. Anyway I do like how it make my skin feel</li>
            <li> Great product.  At least a couple of years worth</li>
            <li> This was a very effective oil for treating and lightening old scars. It doesn&#x27;t completely erase the scars, but it does make them less obvious. I have one that runs along the length of my cheek and this did a good job of lightening it.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what was pictured,  shipping was very timely. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I do like the 100% Vitamin E Oil Very Much.  It is VERY THICK. The only thing is I wish it had a different cap on it  - or a bottle that you could just squeeze a little out.  It is a glass bottle with a small opening and regular screw top and I stick like a small plastic stick to get some out to use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a GREAT product.&lt;br /&gt;And it was SHIPPED quickly and I received it fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for faster healing and minimizing scarring.  Far easier than poking Vit E Oil capsules with a pin.</li>
            <li> This is very thick in form but it works well. I mix it with another oil to not make it so thick.</li>
            <li> very thick but after awhile it seems to be less sticky</li>
            <li> This has a horrible smell. I bought this for my hair and it stinks. I can&#x27;t walk around with this is my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for making various home remedies and am very happy with the product.  There is a relatively small amount of oil in the bottle but it is VERY thick, to the point of being almost sticky, when you use it undiluted.  I mix it with coconut oil for hair masks and with tea tree oil and water as a soothing scalp spray.  I have made a few batches and I am not even down to half a bottle because a little bit goes a really long way.  I have a couple of scars from a surgery last year that I am trying to fade, and I have to mix this stuff up for it to even spread out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price vs. quality/value, this is a really good product and I would highly recommend to anybody who is looking for good Vit E oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used this for multiple skin care needs. It&#x27;s great! Just remember to wash your hands after using it because it can stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Excellent source of concentrated vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  We are using it for a scar on a child&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my neck and chest area. Leaves my skin soft and healthy. I love. It&#x27;s thick, so don&#x27;t use too much. Comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> just a drop, seems to last forever</li>
            <li> It works wonders, I even got my family using it! Thick consistency but it soaks into skin and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy.</li>
            <li> Got it on time. Just what I wanted. Could ask for more.</li>
            <li> This is slowly but surely helping some of my scars fade. Be forewarned that it is very gooey. It&#x27;s definitely something you&#x27;ll want to wear while sleeping because it&#x27;s very obvious when it&#x27;s on your skin. I&#x27;ve recently been putting it under my eyes at bedtime to see if it will help with my undereye circles (I&#x27;m only 24 and I look like a raccoon). Hopefully it will make a difference. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was hoping for--upon my doctor&#x27;s recommendation, I amusing Vit E oil to assist with post-surgical scar healing.  This is so much easier to use than breaking Vit E capsules open!!  The little glass bottle that this comes in also reminds me of old-world perfume bottles--I&#x27;ll probably re-use it after I&#x27;ve used the oil.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After years of swimming, floating rivers, snorkeling and playing in oceans and hiking mountain trails without a hat I now get little sores on the top of my head if I even expose it for a bit to the sun.  I hate hats. My curly hair is fine and thinning.  I put a little dab of your Vitamin E oil on them and they heal right away. I use to pierce the caps and sometimes my finger.</li>
            <li> Super thick and moisturizing.  A little goes a long way.  I cleaned out a mascara brush/tube and use this as eyelash conditioner- it really helps grow lashes thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I usually purchase vitamin E oil from CVS, but this stuff is a lot less sticky and the opening is smaller than on the CVS bottle so I don&#x27;t spill every where!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother and my dark spots (from acne) are disappearing. I use topical acne medications which are VERY drying and I put this oil on after applying the creams (and letting it dry first) and this is keeping me from completely peeling and looking like a reptile.</li>
            <li> I massage my incision everyday. It looks better. will see what will happen.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week, but it already has impressed me.  I have newly diagnosed autoimmune disorders and the acne on my face all these years, is really ulcers (blisters) from sun exposure.  They take forever to heal and leave scars. We&#x27;ll I had a bad breakout and based on the reviews, I purchased this product.  My entire face is cleared up and barely a mark has been left to be seen.  I am shocked it heals so quickly. It is goopy, as described in other reviews, so don&#x27;t use your good pillowcases.  I used it very generously and glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for almost one week and i can see the diff on my acne scars . They getting lighter and lighter ..</li>
            <li> Very very rich and lovely for all of your needs</li>
            <li> I would be happy with the product but when i received my package not only had my product been opened, but someone done spilt it all over the box. I would post pictures if i could. Not all too happy about sticky fingers but i guess the product itself is okay.</li>
            <li> Really thick and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> Yay!! Vitamin E Oil thats purely Vit E only!&lt;br /&gt;VERY VERY thick.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful quality.</li>
            <li> thought this was going to perhaps have a better texture than regular Vit E oil but its just as thick and sticky, not my favorite</li>
            <li> Smelled nice.  Arrived quickly.  Very happy with product so far.</li>
            <li> Oil meets expectations and is reasonably priced. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product was given to me for use on my daughters hair. I put it up and forgot about it until I ran across it looking for something to cure my dry cuticles. In January I started applying it on my nails every time I washed my hands at work. I had worn acrylic nails for years and decided to take them off last April. I tried several products to grow/harden my nails with Sally Hansen Hard as Nails being the only one that came close to making that happen. Well after a month of using the Vitamin E Oil my nails are hard and have grown and have never looked this great. I highly recommend this to anyone taking off acrylics or just in need to strengthen their nails.</li>
            <li> Did not work as described it would</li>
            <li> i keep ordering it..so what does that tell you...great for homemade concoctions</li>
