            <li> This is a good product but too difficult to use the sprayer.  </li>
            <li> I can spray it on dry hair and with a little gentle combing it too will work through my tangles.</li>
            <li> can definitely see it work for people with really dry and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to the dry oils.</li>
            <li> This version has a strange smell and actually seems to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be heavy, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has softened my dry, damaged, color-treated ends.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does not work like I expected makes my hair look grease.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> There are other products that don&#x27;t hurt my hands.  </li>
            <li> this smells just a hint like it may have gone sour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wee bit heavy use very&lt;</li>
            <li> but i cant get past the smell.</li>
            <li> it was a bit terrifying since this stuff is really thick,I was worried it would make my hair look and feel greasy,yet,it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like almond oil or something, but faint.</li>
            <li> but I was so disappointed in this version.</li>

            <li> Great product from a great seller.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but too difficult to use the sprayer.  There are other products that don&#x27;t hurt my hands.  I wish they would improve their pump functionality.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on fly away hair and adds shine.</li>
            <li> this smells just a hint like it may have gone sour. it works but i cant get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;It has softened my dry, damaged, color-treated ends.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair feel a lot softer, but not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It is a thicker leave in spray. I thought it would be heavy, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a scent, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. It&#x27;s like almond oil or something, but faint.</li>
            <li> I have the oil which smells really nice, however this product does not. It also left a residue in my hair which resulted in product build-up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! After washing my hair I can spray it on and comb through without any tangles, which I normally have.  I can spray it on dry hair and with a little gentle combing it too will work through my tangles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does not work like I expected makes my hair look grease.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> Loved it... Wee bit heavy use very&lt;br /&gt;sparingly....warm in hands .. Then&lt;br /&gt;rub on... ends especially nice for use on</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this. I use it on my kids hair every morning to make their hair nice and neat. Smells great and I feel the conditioner works well. Especially during the summer when we are at the pool often.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to hydrate my hair and give it some natural shine. This product does the job! Great product for naturally curly hair and African-American hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great detangler, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have just sprayed it on my hair for the 1st time. it was a bit terrifying since this stuff is really thick,I was worried it would make my hair look and feel greasy,yet,it didn&#x27;t,it passed the touch test well.&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have oily hair that tend to tangle up. my hairstylist recommended to start using a conditioner to make it stronger. also,I am trying to grow my hair out,I have heard that a good moisturizing helps and I ordered this spray,shampoo and conditioner from this line since they seem to be rich. hope it makes my hair healthier,so it can grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see it work for people with really dry and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have curly hair and it works great for a blow out or for just my curls</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s old.... Smells rancid !</li>
            <li> I am very picky about hair products always trying to find the best for my hair (fine, oily scalp, chemically treated/colored in need of repair, moisture, and volume). I have become semi loyal to Organix (as in I&#x27;m still always looking for better products but this is the only brand I&#x27;ve been a repeat customer of often for shampoo/conditioner). I love their argan products more than anything but I was so disappointed in this version. I&#x27;ll go back to the dry oils. This version has a strange smell and actually seems to dry my hair out. The silver lining is once I emptied the bottle, I put it to great use for homemade leave ins because of the nice, fine mist of the bottle nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try argan, try the blue bottle original versions and the dry oils (even the sprays) but I can&#x27;t recommend the yellow bottle or crème versions to anyone.</li>
            <li> Customers need to check on the ingredient Cyclotetrasiloxane.  http://www.annmariegianni.com/ingredient-watch-list-cyclotetrasiloxane-the-hair-conditioner-that-may-harm-our-waterways/  I wanted to like it but upon research it seems to be harmful, doing something to with activity with repeated use. .  Just FYI</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product! I love the clean and soothing smell of the mist! It makes my hair feel healthy, rich &amp; luxurious!  My only wish is that it came in the form of a body mist, lotion or perfume! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, this product has a very strong scent. Also, don&#x27;t use more than 3 pumps for medium length hair. Or it&#x27;s too much. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again.</li>
