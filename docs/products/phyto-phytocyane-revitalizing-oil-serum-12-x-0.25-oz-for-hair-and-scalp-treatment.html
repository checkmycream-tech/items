            <li>I never like phyto products , too $$$ when you can find something less and better.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white, 28 year old woman who noticed about a year ago that my fine, medium thickness hair was suddenly falling out much more than usual in the shower and thinning to the point where I could see my scalp when the light was directly overhead.</li>
            <li>Need to give it more time to work, I am not giving up yet, had a little results  </li>
            <li>And that is a big success.</li>

            <li> the packaging - glass vials are not very practical.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for the end of time as long as it continues to thicken my hair, cause less hair falling out, and help my hair to grow.&lt;br /&gt;However-</li>
            <li> So I decided to read other comments on items on here and read a lot about this one</li>
            <li> I take a shower every other day and use the treatment after each shower.</li>
            <li> This is ok for people that are not severe:(</li>
            <li> But, at least it&#x27;s helping it grow back.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not an instant fix, at least not for me, but about half way through the second package there was a dramatic difference in the amount of hair</li>
            <li> and I bought it with a little doubt.</li>

            <li> I am truly amazed, my hair is a thick little bundle now</li>
            <li> My hair had been thinning out for the past five years</li>
            <li> If you have coily or kinkier hair, try using a small spray bottle and part your hair, applying serum to the scalp after washing.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom, she complained about pieces of glass getting into her hair.</li>
            <li> Give it a try for at least six weeks</li>
            <li> I mean I cried every time I would see my hair all over the sink</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCTS. FAST SHIPPING. WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> This product has really helped to transform my hair from lackluster to healthy. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product, in combination with the shampoo, really actually works! As I mentioned in the shampoo review, I&#x27;m 23 and have to take heavy medication that induces hair loss and Phyto products actually stop sheds. These vials also made my hair grow back in some places (I ide them for 4 weeks at a time and take around 2 months breaks). The hair that grew back from the bald patches was thin and fuzzy (way better than nothing!!) and the hairs that I treated that were still there became super thick. I live and die by this line and without it, I would lose my most&lt;br /&gt;Valuable physical characteristic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man, but how different can the product actually be for women?  It did not work for me and is a massive waste of money.  As well, it&#x27;s quite time-consuming to apply correctly, so it&#x27;s also a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> Noticed hair growth with in 2 weeks. A LOT of hair growth. this is my second time using it. love this stuff</li>
            <li> I am on my third box now because I know it works. My hair was falling out for many months. It was everywhere. I could not brush my hair without picking up loose hair from the floor. My bathtub was always clogged. I have tried many products which are available on the market but they caused only more fall out, acne, dandruff, itchiness. This thing stopped my hair from falling out. And that is a big success. Now it looks like I might be growing baby hair. To all of you who do not believe in this product: You must be patient. If you have a massive hair loss it will take time to regrow your hair.</li>
            <li> liking the product but once you open the vial its a little difficult to use with the plastic cap on top doesn&#x27;t stay put and if not careful can leak everywhere</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product, I have been using it and honestly I am amazed. My hair had been thinning out for the past five years I have tried everything. I finally decided to wear it cut short so as not to cry every time I comb it and see hair falling out.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter told me about this product and I bought it with a little doubt. I started using it and taking the supplements and immediately my hair stopped falling out, a week after using it, I kept combing my hair expecting to see hair all over my sink but nothing. I am truly amazed, my hair is a thick little bundle now and I am still in shock. I mean I cried every time I would see my hair all over the sink and now I smile to see none. Now I have the option of letting it grow out or keep it short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What should I do? What should I do?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not finding it as useful as I experienced before.  But still observing. I will make another order in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of this wonderful product i realize my hair is now growing healthy and thick !!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing !</li>
            <li> Need to give it more time to work, I am not giving up yet, had a little results  May work better for someone else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;I want it now person,&amp;#34;  so I can&#x27;t give honest feedback.  My stylist says she doesn&#x27;t see a difference so what can I say.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in the last 3 months and I love it, lots of baby hair are constantly coming out , it adds a beautiful shine , my hair are stronger and with the revitalizing shampoo and the Elixir my hair looks better then ever . Very happy !!!</li>
            <li> It does work.  I am on my 3rd week and hair loss has stopped.  I have a lot of new hair re-growth and my scalp is not showing anymore.  I am also combining this product with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom, she complained about pieces of glass getting into her hair.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> Great hair product!  I never like phyto products , too $$$ when you can find something less and better.  But this one is pretty great!!! I recommended it to many.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  It really helps stop hair loss.  It makes your hair feel stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is good for my hair, and I&#x27;ve definitely seen new growth. I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because it hasn&#x27;t really kept my hair from falling out in large quantities. But, at least it&#x27;s helping it grow back.  I do wish they&#x27;d change the packaging - glass vials are not very practical.</li>
            <li> The moment i started using this serum, i can feel big difference in my hair,  it&#x27;s Awesome :)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent I have been using the vials as directed and have seen a reduction in the amount of hair that falls out every day.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It has greatly improved my hair and minimized the loss.  If you wash your hair daily you will have to use this very frequently.  The key is to keep it on your scalp.  If you wash your hair once a week or less frequently, you can use this only after washing because it will stay on your scalp if not washed off.  If you have straight hair just tilt your head back and drip on to your head from the top, letting the serum run down all over your scalp.  If you have coily or kinkier hair, try using a small spray bottle and part your hair, applying serum to the scalp after washing. One added benefit for me is that it has completely stopped dandruff that I have suffered for many years.  For this reason I will continue to use it.  Good luck with this product.  Give it a try for at least six weeks and you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product.. No improvement to my hair..</li>
            <li> This product works. It&#x27;s not an instant fix, at least not for me, but about half way through the second package there was a dramatic difference in the amount of hair fall that I experienced. I used 2 packages, applying 3X a week and my hair was dramatically thicker and fuller. I stopped using this product because of the cost and after about 3 months my hair starting falling out in clumps again. It&#x27;s expensive yes but totally worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li> I just had my second child at 30 and started to notice more and more hair falling out in the shower and wanted to stop it before it got worse. So I decided to read other comments on items on here and read a lot about this one so I got it. I take a shower every other day and use the treatment after each shower. I am now down to my last two bottles and I have really noticed a different in the amount of hair that is starting to grow back. All around my forehead the new hair growth is about an inch long and i am really happy about it,</li>
            <li> It is a little early to tell if the serum is helping with hair growth as I have only tried it about 3 times.  It does appear that the hairs at the front of my scalp are starting to come in longer.</li>
            <li> This is a good product make ur healthy not breaking up</li>
            <li> Does what it suppose to. Grow hair. Yes it does work, give it about a month to see a difference.</li>
            <li> The fact that the boyfriend comments on how much healthier my hair looks, and how there&#x27;s less hair hanging around the bedroom tells me that there must be something right with my new line of products from Phyto!! I&#x27;ve been using their products a little over a month, and positive changes have come along - not just hair loss but smooth and shiny as ever. I have mixed Latin/African American hair, and my only chemical is Brazilian keratin treatment every 3-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;Recently stopped using clip-on hair extensions and decided to go with my natural length so I looked into products to minimize hair loss (mine was mainly due to the daily extension use) - PHYTO has done the trick so far. Looking forward to more positive results - I guess it&#x27;s all about being consistent!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for fine thinning hair.  It helped stop my hair from falling out and brought thickness, luster, strength, and sheen to my hair.  When I run out of this product, my hair shows it immediately.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Yes it filled my expectations.  I&#x27;ve seen big results since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white, 28 year old woman who noticed about a year ago that my fine, medium thickness hair was suddenly falling out much more than usual in the shower and thinning to the point where I could see my scalp when the light was directly overhead. Verrrry scary. I moved to a large city around two years ago and thought it might be caused by stress. A visit to the doctor told me my vitamin D was slightly low, but thyroid and all other vitamins/hormones were normal.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 3 weeks now. I use a vial each time I wash my hair, which is 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;I felt a difference in my hair after the second use. My hair felt fuller at the roots and softer to the touch. I will continue to use this for the end of time as long as it continues to thicken my hair, cause less hair falling out, and help my hair to grow.&lt;br /&gt;However- I have been doing several things to thicken my hair and am unsure if just the Phytocyane is the solution. I&#x27;m listing them below in hopes that it will help people with similar plights. Best of luck, ladies!&lt;br /&gt;The following is the additional products I have used along with Phytocyane serum:&lt;br /&gt;a water softener, only wash my hair in soft water now (2-3 months)&lt;br /&gt;biotin (6 months)&lt;br /&gt;vitamin D3 (3-4 months)&lt;br /&gt;fish oil (2-3 months)&lt;br /&gt;Maxi-Hair vitamins (1 month)&lt;br /&gt;coal tar shampoo (1 month)&lt;br /&gt;nioxin shampoo (3 months)&lt;br /&gt;Jamaican black castor oil for hair mask (overnight once a week for around 2 months)</li>
            <li> Works really well. Makes hair look great especially the day of application</li>
            <li> This is ok for people that are not severe:(</li>
            <li> This item works really well, I&#x27;ve been using this for one year already. Item arrived quickly and was packaged well. Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a change in volume but was softer and silkier</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker . The damaged hair has. Egan to grow back. Only after four treatments. He really works.</li>
