    <ol>
            <li>I was impressed with delivery time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The price on AMAZON is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for summer.  </li>
            <li>This is the best smelling perfume ever!!</li>
            <li>and I thought they smelled absolutely delicious.  </li>
            <li>This product more than met my expectations!!!!  </li>
            <li>However the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>If you want a great coconut/vanilla perfume, try Island Bath and Body Coconut-Vanilla--lots of coconut in that one, and the scent lasts longer than this does.</li>
            <li>all excellent, I loved the product is genuine</li>
            <li>Came fast, packaging was perfect, got compliments, smells great.</li>
            <li>It smells great , a bit more vanilla</li>
            <li>smells lovely!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product and I am so glad I ordered 2 bottles!!!!</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments when I wore it that I gave some to friends and kept 3 for myself!</li>
            <li>This smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>But it does smell nice.</li>
            <li>so it has a warm tone.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a nice not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Nice, tropical scent.</li>
            <li>Not to overwhelming but nice coverage.</li>
            <li>More than one makes the smell too strong in my opinion, but just one smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good value for your money and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>The sellers made sure it was wrapped so it would break during shippment.</li>
            <li>I can smell the fruits a when I put it on, then as time went it turned more floral like with hints of fruit..</li>
            <li>Smells more like vanilla.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more...</li>
            <li>Coconut is my favorite .</li>
            <li>Got many compliments.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It was ok .</li>
            <li>I love this perfume to wear during the spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Nicely shipped and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I spray it on my clean linen too!</li>
            <li>It came before the expected delivery date and it is just AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>Light, clean, and fruity.</li>
            <li>It smells so light and airy and just a touch of sweet vanilla and coconut....</li>
            <li>Wish it lasted longer and was more prominent on me, other than that its an amazing product</li>
            <li>smells amazing doesnt last more than 20 mins..</li>
            <li>Maybe it smells better as a body spray that is not so intense.</li>
            <li>Just got to watch out for Bee season, this stuff is sweet</li>
            <li>Subtle, sweet, tropical but not too much, absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light coconut smell without any heavy floral scent this Perfume is great.</li>
            <li>so pretty!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great everyday perfume</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell fresh and fruity since it has coconut scent in it.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of that perfume &#x27;Far Away&#x27; and smells a bit cheap, like it&#x27;s from the 90s.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this perfume!</li>
            <li>It does smelly pretty \\&quot;vanilla-y\\&quot; though.</li>
            <li>I wish this was more of a perfume that would last longer because after 31 years it is still the only scent I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>responsible and quality</li>
            <li>Very overpowering from just one spray.</li>
            <li>Very tropical.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li>Really fast service</li>
            <li>I liked the aroma but it really did not last very long.  </li>
            <li>Also I do not believe it is a true product of Victoria&#x27;s Secret, nicely played.</li>
            <li>It has a strong alcohol smell and little if any coconut scent</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something very simple and pure smelling and I got found it.</li>
            <li>It came two days early.</li>
            <li>It is a light scent that is not one that will be heavy in the air or choke you.  </li>
            <li>This smells good, but it sadly does not smell like coconut.</li>
            <li>Overall: not bad, not great--smelled a lot of other perfumes that smell like this.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;ve tried several different coconut scented perfumes and have never found one with any real smell to them.  </li>
            <li>A burst of vanilla with barely a hint of any coconut.</li>
            <li>It does not have the real coconut fragrance I expected.</li>
            <li>I have many of Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfumes/body sprays.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend wants to cuddle up next me an awful lot more since I have been wearing this scent..... :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me a long time because one spritz is enough to last the whole day.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> responsible and quality</li>
            <li> A burst of vanilla with barely a hint of any coconut. Very overpowering from just one spray. Reminds me of that perfume &#x27;Far Away&#x27; and smells a bit cheap, like it&#x27;s from the 90s. I don&#x27;t think I will chance wearing this on campus because it might cause someone to sneeze or get a headache. Wanted to like this. Maybe it smells better as a body spray that is not so intense. I think I will use this as a bedroom freshener.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with delivery time. It came two days early. My only issue is with the perfume itself. It has a strong alcohol smell and little if any coconut scent however I&#x27;ve tried several different coconut scented perfumes and have never found one with any real smell to them.  I figured Victoria&#x27;s Secret would get it right if it can be done. I&#x27;m beginning to think it just can&#x27;t be done.</li>
            <li> smells lovely! Light, clean, and fruity. I hate that they transitioned to body spray. The sellers made sure it was wrapped so it would break during shippment.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this perfume! I can smell the fruits a when I put it on, then as time went it turned more floral like with hints of fruit.. It&#x27;s not over powering (a little goes a long way.. Don&#x27;t over do it!).. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light coconut smell without any heavy floral scent this Perfume is great. i would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells more like vanilla. I was wanting a coconut perfume. But it does smell nice.</li>
            <li> This smells good, but it sadly does not smell like coconut. It does smelly pretty \\&quot;vanilla-y\\&quot; though. If you want a great coconut/vanilla perfume, try Island Bath and Body Coconut-Vanilla--lots of coconut in that one, and the scent lasts longer than this does.

            <li> This smells horrible! I thought it would smell fresh and fruity since it has coconut scent in it.  Wow, was I wrong! There in vanilla in it (which I didn&#x27;t know) so it has a warm tone. It&#x27;s just bad.  I have many of Victoria&#x27;s Secret perfumes/body sprays. This one, hands down, it&#x27;s the worst.</li>
            <li> all excellent, I loved the product is genuine</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. I spray it on my clean linen too!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  Very tropical.  The price on AMAZON is GREAT!  I am going to buy more... you can smell the coconut with a very subtle floral undertone.  It is perfect for summer.  Not overpowering.  My boyfriend wants to cuddle up next me an awful lot more since I have been wearing this scent..... :-)</li>
            <li> Coconut is my favorite . Got many compliments.  Just got to watch out for Bee season, this stuff is sweet</li>
            <li> I liked the aroma but it really did not last very long.  I expected more from Victoria Secret.  Nicely shipped and quickly.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Coconut Passion. When I received the package of fragrance, it was smashed and than opened it to notice it was leaking. I figured if I paid the extra money to have it delivered, they would have properly secured it. However the smell is very pleasant. Not to overwhelming but nice coverage. Also I do not believe it is a true product of Victoria&#x27;s Secret, nicely played.</li>
            <li> Ships makes the price expensive. But, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice not overpowering scent. Although its not very strong it stays all day. I did receive a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> smells amazing doesnt last more than 20 mins..</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume ever!! It came before the expected delivery date and it is just AMAZING!!! It smells so light and airy and just a touch of sweet vanilla and coconut....so pretty! Highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li> I wish this was more of a perfume that would last longer because after 31 years it is still the only scent I absolutely love.  Subtle, sweet, tropical but not too much, absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Vanilla and coconut &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this perfume. It&#x27;s lasted me a long time because one spritz is enough to last the whole day. More than one makes the smell too strong in my opinion, but just one smells really good. This is a tiny bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for several months and am just now getting halfway through it. Good value for your money and the shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in VS. It does not have the real coconut fragrance I expected. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice, tropical scent. I was hoping for something very simple and pure smelling and I got found it. One spritz is enough to get me through the day.</li>
            <li> I ordered Eternal Essence fragrance oils at the same time and I thought they smelled absolutely delicious.  I can&#x27;t say the same about this one.</li>
            <li> It was ok . I thought it was a nicer smell .</li>
            <li> Really fast service but doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;coconut\\&quot; fragrance am looking for-</li>
            <li> I love this perfume to wear during the spring and summer.  It is a light scent that is not one that will be heavy in the air or choke you.  I love this scent and so does my boyfriend.</li>

            <li> I got so many compliments when I wore it that I gave some to friends and kept 3 for myself!</li>
            <li> Me encanta ese perfume,es una fragancia excelente, y dulce . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Came fast, packaging was perfect, got compliments, smells great. Wish it lasted longer and was more prominent on me, other than that its an amazing product</li>
