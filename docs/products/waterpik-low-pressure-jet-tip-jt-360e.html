            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s the two pack</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>They work slightly better than nothing.</li>
            <li>It promises more than it seems to be able to give.  </li>
            <li>What more can you say but this review requires a bunch of words</li>
            <li>I love my Waterpik</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be happy if i can get an exchange for the high pressure Tips.</li>
            <li>I wish everything was this easy :)</li>
            <li>So happy to have a replacement low pressure jet, and nice they came in a two pack</li>
            <li>I appreciated the fast, excellent service!</li>
            <li>So the bottom line is that they produce more power to clean.</li>
            <li>It makes shopping so easy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect these tips to give you the velocity of the good high speed Water pick  tips.  </li>
            <li>and luckily there were these replacements available!</li>
            <li>They fit the waterpik, they work, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Pockets I have are getting smaller and the bleeding I have experienced when having my teeth cleaned has dissipated...gums are tougher.</li>
            <li>Tried and liked the waterpik and decided to let the whole family try it.</li>
            <li>Needed to replace my basic tips since I had the product for over a year, these work great.  </li>
            <li>I never had any problems with water pik original parts.</li>
            <li>I ordered on Amazon and received them right away, and they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>Keeping my teeth all clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>My daughter has to have her waterpik to keep her braces clean.</li>
            <li>I will update this review if things change; but so far pleased with item, and pleased with Amazon free shipping, fast service.</li>
            <li>and I received them quickly.</li>
            <li>Some said they were high pressure and better.</li>
            <li>These tips provide just the right amount of pressure to clean without pain.</li>
            <li>Fairly straight forward to use, easy to attach and remove from unit.</li>
            <li>Water pik is super easy to use and helps get areas normally missed with brushing alone.</li>
            <li>replacing a broken head perfectly</li>
            <li>Exact replacement at the right price.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the ONLY place I&#x27;ve been able to find Waterpik Jt 360 E Dental Water Jet Replacement Jet Tips (2 Tips)</li>
            <li>The only difference from the ones that came with the Water-Pik Ultra model are the color, and the low-pressure fitting on the connecting part.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The work exactly like what you would get out of the box when you first purchased your Water Jet.</li>
            <li>If only we knew these existed, we would have been using them from many years ago.</li>
            <li>I did read the reviews first</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Low pressure is a lot better than the high pressure because you can get as close as you want without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li>I actually had to reduce the power setting or it was too strong a stream.</li>
            <li>This is just fine as I intended them for my younger children who do not like the highest pressure settings anyway.</li>
            <li>When I first started to use it, the water was spraying all over me and the bathroom, but as long as you keep your finger on the off button, it works fine.</li>
            <li>I wish the colors would be completely different, not just the little rim on the bottom, but they work great.</li>
            <li>While these tips were a little longer than the original ones I had with my Waterpik, they work just fine.</li>
            <li>THEY WORK VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>And it costs too much to return them</li>
            <li>What really attracted me to this purchase was price (lowest of all vendors).</li>
            <li>I expected to be ok on my WP100 model, but it was not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My teeth really like them.</li>
            <li>Work very well with her water pik.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Note, as well, that I am very stringent about dental care.</li>
            <li>If you have a waterpik you know that it kind of gets messy when using it.</li>
            <li>As a first time waterpik user though I was satisfied with the low pressure tips (which is what these are, low pressure).</li>
            <li>these have a smaller hole in them than the one that came originally with the main unit.</li>
            <li>Price was decent.  </li>
            <li>I thought these was the high pressure Tips.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get these if you are expecting the high pressure replacements.</li>
            <li>You have to specifically search for HIGH PRESSURE.</li>
            <li>These tips work just fine, as expected.</li>
            <li>Finally got the right ones and brought these and the high power ones as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since used the waterpik and the low pressure ones are strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>These are low pressure, which is not in the description but right on the front of the package once it arrives.</li>
            <li>Looked all over for extra tips for my water-pik ultra, but could not find any that fit my model in any of the the local stores.</li>
            <li>I broke BOTH of the original tips within days of each other by dropping the waterpik into the sink.  </li>
            <li>No need to spend more than is necessary for two little pieces of plastic.</li>
            <li>These should really be labeled LOW PRESSURE to avoid confusion.</li>
            <li>cheaper then buying direct from company.</li>
            <li>Just check carefully that they are the right ones before you buy.</li>
            <li>Had trouble finding what I was looking for but Amazon customer service located this product for me quickly.</li>
            <li>The water comes out very fast and hard spraying my whole face with water.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, really.</li>
            <li>At the time of purchase, though, these two replacements were the only ones available directly from Amazon, which was something I was specifically looking for (other vendors have other replacement units).</li>

            <li> it&#x27;ll last a long time!</li>
            <li> But it is something she wanted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The pics only last a couple of weeks and are not available in any if my local stores.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected</li>
            <li> These were also a bit difficult to find and I wanted them exactly like the one that broke.  </li>
            <li> I sent away for these to replace the ones that I had broken previously and (so far) they have remained intact.</li>
            <li> I truly felt this would cut down on plaque, however, I still need to use dental floss.  </li>
            <li> It took a few times using the pik for me to get used to it though.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit my Waterpik</li>
            <li> Waterpik replacement tips are hard to find at the store.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product, but amazon has got it!</li>
            <li> The water stream is weak even with increasing the pressure.</li>
            <li> Water-pik replacement tips are very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> We purchased these as the water jet fell off the counter and onto the floor; the result was a broken jet tip.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I kept buying the wrong tips for our Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> And returning them when you make the mistake is expensive.</li>

            <li> Just as expected. Used as replacement parts</li>
            <li> Worx prorerly &amp; makes my teeth white &amp; shiny  thats why i wanted   thats why I bought it  Looks stylish  Peace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s the two pack it&#x27;ll last a long time! i lost the one that came with the waterpik and luckily there were these replacements available!</li>
            <li> Amazon is the ONLY place I&#x27;ve been able to find Waterpik Jt 360 E Dental Water Jet Replacement Jet Tips (2 Tips)</li>
            <li> Needed additional low-pressure replacement tips for my waterpick - good price and works great.  Had trouble finding what I was looking for but Amazon customer service located this product for me quickly.</li>
            <li> I think these tips are inferior to the stock tips that came with the unit. The water stream is weak even with increasing the pressure. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> THEY WORK VERY WELL.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> these have a smaller hole in them than the one that came originally with the main unit. So the bottom line is that they produce more power to clean. I actually had to reduce the power setting or it was too strong a stream. I like them.</li>
            <li> These were also a bit difficult to find and I wanted them exactly like the one that broke.  These are the same so there is no difficulty u sing them.</li>
            <li> Just replacement tips, whaddya want lol?  They do their job every bit as good as the originals.  Keeping my teeth all clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I thought these was the high pressure Tips. I&#x27;ll be happy if i can get an exchange for the high pressure Tips.</li>
            <li> They fit the waterpik, they work, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  Not much to say, really. If you have a waterpik you know that it kind of gets messy when using it.</li>
            <li> I use this tip for flossing, cleaning, and gum message and have for four months. It works beautifully and my teeth feel like I have just been to the dentist when I am done. Pockets I have are getting smaller and the bleeding I have experienced when having my teeth cleaned has dissipated...gums are tougher. Great tool for avoiding gum disease.</li>
            <li> I ordered Waterpik replacment jet tips not knowing there were different models requiring different styles of tips.  Still don&#x27;t know what the model number is for my waterpik but these definitely are not the style for my model.  And it costs too much to return them so I am stuck.  I wish Amazon would post such information in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li> Looked all over for extra tips for my water-pik ultra, but could not find any that fit my model in any of the the local stores. I ordered on Amazon and received them right away, and they fit just fine. The only difference from the ones that came with the Water-Pik Ultra model are the color, and the low-pressure fitting on the connecting part. This is just fine as I intended them for my younger children who do not like the highest pressure settings anyway.</li>
            <li> These Jet Tips are fragile - so you need to buy a couple because they break - especially if kids use them</li>
            <li> Bought this product as XMAS gift so I&#x27;ve owned and used this for a short while. Fairly straight forward to use, easy to attach and remove from unit. At the time of purchase, though, these two replacements were the only ones available directly from Amazon, which was something I was specifically looking for (other vendors have other replacement units). What really attracted me to this purchase was price (lowest of all vendors). As a first time waterpik user though I was satisfied with the low pressure tips (which is what these are, low pressure). I&#x27;ve since used the waterpik and the low pressure ones are strong enough for me. I will update this review if things change; but so far pleased with item, and pleased with Amazon free shipping, fast service. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the replacement tips.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is a wonderful product.  I flossed my teeth prior to using the Waterpik and I couldn&#x27;t believe all of the debris that the Waterpik still got out between my teeth.  Sometimes I put Listerine in the tank with the water and it makes my mouth feel even fresher.  It took a few times using the pik for me to get used to it though.  When I first started to use it, the water was spraying all over me and the bathroom, but as long as you keep your finger on the off button, it works fine.</li>
            <li> These are low pressure, which is not in the description but right on the front of the package once it arrives.</li>
            <li> I kept buying the wrong tips for our Waterpik.  Finally got the right ones and brought these and the high power ones as well.  Great value for the price and color coated for his and her&#x27;s or for children.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I expected to be ok on my WP100 model, but it was not.&lt;br /&gt;The water pressure is lower than before.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement at the right price.</li>
            <li> I sent away for these to replace the ones that I had broken previously and (so far) they have remained intact.</li>
            <li> I love these. I use them with the portable rechargable water pik. Move over tooth picks. Fast delivery. Great experience.</li>
            <li> Waterpik attachments aren&#x27;t that easy to find in brick and mortar stores, so I was very happy to find replacements on amazon. You can find anymost anything you can think of on amazon. It makes shopping so easy. The product arrived promptly, in perfect shape and was the model that fit my particular machine. If anything, they seem even sturdier than the attachments that came with the unit. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It has not been used yet.  But it is something she wanted for a long time.  Good for dental health.</li>
            <li> The pics only last a couple of weeks and are not available in any if my local stores.</li>
            <li> Great price for two replacement heads. Water pik is super easy to use and helps get areas normally missed with brushing alone. Ex: braces, implants, &amp; bridgework.</li>
            <li> We purchased these as the water jet fell off the counter and onto the floor; the result was a broken jet tip. These are manufacturer&#x27;s quality and fit perfectly into the unit. The work exactly like what you would get out of the box when you first purchased your Water Jet.</li>
            <li> So happy to have a replacement low pressure jet, and nice they came in a two pack so my hubby can also use the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> We have Four tooth-brushers in our house. I am happy to find a color-coded way to share the waterpick. We are happy with the performance</li>
            <li> fits well and works great.  good value</li>
            <li> I like them.  My teeth really like them.</li>
            <li> Yes, these tips are really great for the flosser.  Just subscribed to get them every 6 months or so on Amazon.  These are great.  Recommended Product.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find product, but amazon has got it! My daughter has to have her waterpik to keep her braces clean. With multiple tips now I can use it.</li>
            <li> tips fit and work great,  very good price</li>
            <li> replacing a broken head perfectly</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> worked well with my waterpik and good price.</li>
            <li> These replacement tips work perfectly with my waterpik and what more can I say?  Just check carefully that they are the right ones before you buy.</li>
            <li> These tips provide just the right amount of pressure to clean without pain.</li>
            <li> buen precio y practico,facil de usar.Muy util para el aseo personal e individual de cada persona,puede usarlo dos personas a la vez</li>
            <li> Very easy to install and are the perfect pressure for my teeth. Low pressure is a lot better than the high pressure because you can get as close as you want without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li> The water Pik machine which goes with these spare jet tips, is the best ever invention! If only we knew these existed, we would have been using them from many years ago.</li>
            <li> I received the Water-pick Jt 360 Dental Water Jet Replacement tips quickly and they work perfectly.  I appreciated the fast, excellent service!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my granddaughter who wears braces.  They were a great buy. Work very well with her water pik.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Works as expected</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my flosser but it didn&#x27;t have a problem until I installed these heads. They work slightly better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these if you are expecting the high pressure replacements. You have to specifically search for HIGH PRESSURE. These should really be labeled LOW PRESSURE to avoid confusion. Now I&#x27;m stuck with these things. I did read the reviews first but they were mixed. Some said they were high pressure and better. Maybe one review mentioned they were low pressure.</li>
            <li> Tried and liked the waterpik and decided to let the whole family try it. All we have to do is swap tips.</li>
            <li> I wish the colors would be completely different, not just the little rim on the bottom, but they work great.</li>
            <li> Just Like What Came With the WaterPik.  I recommend purchasing an extra set of jet tips just in case yours break.  These are cheaper than what WaterPik sells and just as good.</li>
            <li> as advertised. can&#x27;t seem to find them in stores.</li>
            <li> The replacement tips work with our older model Water perfectly.  No need to spend more than is necessary for two little pieces of plastic.</li>
            <li> perfect for my water pik.  cheaper then buying direct from company.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my Waterpik</li>
            <li> I broke BOTH of the original tips within days of each other by dropping the waterpik into the sink.  These replacement tips are a perfect fit for my handheld pik.</li>
            <li> Was suspose to receive water pic jet tips. Received low volume jet tips. If they were low volume jet tips they should have said so in the description. Not happy</li>
            <li> While these tips were a little longer than the original ones I had with my Waterpik, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement for my Water-Pic</li>
            <li> Water-pik replacement tips are very hard to find in stores. Delighted to find these! They are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for and it came in a convenient 2 pack.  Shipped promptly and it was a great price!!  Very pleased with the purchase I made.  I wish everything was this easy :)[[ASIN:B002BWQ73O Waterpik Jt 360 E Dental Water Jet Replacement Jet Tips (2 Tips)]]</li>
            <li> Waterpik replacement tips are hard to find at the store.  These are a great price and I received them quickly.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect these tips to give you the velocity of the good high speed Water pick  tips.  They are the ones that come with water pick that nobody ever uses.  And returning them when you make the mistake is expensive.</li>
            <li> I truly felt this would cut down on plaque, however, I still need to use dental floss.  It promises more than it seems to be able to give.  My teeth do not have gaps, so maybe that is the problem.  When I go to the dentist in two weeks, I will see if they see a difference.  Note, as well, that I am very stringent about dental care.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the tip I broke. Arrived on time. Packed well. Just what I needed for my water pic</li>
            <li> Since using a waterpik with these jets ,I now can reduce my cleaning appointments from 3 per year to only 2 which  saves me $114.&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygenist even asked if I made changes in my teeth cleaning method. She said &amp;#34;keep using the water pik&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> these tips are required for a functioning unit.  These work for my needs. Always check your model before buying. Easier than looking for a store that carries these.</li>
            <li> I chose my rating because I&#x27;m still in the process of learning how to use my waterpik flosser. The water comes out very fast and hard spraying my whole face with water.</li>
            <li> Great replacement jets.  Fit perfectly</li>
            <li> They are good quality and work great.  Price was decent.  What more can you say but this review requires a bunch of words so I have to keep typing.</li>
            <li> After breaking the tips for my Waterpik a couple years ago, it just sat under my cabinet until I found these replacement tips. They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> The replacement Jet Tips works great with the Waterpik.  Needed to replace my basic tips since I had the product for over a year, these work great.  I love my Waterpik and so does my dentist.  It is a must have for oral care.</li>
            <li> I never had any problems with water pik original parts. These tips work just fine, as expected. x x x</li>
