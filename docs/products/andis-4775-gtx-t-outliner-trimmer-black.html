            <li>I&#x27;m have been impressed at how well the clippers cut and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I used to own some Andis T-Outliner clippers and I have the Whal 5 series clippers that suppose to be good for people that suffer from razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>

            <li>The blades that were on the clippers were good, nevertheless had to replace it with Pro-mate Trimmer Blade.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Also good for cleaning all edges in between haircuts.</li>
            <li>Works good, I recommend.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this product.</li>
            <li>The package holding my items were in good shape, but the edge of the hair trimmer box was smashed.</li>
            <li>Delivery time was prompt, so satisfaction was good.</li>

            <li>This trimmer is really great for all purposes and it is quite safe to use for any parts of your body and it is quite effective.</li>
            <li>Love andis trimmers!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>I was impressed after the first use.</li>
            <li>Excellent fit, molded into a perfect fit for one&#x27;s hand, which means, it fit in the hand very comfortably.</li>
            <li>but i say bout 10 min goes hot , but u shouldnt be lining that consecutively! !!!</li>
            <li>Andis trimmers are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this trimmer to any barber or someone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li>Nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Recommended to all barbers and those who cit their own hair.</li>
            <li>Good quality for sure.</li>
            <li>Now im going to start shaving my own hair, doing my own designs, shave my own beard and do it when i want and how i want.</li>
            <li>and I get a nice, even shave within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it to trim my own beard.</li>
            <li>i had the t-edjer forever and loved it but broke after one to many drops, now i picked this up.  </li>
            <li>but any trimmer of this caliber gets warm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m my own barber</li>
            <li>It is a nice product.</li>
            <li>Awesome and very close trim.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone wanting to line their own hair.</li>
            <li>This one is really nice.</li>
            <li>Not even worth returning it!!!</li>
            <li>He is very impressed with it compare to the older model that he had</li>
            <li>Perfect for free haircuts and quick trims at home.  </li>
            <li>but for a quick line up and clean your face up this works awesome.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, and the GTX blade makes it just that better.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is the best out of 5 trimmers i have owned so far.</li>
            <li>Great powerful Trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps me from tearing up the razor blades which saves me money and keeps the razor blades in good condition so that they cut smooth and shaving feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are by far the best on the market</li>
            <li>The best clipper I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>This product came in very handy and us powerful(: met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I own most all the top trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>But I own 7 pairs of trimmers and find myself using the gtx outliner more and more.  </li>
            <li>the best hair an beard trimmer i bought gets really close for a clean shave without the razor burn</li>
            <li>Hits just fine out of the box!</li>
            <li>nice and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>He used to use the gray one and that was his favorite.</li>
            <li>This product came on top of my list.</li>
            <li>Love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I know the detailers are most barber&#x27;s choice</li>
            <li>but these are in the top name trimmers......</li>
            <li>Extra power when you need it with a wider blade perfect combination 👍👍👍</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and it works better for my skin/beard.</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using this to shave more frequently, the blade it came with isn&#x27;t really ideal for that.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hubby and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He has tried many and this one seems to do the job.</li>
            <li>I got these today the day after I cut my hair but tried them anyway just to see if they cleared up better then</li>
            <li>So glad I decided to buy these clippers.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite trimmers of all time.</li>
            <li>and im completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>ONLY IF it did what its suppose to do best !</li>
            <li>Additionally, they do take a bit more maintenance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more blades.</li>
            <li>My headliners trimmers work better than this one.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>but this is the better of them all.</li>
            <li>it get used at mexico and my uclce love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to try it again as I really enjoyed the trimmers power and accuracy.</li>
            <li>This my top choice for a pair of trimmers.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>i love this thing.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my brother because he said it&#x27;s top of the line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s EVEN BETTER than the Outliner II -</li>
            <li>Ok product but will not buy again</li>
            <li>But it cuts ok</li>
            <li>needed to raise to make sharper. will be buying more andis products from now on .</li>
            <li>I love Andis&#x27; products</li>
            <li>but I still think the Wahl Detailers are better.</li>
            <li>and I must say one of the best especially for beards.</li>
            <li>no complaints :)</li>
            <li>BUT the outliner 2 is still better.</li>
            <li>But longer is not always better.</li>
            <li>I put so many people on these liners.</li>
            <li>great power, nice durable cord, don&#x27;t get hot...and are nice and quiet...</li>
            <li>and I have used just about every top trimmer on the market.</li>
            <li>I choose to use more than one type of trimmer</li>
            <li>Better than any others I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Still one of the best trimmers ever &amp; essential tool for barbers!</li>
            <li>the hit ok</li>
            <li>really great at shaping up and also on facial hair a good buy :)</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I does not cut as close as advertised, could be better</li>
            <li>It might be a bit overdone if you are just using it at home like me, but I am sure it will hold up well.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the performance and the cut of the blades.  </li>
            <li>I thought I finally found the perfect combination of shaver and travel clippers.</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very precise and a nice clean shave&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used.. won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li>Better then original t-outliners!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome liner for course hair and they do get hot sort of fast.</li>
            <li>Trims nicely and cleanly.</li>
            <li>This is a great high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>Pretty good trimmers.</li>
            <li>Most times I let it go at that, but I can also easily shave that off if I want to.</li>
            <li>This Outliner is perfect for dry shaving after you cut with a 0.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry shaving.</li>
            <li>But if you just want then to cut like Subzero(making the line to fade or shaving your head or beard) DONT even try to adjust them, they cut more than perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Though I am not a barber I think that if you are using them to do simple lines of the face and hairline they are very good.</li>
            <li>I love, gives a smooth shave, just what I needed.</li>
            <li>it came super fast and worked really great.</li>
            <li>If anyone is looking for a excellent set of trimmers that cuts sharp outlines on a persons head</li>
            <li>but there is no thumb bar on the side to make them longer or shorter other than that they&#x27;re awesome</li>
            <li>wow this is the best clippers i have ever owned, i should have purchased this item a long time ago, really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to adjust, easy to take apart, easy to clean and works great other wise</li>
            <li>Great Tliner i&#x27;d buy more in the future</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Precisioner from Promate.</li>
            <li>It is strong like the styliner and gets close like the outliner 2,</li>
            <li>Very strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>right now runs smooth and leaves nice crispy lines.</li>
            <li>Need slight adjustment to be zero gapped, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li>All three products I had received looked like it had been opened and used, even saw fine bits of hair on the blade.</li>
            <li>This performed absolutely perfect; Until it died after less than 3 months of use.</li>
            <li>I love my new clippers great product and very affordable price.</li>
            <li>Bought one and it worked pretty good but overheated SUPER quick.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of andis have been using them for 6 yrs now.</li>
            <li>These are great for daily face trimming as well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The replacement has been going great for almost daily shaving and monthly haircuts for about 4 months now.</li>
            <li>There just isn&#x27;t another credible option for a T trimmer than the Andis.</li>
            <li>Took Only 3 days to get and they worked great.</li>
            <li>they cut low and feel great in the hands.</li>
            <li>Runs cooler &amp; slightly more powerful than reg t-outliner.</li>
            <li>After opening it, the clipper was wrapped in a cheap plastic materia with holes on it?</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer because I wanted something more powerful than those battery operated ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a quality feel and sound.  </li>
            <li>Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Would never buy again, even if its offered  for free.</li>
            <li>It smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>They are both great trimmers but for totally different uses.  </li>
            <li>these are great outliners and tremors or just shave it as close as possible</li>
            <li>The buzz sound is audible but not annoying.</li>
            <li>It has a more powerful motor that Oster Outliner with or without the T blade.</li>
            <li>Its cuts close without any niches to the skin or snags to the hair that occurs from using cheap (Walfart) clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use for shaving a light beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>Adjusting it too far in will result in not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Right now though, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is easy: just wipe with a cloth and spray on the Andis cool care spray cleaner/lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new favorite!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who cuts their own hair.  </li>
            <li>smooth clippers great for dry shaving</li>
            <li>My original t-outliner stood up for 14 years .  </li>
            <li>I originally zero gapped the blade, but it was a bit too close.</li>
            <li>Always keeps me looking fresh out of the barber shop!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the best advice I can give: Loosen the head on it, and get the blades as close to the end of the guard as you can without going past it.</li>
            <li>once you do some adjusting like with any clippers, you are GOLDEN!</li>
            <li>BEST TRIMMERS better than the regular t-out-liners is basically the same thing just upgraded, and it comes with a 3 prong power cable no wall mart</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 2/27/15&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with the original outliner blade.  </li>
            <li>the original outliner 2.  </li>
            <li>But any trimmer will get hot if you are using it for more than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer worked fine while it lasted but completely but broke under it&#x27;s own power.  </li>
            <li>until i dropped them a few too many times lol.</li>
            <li>they work great for dry shaving and close trimming of mustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even cut the hairs cleanly off anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use it to shave and clean up my shape ups.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean up the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>its not gonna get that baby smooth super close shave</li>
            <li>Everytime I give an edge up people always ask what type of trimmers are those because they cut so clean.</li>
            <li>I would recommend adjusting the blade to get a clean shave</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean cut the way I want it.</li>
            <li>Not the easiest machine to clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry shaving and maintenance cuts.</li>
            <li>Very good clipper, just wish it would shape the beard a little closer, but would buy again.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is very very precise and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>If I had to describe this particular clippers, I would have to describe it has, an indispensable and responsive trimmer, the one in question, helping create an appealing outline.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a very good product with few drawbacks.</li>
            <li>The Gtx trimmer works wonderfully on ethnic hair, and zipps right through fine hair, but seems to pull on thick brown hair,  out of all my clients</li>
            <li>it is not as great as expected.</li>
            <li>come super clean.</li>
            <li>Really well built and top quality in a trimmer.</li>
            <li>If you are a barber you are better off using the T-Outliners with an adjusted blade really.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get a trimmer to get really close their for some reason, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, Amazon delivered them on time and safe not to mention reasonable, Thanx</li>
            <li>I used this item to square up my hair cut in front about every other week for me and my sons and it works great.</li>
            <li>Pefect smooth clean line up , doesnt get hot to quick</li>
            <li>Built quality is very nice and nice thick wire !</li>
            <li>They were fine out of the box, but I need them crisp</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>and they get super close.</li>
            <li>they are much more powerful and the blade is much deeper and they run cooler</li>
            <li>It was shipped and received fairly quickly with no issues from the seller.</li>
            <li>it will take a few tries to adjust it to be perfect, but once you find the sweet spot, its amazing</li>
            <li>gets very hot and almost unbearable to touch.</li>
            <li>but they cut very very close to the skin!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be good if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li>Love my new clippers.</li>
            <li>The O8770 is a slightly upgraded and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It cut really close and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>but they last long and are great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Fast and easy shaving&lt;</li>
            <li>In the past, I have owned the Outliner II, which was a good trimmer, but this one is even better.  </li>
            <li>, I Always Wanted That Crisp Clean Line Up</li>
            <li>Very smooth, quiet, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I love these things nice sharp crisp line that won&#x27;t dig into your skin and cut u</li>
            <li>These are my second set but my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>The only con I could find with the GTX clippers is that the clippers do get hot the longer you use them but other than that they are definitely a good investment for men who want a good trimmer and those who suffer from razor bumps, ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li>Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li>if you get a cheap one with not that much power.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close to the skin and smoothly.</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus, because it means you can get a closer shave than most traditional trimmers you can purchase at the store.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is amazing simply set the blade and go no need to tune like the gray versions&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, but for a closer cut you will need to purchase (Andis Replacement Hair Trimmer Blade (04521))</li>
            <li>Seems the same as the gray ones.. comes with attachments though, which is nice..</li>
            <li>That was also a success.</li>
            <li>So Fresh Out</li>
            <li>But even if it dies within a couple of years, it will have been worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite trimmer</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>worth the money and time I put in to shave.</li>
            <li>powerful.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money...</li>
            <li>Hopefully I get my moneys worth with this product.</li>
            <li>nice clippers, bought them for someones birthday only after buying them I discovered they bought them for themselves as a bday gift.</li>
            <li>I zero-gapped them and they are SHARP perfect for crisp clean linings, only one thing DONT APPLY ALOT OF PRESSURE.</li>
            <li>Work easily and don&#x27;t get hot fast.</li>
            <li>Garbage... Gets super hot</li>
            <li>The trimmer gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>awesome clipper..hits hard out of the box,is perfect with a few minor adjustments...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more interested in that because I more so use a straight razor for the overall shape up.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this trimmer particularly the blade.</li>
            <li>When they come out the box they are not that sharp, but if you know how to adjust them they are good trimmers.</li>
            <li>This clipper is good compared to other ones I have been using.</li>
            <li>Sure this thing may have a super powerful motor, but what good is that if it cannot cut a balding man&#x27;s thin hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts just the right length where it looks like I just shaved</li>
            <li>It trims the hair right to the scalp.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve a glide when the blade is set right.</li>
            <li>right out the box</li>
            <li>Clean lines and very close.</li>
            <li>so if you dont have a clipper available you can do some decent fades and tapers with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I clean it too much, or the cleaner that I use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and much faster than my Con Air as well!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great of trimming and lining a beard which is pointless when I&#x27;m shaving my head and beard.</li>
            <li>It stay cool and much</li>
            <li>I love it for the silence and my husband loves it because he can use it everyday, easy to clean, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Unscrew and removed the top blade, then loosen the two small screws to the retainer guide and adjust the guide to meet the very edge of the top blade for a closer and fine cut to shape lines.  </li>
            <li>cord is very long, which is nice,  </li>
            <li>I had previously bought cheaper $10-$20 trimmers, but they weren&#x27;t too good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, these are some pretty darn good clippers, but not really worth the investment.</li>
            <li>i bought this product because I had previously owned outliner 1 which was good for  almost two years.</li>
            <li>It was very hot and the blade does not shave very well, I&#x27;ll have to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watched several videos on youtube to make sure I was doing it right.</li>
            <li>Very noisy and gets hot too quickly.</li>
            <li>Also very fast to shave with them.</li>
            <li>It gets very very close.</li>
            <li>Very strong the blade is super sharp.</li>
            <li>always clean, and oil after each use, but it&#x27;s starting to sound like something inside</li>
            <li>I own the older model with the regular motor</li>
            <li>I did cut myself on the neck a cuple times the first time because I was &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose thanks!</li>
            <li>Also if you want to improve its closeness to even a higher degree look into buying an anivo blade setter or replacement blades from mdbarber.com</li>
            <li>It literally shaves so close that it looks like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (which is exactly what I wanted).  </li>
            <li>I just wished it didn&#x27;t get so hot after 5-10 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li>Get hot</li>
            <li>First of all let me just put it out there that shipping was extremely first.</li>
            <li>Overall they are ok.</li>
            <li>My whiskers are fairly thick, and there are a lot of them, and this does a great job.</li>
            <li>By the time it was used, we realized it gets really HOT and unbearably to HOLD.</li>
            <li>but everytime i use it gets so hot</li>
            <li>They are very noisy and they are not cutting like the gtx that I bought out of the hair store.</li>
            <li>After I Did My First Shape</li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised with precision.</li>
            <li>With that said, I&#x27;ve gone through many different types of trimmers, ranging from cordless to corded, adjustable blades etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the FIRST trimmer where I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;m getting close to the equipment that barbershops or salons use.</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my skin stung after shaving with the Andis GTX.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is powerful for the price, however, you do have to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice these getting hot at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also is a much more solid build.</li>
            <li>you know what”… Adjust them and they’re ready to go!</li>
            <li>people might say it gets hot.</li>
            <li>it might not get hot.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty durable</li>
            <li>I love the tiny guards it comes with to shape up clients beards.</li>
            <li>It will get hot after about 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use</li>
            <li>However it can get awefully hot over a period of usage</li>
            <li>Decided that i&#x27;d drop more money on a trimmer that i could have the rest of my life possibly.</li>
            <li>Also, the clippers get way too hot.  </li>
            <li>The first time i used it it worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot for awhile</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer head is shaped differently than most I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li>and they get hot as he</li>
            <li>prongs cords doesn&#x27;t give you more power it only for ground wire.</li>
            <li>First of all I would like to say that I am a barber and have used about every trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not shiny since about the first month of use.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to a friend because it does what it should and does it well :)</li>
            <li>It would have gotten 5 stars but it gets really hot after like 15-20 mins...</li>
            <li>Im about to send it to Andis for repair, which will take the better part of a month to get back.</li>
            <li>Returned and got a replacement which is a little better but also overheats very quick, after about two mins of leaving it on it</li>
            <li>I love it , gives sharp lines and clean shaves &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>so i tried it and it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 minuted without being EXTREMELY HOT!!!</li>
            <li>it also comes with adjustable combs that were very helpful and the right size.</li>
            <li>My friend and barber for nearly 15 years told me to look into this unit because of the thicker and better cord assembly when i was ready for a new one.</li>
            <li>They are more quiet than metal and much cooler after extended use</li>
            <li>Great Professional tool for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>It also gets the top back of my head very close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other shavers but I think so far this one is the best.easy to use and have a pretty good grip.</li>
            <li>He gets a very close shave look when he uses it to trim his face and a very straight edge up line.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much difference from the the regular grey Andis trimmer but it is better for cleaning up a fade because of the deeper teeth gives more flexibility.</li>
            <li>Still doesn&#x27;t get hot fast.</li>
            <li>first you have to adjust the blades, do your line up, then go over with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>Mine came straight from Amazon so no questionable sellers to blame.</li>
            <li>getting this product i was really looking forward to using them but on my first client the razor BLEW UP</li>
            <li>I will exchange it and see if another one works as I had good luck with this manufacturer in the past.</li>
            <li>Good product but not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>if you have a nice thick beard and want to keep it looking clean, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update::</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for very long because the edge of the stationary blade somehow broke after a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>The teeth chips on both the outer and inner blade easily making it an unreliable tool.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot, has plenty of power, very durable, high quality build that andis is known for!</li>
            <li>good for personal use but wouldnt reccomend for a barber to use all day long</li>
            <li>It was also more powerful than old Andis Outliner (the grey one).</li>
            <li>I find the GTX much more powerful than your typical beard trimmer doing a faster and cleaner job.</li>
            <li>to fast</li>
            <li>but I earned how to maneuver it more carefully.</li>
            <li>They work better than expected.</li>
            <li>Andis 4775 GTX T-Outline, absolutely kicks ass.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li>Not so much the blade, but the body of the clipper, over the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimmer works really well</li>
            <li>these are some great trimmers they are the only ones i use, but the only issue i have is that on the box it says guard included and when i open up the box there wasn&#x27;t any there.</li>
            <li>Anyone one who wants to buy a trimmer and doesnt want to go pay that $13 barber fee.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Very Quite&lt;</li>
            <li>It does cut very well</li>
            <li>When i received it, it came very well packed.</li>
            <li>REALLY??</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reason for removing 1 star: The trimmer is a bit loud, but not crazy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get these adjusted for a real close shave.</li>
            <li>Very dependable</li>
            <li>Works well. 0 gapped the blade and cuts very close.</li>
            <li>Andis have really done it this time.</li>
            <li>and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>States that the cut is very close</li>
            <li>it cuts very close for a trimmer (after you adjust the blades).</li>
            <li>hahaha just kidding.</li>
            <li>I believe they serve their purpose very well.</li>
            <li>They also clip very well.  </li>
            <li>The Gtx provides a very close shave that leaves a bit stubble  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars but the vibration extremely intense, so literally after using it for 5 minutes, my had is tingling.</li>
            <li>Straight out the box</li>
            <li>It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t break skin.</li>
            <li>As a barber I cannot stress how much I rely on my tools to provide a quality service and this trimmer allows me to offer that to my clients and customers.</li>
            <li>The cord on this is also very sturdy when compared to the gray t-outliner I have.  </li>
            <li>I have saved soo much money on hair cuts and the boys look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li>Oster Fast Feeds from this crowd for my Birthday.</li>
            <li>The Norelco&#x27;s did a fair job cutting and were fairly comfortable but this Andis trimmer gets as close as a blade without the irritation!</li>
            <li>Good solid product over all, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying the  Andis professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer.</li>
            <li>They do stay cooler longer, and are sharp right out of the box, but they aren&#x27;t easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this trimmer a chance, because I had 3 other trimmers, and I did not see the point, buying another Andis trimmer,</li>
            <li>If this trimmer is from Cosmetic Central, this is NOT an original Andis.  </li>
            <li>The body is also smaller than most trimmers we&#x27;ve had in the past, which means it fits in my hands better.  </li>
            <li>If you tackle pompadours, fades, gentleman&#x27;s, line ups, shaves, buzzes, finish work, outlines, older folks, young guys, even kids, this thing does not bite and hits right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Being in a profession that doesn&#x27;t require daily shaves lets me use the 08770 to clean things up when needed.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the trimmer themselves seem to be okay, but the box makes me seriously think against the product being new.</li>
            <li>Superb trimmer, however appear to procure relatively torrid and feel the necessity to let it sit for at least 10 or so minute, prior to avail oneself of it again.</li>
            <li>Not good didn&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li>Good for short hair only and for a short time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bald guy with full facial hair!</li>
            <li>but Ill learn not to apply as much pressure, overall they are very good trimmers!</li>
            <li>Ok trimmer this was bought to replace my other and is clippers because they had stopped moving.theese are pretty powerful and does get hot after 10 minutes.the blade is sharp but just a little unbalanced and I can&#x27;t fix it to save my life but overall theese are good shape up clippers</li>
            <li>If you look and the teeth of the blade, it is the equivalent of the Promate Blade, only the Promate Blade has a copper coating that looks cool and the heavy cord generates more power to the trimmer and really makes you feel that power.</li>
            <li>The T-edges get the really close precise detailing and the wide shape</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t replace a regular wet shave, I can now comfortably use this to clean up and outline my beard instead of shaving.</li>
            <li>Plus what guy doesn’t love anything in black.</li>
            <li>I mainly use to trim my beard and mustache using the included combs.</li>
            <li>than that it is the same outstanding personal trimmer i.e. motor, casing, blades etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I brought the Andis gto trimmer, and to keep it short and simple</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the main function of this machine.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer, got enough power and trims really low.  </li>
            <li>But when i first purchased my first trimmer it came with 4 hair clips and the second one with i bought from this seller</li>
            <li>and I asked him how I can get this particular clipper</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a buddy present to line you up in the back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Oster Classic for years but combined with an outliner, it&#x27;s a bit bulky for travel.</li>
            <li>These bad boys are powerful,  precise and very smooth!</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Andis trimmers since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>especially seen I already own the other version.</li>
            <li>The blades are not sharp and they get hot.</li>
            <li>Thought I would spend a little more and buy these clippers.</li>
            <li>trimmers are extremely sharp and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>The trimmer produces sharp edges and cuts well through any length of hair easily.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to be able to use this to clean up my beard instead of having to wet shave, but it doesnt cut close enough, and even after zero gapping it, it will not replace a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will suggest investing in the Andis cool care plus clipper blade cleaner to really clean the blades and keeping cutting good for a long time.</li>
            <li>They get a little warm but cool down in the 10 min between uses.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>These were brand new with decent power.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>The only thing is they get hot fast.</li>
            <li>I prefer andis over the other major brands because I&#x27;ve always had a better cut with them than the others.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box it would occasionally rattle as if something were tumbling inside it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very solid and compact and the switch is nice and tight.</li>
            <li>My barber recommended it, but it&#x27;s too heavy and vibrates too much for the fine control I need.  </li>
            <li>I dont understand why someone would do this and ask for a price of almost brand new one.</li>
            <li>And here I am (in Sept 2013) searching for a new one.</li>
            <li>I will try to find a new one.</li>
            <li>i bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>Seller claims its new?</li>
            <li>I planned on exchanging for a new one, but the seller did not have any in stock</li>
            <li>in hand&lt;br /&gt;-nice new style of blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Outliner II for a bald/headshave for close to 25 years and when it was time for a new clipper, decided on this one.</li>
            <li>Recommend purchasing clippers in country to ensure their made for the voltage of where you live.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in new condition as stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new blade and will update this review based on how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had a wahl peanut before but wanted a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>My new #1 trimmers..</li>
            <li>The second one looked exactly like the first one I had returned, the deep scratch on the metal side was in the same exact place, I even took a picture of it!</li>
            <li>I use this on everybody from older gentleman to young kids.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a professional look.</li>
            <li>The trimmer its good when it comes to power, the power cord its long, and the design its really good, but when it comes about the blade its really bad because its not adjusted properly from factory si</li>
            <li>This is my second trimmer i accidentally dropped my first trimmer and broke the teeth on it</li>
            <li>These, by far, leave the sharpest line of them all!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get really hot and runs really quietly.</li>
            <li>Its pretty quiet too.</li>
            <li>I used to use the back of my Nerelco to first trim, and then i shave.</li>
            <li>Cut my throat in two different places on first use.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall to all of the andis trimmers I have used it that they all get hot.  </li>
            <li>Looked for a very long time and finally I&#x27;ve found an outstanding, sharp, powerful edger.</li>
            <li>I mean, it still gets the job done, but the older model is better.</li>
            <li>Mine now won&#x27;t turn on after less than two months of light use.</li>
            <li>While every electric razor I have owned, including expensive ones, has not cut very close and caused skin irritation, this trimmer cuts close quickly and easily and causes no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp trimmer but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as regular t outliner does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Keeps cool longer than other T outliners.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought it will be better than my old one (04710), but after several use, I concluded that it&#x27;s not worth the price or the hype claimed by Andis.</li>
            <li>came back on amazon looking for new blade options, didn&#x27;t really see anything.</li>
            <li>The Andes hair cutting tool was recommended by my dogs groomer, and is the tool used by a lot of younger barbers, my grand son is very good at cutting hair and is working in a barber shop in San Francisco California, he learned to cut hair on his own in his garage by cutting his friends hair, he has been schooled and is in training for his license certificate, and wants to open his own barber shop, he very determined to do this as his career.</li>
            <li>There is no rattling or loud noises but the edging power seems to be kind of weak.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the T-Outliner, but it does get a little hot after about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The coil in this item is one half the size of the original and the rewiring was patched with tape.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and this one helps keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li>Now, I may have not read the description clearly but these trimmers are not for shaping stubble.</li>
            <li>Complete BS dont ever buy these</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a Christmas present and it came fast</li>
            <li>the only flaw is that it gets hotter than I&#x27;d like much faster than it rightfully should..</li>
            <li>My skin type is extremely sensitive and razors (yes, even the Mach 3) cause skin irritation which lead to acne spots.  </li>
            <li>A regular shaver can&#x27;t handle that much, so I use a trimmer instead.</li>
            <li>As a guy who didn&#x27;t try to fight baldness from an early age, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head once a week since I was 22.</li>
            <li>It has turned my wife into a professional barber!(well almost)</li>
            <li>It makes a loud noise.  </li>
            <li>Used these twice so far</li>
            <li>Wooow,I been cutting for 28yrs and never has a trimmer come close to the andis Gtx, My job has become easier and more enjoyable, Not only that</li>
            <li>but they still do get hot if using for a long time.</li>
            <li>it rattles loudly when I turn it over.</li>
            <li>edit: works after much tweeking with the internals-made possible with the help of YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll dust off my 4 year old Oster Outliner and avoid Andis completely going forward.</li>
            <li>This is a really good buy, but I must say that my peanut clipper can get closer to the skin but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get no little breakouts or rashes I do with razors.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t do the heavy work of an Oster 76 classic but they are complimentary products.</li>
            <li>I know some people have had mixed experiences with the product, some negative and some positive, with regards to closeness in shaping fine lines around the hair line.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I am giving 4 stars is the first one showed up and only lasted 3 cycles of the switch....</li>
            <li>Nice, deep tooth blade is a little different, but overall they get the job done</li>
            <li>But overall, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am noticing is that the metal on the top where the screws are is starting to bend up a little on one side but that could of been from anything.</li>
            <li>tried to use it to shave the sides of a high and tight on my son, and noticed a spot got really hot.</li>
            <li>only drawback is that it vibrates a lot (probably normal for a trimmer of this power) but it does not interfere with my control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heavier than expected, but also much higher quality.  </li>
            <li>I am left with a broken trimmer that is good enough for the trash.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for cleaning up my face and goatee, instead of shaving due to my very coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li>now my only ideas of buying any hair clippings our new blade for the ones that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>You actually get the one with the new and improved switch.</li>
            <li>Just started cutting my own hair and these make it so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This broke after only a few months of light use.</li>
            <li>that in upgrading the cord to a grounded 3 wire version they also switched to a much stiffer cord stock which make storing the clipper more difficult.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t get hot like the old ones do, and they are sharp!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no other competition for this product.</li>
            <li>Compared to the other one with a gray colored plastic body, this does feel more heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>I have to scrub with it a little but its worth it.</li>
            <li>of them have generally sucked, for one reason or another.</li>
            <li>and he barely misses his old one that finally gave out after years.</li>
            <li>complaint is that it gets hot quite fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it begins making some loud grinding noises, out of the blue.</li>
            <li>Adjusting the retainer guide too far out will result in a possible skin cut.  </li>
            <li>But once I oiled it again, it was back in action.</li>
            <li>I had to stop using it and go back to my old clippers.</li>
            <li>I pulled out my old facial hair trimmer and completed the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>and they repeated the same behavior in a hotel bathroom sparking poping with light smoke coming from the unit big waste of money</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use the trimmer yet because the blade was broken when it arrived, but the rating will stay as 1 star until I receive a working trimmer and can try it out.</li>
            <li>once one learns the formula behind adjusting the blade, the results will be satisfying.  </li>
            <li>That might make this a little less safe to use, although it would make the trim even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got lots of redness at first, and after I started cleaning after EVERY use, it went down.  </li>
            <li>They stopped working on me after the first time use which took less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The switch on this model is a bit easier to use than my old Andis which finally gave up the ghost after 15 years of constant use.</li>
            <li>i bought this trimmer instead of my usual gray trimmer by andis because the black on is suppose to be better.  </li>
            <li>My first Andis also performed  the same way after less than a year.</li>
            <li>Close enough that I can barely see the shadow.</li>
            <li>I only use these for personal use however so in a professional setting this may be a different story.  </li>
            <li>This has same power consumption (10Watts) of the T-Outliner II or Outliner but runs smoother, takes a little longer (maybe 10 additional minutes) to get hot compared to Outliner.</li>
            <li>I also use an old toothbrush to brush the hair off the blade as I&#x27;m dry shaving.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that it gets a little hot a little fast.</li>
            <li>The trimmer still has the same characteristic of all of the other andis trimmers “they get hot than a</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does cut well, and is comfortable, but after a few uses, I noticed some odd noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The box actually looked old and loose.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m have been impressed at how well the clippers cut and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I used to own some Andis T-Outliner clippers and I have the Whal 5 series clippers that suppose to be good for people that suffer from razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> and it is very precise one of the best trimmers ive ever had</li>
            <li> This Andis GTX trimmer is amazing!  </li>

            <li> Good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also good for cleaning all edges in between haircuts.</li>

            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> I was impressed after the first use.</li>
            <li> Excellent fit, molded into a perfect fit for one&#x27;s hand, which means, it fit in the hand very comfortably.</li>
            <li> but i say bout 10 min goes hot , but u shouldnt be lining that consecutively! !!!</li>
            <li> Andis trimmers are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this trimmer to any barber or someone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Recommended to all barbers and those who cit their own hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality for sure.</li>
            <li> Now im going to start shaving my own hair, doing my own designs, shave my own beard and do it when i want and how i want.</li>
            <li> and I get a nice, even shave within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it to trim my own beard.</li>
            <li> i had the t-edjer forever and loved it but broke after one to many drops, now i picked this up.  </li>
            <li> but any trimmer of this caliber gets warm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m my own barber</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Awesome and very close trim.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anyone wanting to line their own hair.</li>
            <li> This one is really nice.</li>
            <li> Not even worth returning it!!!</li>
            <li> He is very impressed with it compare to the older model that he had</li>
            <li> Perfect for free haircuts and quick trims at home.  </li>
            <li> but for a quick line up and clean your face up this works awesome.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, and the GTX blade makes it just that better.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is the best out of 5 trimmers i have owned so far.</li>
            <li> Great powerful Trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps me from tearing up the razor blades which saves me money and keeps the razor blades in good condition so that they cut smooth and shaving feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these are by far the best on the market</li>
            <li> The best clipper I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This product came in very handy and us powerful(: met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I own most all the top trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> But I own 7 pairs of trimmers and find myself using the gtx outliner more and more.  </li>
            <li> the best hair an beard trimmer i bought gets really close for a clean shave without the razor burn</li>
            <li> Hits just fine out of the box!</li>
            <li> nice and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> He used to use the gray one and that was his favorite.</li>
            <li> This product came on top of my list.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I know the detailers are most barber&#x27;s choice</li>
            <li> but these are in the top name trimmers......</li>
            <li> Extra power when you need it with a wider blade perfect combination 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and it works better for my skin/beard.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using this to shave more frequently, the blade it came with isn&#x27;t really ideal for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He has tried many and this one seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I got these today the day after I cut my hair but tried them anyway just to see if they cleared up better then</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to buy these clippers.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite trimmers of all time.</li>
            <li> and im completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> ONLY IF it did what its suppose to do best !</li>
            <li> Additionally, they do take a bit more maintenance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more blades.</li>
            <li> My headliners trimmers work better than this one.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> but this is the better of them all.</li>
            <li> it get used at mexico and my uclce love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try it again as I really enjoyed the trimmers power and accuracy.</li>
            <li> This my top choice for a pair of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> i love this thing.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother because he said it&#x27;s top of the line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EVEN BETTER than the Outliner II -</li>
            <li> Ok product but will not buy again</li>
            <li> But it cuts ok</li>
            <li> needed to raise to make sharper. will be buying more andis products from now on .</li>
            <li> I love Andis&#x27; products</li>
            <li> but I still think the Wahl Detailers are better.</li>
            <li> and I must say one of the best especially for beards.</li>
            <li> no complaints :)</li>
            <li> BUT the outliner 2 is still better.</li>
            <li> But longer is not always better.</li>
            <li> I put so many people on these liners.</li>
            <li> great power, nice durable cord, don&#x27;t get hot...and are nice and quiet...</li>
            <li> and I have used just about every top trimmer on the market.</li>
            <li> I choose to use more than one type of trimmer</li>
            <li> Better than any others I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Still one of the best trimmers ever &amp; essential tool for barbers!</li>
            <li> the hit ok</li>
            <li> really great at shaping up and also on facial hair a good buy :)</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> I does not cut as close as advertised, could be better</li>
            <li> It might be a bit overdone if you are just using it at home like me, but I am sure it will hold up well.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the performance and the cut of the blades.  </li>
            <li> I thought I finally found the perfect combination of shaver and travel clippers.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very precise and a nice clean shave&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used.. won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> Better then original t-outliners!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome liner for course hair and they do get hot sort of fast.</li>
            <li> Trims nicely and cleanly.</li>
            <li> This is a great high quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good trimmers.</li>
            <li> Most times I let it go at that, but I can also easily shave that off if I want to.</li>
            <li> This Outliner is perfect for dry shaving after you cut with a 0.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> But if you just want then to cut like Subzero(making the line to fade or shaving your head or beard) DONT even try to adjust them, they cut more than perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Though I am not a barber I think that if you are using them to do simple lines of the face and hairline they are very good.</li>
            <li> I love, gives a smooth shave, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> it came super fast and worked really great.</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking for a excellent set of trimmers that cuts sharp outlines on a persons head</li>
            <li> but there is no thumb bar on the side to make them longer or shorter other than that they&#x27;re awesome</li>
            <li> wow this is the best clippers i have ever owned, i should have purchased this item a long time ago, really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to adjust, easy to take apart, easy to clean and works great other wise</li>
            <li> Great Tliner i&#x27;d buy more in the future</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend Precisioner from Promate.</li>
            <li> It is strong like the styliner and gets close like the outliner 2,</li>
            <li> Very strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> right now runs smooth and leaves nice crispy lines.</li>
            <li> Need slight adjustment to be zero gapped, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> All three products I had received looked like it had been opened and used, even saw fine bits of hair on the blade.</li>
            <li> This performed absolutely perfect; Until it died after less than 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> I love my new clippers great product and very affordable price.</li>
            <li> Bought one and it worked pretty good but overheated SUPER quick.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of andis have been using them for 6 yrs now.</li>
            <li> These are great for daily face trimming as well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The replacement has been going great for almost daily shaving and monthly haircuts for about 4 months now.</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t another credible option for a T trimmer than the Andis.</li>
            <li> Took Only 3 days to get and they worked great.</li>
            <li> they cut low and feel great in the hands.</li>
            <li> Runs cooler &amp; slightly more powerful than reg t-outliner.</li>
            <li> After opening it, the clipper was wrapped in a cheap plastic materia with holes on it?</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I wanted something more powerful than those battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have a quality feel and sound.  </li>
            <li> Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Would never buy again, even if its offered  for free.</li>
            <li> It smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> They are both great trimmers but for totally different uses.  </li>
            <li> these are great outliners and tremors or just shave it as close as possible</li>
            <li> The buzz sound is audible but not annoying.</li>
            <li> It has a more powerful motor that Oster Outliner with or without the T blade.</li>
            <li> Its cuts close without any niches to the skin or snags to the hair that occurs from using cheap (Walfart) clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for shaving a light beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> Adjusting it too far in will result in not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Right now though, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is easy: just wipe with a cloth and spray on the Andis cool care spray cleaner/lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new favorite!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who cuts their own hair.  </li>
            <li> smooth clippers great for dry shaving</li>
            <li> My original t-outliner stood up for 14 years .  </li>
            <li> I originally zero gapped the blade, but it was a bit too close.</li>
            <li> Always keeps me looking fresh out of the barber shop!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the best advice I can give: Loosen the head on it, and get the blades as close to the end of the guard as you can without going past it.</li>
            <li> once you do some adjusting like with any clippers, you are GOLDEN!</li>
            <li> BEST TRIMMERS better than the regular t-out-liners is basically the same thing just upgraded, and it comes with a 3 prong power cable no wall mart</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2/27/15&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with the original outliner blade.  </li>
            <li> the original outliner 2.  </li>
            <li> But any trimmer will get hot if you are using it for more than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer worked fine while it lasted but completely but broke under it&#x27;s own power.  </li>
            <li> until i dropped them a few too many times lol.</li>
            <li> they work great for dry shaving and close trimming of mustache and sideburns.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even cut the hairs cleanly off anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use it to shave and clean up my shape ups.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean up the lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> its not gonna get that baby smooth super close shave</li>
            <li> Everytime I give an edge up people always ask what type of trimmers are those because they cut so clean.</li>
            <li> I would recommend adjusting the blade to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> It gives me a clean cut the way I want it.</li>
            <li> Not the easiest machine to clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry shaving and maintenance cuts.</li>
            <li> Very good clipper, just wish it would shape the beard a little closer, but would buy again.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is very very precise and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> If I had to describe this particular clippers, I would have to describe it has, an indispensable and responsive trimmer, the one in question, helping create an appealing outline.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a very good product with few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> The Gtx trimmer works wonderfully on ethnic hair, and zipps right through fine hair, but seems to pull on thick brown hair,  out of all my clients</li>
            <li> it is not as great as expected.</li>
            <li> come super clean.</li>
            <li> Really well built and top quality in a trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you are a barber you are better off using the T-Outliners with an adjusted blade really.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a trimmer to get really close their for some reason, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Amazon delivered them on time and safe not to mention reasonable, Thanx</li>
            <li> I used this item to square up my hair cut in front about every other week for me and my sons and it works great.</li>
            <li> Pefect smooth clean line up , doesnt get hot to quick</li>
            <li> Built quality is very nice and nice thick wire !</li>
            <li> They were fine out of the box, but I need them crisp</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> and they get super close.</li>
            <li> they are much more powerful and the blade is much deeper and they run cooler</li>
            <li> It was shipped and received fairly quickly with no issues from the seller.</li>
            <li> it will take a few tries to adjust it to be perfect, but once you find the sweet spot, its amazing</li>
            <li> gets very hot and almost unbearable to touch.</li>
            <li> but they cut very very close to the skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be good if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> Love my new clippers.</li>
            <li> The O8770 is a slightly upgraded and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It cut really close and is easy to control.</li>
            <li> but they last long and are great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Fast and easy shaving&lt;</li>
            <li> In the past, I have owned the Outliner II, which was a good trimmer, but this one is even better.  </li>
            <li> , I Always Wanted That Crisp Clean Line Up</li>
            <li> Very smooth, quiet, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love these things nice sharp crisp line that won&#x27;t dig into your skin and cut u</li>
            <li> These are my second set but my new favorite!!</li>
            <li> The only con I could find with the GTX clippers is that the clippers do get hot the longer you use them but other than that they are definitely a good investment for men who want a good trimmer and those who suffer from razor bumps, ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li> if you get a cheap one with not that much power.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close to the skin and smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus, because it means you can get a closer shave than most traditional trimmers you can purchase at the store.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing simply set the blade and go no need to tune like the gray versions&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, but for a closer cut you will need to purchase (Andis Replacement Hair Trimmer Blade (04521))</li>
            <li> Seems the same as the gray ones.. comes with attachments though, which is nice..</li>
            <li> That was also a success.</li>
            <li> So Fresh Out</li>
            <li> But even if it dies within a couple of years, it will have been worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite trimmer</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> worth the money and time I put in to shave.</li>
            <li> powerful.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money...</li>
            <li> Hopefully I get my moneys worth with this product.</li>
            <li> nice clippers, bought them for someones birthday only after buying them I discovered they bought them for themselves as a bday gift.</li>
            <li> I zero-gapped them and they are SHARP perfect for crisp clean linings, only one thing DONT APPLY ALOT OF PRESSURE.</li>
            <li> Work easily and don&#x27;t get hot fast.</li>
            <li> Garbage... Gets super hot</li>
            <li> The trimmer gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> awesome clipper..hits hard out of the box,is perfect with a few minor adjustments...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more interested in that because I more so use a straight razor for the overall shape up.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this trimmer particularly the blade.</li>
            <li> When they come out the box they are not that sharp, but if you know how to adjust them they are good trimmers.</li>
            <li> This clipper is good compared to other ones I have been using.</li>
            <li> Sure this thing may have a super powerful motor, but what good is that if it cannot cut a balding man&#x27;s thin hair.</li>
            <li> It cuts just the right length where it looks like I just shaved</li>
            <li> It trims the hair right to the scalp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve a glide when the blade is set right.</li>
            <li> right out the box</li>
            <li> Clean lines and very close.</li>
            <li> so if you dont have a clipper available you can do some decent fades and tapers with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I clean it too much, or the cleaner that I use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and much faster than my Con Air as well!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great of trimming and lining a beard which is pointless when I&#x27;m shaving my head and beard.</li>
            <li> It stay cool and much</li>
            <li> I love it for the silence and my husband loves it because he can use it everyday, easy to clean, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Unscrew and removed the top blade, then loosen the two small screws to the retainer guide and adjust the guide to meet the very edge of the top blade for a closer and fine cut to shape lines.  </li>
            <li> cord is very long, which is nice,  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought cheaper $10-$20 trimmers, but they weren&#x27;t too good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, these are some pretty darn good clippers, but not really worth the investment.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because I had previously owned outliner 1 which was good for  almost two years.</li>
            <li> It was very hot and the blade does not shave very well, I&#x27;ll have to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watched several videos on youtube to make sure I was doing it right.</li>
            <li> Very noisy and gets hot too quickly.</li>
            <li> Also very fast to shave with them.</li>
            <li> It gets very very close.</li>
            <li> Very strong the blade is super sharp.</li>
            <li> always clean, and oil after each use, but it&#x27;s starting to sound like something inside</li>
            <li> I own the older model with the regular motor</li>
            <li> I did cut myself on the neck a cuple times the first time because I was &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose thanks!</li>
            <li> Also if you want to improve its closeness to even a higher degree look into buying an anivo blade setter or replacement blades from mdbarber.com</li>
            <li> It literally shaves so close that it looks like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (which is exactly what I wanted).  </li>
            <li> I just wished it didn&#x27;t get so hot after 5-10 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> Get hot</li>
            <li> First of all let me just put it out there that shipping was extremely first.</li>
            <li> Overall they are ok.</li>
            <li> My whiskers are fairly thick, and there are a lot of them, and this does a great job.</li>
            <li> By the time it was used, we realized it gets really HOT and unbearably to HOLD.</li>
            <li> but everytime i use it gets so hot</li>
            <li> They are very noisy and they are not cutting like the gtx that I bought out of the hair store.</li>
            <li> After I Did My First Shape</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised with precision.</li>
            <li> With that said, I&#x27;ve gone through many different types of trimmers, ranging from cordless to corded, adjustable blades etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the FIRST trimmer where I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;m getting close to the equipment that barbershops or salons use.</li>
            <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my skin stung after shaving with the Andis GTX.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powerful for the price, however, you do have to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice these getting hot at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also is a much more solid build.</li>
            <li> you know what”… Adjust them and they’re ready to go!</li>
            <li> people might say it gets hot.</li>
            <li> it might not get hot.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty durable</li>
            <li> I love the tiny guards it comes with to shape up clients beards.</li>
            <li> It will get hot after about 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use</li>
            <li> However it can get awefully hot over a period of usage</li>
            <li> Decided that i&#x27;d drop more money on a trimmer that i could have the rest of my life possibly.</li>
            <li> Also, the clippers get way too hot.  </li>
            <li> The first time i used it it worked like a champ.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot for awhile</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer head is shaped differently than most I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> and they get hot as he</li>
            <li> prongs cords doesn&#x27;t give you more power it only for ground wire.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I am a barber and have used about every trimmer on the market.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not shiny since about the first month of use.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to a friend because it does what it should and does it well :)</li>
            <li> It would have gotten 5 stars but it gets really hot after like 15-20 mins...</li>
            <li> Im about to send it to Andis for repair, which will take the better part of a month to get back.</li>
            <li> Returned and got a replacement which is a little better but also overheats very quick, after about two mins of leaving it on it</li>
            <li> I love it , gives sharp lines and clean shaves &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> so i tried it and it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 minuted without being EXTREMELY HOT!!!</li>
            <li> it also comes with adjustable combs that were very helpful and the right size.</li>
            <li> My friend and barber for nearly 15 years told me to look into this unit because of the thicker and better cord assembly when i was ready for a new one.</li>
            <li> They are more quiet than metal and much cooler after extended use</li>
            <li> Great Professional tool for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> It also gets the top back of my head very close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shavers but I think so far this one is the best.easy to use and have a pretty good grip.</li>
            <li> He gets a very close shave look when he uses it to trim his face and a very straight edge up line.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference from the the regular grey Andis trimmer but it is better for cleaning up a fade because of the deeper teeth gives more flexibility.</li>
            <li> Still doesn&#x27;t get hot fast.</li>
            <li> first you have to adjust the blades, do your line up, then go over with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> Mine came straight from Amazon so no questionable sellers to blame.</li>
            <li> getting this product i was really looking forward to using them but on my first client the razor BLEW UP</li>
            <li> I will exchange it and see if another one works as I had good luck with this manufacturer in the past.</li>
            <li> Good product but not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> if you have a nice thick beard and want to keep it looking clean, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update::</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for very long because the edge of the stationary blade somehow broke after a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> The teeth chips on both the outer and inner blade easily making it an unreliable tool.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot, has plenty of power, very durable, high quality build that andis is known for!</li>
            <li> good for personal use but wouldnt reccomend for a barber to use all day long</li>
            <li> It was also more powerful than old Andis Outliner (the grey one).</li>
            <li> I find the GTX much more powerful than your typical beard trimmer doing a faster and cleaner job.</li>
            <li> to fast</li>
            <li> but I earned how to maneuver it more carefully.</li>
            <li> They work better than expected.</li>
            <li> Andis 4775 GTX T-Outline, absolutely kicks ass.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Not so much the blade, but the body of the clipper, over the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimmer works really well</li>
            <li> these are some great trimmers they are the only ones i use, but the only issue i have is that on the box it says guard included and when i open up the box there wasn&#x27;t any there.</li>
            <li> Anyone one who wants to buy a trimmer and doesnt want to go pay that $13 barber fee.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Very Quite&lt;</li>
            <li> It does cut very well</li>
            <li> When i received it, it came very well packed.</li>
            <li> REALLY??</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reason for removing 1 star: The trimmer is a bit loud, but not crazy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get these adjusted for a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Very dependable</li>
            <li> Works well. 0 gapped the blade and cuts very close.</li>
            <li> Andis have really done it this time.</li>
            <li> and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> States that the cut is very close</li>
            <li> it cuts very close for a trimmer (after you adjust the blades).</li>
            <li> hahaha just kidding.</li>
            <li> I believe they serve their purpose very well.</li>
            <li> They also clip very well.  </li>
            <li> The Gtx provides a very close shave that leaves a bit stubble  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the vibration extremely intense, so literally after using it for 5 minutes, my had is tingling.</li>
            <li> Straight out the box</li>
            <li> It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t break skin.</li>
            <li> As a barber I cannot stress how much I rely on my tools to provide a quality service and this trimmer allows me to offer that to my clients and customers.</li>
            <li> The cord on this is also very sturdy when compared to the gray t-outliner I have.  </li>
            <li> I have saved soo much money on hair cuts and the boys look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li> Oster Fast Feeds from this crowd for my Birthday.</li>
            <li> The Norelco&#x27;s did a fair job cutting and were fairly comfortable but this Andis trimmer gets as close as a blade without the irritation!</li>
            <li> Good solid product over all, but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> You are better off buying the  Andis professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer.</li>
            <li> They do stay cooler longer, and are sharp right out of the box, but they aren&#x27;t easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I gave this trimmer a chance, because I had 3 other trimmers, and I did not see the point, buying another Andis trimmer,</li>
            <li> If this trimmer is from Cosmetic Central, this is NOT an original Andis.  </li>
            <li> The body is also smaller than most trimmers we&#x27;ve had in the past, which means it fits in my hands better.  </li>
            <li> If you tackle pompadours, fades, gentleman&#x27;s, line ups, shaves, buzzes, finish work, outlines, older folks, young guys, even kids, this thing does not bite and hits right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Being in a profession that doesn&#x27;t require daily shaves lets me use the 08770 to clean things up when needed.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the trimmer themselves seem to be okay, but the box makes me seriously think against the product being new.</li>
            <li> Superb trimmer, however appear to procure relatively torrid and feel the necessity to let it sit for at least 10 or so minute, prior to avail oneself of it again.</li>
            <li> Not good didn&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li> Good for short hair only and for a short time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bald guy with full facial hair!</li>
            <li> but Ill learn not to apply as much pressure, overall they are very good trimmers!</li>
            <li> Ok trimmer this was bought to replace my other and is clippers because they had stopped moving.theese are pretty powerful and does get hot after 10 minutes.the blade is sharp but just a little unbalanced and I can&#x27;t fix it to save my life but overall theese are good shape up clippers</li>
            <li> If you look and the teeth of the blade, it is the equivalent of the Promate Blade, only the Promate Blade has a copper coating that looks cool and the heavy cord generates more power to the trimmer and really makes you feel that power.</li>
            <li> The T-edges get the really close precise detailing and the wide shape</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t replace a regular wet shave, I can now comfortably use this to clean up and outline my beard instead of shaving.</li>
            <li> Plus what guy doesn’t love anything in black.</li>
            <li> I mainly use to trim my beard and mustache using the included combs.</li>
            <li> than that it is the same outstanding personal trimmer i.e. motor, casing, blades etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I brought the Andis gto trimmer, and to keep it short and simple</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the main function of this machine.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer, got enough power and trims really low.  </li>
            <li> But when i first purchased my first trimmer it came with 4 hair clips and the second one with i bought from this seller</li>
            <li> and I asked him how I can get this particular clipper</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a buddy present to line you up in the back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oster Classic for years but combined with an outliner, it&#x27;s a bit bulky for travel.</li>
            <li> These bad boys are powerful,  precise and very smooth!</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Andis trimmers since I was in high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> especially seen I already own the other version.</li>
            <li> The blades are not sharp and they get hot.</li>
            <li> Thought I would spend a little more and buy these clippers.</li>
            <li> trimmers are extremely sharp and easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> The trimmer produces sharp edges and cuts well through any length of hair easily.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to be able to use this to clean up my beard instead of having to wet shave, but it doesnt cut close enough, and even after zero gapping it, it will not replace a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will suggest investing in the Andis cool care plus clipper blade cleaner to really clean the blades and keeping cutting good for a long time.</li>
            <li> They get a little warm but cool down in the 10 min between uses.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> These were brand new with decent power.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> The only thing is they get hot fast.</li>
            <li> I prefer andis over the other major brands because I&#x27;ve always had a better cut with them than the others.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box it would occasionally rattle as if something were tumbling inside it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very solid and compact and the switch is nice and tight.</li>
            <li> My barber recommended it, but it&#x27;s too heavy and vibrates too much for the fine control I need.  </li>
            <li> I dont understand why someone would do this and ask for a price of almost brand new one.</li>
            <li> And here I am (in Sept 2013) searching for a new one.</li>
            <li> I will try to find a new one.</li>
            <li> i bought a new one.  </li>
            <li> Seller claims its new?</li>
            <li> I planned on exchanging for a new one, but the seller did not have any in stock</li>
            <li> in hand&lt;br /&gt;-nice new style of blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Outliner II for a bald/headshave for close to 25 years and when it was time for a new clipper, decided on this one.</li>
            <li> Recommend purchasing clippers in country to ensure their made for the voltage of where you live.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in new condition as stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new blade and will update this review based on how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had a wahl peanut before but wanted a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> My new #1 trimmers..</li>
            <li> The second one looked exactly like the first one I had returned, the deep scratch on the metal side was in the same exact place, I even took a picture of it!</li>
            <li> I use this on everybody from older gentleman to young kids.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a professional look.</li>
            <li> The trimmer its good when it comes to power, the power cord its long, and the design its really good, but when it comes about the blade its really bad because its not adjusted properly from factory si</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer i accidentally dropped my first trimmer and broke the teeth on it</li>
            <li> These, by far, leave the sharpest line of them all!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get really hot and runs really quietly.</li>
            <li> Its pretty quiet too.</li>
            <li> I used to use the back of my Nerelco to first trim, and then i shave.</li>
            <li> Cut my throat in two different places on first use.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall to all of the andis trimmers I have used it that they all get hot.  </li>
            <li> Looked for a very long time and finally I&#x27;ve found an outstanding, sharp, powerful edger.</li>
            <li> I mean, it still gets the job done, but the older model is better.</li>
            <li> Mine now won&#x27;t turn on after less than two months of light use.</li>
            <li> While every electric razor I have owned, including expensive ones, has not cut very close and caused skin irritation, this trimmer cuts close quickly and easily and causes no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp trimmer but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as regular t outliner does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. Keeps cool longer than other T outliners.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought it will be better than my old one (04710), but after several use, I concluded that it&#x27;s not worth the price or the hype claimed by Andis.</li>
            <li> came back on amazon looking for new blade options, didn&#x27;t really see anything.</li>
            <li> The Andes hair cutting tool was recommended by my dogs groomer, and is the tool used by a lot of younger barbers, my grand son is very good at cutting hair and is working in a barber shop in San Francisco California, he learned to cut hair on his own in his garage by cutting his friends hair, he has been schooled and is in training for his license certificate, and wants to open his own barber shop, he very determined to do this as his career.</li>
            <li> There is no rattling or loud noises but the edging power seems to be kind of weak.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the T-Outliner, but it does get a little hot after about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> The coil in this item is one half the size of the original and the rewiring was patched with tape.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and this one helps keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> Now, I may have not read the description clearly but these trimmers are not for shaping stubble.</li>
            <li> Complete BS dont ever buy these</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Christmas present and it came fast</li>
            <li> the only flaw is that it gets hotter than I&#x27;d like much faster than it rightfully should..</li>
            <li> My skin type is extremely sensitive and razors (yes, even the Mach 3) cause skin irritation which lead to acne spots.  </li>
            <li> A regular shaver can&#x27;t handle that much, so I use a trimmer instead.</li>
            <li> As a guy who didn&#x27;t try to fight baldness from an early age, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head once a week since I was 22.</li>
            <li> It has turned my wife into a professional barber!(well almost)</li>
            <li> It makes a loud noise.  </li>
            <li> Used these twice so far</li>
            <li> Wooow,I been cutting for 28yrs and never has a trimmer come close to the andis Gtx, My job has become easier and more enjoyable, Not only that</li>
            <li> but they still do get hot if using for a long time.</li>
            <li> it rattles loudly when I turn it over.</li>
            <li> edit: works after much tweeking with the internals-made possible with the help of YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll dust off my 4 year old Oster Outliner and avoid Andis completely going forward.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy, but I must say that my peanut clipper can get closer to the skin but don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get no little breakouts or rashes I do with razors.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t do the heavy work of an Oster 76 classic but they are complimentary products.</li>
            <li> I know some people have had mixed experiences with the product, some negative and some positive, with regards to closeness in shaping fine lines around the hair line.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I am giving 4 stars is the first one showed up and only lasted 3 cycles of the switch....</li>
            <li> Nice, deep tooth blade is a little different, but overall they get the job done</li>
            <li> But overall, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am noticing is that the metal on the top where the screws are is starting to bend up a little on one side but that could of been from anything.</li>
            <li> tried to use it to shave the sides of a high and tight on my son, and noticed a spot got really hot.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that it vibrates a lot (probably normal for a trimmer of this power) but it does not interfere with my control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavier than expected, but also much higher quality.  </li>
            <li> I am left with a broken trimmer that is good enough for the trash.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for cleaning up my face and goatee, instead of shaving due to my very coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> now my only ideas of buying any hair clippings our new blade for the ones that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> You actually get the one with the new and improved switch.</li>
            <li> Just started cutting my own hair and these make it so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This broke after only a few months of light use.</li>
            <li> that in upgrading the cord to a grounded 3 wire version they also switched to a much stiffer cord stock which make storing the clipper more difficult.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t get hot like the old ones do, and they are sharp!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no other competition for this product.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other one with a gray colored plastic body, this does feel more heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> I have to scrub with it a little but its worth it.</li>
            <li> of them have generally sucked, for one reason or another.</li>
            <li> and he barely misses his old one that finally gave out after years.</li>
            <li> complaint is that it gets hot quite fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it begins making some loud grinding noises, out of the blue.</li>
            <li> Adjusting the retainer guide too far out will result in a possible skin cut.  </li>
            <li> But once I oiled it again, it was back in action.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it and go back to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I pulled out my old facial hair trimmer and completed the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> and they repeated the same behavior in a hotel bathroom sparking poping with light smoke coming from the unit big waste of money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use the trimmer yet because the blade was broken when it arrived, but the rating will stay as 1 star until I receive a working trimmer and can try it out.</li>
            <li> once one learns the formula behind adjusting the blade, the results will be satisfying.  </li>
            <li> That might make this a little less safe to use, although it would make the trim even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got lots of redness at first, and after I started cleaning after EVERY use, it went down.  </li>
            <li> They stopped working on me after the first time use which took less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The switch on this model is a bit easier to use than my old Andis which finally gave up the ghost after 15 years of constant use.</li>
            <li> i bought this trimmer instead of my usual gray trimmer by andis because the black on is suppose to be better.  </li>
            <li> My first Andis also performed  the same way after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Close enough that I can barely see the shadow.</li>
            <li> I only use these for personal use however so in a professional setting this may be a different story.  </li>
            <li> This has same power consumption (10Watts) of the T-Outliner II or Outliner but runs smoother, takes a little longer (maybe 10 additional minutes) to get hot compared to Outliner.</li>
            <li> I also use an old toothbrush to brush the hair off the blade as I&#x27;m dry shaving.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it gets a little hot a little fast.</li>
            <li> The trimmer still has the same characteristic of all of the other andis trimmers “they get hot than a</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does cut well, and is comfortable, but after a few uses, I noticed some odd noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The box actually looked old and loose.</li>
            <li> It is sized somewhere in between our large clippers and the really small ones that don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only negative is they still will get hot if used for face and head.</li>
            <li> usually 1-2 minutes only for my whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Power is also a problem, as the hair I DO have left tends to be pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Same as the grey andis t-outliner model.  </li>
            <li> I expect them to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I go several days without shaving and my beard growth is too long for a razor</li>
            <li> I also oil the blades every time I use the clippers, I put three drops of oil in different places on the blade while the blade is running for not too long.</li>
            <li> Not sharp like cut you sharp</li>
            <li> They are a lot cheaper and dont last very long.</li>
            <li> , I use a trimmer to do most of the beard cutting and only use a razor for finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> who wants to go to a barber shop and spend at least $13 on a hair cut plus a shave?</li>
            <li> It becomes a chore trimming one day, wet shaving the next, and using scissors day 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not think this trimmer could make a significant difference, but I was wrong it makes a significant difference, and I&#x27;m glad I added it to my already insane trimmer arsenal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about long term durability.</li>
            <li> but its going to pull hair all day long on your face.</li>
            <li> These clippers has long teeth to get into the skin</li>
            <li> I have been looking to get it for a long time</li>
            <li> I WAITED SO LONG TO PURCHASE THEM</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a world of difference in dry face shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular gray outliner and this is even a few steps above it!</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not new.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the second cut she became blind and did not cut more than one side of the blade!!!</li>
            <li> Worst clippers, snapped after less than 4 months when i was grooming myself for a very important occasion right in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> All they did was change the color from grey to black and give it a different name.</li>
            <li> The first one arrived with a broken blade.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very sharp and can actually be used for dry shaving under the chin and on the neck area without causes razor bumps and in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> Screws came loose and casing came off.</li>
            <li> It may be a loose screw... will replace and report&lt;</li>
            <li> Only half of the clipper would cut.  </li>
            <li> Nothing different besides the black casing and the GTX blade.</li>
            <li> negatives - very loud, cheap looking and slightly dull cutting</li>
            <li> I moved it a little back</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting, no snagging or pinching or irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spent 70 dollars on it and they had a lot of hair and looked used.</li>
            <li> I can compare this trimmer to the Wahl Detailer which I still believe cuts closer with the T Wide Blade</li>
            <li> The trimmer broke after a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected and has been doing the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I buzz my husband&#x27;s head a few times a month, and we&#x27;ve gone through three trimmers in the last four years.  </li>
            <li> The item does not perform as I had expected.</li>
            <li> These are very heavy duty clippers that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I became tired of those turn to adjust beard trimmers, since they sometimes shifted to a different setting, and mainly because they gave an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> these are not the grey trimmers just in a black case</li>
            <li> But it seems that after a few months you will definitely notice everything going down hill....</li>
            <li> One does not replace the other.</li>
            <li> the go hand in hand with each other.</li>
            <li> If you &#x27;re looking for trimmers buy this one,and you will never buy any other.</li>
            <li> my other trimmers</li>
            <li> but that is expected!</li>
            <li> When I used the trimmer it worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer gave me a barber like sharp hairline.</li>
            <li> There were also some scratches along the metal below the blade, probably from the manufacturing process, but other than that it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Small, solid, and substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It Was Sharp.</li>
            <li> I have had other brands</li>
            <li> It turns out that it was due to shaving with the moving blade against the skin.</li>
            <li> Blade wasn&#x27;t fully sharp</li>
            <li> the blade is not as sharp as you would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is my opinion and other people</li>
            <li> The other one I have is a plug with two tabs on it.  </li>
            <li> With the bathroom door closed I do not hear anything!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any extreme heat.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has extremely sharp blades, and delivers an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if I store it blade down, wipe off with a damp cloth, or minimally use the cleaning liquid.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model specifically for shaping and trimming fine lines behind the ears, mustash, gotee and behind the neck line.  </li>
            <li> I have dry shave everyday.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using it continuously for 10 minutes it will get very hot and to the point that you&#x27;re either shutting it off or holding it awkwardly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer will handle it and not bog down like other trimmers.</li>
            <li> This one however seems to be less sharp.</li>
            <li> If the gray ones work for you its not worth the &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the disenfectant will coat the entire unit and make it greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> it is not built to last past a few months.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one will actually last a year at least.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Outliner has small teeth for stubborn grey hair.</li>
            <li> hated to return them they look sooooooo nice and everything came as stated</li>
            <li> it is powerful and cuts hair very sharp without cutting into the skin.</li>
            <li> They even come with guards if you want to trim your mustache, eyebrows, and beard down.</li>
            <li> Just a little sharp may need to be adjusted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and needed adjusting</li>
            <li> I do prefer it in black.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, this clipper has a malfunction that blade replacement will not correct.</li>
            <li> No full hair cuts.</li>
            <li> my lines look like some put a ruler on my forehead before they started cutting, thats how crisp it is.</li>
            <li> Very sharp cut with little effort.</li>
            <li> and they did they got hair that my other trimmers left behind</li>
            <li> The power cord is three pronged and thick, so that is an improvement over the grey ones.</li>
            <li> The picture is a little off.</li>
            <li> but with a little blade adjustment and a little adjustment on the tension screw</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp!!</li>
            <li> a few observations.</li>
            <li> , I would say heavy duty.</li>
            <li> , I got harsh razor burn before I started cleaning it after every use.</li>
            <li> Might be heavy for some</li>
            <li> gave me few cuts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but I might give it a show in a few months.</li>
            <li> Thicker cord, which reminds me of my heavy duty tools.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in Japan I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these even with a converter can become an issue and waste of your money.</li>
            <li> and I we use is just about almost everyday on grooming our son in ourselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these before but the newer gtx has a few differences.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a few attachments if you&#x27;re not into buzzing someone&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and well made.</li>
            <li> and i tried it on a few clients i was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they started sparking, poping and it killed the power socket in my bathroom</li>
            <li> Other than that my biggest complaint is the heat on the body of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> For those of us that cannot use razors (because of razor bumps); this product in my experience is not a strong alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber in training and have been testing out clippers for the past few months</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and was worried about it getting caught up in the blades like it has with previous hair trimmers I have owned, but I didn&#x27;t get one snag.  </li>
            <li> very little noise</li>
            <li> the trimmer could be ready to use because when you use it for shaving or anything else the blade pull the hair so bad that it could make you bleed</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with an Andis, this is my second</li>
            <li> still use this to trim my beard, I usually keep it at 1/4&amp;#34; or 1/8&amp;#34; depending on the season.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small bottle of oil, which is not a lot</li>
            <li> Once I flipped the clipper over so that the stationary blade was against the skin there was no more after-sting.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use them for excessive amounts of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its the blade or not</li>
            <li> I have had Wahl hair clippers in the past and this blows them out of the water.  </li>
            <li> Its a little on the loud side but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> had to replace the stock blade due to a broken tooth.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed because I really wanted this trimmer to work out.  </li>
            <li> that I can hardly tell a difference in using this versus a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just wish it came with a hard carry case instead of needing to keep the box and plastic packing tray</li>
            <li> The deep tooth blade allows you to get a close shave without cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return but its too late si</li>
            <li> which really sucks</li>
            <li> Even worse, I noticed the link to the warranty information on the Amazon product page leads to a dead end.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it can&#x27;t be used in Barbados due to their Elec.</li>
            <li> Such a useless product !</li>
            <li> I tried cutting my sons hair thats about 3 inches long</li>
            <li> For those who say its the same as the regular Andis outliners are just insane.</li>
            <li> The blade is a little bit too thin for my liking, and the extra thick power cord is just annoying.</li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement and will update this review if it was just a bad unit and the next one works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and break out horribly if I use a blade on my neck.</li>
            <li> Let me say that Andis got their game up with these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Andis now has a competitor in the cut game versus the Wahl Detailer and this trimmer</li>
            <li> One thing that stood out to me, the heavy duty 8-foot cord, it allows me to move around while cutting.</li>
            <li> I gave a poor rating because it did work correctly out of the box.  </li>
            <li> If you run it along your face too fast you might end up pulling hairs, which we all know is one of the worst feelings ever.</li>
            <li> Looks like used and refurbished, scratches all over the body and 4 teeth on the one side of the blade are broken.</li>
            <li> so is it false advertisement or</li>
            <li> Disappointed because its shaving power seems less than outliner 1.</li>
            <li> Buy it without hesitation - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with quality Andis liners.</li>
            <li> ,i used them 2 times and it was scary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M JUST SORRY</li>
            <li> i mean bad</li>
            <li> I wanted a pair of clippers that could both give a close shave, and for cutting in my beard lines.</li>
            <li> Then you will notice it isn&#x27;t even cutting correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two andis t outliners and can tell a difference in cutting power.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it, oiled it, and it just stopped cutting.</li>
            <li> The Andis trimmer did not work, I try cutting hair and the blade adjust pull the hair.</li>
            <li> you wont regret it and your hairline will thank you...happy cutting.</li>
            <li> It shaves without cutting.</li>
            <li> Coil Inside blew up, Could have done serious damage to me or the client i got a nasty shock of the product to.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had. I have acne prone skin and this one helps keeps my face clear. It cuts just the right length where it looks like I just shaved and I don&#x27;t get no little breakouts or rashes I do with razors.  I did cut myself on the neck a cuple times the first time because I was &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; to fast but I earned how to maneuver it more carefully. Thank god for Andis I have dry shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and as described. I mainly use to trim my beard and mustache using the included combs. I find the GTX much more powerful than your typical beard trimmer doing a faster and cleaner job.</li>
            <li> The Andes hair cutting tool was recommended by my dogs groomer, and is the tool used by a lot of younger barbers, my grand son is very good at cutting hair and is working in a barber shop in San Francisco California, he learned to cut hair on his own in his garage by cutting his friends hair, he has been schooled and is in training for his license certificate, and wants to open his own barber shop, he very determined to do this as his career. So, I bought the&lt;br /&gt;Andes tools so he can proceed.</li>
            <li> I really am happy I ordered these trimmers. They work better than expected. I prefer andis over the other major brands because I&#x27;ve always had a better cut with them than the others.</li>
            <li> Andis 4775 GTX T-Outline, absolutely kicks ass. It&#x27;s powerful, but for a closer cut you will need to purchase (Andis Replacement Hair Trimmer Blade (04521)) separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no other competition for this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my husband and he&#x27;s happy with it. It&#x27;s very sharp and needed adjusting but that&#x27;s normal. He used to use the gray one and that was his favorite. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim (embarrassingly) nose and ear hair.  My barber recommended it, but it&#x27;s too heavy and vibrates too much for the fine control I need.  I had previously bought cheaper $10-$20 trimmers, but they weren&#x27;t too good.  This is overkill.</li>
            <li> had some Andis T-liners and they were awesome. until i dropped them a few too many times lol. So i panicked and saw these on here and saw some good reviews. Adding mine to that list</li>
            <li> Had it for years. Still going strong. Still doesn&#x27;t get hot fast. Still cuts low. I have to scrub with it a little but its worth it. Still gets low lol</li>
            <li> Exelente... recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> Was broke when I got them garbage</li>
            <li> Worst buy ever. I spent 70 dollars on it and they had a lot of hair and looked used. I dont understand why someone would do this and ask for a price of almost brand new one. They stopped working on me after the first time use which took less than 5 minutes. Complete BS dont ever buy these</li>
            <li> Like others have pointed to there definitely seem to be some quality control issues with these. Mine now won&#x27;t turn on after less than two months of light use.</li>
            <li> Product was Exactly what I wanted, and the Description was right on point!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Christmas present and it came fast but the blades were bent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. it does the work for what i bought this item. gives a good shape in the face!! just great!!</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose thanks!</li>
            <li> Ive used the standard andis t-outliners for years and have had to replace the cord several times. My friend and barber for nearly 15 years told me to look into this unit because of the thicker and better cord assembly when i was ready for a new one. He was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is the same outstanding personal trimmer i.e. motor, casing, blades etc. I do prefer it in black. It looks cleaner and stays looking cleaner especially if you&#x27;re a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few observations. Also if you want to improve its closeness to even a higher degree look into buying an anivo blade setter or replacement blades from mdbarber.com</li>
            <li> Great machine..the only flaw is that it gets hotter than I&#x27;d like much faster than it rightfully should..good for personal use but wouldnt reccomend for a barber to use all day long</li>
            <li> Great clipper. Very strong the blade is super sharp. Haircuts edge up come super clean. But the blade is so fragile it broke in 2 days</li>
            <li> ONE HAPPY CUSTOMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM HAPPIER THAN A HUNGRY DOOG ...... ON A MEAT WAGON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,,,, GREAT TRIMMER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.B. STINES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no barber but I do like these, wish I would have purchased the t outliners for corners. Would recommend they are great quality!</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and break out horribly if I use a blade on my neck. I tried several Norelco&#x27;s before purchising this trimmer. The Norelco&#x27;s did a fair job cutting and were fairly comfortable but this Andis trimmer gets as close as a blade without the irritation! I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Great. Dependable product.  My original t-outliner stood up for 14 years .  These are great for daily face trimming as well.</li>
            <li> Only reason I am giving 4 stars is the first one showed up and only lasted 3 cycles of the switch....&lt;br /&gt;The replacement has been going great for almost daily shaving and monthly haircuts for about 4 months now.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use the trimmer yet because the blade was broken when it arrived, but the rating will stay as 1 star until I receive a working trimmer and can try it out.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very very precise and cuts very close. I would recommend this trimmer to any barber or someone who cuts their own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I brought the Andis gto trimmer, and to keep it short and simple it&#x27;s a great bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> I have been doing some research for a trimmer so I can do my neck, around my hears and cut my kids hair. This product came on top of my list. very little noise, I would say heavy duty. I have seen barbers using this trimmer as well. I think that I will be good for awhile.</li>
            <li> Garbage... Gets super hot.. Have to keep shutting it off so I don&#x27;t burn my hand..</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a week of use do not buy this item it has to be a knock off I have one I got at Sally&#x27;s and the cords are different</li>
            <li> Nice pair of clippers. I wanted a pair of clippers that could both give a close shave, and for cutting in my beard lines. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> The best outliners I&#x27;ve ever used! 5 stars</li>
            <li> Love these clippers.  Just started cutting my own hair and these make it so much easier.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with them</li>
            <li> There just isn&#x27;t another credible option for a T trimmer than the Andis. The O8770 is a slightly upgraded and it does a great job. It cut really close and is easy to control. The switch on this model is a bit easier to use than my old Andis which finally gave up the ghost after 15 years of constant use. Being in a profession that doesn&#x27;t require daily shaves lets me use the 08770 to clean things up when needed. It can&#x27;t do the heavy work of an Oster 76 classic but they are complimentary products. One does not replace the other. My only quibble with this model is that in upgrading the cord to a grounded 3 wire version they also switched to a much stiffer cord stock which make storing the clipper more difficult. All in all this is a very good product with few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Great clippers!!! Has alot of power and give your clients that razor look. I know the detailers are most barber&#x27;s choice but these are in the top name trimmers......</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with an Andis, this is my second and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, making my head bald, of course  it&#x27;s not the main function of this machine.</li>
            <li> Extra power when you need it with a wider blade perfect combination 👍👍👍👌👌👌</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd pair of Andis trimmers. they work great for dry shaving and close trimming of mustache and sideburns. Really well built and top quality in a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Let me say that Andis got their game up with these trimmers. For those who say its the same as the regular Andis outliners are just insane. If you look and the teeth of the blade, it is the equivalent of the Promate Blade, only the Promate Blade has a copper coating that looks cool and the heavy cord generates more power to the trimmer and really makes you feel that power. I can compare this trimmer to the Wahl Detailer which I still believe cuts closer with the T Wide Blade but it looks and feels fragile. Andis now has a competitor in the cut game versus the Wahl Detailer and this trimmer is up there. I put the Promate blades on here and it is like heaven on a hairline. Recommended to all barbers and those who cit their own hair. You will feel and experience the difference.</li>
            <li> Pretty good trimmers. Took Only 3 days to get and they worked great. would highly recommend. Got them in combination with some clippers also. the go hand in hand with each other. Go and Buy.</li>
            <li> I bought andis trimmers before,(not this one)and was happy with them. This one is the best I have ever had. My husband uses them to cut his own hair and shape the edges and this one is the best yet. Love them. If you &#x27;re looking for trimmers buy this one,and you will never buy any other.</li>
            <li> Seems the same as the gray ones.. comes with attachments though, which is nice.. If the gray ones work for you its not worth the &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer solely for the purpose of \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; in the morning.  My skin type is extremely sensitive and razors (yes, even the Mach 3) cause skin irritation which lead to acne spots.  I used to have a rechargeable Con Air trimmer, but at best I would describe that as being sufficient.  This Andis GTX trimmer is amazing!  It literally shaves so close that it looks like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow (which is exactly what I wanted).  It&#x27;s powerful and much faster than my Con Air as well!  One swipe and the hair is gone, not requiring a second or third pass.  Cleanup is easy: just wipe with a cloth and spray on the Andis cool care spray cleaner/lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it vibrates a lot (probably normal for a trimmer of this power) but it does not interfere with my control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now look forward to shaving!</li>
            <li> Really good trimmer.  Best I ever used.  I highly recommend it to anyone who cuts their own hair.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Best trimmers I ever purchased. Andis for life!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I just wished it didn&#x27;t get so hot after 5-10 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I became tired of those turn to adjust beard trimmers, since they sometimes shifted to a different setting, and mainly because they gave an uneven cut.  This has been working perfect for giving a nice even beard.  I havent learned to fade yet, and probably wont even try.  I zero gapped mine but it has since been snagging.  I had hoped to be able to use this to clean up my beard instead of having to wet shave, but it doesnt cut close enough, and even after zero gapping it, it will not replace a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a must to get the disinfectant. I got lots of redness at first, and after I started cleaning after EVERY use, it went down.  Still not a replacement for a razor, but if you have a nice thick beard and want to keep it looking clean, this is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:: 2 years later&lt;br /&gt;I still use this to trim my beard, I usually keep it at 1/4&amp;#34; or 1/8&amp;#34; depending on the season. I originally zero gapped the blade, but it was a bit too close. I moved it a little back and it works better for my skin/beard. While it doesn&#x27;t replace a regular wet shave, I can now comfortably use this to clean up and outline my beard instead of shaving. It becomes a chore trimming one day, wet shaving the next, and using scissors day 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the disinfectant is a must, I got harsh razor burn before I started cleaning it after every use. I got the Andis blue liquid, dip this in and wipe off excess with tissue before storing it in the drawer. My one complaint is that the disenfectant will coat the entire unit and make it greasy feeling. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I store it blade down, wipe off with a damp cloth, or minimally use the cleaning liquid. It&#x27;s just a part of what it is. Everything can&#x27;t be perfect but this is close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came back on amazon looking for new blade options, didn&#x27;t really see anything. I have a very thick beard.  Now that I have been using this to shave more frequently, the blade it came with isn&#x27;t really ideal for that. It&#x27;s great for trimming the beard but won&#x27;t pickup evenly without the guards.al for that. It&#x27;s great for trimming the beard but won&#x27;t pickup evenly without the guards.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He has tried many and this one seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I got these today the day after I cut my hair but tried them anyway just to see if they cleared up better then my other trimmers and they did they got hair that my other trimmers left behind I was blown away great buy</li>
            <li> Had a pair of the beige color but they went out. Bought these as a replacement and they worked great!!! The only thing is that I have to replace the Blade after 10 months but they last long and are great!</li>
            <li> It works great!!!! Love this trimmer, got enough power and trims really low.  Blades are sharp!! Get hot but that is expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this Product on July 2, 2013. And here I am (in Sept 2013) searching for a new one. I don&#x27;t know why, but it begins making some loud grinding noises, out of the blue. It hasn&#x27;t been dropped or anything. It doesn&#x27;t even cut the hairs cleanly off anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This also happened with the last Andis I purchased. I don&#x27;t know, -maybe it is not built to last past a few months. But it seems that after a few months you will definitely notice everything going down hill....(I use it for shaving daily). Suddenly you will hear an entire different noise coming from the motor. Then you will notice it isn&#x27;t even cutting correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So bottom line, it starts off well, but it just seems to not be built to last. I will try to find a new one. Maybe the 3rd times a charm. Hopefully this one will actually last a year at least.</li>
            <li> Great product. So glad I decided to buy these clippers. Really nice product, and the GTX blade makes it just that better.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is the best out of 5 trimmers i have owned so far. it is powerful and cuts hair very sharp without cutting into the skin.</li>
            <li> Very very good product.  No complains at all.</li>
            <li> Superb trimmer, however appear to procure relatively torrid and feel the necessity to let it sit for at least 10 or so minute, prior to avail oneself of it again. This clipper has​ an edge to it, and it looks very elegant. One thing that stood out to me, the heavy duty 8-foot cord, it allows me to move around while cutting. The blades that were on the clippers were good, nevertheless had to replace it with Pro-mate Trimmer Blade. Excellent fit, molded into a perfect fit for one&#x27;s hand, which means, it fit in the hand very comfortably. If I had to describe this particular clippers, I would have to describe it has, an indispensable and responsive trimmer, the one in question, helping create an appealing outline. I am glad I gave this trimmer a chance, because I had 3 other trimmers, and I did not see the point, buying another Andis trimmer, especially seen I already own the other version. I did not think this trimmer could make a significant difference, but I was wrong it makes a significant difference, and I&#x27;m glad I added it to my already insane trimmer arsenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Andis trimmers since I was in high school. I use it to shave and clean up my shape ups. First of all let me just put it out there that shipping was extremely first. Bought it Saturday and got it on Monday. When the product arrived I noticed the box said T-Outliner but on the actual trimmer it said Outliner II. I know the trimmers are basically the same, but the box was misleading which is why the seller received 4 stars. When I used the trimmer it worked extremely well. The deep tooth blade allows you to get a close shave without cutting yourself. I allowed the trimmer to get on the warmer side before attempting to do my shape up. The trimmer gave me a barber like sharp hairline. I was impressed. After that I used the guards to guide me in creating a temp fade. That was also a success. So far I&#x27;m loving this trimmer particularly the blade.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great for shape ups. they cut low and feel great in the hands. Good quality for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two andis t outliners and can tell a difference in cutting power. Its a little on the loud side but nothing bad. Its a three prong electric connector. And it came with guards. So that&#x27;s a plus bc I didn&#x27;t except it to come with guards. All and all great set of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Works great but box came with damaged edges. I&#x27;m assuming it was dropped during the packaging process. There were also some scratches along the metal below the blade, probably from the manufacturing process, but other than that it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite trimmers of all time.</li>
            <li> Runs cooler &amp; slightly more powerful than reg t-outliner. Thicker cord is a plus. I used a pro-mate blade but I suggest using the gtx blade. Overall solid trimmer</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well on my beard, and neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use it to shave the sides of a high and tight on my son, and noticed a spot got really hot. Not so much the blade, but the body of the clipper, over the motor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cut well, and is comfortable, but after a few uses, I noticed some odd noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always clean, and oil after each use, but it&#x27;s starting to sound like something inside may be coming lose?</li>
            <li> Perfect for use, always oil and keep fresh. I will always check Amazon too for the best deals on good products.</li>
            <li> These are very heavy duty clippers that will last a long time.  I just wished they were sharper or could cut closer.  Overall they are ok.</li>
            <li> If you are a barber you are better off using the T-Outliners with an adjusted blade really. If you already own a pair of T&#x27;s this won&#x27;t do you much good. The blade is a little bit too thin for my liking, and the extra thick power cord is just annoying. They do stay cooler longer, and are sharp right out of the box, but they aren&#x27;t easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, these are some pretty darn good clippers, but not really worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I know some people have had mixed experiences with the product, some negative and some positive, with regards to closeness in shaping fine lines around the hair line.  I purchased this model specifically for shaping and trimming fine lines behind the ears, mustash, gotee and behind the neck line.  I have stated in my last review, once one learns the formula behind adjusting the blade, the results will be satisfying.  Unscrew and removed the top blade, then loosen the two small screws to the retainer guide and adjust the guide to meet the very edge of the top blade for a closer and fine cut to shape lines.  It&#x27;s a process.  Adjusting the retainer guide too far out will result in a possible skin cut.  Adjusting it too far in will result in not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, quiet, and comfortable. Small, solid, and substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; I like to shave about once a week. A regular shaver can&#x27;t handle that much, so I use a trimmer instead. This one leaves about a one-day stubble, which is perfect. Most times I let it go at that, but I can also easily shave that off if I want to. My whiskers are fairly thick, and there are a lot of them, and this does a great job. Smooth cutting, no snagging or pinching or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is nothing flashy—in fact it looks like bakelite—but it&#x27;s very solid and compact and the switch is nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I love it , gives sharp lines and clean shaves &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Trimmer works really well but I wish I had gotten a ceramic blade. They are more quiet than metal and much cooler after extended use</li>
            <li> I gave a poor rating because it did work correctly out of the box.  Only half of the clipper would cut.  I will exchange it and see if another one works as I had good luck with this manufacturer in the past. Stay tune to my next review.</li>
            <li> these are some great trimmers they are the only ones i use, but the only issue i have is that on the box it says guard included and when i open up the box there wasn&#x27;t any there. so is it false advertisement or somebody took my them?</li>
            <li> who wants to go to a barber shop and spend at least $13 on a hair cut plus a shave? not me, so i got me this bad boy and i only used it once and im completely satisfied. I happy with what i got with it as well. It comes with a small bottle of oil, which is not a lot but you can buy and add on the 4 ounce clipper oil. it also comes with adjustable combs that were very helpful and the right size. Now im going to start shaving my own hair, doing my own designs, shave my own beard and do it when i want and how i want. Anyone one who wants to buy a trimmer and doesnt want to go pay that $13 barber fee. GET THIS BAD BOY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS- Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;  Fast and easy shaving&lt;br /&gt;  Very precise and a nice clean shave&lt;br /&gt;  Very Quite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS- Vibration when using might bother some&lt;br /&gt;  Might be heavy for some</li>
            <li> Great powerful Trimmer. I feel like it has like two gears. This is an awesome liner for course hair and they do get hot sort of fast.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because I had previously owned outliner 1 which was good for  almost two years. This one however seems to be less sharp. Disappointed because its shaving power seems less than outliner 1.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product. It was a birthday gift that I purchased. By the time it was used, we realized it gets really HOT and unbearably to HOLD. Not worth the money. I wish I could return but its too late si I am stuck with a product that is dangerous to use!</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. This is my second trimmer i accidentally dropped my first trimmer and broke the teeth on it thats y i bought a new one.  But when i first purchased my first trimmer it came with 4 hair clips and the second one with i bought from this seller they didnt include the 4 clips even thought it says on the box it comes with them.</li>
            <li> Very nice blade, and grip. This trimmer is very sharp and can actually be used for dry shaving under the chin and on the neck area without causes razor bumps and in-grown hairs. My only gripe is that it gets a little hot a little fast. Still a very nice purchase though.</li>
            <li> It does cut very well but I read it does not over heat but everytime i use it gets so hot I burn my hand which really sucks guess dnt believe everything u read is best.</li>
            <li> They are very noisy and they are not cutting like the gtx that I bought out of the hair store.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I would recommend them to anybody who wants to have top of the line equipment an amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Love andis trimmers! I do 20-30 haircuts a day and these are perfect! Clean lines and very close. They get a little warm but cool down in the 10 min between uses.&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Seller claims its new? NO!! When i received it, it came very well packed. However, the actual box was torn and opened. The box actually looked old and loose. After opening it, the clipper was wrapped in a cheap plastic materia with holes on it? REALLY?? so i opened it at it looked used. I DEFINITELY saw finger prints on it! Anyway so i tried it and it doesn&#x27;t even last 5 minuted without being EXTREMELY HOT!!! This is DEFINITELY cheap and used!!! Not even worth returning it!!!</li>
            <li> A must have in your clipper line up</li>
            <li> these are brilliant. a must for personal use</li>
            <li> Pefect smooth clean line up , doesnt get hot to quick but i say bout 10 min goes hot , but u shouldnt be lining that consecutively! !!! Helped my neck line up skill (home)</li>
            <li> Well I Have Always Been A Wahl Man And I Just Received The Andis GTX and i Must Say I Was Very Pleased. Im Only Using It To Do Shape Ups, I Always Wanted That Crisp Clean Line Up So Fresh Out The Box It Was Sharp. I Ended Up Zero Gapping The Blade Just A Couple Hours After I Did My First Shape Up And I Must Say It Was A Big Difference.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it can&#x27;t be used in Barbados due to their Elec. Cycles; I use it in the USA and love it; My wife uses it to shape her head line and is very impressed.</li>
            <li> Trimmer worked fine while it lasted but completely but broke under it&#x27;s own power.  Screws came loose and casing came off.</li>
            <li> This is a great high quality trimmer. I use it to clean up the lines on my forehead. Always keeps me looking fresh out of the barber shop!</li>
            <li> Good solid product over all, but not what I expected. Not for shaving...gave me few cuts. have to cut sideways to get the proper trimming. Built quality is very nice and nice thick wire ! I would give it 5 star ONLY IF it did what its suppose to do best ! which is cutting close !</li>
            <li> Great Value for the price. Great Professional tool for everyday use.  Trimmer has lots of power.  Would recommend to all Barbers.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really great for all purposes and it is quite safe to use for any parts of your body and it is quite effective.</li>
            <li> trimmers are extremely sharp and easy to adjust. excellent item for great price. would definitely recommend this item for anyone that cuts hair</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I wanted something more powerful than those battery operated ones. The trimmer functions great and I get a nice, even shave within a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason for removing 1 star: The trimmer is a bit loud, but not crazy. These are quite often used at the barber shops. Additionally, they do take a bit more maintenance. After each use, it is recommended to brush out any hair and keep it oiled. I didn&#x27;t do this for a couple of times and the blade started to stick/ pull my hair. But once I oiled it again, it was back in action. So, keep it oiled up and I&#x27;ve been told it will last years.</li>
            <li> These trimmers  are no different than the outliners 2. The blades are not sharp and they get hot. I&#x27;m ordering more blades. Can&#x27;t get these adjusted for a real close shave. My headliners trimmers work better than this one.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, this clipper has a malfunction that blade replacement will not correct. A co-worker has issues with a set he bought after mine. I am going back over to the gray Andis Outliner until this model is functioning as it should.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. This broke after only a few months of light use. I used it to trim my own beard. No full hair cuts. Just the beard. I cleaned it, oiled it, and it just stopped cutting. Tried opening it up and adjusting it. Watched several videos on youtube to make sure I was doing it right. Still nothing. I am left with a broken trimmer that is good enough for the trash. Maybe mine was just a fluke. Stay away from this clipper.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product. It does exactly as advertised with precision. I have had other brands but this is the better of them all.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. He gets a very close shave look when he uses it to trim his face and a very straight edge up line.</li>
            <li> I can skip the waiting for a barber.</li>
            <li> Finally got my Andis GTX today . These things cut like butter AFTER you adjust them. But if you just want then to cut like Subzero(making the line to fade or shaving your head or beard) DONT even try to adjust them, they cut more than perfectly fine. But I  specifically bought them for edging up.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I adjusted them I loved them!!</li>
            <li> work great just make sure its gets oiled. like manufacture suggested to. it get used at mexico and my uclce love it.</li>
            <li> The Andis trimmer did not work, I try cutting hair and the blade adjust pull the hair. I was force to return it to Andis for repairs, still waiting on the return.</li>
            <li> I love these things nice sharp crisp line that won&#x27;t dig into your skin and cut u</li>
            <li> I own most all the top trimmers on the market. These, by far, leave the sharpest line of them all!</li>
            <li> As a guy who didn&#x27;t try to fight baldness from an early age, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head once a week since I was 22. With that said, I&#x27;ve gone through many different types of trimmers, ranging from cordless to corded, adjustable blades etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have generally sucked, for one reason or another. Durability has always been an issue. Power is also a problem, as the hair I DO have left tends to be pretty thick. And finally, closeness of the trimming. I always cut at a zero (i.e. no guides, just the blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the FIRST trimmer where I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;m getting close to the equipment that barbershops or salons use. It works well, doesn&#x27;t snag any hairs and the factory set trimming level is close but not so close that I&#x27;ve accidentally cut myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some folks on here talking about the Pro-Mate blades to use on this trimmer. I haven&#x27;t tried that yet, but I might give it a show in a few months. Also thinking of a blade zero-gapper. That might make this a little less safe to use, although it would make the trim even closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with this product so far. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of months, so I don&#x27;t know about long term durability. But even if it dies within a couple of years, it will have been worth it.</li>
            <li> the best hair an beard trimmer i bought gets really close for a clean shave without the razor burn i would tell everyone this is the best on the market</li>
            <li> I replaced a [[ASIN:B00009RF1E Wahl trimmer]] with the Andis GTX and it&#x27;s made a world of difference in dry face shaving. At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my skin stung after shaving with the Andis GTX. It turns out that it was due to shaving with the moving blade against the skin. Once I flipped the clipper over so that the stationary blade was against the skin there was no more after-sting. You&#x27;ll want to zero-gap the blades to achieve the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a before and after image of my shaving w/ the GTX after one day stubble growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update 7/12/2014 **&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace the stock blade due to a broken tooth. The replacement blade is an [[ASIN:B0006ZTEQK Andis #04521]]. It&#x27;s shallower than the stock blade so you&#x27;ll get an even closer shave. The only drawback is that you&#x27;ll have to run multiple passes to catch any missed hairs. My GTX just became even more awesome!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is powerful for the price, however, you do have to be gentle with it. If you run it along your face too fast you might end up pulling hairs, which we all know is one of the worst feelings ever. I would recommend it, but I might give another brand a shot when this one goes kaput.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. These bad boys are powerful,  precise and very smooth! Very dependable and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> bought these for my husband as an anniversary gift he uses it to line up his mustashe and beard he absoulutely loves it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Needed something for lines and edges. Works well. 0 gapped the blade and cuts very close. I don&#x27;t notice these getting hot at all but I don&#x27;t use them for excessive amounts of time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer broke after a few short weeks. I planned on exchanging for a new one, but the seller did not have any in stock so I returned. I&#x27;d like to try it again as I really enjoyed the trimmers power and accuracy.</li>
            <li> Andis have really done it this time. Love my new clippers. Blade wasn&#x27;t fully sharp but once I adjusted it, it&#x27;s the best. Each clippers blades come not adjusted. Anywhere you purchase a clippers you have to adjusted them yourself. Anyways, this is one for the money...</li>
            <li> I do all my shaving with clippers. These are the best I&#x27;ve ever used for head and face. Only negative is they still will get hot if used for face and head. But overall, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Ama......zing. I have tried them all but had never heard of this company. This is by far my favorite trimmer and I will never buy anything else. Close? It trims the hair right to the scalp. It also gets the top back of my head very close. I have never been able to get a trimmer to get really close their for some reason, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is a much more solid build. Thicker cord, which reminds me of my heavy duty tools.  I am even impressed with the quality of the bald attachments that it comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Same as the grey andis t-outliner model.  Nothing different besides the black casing and the GTX blade. The Gtx blade is what makes this trimmer “a beast out of its cage”. Plus what guy doesn’t love anything in black. The trimmer still has the same characteristic of all of the other andis trimmers “they get hot than a you know what”… Adjust them and they’re ready to go!</li>
            <li> This my top choice for a pair of trimmers. If anyone is looking for a excellent set of trimmers that cuts sharp outlines on a persons head these are the trimmers to get.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected and has been doing the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again when the need arises.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my nephew. I asked how it was working for him and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought these trimmers based on the great reviews, but upon receiving them I was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;The positives - includes various attachments, convenient on/off thumb switch.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives - very loud, cheap looking and slightly dull cutting blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning these trimmers and purchasing the Andis Outliner II Trimmers. I was very satisfied with the Andis Outliner II over the GTX model.</li>
            <li> i bought this trimmer instead of my usual gray trimmer by andis because the black on is suppose to be better.  it turns out to be heavier and doesn&#x27;t give close trim.  the surface trimmer feels like it&#x27;s left with a 1/2 stubble.  i have to rrturn and puchase the gray trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he loves it. States that the cut is very close and he barely misses his old one that finally gave out after years.</li>
            <li> Love these.  They compliment my wahl detailers well.  I outfitted mine with the promate blade.  I don&#x27;t recommend that, maybe get an MD blade if you want after market.  Doesn&#x27;t get really hot and runs really quietly.</li>
            <li> Not good didn&#x27;t work good that&#x27;s why I send it back</li>
            <li> i love this thing. i had the t-edjer forever and loved it but broke after one to many drops, now i picked this up.  it cuts very close for a trimmer (after you adjust the blades). its not gonna get that baby smooth super close shave but for a quick line up and clean your face up this works awesome. it also comes with guide combs so if you dont have a clipper available you can do some decent fades and tapers with it. if you want that perfect crispy barber line up. first you have to adjust the blades, do your line up, then go over with a straight edge razor. then boooom! you are set to go. my lines look like some put a ruler on my forehead before they started cutting, thats how crisp it is. hahaha just kidding. you wont be disappointed with this trimmers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---pros---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-comfortable in hand&lt;br /&gt;-nice new style of blade. (very similar to pro-mate)&lt;br /&gt;-fairly cheap&lt;br /&gt;-blade is fully adjustable&lt;br /&gt;-lot of power&lt;br /&gt;-comes with extension guide combs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---cons---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-there is no specification on how to adjust the blades properly. there is a ton of videos on youtube about adjusting the blades and the tension spring. so just try a couple of different methods and find out what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;-some people might say it gets hot. but any trimmer of this caliber gets warm. if you get a cheap one with not that much power. it might not get hot. but its going to pull hair all day long on your face. the gtx actually seems to be cooler than the t-edjer and t-outliner</li>
            <li> When they come out the box they are not that sharp, but if you know how to adjust them they are good trimmers. The only thing is they get hot fast. I&#x27;d recommend them though if you&#x27;re a beginner like myself.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly as described.  Bought as a Christmas present and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is not new. Looks like used and refurbished, scratches all over the body and 4 teeth on the one side of the blade are broken. Very disappointed, returning.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer! I use mine almost every day and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a professional look. The T-edges get the really close precise detailing and the wide shape lets you cover a lot of ground. Its pretty quiet too. Its pretty durable I have had mine for about a year now and I love them. The only thing I am noticing is that the metal on the top where the screws are is starting to bend up a little on one side but that could of been from anything. Without a doubt would recommended this to anyone. Andis is a great company.</li>
            <li> These clippers I purchased on a wing while I was deployed and have not had any issues. I believe they serve their purpose very well. Though I am not a barber I think that if you are using them to do simple lines of the face and hairline they are very good.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Bought this for my brother because he said it&#x27;s top of the line. And he loves it. It works well and does everything it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Outliner II for a bald/headshave for close to 25 years and when it was time for a new clipper, decided on this one. It&#x27;s EVEN BETTER than the Outliner II - it&#x27;s the &#x27;closes&#x27; shave of any of the clippers or trimmers I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them. Buy it without hesitation - you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of andis have been using them for 6 yrs now. Very sharp cut with little effort. Recommend to anyone in the states. If you&#x27;re in Japan I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying these even with a converter can become an issue and waste of your money. Recommend purchasing clippers in country to ensure their made for the voltage of where you live.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the second cut she became blind and did not cut more than one side of the blade!!!</li>
            <li> I almost have to bruised a scalp to get these to cut close.  I&#x27;m not sure if its the blade or not but they don&#x27;t cut close as advertised.</li>
            <li> Andis trimmers are amazing.  This is almost identical to the T-Outliner in performance.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the T-Outliner, but it does get a little hot after about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best edger I&#x27;ve owned yet!!!!  Looked for a very long time and finally I&#x27;ve found an outstanding, sharp, powerful edger.</li>
            <li> If this trimmer is from Cosmetic Central, this is NOT an original Andis.  Purchased one and the motor stopped working.  I sent this item to Andis for repair and they told me that it was a COUNTERFEIT CLONE.  The coil in this item is one half the size of the original and the rewiring was patched with tape.  When you get it, open it up and look, then complain to Amazon.</li>
            <li> the best clippers in the world</li>
            <li> Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve ever used.. won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
            <li> This product came in very handy and us powerful(: met my expectations. Great for all barbers and shouldconsider thos machine.</li>
            <li> what a great trimmer.! is very quiet and lightweight. I love the tiny guards it comes with to shape up clients beards. and it is very precise one of the best trimmers ive ever had</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quit like these. They always get caught in the bumps on my face</li>
            <li> Edge broke.  Ok product but will not buy again</li>
            <li> Heavier than expected, but also much higher quality.  It has turned my wife into a professional barber!(well almost) It is sized somewhere in between our large clippers and the really small ones that don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a quality feel and sound.  They also clip very well.  I expect them to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This Outliner is perfect for dry shaving after you cut with a 0. Also good for cleaning all edges in between haircuts.</li>
            <li> Thought I would spend a little more and buy these clippers. What have I been waiting for all these years?  Barber shop edge ups at home now.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry shaving. I am an African American male who has dealt with razor bump issues for years. The Gtx provides a very close shave that leaves a bit stubble  so the razor bump issue is no longer a problem. Very strong and powerful. It will get hot after about 30 to 45 minutes of continuous use</li>
            <li> From the time I took this awesome piece of equipment out of the box it has preformed beyond my wildest imagination! It trims beautifully and lines with precision. Great product for every day use!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had. It cuts very close to the skin and smoothly. I will recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Love it so far.</li>
            <li> Great! These trimmers are the best out of all andis in my opinion. Everytime I give an edge up people always ask what type of trimmers are those because they cut so clean.</li>
            <li> Product works well and gets close to the skin but in some areas it yanks enough to cut. I&#x27;ve been told to zero out the blades to prevent that from happening. Other than that my biggest complaint is the heat on the body of the trimmer. If you&#x27;re using it continuously for 10 minutes it will get very hot and to the point that you&#x27;re either shutting it off or holding it awkwardly.</li>
            <li> The Gtx trimmer works wonderfully on ethnic hair, and zipps right through fine hair, but seems to pull on thick brown hair,  out of all my clients I only have this problem with one person.  It&#x27;s really easy to adjust, easy to take apart, easy to clean and works great other wise</li>
            <li> Great for line-ups an all around trimming. Most powerful trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my beard  as close as possible without breaking out.  Works good, I recommend.  Comes with attachments to trim your hair at different levels.</li>
            <li> I love my new clippers great product and very affordable price. They also durable cuts and line my hear perfect couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> nice and easy to handle. worth the money and time I put in to shave. However it can get awefully hot over a period of usage</li>
            <li> When I turn it on. It makes a loud noise.  Also, smell burn may be used one. But it cuts ok</li>
            <li> great item from my boyfriend and I we use is just about almost everyday on grooming our son in ourselves. now my only ideas of buying any hair clippings our new blade for the ones that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rechargeable clippers on my face since I started getting facial hair. They are a lot cheaper and dont last very long. Decided that i&#x27;d drop more money on a trimmer that i could have the rest of my life possibly. Used these twice so far and they get super close. I prefer using these instead of a razor because of razor bumps. So far so good!</li>
            <li> great all around. powerful. needed to raise to make sharper. will be buying more andis products from now on .</li>
            <li> Bought one and it worked pretty good but overheated SUPER quick. Returned and got a replacement which is a little better but also overheats very quick, after about two mins of leaving it on it gets very hot and almost unbearable to touch. Disappointed and do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The trimmer its good when it comes to power, the power cord its long, and the design its really good, but when it comes about the blade its really bad because its not adjusted properly from factory si the trimmer could be ready to use because when you use it for shaving or anything else the blade pull the hair so bad that it could make you bleed</li>
            <li> As a barber, my opion is as follows. The trimmer produces sharp edges and cuts well through any length of hair easily. It feels like the motor is stronger than the standard gray T-outliner. The trimmer gets hot quickly. The teeth chips on both the outer and inner blade easily making it an unreliable tool. I love Andis&#x27; products but I still think the Wahl Detailers are better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t known why these clippers gets such reviews. Worst clippers, snapped after less than 4 months when i was grooming myself for a very important occasion right in the middle of the night. Would never buy again, even if its offered  for free. My first Andis also performed  the same way after less than a year.Such a useless product !</li>
            <li> Great Tliner i&#x27;d buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber in training and have been testing out clippers for the past few months and I must say one of the best especially for beards. I&#x27;m more interested in that because I more so use a straight razor for the overall shape up. I&#x27;d say this is a must have in your arsenal for barbers.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy, but I must say that my peanut clipper can get closer to the skin but don&#x27;t get me wrong I use it in combination to cut. Overall like the clipper and its uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Keeps cool longer than other T outliners.</li>
            <li> smooth clippers great for dry shaving I would recommend adjusting the blade to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Good for short hair only and for a short time.  I tried cutting my sons hair thats about 3 inches long and the clippers kept getting caught in his hair.  Also, the clippers get way too hot.  I had to stop using it and go back to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace using my facial trimmer for shaving my head.  The first time i used it it worked like a champ.  During the second time shaving my head, it would only jam.  I tried lubricating the blades, but it just would not cut through my hair.  I pulled out my old facial hair trimmer and completed the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waist of money.  Sure this thing may have a super powerful motor, but what good is that if it cannot cut a balding man&#x27;s thin hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a christmas gift for My hubby and he likes it very much great product no complaints :)</li>
            <li> Wooow,I been cutting for 28yrs and never has a trimmer come close to the andis Gtx, My job has become easier and more enjoyable, Not only that, Amazon delivered them on time and safe not to mention reasonable, Thanx</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I bought these because they are the same ones my barber used.  What a difference quality makes.  Great cord too.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I bought it because my barber had the same one which he used to trim my beard and I hate shaving. Here&#x27;s the best advice I can give: Loosen the head on it, and get the blades as close to the end of the guard as you can without going past it. I have it close enough that I can hardly tell a difference in using this versus a razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this for about 7 months, and use it about 2-3 times a week. I oil it about once a month. Still runs like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews will say it doesn&#x27;t get close enough...they obviously do not know how to adjust the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Stop buying Wahl pieces of garbage for 20-30$ at W@lmart. Get this and be happy with your purchase and best of all, look good!</li>
            <li> Very good clipper, just wish it would shape the beard a little closer, but would buy again.  Get&#x27;s the job done.</li>
            <li> this shaver was a recommendation from his barber - he thinks it is the best one he has ever had.</li>
            <li> This is a great pair of trimmers. Probably one of the best you can buy. Need slight adjustment to be zero gapped, but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband, he is loving it!!! He is very impressed with it compare to the older model that he had</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great trimmer BUT the outliner 2 is still better. The guards are different which makes them different. Outliner has small teeth for stubborn grey hair. These clippers has long teeth to get into the skin But longer is not always better.</li>
            <li> I am a guy that shaves once a week. I used to use the back of my Nerelco to first trim, and then i shave. I started using this proffessional grade trimmer instead and man is it close for a trimmer! I would have given it 5 stars but the vibration extremely intense, so literally after using it for 5 minutes, my had is tingling. But I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great I&#x27;m very happy with the product and would order from again !!!!!!</li>
            <li> The picture is a little off. You actually get the one with the new and improved switch. The power cord is three pronged and thick, so that is an improvement over the grey ones. They were fine out of the box, but I need them crisp so I zero gapped them. Great product and my favorite liners. They also came with guards you can attach when needed.</li>
            <li> I am a home user and this is perfect for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for trimming my hair and shaving my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go several days without shaving and my beard growth is too long for a razor, I use a trimmer to do most of the beard cutting and only use a razor for finishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps me from tearing up the razor blades which saves me money and keeps the razor blades in good condition so that they cut smooth and shaving feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SHIPPING was SUPER-SONIC Fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had anything arrive faster than this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Now, I may have not read the description clearly but these trimmers are not for shaping stubble. It&#x27;s great of trimming and lining a beard which is pointless when I&#x27;m shaving my head and beard. I&#x27;m my own barber so I don&#x27;t need different types of clippers, I will return these.</li>
            <li> one of the BEST liners ive ever used. I always used the t liners and when i seen these, i had to get them! once you do some adjusting like with any clippers, you are GOLDEN! I put so many people on these liners. Great liners!!!!</li>
            <li> awesome clipper..hits hard out of the box,is perfect with a few minor adjustments...these clippers completed my collection ....great power, nice durable cord, don&#x27;t get hot...and are nice and quiet...definitely worth the money... buy them now you wont regret it and your hairline will thank you...happy cutting.</li>
            <li> Better then original t-outliners! And don&#x27;t over heat 5 minutes into the haircut</li>
            <li> Cut my throat in two different places on first use.  I have an oster t trimmer that I have used for years that never cut me.  Really disappointed because I really wanted this trimmer to work out.  I ordered a replacement and will update this review if it was just a bad unit and the next one works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer in my barber shop and it is reliable, well made and removes hair with ease. If you are using this item to trim your facial hair or just to shave, follow it up with a [[ASIN:B003K1R162 Wahl 5-Star Shaver]] and you will be amazed how close it will shave.</li>
            <li> Nice, deep tooth blade is a little different, but overall they get the job done</li>
            <li> I have been a barber for 15 years and I have used just about every top trimmer on the market. The GTX is the best trimmer I have in my arsenal. I choose to use more than one type of trimmer but if I could use only one this is it</li>
            <li> This is the third one I&#x27;ve ordered in a row. The second one looked exactly like the first one I had returned, the deep scratch on the metal side was in the same exact place, I even took a picture of it! All three products I had received looked like it had been opened and used, even saw fine bits of hair on the blade. I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and buy directly from the manufacturer. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Work great. Better than any others I have ever used. These save me a lot of time. Just hope they last.</li>
            <li> This clipper is good compared to other ones I have been using. It gives me a clean cut the way I want it. The product meet is awesome. I have been looking to get it for a long time and finally I got it. There was time I went to my barber and I asked him how I can get this particular clipper and he talk something else because he thought that if I get it I will stop coming to his shop. Now that I got he will not see me again. I will recommend this to my friend. It is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in new condition as stated. I&#x27;ve purchased these before but the newer gtx has a few differences. The body is slightly bigger &amp; it has 12 watts instead of 10. Still one of the best trimmers ever &amp; essential tool for barbers!</li>
            <li> Awesome and very close trim. It gets hot for awhile but I would share this with everyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> Who has two thumbs and loves their Andis Trimmer?  This girl!  Seriously, it is amazing.  I buzz my husband&#x27;s head a few times a month, and we&#x27;ve gone through three trimmers in the last four years.  Nothing seems to hold up, even the well known brands.  When I came across this trimmer and actual barbers had reviewed it, I was in, and boy was I not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head is shaped differently than most I&#x27;ve had before.  This is a huge plus, because it means you can get a closer shave than most traditional trimmers you can purchase at the store.  It also comes with a few attachments if you&#x27;re not into buzzing someone&#x27;s head.  The body is also smaller than most trimmers we&#x27;ve had in the past, which means it fits in my hands better.  Not to mention the cord seems like it&#x27;s industrial quality and will withstand abuse.  Not that I have any intention of abusing it, but the option is always there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve had it for a few months (fingers crossed), I&#x27;ll update the review as to how it holds up.  Right now though, I&#x27;m pleased as punch with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The best liners on market. Learn how to set your blades &amp; watch them work. They&#x27;ve a glide when the blade is set right.</li>
            <li> It was great thank you !! I use them every cut and there crispy liners  (: they the best ever</li>
            <li> The Gtx T-Outliner trimmers have been as advertised. I&#x27;m have been impressed at how well the clippers cut and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I used to own some Andis T-Outliner clippers and I have the Whal 5 series clippers that suppose to be good for people that suffer from razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I set the blade on the Andis GTX clippers so they could cut a bit closer and I go with the grain to prevent ingrown hairs even though I still get some hair bumps here and there. I also oil the blades every time I use the clippers, I put three drops of oil in different places on the blade while the blade is running for not too long. I also use an old toothbrush to brush the hair off the blade as I&#x27;m dry shaving. I will suggest investing in the Andis cool care plus clipper blade cleaner to really clean the blades and keeping cutting good for a long time. The only con I could find with the GTX clippers is that the clippers do get hot the longer you use them but other than that they are definitely a good investment for men who want a good trimmer and those who suffer from razor bumps, ingrown hairs like myself.</li>
            <li> right out the box the hit ok and they vibrated a lot  so that&#x27;s why 4 and not 5 stars  but with a little blade adjustment and a little adjustment on the tension screw these are by far the best on the market right now runs smooth and leaves nice crispy lines. don&#x27;t be fooled by people these are not the grey trimmers just in a black case they are much more powerful and the blade is much deeper and they run cooler but they still do get hot if using for a long time. overall definitely add these to your line up.</li>
            <li> BEST TRIMMERS better than the regular t-out-liners is basically the same thing just upgraded, and it comes with a 3 prong power cable no wall mart</li>
            <li> Man these are great! I own the older model with the regular motor and they get hot as he**! These have magnetic motor so they don&#x27;t get hot like the old ones do, and they are sharp! Not sharp like cut you sharp but they cut very very close to the skin! I&#x27;m a bald guy with full facial hair! These are perfect for a guy like me!</li>
            <li> really great at shaping up and also on facial hair a good buy :)&lt;br /&gt;only complaint is that it gets hot quite fast</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend Precisioner from Promate. It stay cool and much powerful!&lt;br /&gt;3 prongs cords doesn&#x27;t give you more power it only for ground wire.</li>
            <li> Good product but not completely satisfied. Straight out the box it rattles loudly when I turn it over.</li>
            <li> Stop working  in one month  but it was a 5 star liner up until then</li>
            <li> They work perfectly with no problems. I would recomend this item to any and everyone.  This is why I gave it five stars.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this product. it came super fast and worked really great. Best product on the market. I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Got it for my son.  So far, so good. Trims nicely and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I got it because all the reviews were great but when i got it. it is not as great as expected. the blade is not as sharp as you would like it to be. Not the easiest machine to clean.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ever go wrong with quality Andis liners. I bought these so that I could line my own hair and these work perfectly. It cuts very close and doesn&#x27;t break skin. I use these every week and I love them. I recommend them to anyone wanting to line their own hair.</li>
            <li> It was very hot and the blade does not shave very well, I&#x27;ll have to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Espero que al cambiarle la cuchilla afeite bien.</li>
            <li> This thing is dope gives the freshest shape ups/edge ups I&#x27;d recommend buying the Pro-Mate trimmer blade that fits this thing gives an even sharper cut. Just make sure you have a buddy present to line you up in the back or you just gonna look like a half-way done herb.</li>
            <li> I love, gives a smooth shave, just what I needed. I&#x27;ve used other shavers but I think so far this one is the best.easy to use and have a pretty good grip.</li>
            <li> The package holding my items were in good shape, but the edge of the hair trimmer box was smashed. Fortunately the trimmer themselves seem to be okay, but the box makes me seriously think against the product being new. Hopefully I get my moneys worth with this product. This couldn&#x27;t be Amazon&#x27;s fault, but the specific third party seller I got it from.</li>
            <li> Great trimmers. Work easily and don&#x27;t get hot fast. Love them</li>
            <li> I use this cuzz of razor bumps. It shaves without cutting. Close enough that I can barely see the shadow. Feels heavy and well made. I have an edger by this CO that lasted around 8 years which is why I bought from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thich hair folicles on your face and they curl back into your skin when you cut too short, then these are for you. Also very fast to shave with them. usually 1-2 minutes only for my whole face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with guards (like 4 of them). They&#x27;re plastic. I haven&#x27;t used them, but if you want to edge your beard only, you can use the guards for that as they are like 4 different lengths for them</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer! Best one I&#x27;ve used. Great for dry shaving and maintenance cuts.</li>
            <li> Great and on time service.. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> ive been a barber for 7 years and ive always used andis t outliners, but never this one, when a friend showed me his and i tried it on a few clients i was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE- it will take a few tries to adjust it to be perfect, but once you find the sweet spot, its amazing</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with these i mean bad ,i used them 2 times and it was scary i plugged them into the socket and started shaving and after about 60sec they started sparking, poping and it killed the power socket in my bathroom, i thought it was just a case of a fuse in my circut breaker blew out.Whitch was not the case because it happened agian when i took them out of town with me and they repeated the same behavior in a hotel bathroom sparking poping with light smoke coming from the unit big waste of money maybe i got a defective unit or a bad batch it something to consider for all looking to buy this product at this time from this seller</li>
            <li> Right out of the box it would occasionally rattle as if something were tumbling inside it.  Anyhow, I haven&#x27;t been able to use it for very long because the edge of the stationary blade somehow broke after a couple weeks.  I&#x27;m in the process of buying a new blade and will update this review based on how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/27/15&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with the original outliner blade.  There is no rattling or loud noises but the edging power seems to be kind of weak.  It may be a loose screw... will replace and report&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last edit: works after much tweeking with the internals-made possible with the help of YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> it cuts very good. i use it a lot. A very great pair of outliner trimmers. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to use for shaving the Andis is your answer. It smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> These were brand new with decent power. Didn&#x27;t notice much difference from the the regular grey Andis trimmer but it is better for cleaning up a fade because of the deeper teeth gives more flexibility. Delivery time was prompt, so satisfaction was good.</li>
            <li> The item does not perform as I had expected. I does not cut as close as advertised, could be better</li>
            <li> Hits just fine out of the box! I use this on everybody from older gentleman to young kids. Great all around trimmer that gets the job done whether you&#x27;re trimming beards/faces for shaves, bald fades, prepping the head for shaves, line ups, outlines, etc. This trimmer will handle it and not bog down like other trimmers. Does not get hot, has plenty of power, very durable, high quality build that andis is known for! I&#x27;ve used the regular gray outliner and this is even a few steps above it! As a barber I cannot stress how much I rely on my tools to provide a quality service and this trimmer allows me to offer that to my clients and customers. The perfect trimmer for doing EVERYTHING! If you tackle pompadours, fades, gentleman&#x27;s, line ups, shaves, buzzes, finish work, outlines, older folks, young guys, even kids, this thing does not bite and hits right out of the box. Have yet to touch my blade because it hits very very good and does NOT bite or nick. Andis nailed it with this and I will never use another trimmer. If you&#x27;re a barber and you need that ONE trimmer that can be your go to work horse this will be it. If you like only having one pair of trimmers out that can do it all then this will be the one. Hope this helps from an independent barber that does all kinds of styles.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say that I am a barber and have used about every trimmer on the market.  With that being said, I will tell you that a lot of barbers will tell you to buy the andis t-outliner or andis styliner 2.  They are both great trimmers but for totally different uses.  The gtx t-outliner will do what both those trimmers do!  I always used the styliner 2 for necklines and bald fading because of the power they have over the outliner-2.  But when I saw the gtx trimmer I thought I would give it a shot.  I am glad that I did!!  It is strong like the styliner and gets close like the outliner 2, the only difference I find is that the gtx trimmer will cut faster.  I think that is because it has a different blade then the original outliner 2.  Also because it has a 3 prong cord not a standard 2 prong.  if you are looking for a solid trimmer to fade/outline or design with then look no further!  The only downfall to all of the andis trimmers I have used it that they all get hot.  But any trimmer will get hot if you are using it for more than 10 minutes.  This is my opinion and other people will tell you otherwise.  But I own 7 pairs of trimmers and find myself using the gtx outliner more and more.  If your looking for a good all around trimmer then this is a great choice!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE THING EXCELLENT FOR SHAVING, I&#x27;M JUST SORRY THAT I WAITED SO LONG TO PURCHASE THEM, GREAT JOB ANDIS, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GUY&#x27;S. SINCERELY YOURS, L.CASHMERE</li>
            <li> Great trimmer . Love it !</li>
            <li> I bought this as a compliment to another Andis T - Outliner that I have.  I use both and with different heads and that way I have a backup.  Compared to the other one with a gray colored plastic body, this does feel more heavy duty.  However the finish has not help up as well.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I clean it too much, or the cleaner that I use.  But it&#x27;s not shiny since about the first month of use.  But doesn&#x27;t affect the operation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is very long, which is nice,  But it is also a 3 prong end, with ground.  The other one I have is a plug with two tabs on it.  The cord on this is also very sturdy when compared to the gray t-outliner I have.  It might be a bit overdone if you are just using it at home like me, but I am sure it will hold up well.  I am pleased with the performance and the cut of the blades.  I use it primarily for cleaning up my face and goatee, instead of shaving due to my very coarse facial hair.  I am happy with it, and would buy another one.</li>
            <li> these are great outliners and tremors or just shave it as close as possible but there is no thumb bar on the side to make them longer or shorter other than that they&#x27;re awesome</li>
            <li> I am no expert. Use the buzzer for my head and body.  It gets very very close. I don&#x27;t think it would be good if you have long hair.  I cut my hair on a triple zero.</li>
            <li> I used this item to square up my hair cut in front about every other week for me and my sons and it works great. It was shipped and received fairly quickly with no issues from the seller.</li>
            <li> Super sharp trimmer but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as regular t outliner does.</li>
            <li> This product works well and it&#x27;s easy to use. Best part - its not noisy! The buzz sound is audible but not annoying. With the bathroom door closed I do not hear anything! I love it for the silence and my husband loves it because he can use it everyday, easy to clean, and gets the job done. Excellent for super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for free haircuts and quick trims at home.  I have saved soo much money on hair cuts and the boys look great.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it came with a hard carry case instead of needing to keep the box and plastic packing tray it comes in.</li>
            <li> This trimmer feels durable just by picking it up.  I have had Wahl hair clippers in the past and this blows them out of the water.  The included attachments are a bit annoying when it comes to attachment and removal but I will never use them so I don&#x27;t really care.  I have thick hair and was worried about it getting caught up in the blades like it has with previous hair trimmers I have owned, but I didn&#x27;t get one snag.  It cuts my hair with no effort and only takes one pass to do it&#x27;s job.  I was worried because I kept reading about them heating up when using them but I haven&#x27;t experienced this myself.  I only use these for personal use however so in a professional setting this may be a different story.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend because it does what it should and does it well :)</li>
            <li> The first one arrived with a broken blade. Amazon promptly replaced. I was impressed after the first use. It has a more powerful motor that Oster Outliner with or without the T blade. It was also more powerful than old Andis Outliner (the grey one). I thought I finally found the perfect combination of shaver and travel clippers. I&#x27;ve been using the Oster Classic for years but combined with an outliner, it&#x27;s a bit bulky for travel. I didn&#x27;t notice any extreme heat. Keep in mind I used this to trim my hair while on the road. I was completely satisfied.This performed absolutely perfect; Until it died after less than 3 months of use. Mine came straight from Amazon so no questionable sellers to blame. What a shame. Even worse, I noticed the link to the warranty information on the Amazon product page leads to a dead end. I guess I&#x27;ll dust off my 4 year old Oster Outliner and avoid Andis completely going forward.</li>
            <li> Ok trimmer this was bought to replace my other and is clippers because they had stopped moving.theese are pretty powerful and does get hot after 10 minutes.the blade is sharp but just a little unbalanced and I can&#x27;t fix it to save my life but overall theese are good shape up clippers</li>
            <li> Best trimmers I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Had a wahl peanut before but wanted a new trimmer. This one is really nice. It would have gotten 5 stars but it gets really hot after like 15-20 mins...i wonder if the superliner stays cooler....anyone know?</li>
            <li> This has same power consumption (10Watts) of the T-Outliner II or Outliner but runs smoother, takes a little longer (maybe 10 additional minutes) to get hot compared to Outliner. I remove the T-blade and put an Outliner II blade on it. Its cuts close without any niches to the skin or snags to the hair that occurs from using cheap (Walfart) clipper. Perfect for face, chin and neck shaving every 3 days and keeping hair bumps away. The best clipper I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing simply set the blade and go no need to tune like the gray versions&lt;br /&gt;Second sharpest trimmer next to the detailer/hero</li>
            <li> Very noisy and gets hot too quickly.</li>
            <li> Just a little sharp may need to be adjusted.</li>
            <li> Works perfect!!! My new #1 trimmers.. These are my second set but my new favorite!! They even come with guards if you want to trim your mustache, eyebrows, and beard down.</li>
            <li> nice clippers, bought them for someones birthday only after buying them I discovered they bought them for themselves as a bday gift. hated to return them they look sooooooo nice and everything came as stated</li>
            <li> My Aunty Bought me a Razor.&lt;br /&gt;  Oster Fast Feeds from this crowd for my Birthday. Im a Barber.&lt;br /&gt;After getting this product i was really looking forward to using them but on my first client the razor BLEW UP&lt;br /&gt;The Coil Inside blew up, Could have done serious damage to me or the client i got a nasty shock of the product to. I dont know if it was faulty on who&#x27;s part but i tried leaving an email with no answer. Very Unhappy with my product and experience shopping here.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for shaving a light beard and mustache.  This trimmer has extremely sharp blades, and delivers an extremely close shave.  While every electric razor I have owned, including expensive ones, has not cut very close and caused skin irritation, this trimmer cuts close quickly and easily and causes no irritation.  In the past, I have owned the Outliner II, which was a good trimmer, but this one is even better.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received my liners 2 days before the expected shipping day and WOW. I zero-gapped them and they are SHARP perfect for crisp clean linings, only one thing DONT APPLY ALOT OF PRESSURE. I cut my self here and there but Ill learn not to apply as much pressure, overall they are very good trimmers!</li>
            <li> wow this is the best clippers i have ever owned, i should have purchased this item a long time ago, really good</li>
            <li> You are better off buying the  Andis professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer. It cut smoother, quieter and almost $25 cheaper. This newer one to me is just a way to make extra money by the manufacturer. All they did was change the color from grey to black and give it a different name. I bought it because I thought it will be better than my old one (04710), but after several use, I concluded that it&#x27;s not worth the price or the hype claimed by Andis. I mean, it still gets the job done, but the older model is better.</li>
            <li> Im about to send it to Andis for repair, which will take the better part of a month to get back. But while it was working it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 1 month and have had to readjust the blades twice. It does not give a close enough shave. For those of us that cannot use razors (because of razor bumps); this product in my experience is not a strong alternative.</li>
