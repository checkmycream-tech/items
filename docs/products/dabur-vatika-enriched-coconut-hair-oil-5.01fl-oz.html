            <li>i had to be lol.</li>

            <li>I leave it in overnight with my hair wrapped in a towel, washes out nice and silky hair!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this coconut oil!  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff</li>

            <li>But this oil has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I found this mask as a good treatment for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>This coconut oil has a pleasant lemony smell and is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>and I find that vatika works better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I leave the mask for 2-3 hours, it moisturizes my hair and even gives a bit more volume</li>
            <li>All smiles :) Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was a LOT softer, and my husband noticed as well and kept touching my head.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Outside of that, I&#x27;m glad to have this product.</li>
            <li>It is a staple for us, and I buy 2 bottles at a time to make sure we never run out.  </li>

            <li>My hair has grown more as well as got more healthier with this product.</li>
            <li>Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil smells terrific and feels wonderful in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its works better on my skin than it was on my hair.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Also the odor is more of a nutmeg smell.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love coconut oil for my hair and my sons hair</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I could ever not use it any more</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m required to type 6 more words??</li>
            <li>smells pretty good and conditions hair</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my hair feel soft and mosturizes.</li>
            <li>I loved that this product was not thick.</li>
            <li>When I flat ironed my hair, it came out very nice and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>In addition, delivery was quick!</li>
            <li>I massage it into my scalp and then smooth it through my hair the nights before I&#x27;m going to be washing my hair, and then shampoo it out in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found something I can use more regularly that won&#x27;t break the bank like my argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is also not too strong; it&#x27;s a bit stronger than regular coconut oil (which I happen to love the scent of, but my husband doesn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>But honestly, I get better results from regular old coconut oil that I can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>:) Makes my hair soft, shiny &amp; bouncy.</li>
            <li>an gives you just the right coating on your hair.</li>
            <li>it was super straight and looked just like I had a relaxer.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, but I suggest to use it ONLY on the SCALP as the lemon oil controls sebum production; which is especially beneficial during the warmer months.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li>First time, it was for about 8 hours.</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;Great hair treatment for anyone!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND I WILL USE THIS PROVIDER AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE REASONABLE PRICING AND IT SHIPPED SUPER FAST</li>
            <li>By the way, any price over $4.50 is too much for this oil as it can be found at most any India grocers or International markets.</li>
            <li>Another positive, the henna and the amla in this Vatika Enriched Hair Oil makes your hair thicker.</li>
            <li>Three drops was good for me and my hair is on the thinner side and just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>This prodcut makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a lot of oil on top of dry hair, if that means anything.</li>
            <li>Just got it and have bothers it that much</li>
            <li>so I Dan nit really say much about it</li>
            <li>My girls hair really retains the moisture, I have 3c hair and they have 3a, and it works wonders,</li>
            <li>So for those with finer hair or thin hair at the roots, nape, and/or temple, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li>I noticed that when I put this on while wet, my hair stays SO much more moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I put the bottle on a bowl with warm water for a few minutes and it liguified again.</li>
            <li>Strong but dry.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to buy as long as this is available!</li>
            <li>I shampooed and conditioned as normal, then put about three drops of the oil in my hands and just worked it through my hair and massaged my scalp.</li>
            <li>This oil is wonderful and a little goes a long way, it makes my hair very soft and i even used it in my daughters natural hair after washing it and it make such a big difference in her hair.</li>
            <li>When I washed my head in the morning, my hair was a lot softer and fuller as well which surprised me since I have very fine, very straight hair down to the middle of my back.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not yet hot, this has retained a solid state, but I was able to pry off the inner plastic cap, which allows me to squeeze a small glob out into my palms.  </li>
            <li>and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I found out about it from a colleague who also has natural hair as well.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS AN ITEM THAT I WILL ALWAYS ORDER FOR MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>After using my hair was soft and shine.</li>
            <li>First let me say, I am African American</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it a 4 star was because I didn&#x27;t expect the bottle to be so small but its still a good product though especially for African Americans with dry hair</li>
            <li>IT does have a distinct smell to it, however I grew up in Little India in Queens (elmhurst 72nd st roosevelt avenue)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with curly, natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair and after researching several products I went with this one because it had decent reviews</li>

            <li> I have very dry hair and after researching several products I went with this one because it had decent reviews</li>
            <li> and it made my hair so soft and extremely shiny.  </li>
            <li> The second time i left it as long as possible</li>
            <li> Her hair is very dry and this gives extra moisture, especially to the ends.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other ingredients do, but maybe they don&#x27;t benefit my hair as much.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry scalp all winter, I ordered the enriched version of this since the lemon is supposed to help with itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> The henna strengthens hair but as a result leaves it dry</li>
            <li> However, it gets EXTREMELY dry in between washes, cowashes and treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super thick and pretty manageable.</li>
            <li> You will have to put this in a small plastic container to melt it prior to putting it on your hair but it only takes about 20 seconds to melt.  </li>
            <li> Also, lemon is photosensitive which is another reason not to wear this oil blend on the hair itself, but on the scalp only, as the scalp gets less exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say anything about if you apply it to wet or dry hair, if it stays in or you rinse it out, etc.</li>
            <li> I decided to put on my sleeping cap and try to get used to it, but all night long the odor was extremely bothersome.</li>
            <li> It is a must have for all hair types, especially for those like myself who have tight curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> You have to heat it up though, which is not much of an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I like using all-natural products on my hair, and decided to order this after seeing it recommended a few times on the Long Hair Community forum.  </li>
            <li> I used only a small amount on my hair after my hair was somewhat damp</li>
            <li> A little bit of this oil goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> It looks very very wet while on the hair.</li>
            <li> Good product, terrible bottle, should have used a jar instead.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday , just a few drops.</li>
            <li> the oil is not to heavy</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product on a whim, deviating from my usual use of rosemary oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> My HAIR potion not magic potion, although I can see what the difference is.</li>
            <li> Hard to get product out of bottle.</li>
            <li> : when you wash it out, wash your hair at LEAST twice.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the bottle I opened it up and applied it to my hair as per usual, and was immediately struck by the unpleasant odor.</li>

            <li> I like using all-natural products on my hair, and decided to order this after seeing it recommended a few times on the Long Hair Community forum.  Since I&#x27;ve been suffering from dry scalp all winter, I ordered the enriched version of this since the lemon is supposed to help with itchy scalp.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks, but I like it a lot.  I massage it into my scalp and then smooth it through my hair the nights before I&#x27;m going to be washing my hair, and then shampoo it out in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s not yet hot, this has retained a solid state, but I was able to pry off the inner plastic cap, which allows me to squeeze a small glob out into my palms.  From them, I rub my palms until the oil melts into a liquid, and apply to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is also not too strong; it&#x27;s a bit stronger than regular coconut oil (which I happen to love the scent of, but my husband doesn&#x27;t) because of the added herbs, but it&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this coconut oil from a local India market here n town for $2.99. This coconut oil has a pleasant lemony smell and is easily absorbed. It makes my hair soft, silky, and smooth. This is my number one hair oil that I keep at all times in my home. It is a must have for all hair types, especially for those like myself who have tight curls. By the way, any price over $4.50 is too much for this oil as it can be found at most any India grocers or International markets.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this coconut oil!  First let me say, I am African American and I am transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  I found out about it from a colleague who also has natural hair as well.  I used only a small amount on my hair after my hair was somewhat damp (mid-blowdry) and it made my hair so soft and extremely shiny.  You will have to put this in a small plastic container to melt it prior to putting it on your hair but it only takes about 20 seconds to melt.  A little bit of this oil goes a very long way.  When I flat-ironed my hair it was super straight and looked just like I had a relaxer.  I will definitely continue to buy as long as this is available! I could not ask for any better hair oil!!!</li>
            <li> Great! Hard to get product out of bottle. Just got it and have bothers it that much so I Dan nit really say much about it</li>
            <li> This prodcut makes my hair super soft. I use it everyday , just a few drops. And I also use it mixed in with my deep conditioners. I just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I tried the extra virgin coconut oil before this one and I find that vatika works better for my hair type. My girls hair really retains the moisture, I have 3c hair and they have 3a, and it works wonders, it locks in the moisture, making the hair look shiny, and it smells great too. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I found this mask as a good treatment for my fine hair. I leave the mask for 2-3 hours, it moisturizes my hair and even gives a bit more volume</li>
            <li> I loved that this product was not thick. It has a wonderful smell. Also, it gave my hair a sheen that was nice. When I flat ironed my hair, it came out very nice and healthy looking. In addition, delivery was quick! I got my order w/in the same week that I ordered it. All smiles :) Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it a 4 star was because I didn&#x27;t expect the bottle to be so small but its still a good product though especially for African Americans with dry hair I recommend coconut oil.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good and conditions hair well. I leave it in overnight with my hair wrapped in a towel, washes out nice and silky hair!</li>
            <li> This product is great, but I suggest to use it ONLY on the SCALP as the lemon oil controls sebum production; which is especially beneficial during the warmer months. However lemon is also drying, as it is acidic, so I would not suggest using this product on the actual strands of your hair. The henna strengthens hair but as a result leaves it dry:think straw or hay. Strong but dry. Also, lemon is photosensitive which is another reason not to wear this oil blend on the hair itself, but on the scalp only, as the scalp gets less exposure to the sun. Another positive, the henna and the amla in this Vatika Enriched Hair Oil makes your hair thicker. So for those with finer hair or thin hair at the roots, nape, and/or temple, this product is great for that.</li>
            <li> I like this product and use it on my daughters hair after shampooing. Her hair is very dry and this gives extra moisture, especially to the ends. You have to heat it up though, which is not much of an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and after researching several products I went with this one because it had decent reviews and it was pretty cheap. I&#x27;ve used it only once since I got it a couple days ago, but immediately after I used it I noticed my hair was a LOT softer, and my husband noticed as well and kept touching my head.  The only downside for me were the directions. All it says is to use often and is best used overnight.  It doesn&#x27;t say anything about if you apply it to wet or dry hair, if it stays in or you rinse it out, etc. which would have been helpful to me since I haven&#x27;t used any type of oil in my hair before. I shampooed and conditioned as normal, then put about three drops of the oil in my hands and just worked it through my hair and massaged my scalp. I let it sit for a couple minutes then rinsed it out, and like I said - I could immediately tell a difference.  Three drops was good for me and my hair is on the thinner side and just past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I tried it only once but can see and feel a difference already. The product inside the bottle was solid but I put the bottle on a bowl with warm water for a few minutes and it liguified again. Put on my hair kept it on overnight (with a disposable plastic cap). When I washed my head in the morning, my hair was a lot softer and fuller as well which surprised me since I have very fine, very straight hair down to the middle of my back. Will be doing it once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with curly, natural hair. It&#x27;s not super thick and pretty manageable. However, it gets EXTREMELY dry in between washes, cowashes and treatments. I noticed that when I put this on while wet, my hair stays SO much more moisturized. I can even use this in between as a \\&quot;fluffer\\&quot; for my curls. I&#x27;m glad to have found something I can use more regularly that won&#x27;t break the bank like my argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only pet peeve is that is solidifies and I have to run, dripping hair and all, to the micro wave to zap it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of that, I&#x27;m glad to have this product.</li>
            <li> I use this hair oil on myself, and also on my twin sons.  It smells delicious, and really works at strengthening, moisturizing, protecting, and growing our hair.  It is a staple for us, and I buy 2 bottles at a time to make sure we never run out.  BUY IT NOW, AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AN ITEM THAT I WILL ALWAYS ORDER FOR MY NATURAL HAIR IT HELPS WITH GROWTH AND I WILL USE THIS PROVIDER AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE REASONABLE PRICING AND IT SHIPPED SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> I just adore the smell of this product. But honestly, I get better results from regular old coconut oil that I can buy at the store. Not sure what the other ingredients do, but maybe they don&#x27;t benefit my hair as much.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful and a little goes a long way, it makes my hair very soft and i even used it in my daughters natural hair after washing it and it make such a big difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product on a whim, deviating from my usual use of rosemary oil in my hair. I sleep with a cap on to protect my hair and my pillows from the oil. Upon receiving the bottle I opened it up and applied it to my hair as per usual, and was immediately struck by the unpleasant odor. I decided to put on my sleeping cap and try to get used to it, but all night long the odor was extremely bothersome. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I just can&#x27;t take it anymore. I&#x27;m going back to rosemary oil and throwing the Vatika away.</li>
            <li> My HAIR potion not magic potion, although I can see what the difference is. IT does have a distinct smell to it, however I grew up in Little India in Queens (elmhurst 72nd st roosevelt avenue) So I am used to the smell and it does not bother me. I do use this in a mix of different oils. A little does go a long way. It definitely has made my hair feel a tad bit lighter.</li>
            <li> this product realy works i use it every day i will be buying it again and telling my friends thank you</li>
            <li> I love it the oil is not to heavy an gives you just the right coating on your hair. My hair has grown more as well as got more healthier with this product.</li>
            <li> Good product, terrible bottle, should have used a jar instead.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff :) Makes my hair soft, shiny &amp; bouncy. Already feels/looks healthier &amp; i&#x27;ve only used it twice. I left it on overnight both times. First time, it was for about 8 hours. The second time i left it as long as possible which was over 15 hrs because i had nowhere i had to be lol. It looks very very wet while on the hair. It doesn&#x27;t drip though. I put a shower cap on over my head &amp; a stretchy cloth headband to keep it in place while asleep. Tip: when you wash it out, wash your hair at LEAST twice.</li>
            <li> I like this product. After using my hair was soft and shine. Very nice. But this oil has a very strong smell. I had a headache. That is why I gave only 4 stars. Next time I use this oil I would cover my hait to reduce the smell.</li>
            <li> Dabur Vatika Enriched Coconut Hair Oil smells terrific and feels wonderful in my hair.  The shine is awesome and I look forward to the numerous benefits it will bring to the overall health of my hair in regards to length, thickness, and shine.</li>
            <li> Its works better on my skin than it was on my hair. But that&#x27;s ok. Also the odor is more of a nutmeg smell. I don&#x27;t care for the smell of nutmeg so I didn&#x27;t love. But others might.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this, but that&#x27;s all. The product is too oily and it does nothing for my hair. It&#x27;s just a lot of oil on top of dry hair, if that means anything. Basically, this product just didn&#x27;t work for me. So, I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love coconut oil for my hair and my sons hair don&#x27;t know if I could ever not use it any more</li>
            <li> I like this product. It smells great, makes my hair feel soft and mosturizes. That&#x27;s what I want to say but I&#x27;m required to type 6 more words??</li>
            <li> This Coconut treat is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells great! looks gorgeous, shiny and more voluminous!&lt;br /&gt;My hair, scalp as well as skin and myself SAY THANK YOU!!!!!!!! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Great hair treatment for anyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer :--))</li>
