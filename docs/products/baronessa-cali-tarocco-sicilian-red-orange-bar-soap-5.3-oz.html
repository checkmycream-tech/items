            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>There is a reason this item isn&#x27;t referred to as \\&quot;soap\\&quot;; it works and smells amazing as both a cleanser and moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>We love blood orange soap from Tarocco.  </li>

            <li>It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like harsher soaps will, and it has a wonderful aroma of orange.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have found it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>First found this at a nice hotel.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I ordered when I returned home.  </li>
            <li>Like many others who have posted reviews, I first tried this soap at a hotel where I was staying.  </li>
            <li>The price is steep but well worth it!  </li>
            <li>Originally came across this product at a hotel in Atlantic City.</li>
            <li>There are tiny particles in many nice bars of soap, but this is the first one where it felt like they were scratching my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap has seemed to stop all breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>It cost more than the normal soap but worth every penny--especially for individuals with sensitivities.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  </li>
            <li>It is terrific, smells nice, cleans well, good size, and is not  at all harsh to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Found this soap in a hotel we stayed at and simply fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this soap.</li>
            <li>However, the soap at the hotel lathered up much better than the larger size I bought from Amazon</li>
            <li>Personally, I think they put way too many of these granules in it.  </li>
            <li>I first used this cleanser at a hotel in Lansing, MI.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing too.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I smell clean all day long.</li>
            <li>I definitely get where people feel that their skin is really smooth after using this soap, because your skin does feel that way, but within a few moments, I realized that it leaves more of a film on your skin, than any actually moisturization.</li>
            <li>I discovered this soap during a hotel stay at Skyline in New York.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s soap, and the Minty Bar in the past, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why the large size would be different.</li>
            <li>Has small grains to really make you feel clean.</li>
            <li>and my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not dry!  </li>
            <li>Initially, I thought it was a little pricey for just a skin cleanser, but decided it is worth it.</li>
            <li>in it so is slightly abrasive to really get the dirt off but gentle enough for your face and other sensitive parts.</li>

            <li> Like many others who have posted reviews, I first tried this soap at a hotel where I was staying.  I loved its orange frangrance and the nubbly scrubbing bits in the soap that leave your skin smooth.  It is very moisturizing too.  I am so glad to have found it available through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I discovered this soap during a hotel stay at Skyline in New York.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  This soap has seemed to stop all breakouts and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.  Not dry!  I have also noticed an improvement in my skin overall.  I did a search online and am now exlcusively using this soap for face and shower.  Due to cost, I still use Dove for regular handwashing, but that is it.  You will love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, has stuff inside it that gives a scratchy feel!</li>
            <li> I also discovered this cleanser while staying at a hotel, and from then on my skin has been spectacular. Im a  teenager and i used to suffer from breakouts, but no longer. This product is amazing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and fresh.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Cali Tarocco line of bath products when staying in a boutique hotel in NYC.  I absolutely love this soap! It moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin like harsher soaps will, and it has a wonderful aroma of orange.  Additionally, the shampoo and conditioner are both wonderful.      I went out and bought some as soon as I got home, and I haven&#x27;t been sorry.</li>
            <li> I also discovered this soap in a hotel, in Newport Beach.  It is terrific, smells nice, cleans well, good size, and is not  at all harsh to the skin.  I&#x27;ve used Kiehl&#x27;s soap, and the Minty Bar in the past, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> .The best soap I have ever purchased. I smell clean all day long. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive.  Lower the price.</li>
            <li> First found this at a nice hotel. Fell in love with it. Great soap, beautiful scent. My husband loves it also. Has a little &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; in it so is slightly abrasive to really get the dirt off but gentle enough for your face and other sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my skin.  Soap smells great.  The hotel soap at the Inn on  Whitworth, Love it there and ordered my own.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  The price is steep but well worth it!  My wife love&#x27;s it and so do I.</li>
            <li> Found this soap in a hotel we stayed at and simply fell in love with it. It&#x27;s one of the few soaps that does not dry my skin out. Great scent and nice large bar. Lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love this soap. I like the smell of fresh oranges best of all...</li>
            <li> After using this soap a few times because I liked the smell so much, I threw it away because it was actually painful to use - and my skin is not that sensitive. There are tiny particles in many nice bars of soap, but this is the first one where it felt like they were scratching my skin. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser soap at an equally great (high) price.</li>
            <li> Like others, I found this at a hotel (travel size bar) and really liked it.  However, the soap at the hotel lathered up much better than the larger size I bought from Amazon and it also didn&#x27;t have the exfoliating &amp;#34;granules&amp;#34; like the larger size.  Personally, I think they put way too many of these granules in it.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again, very disappointed.  Don&#x27;t know why the large size would be different.</li>
            <li> The best soap ever, great exfoliation texture, great aroma. Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I first used this cleanser at a hotel in Lansing, MI.  I liked it so much, I ordered when I returned home.  Initially, I thought it was a little pricey for just a skin cleanser, but decided it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Best body soap I have ever used. Leaves you smelling great. Originally came across this product at a hotel in Atlantic City. Can&#x27;t get enough of it.  One bar is equivalent in size to Irish Spring bar of soap.  Very thick, lathery discharge soap.  Has small grains to really make you feel clean.</li>
            <li> We love this soap.  It cost more than the normal soap but worth every penny--especially for individuals with sensitivities.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I definitely get where people feel that their skin is really smooth after using this soap, because your skin does feel that way, but within a few moments, I realized that it leaves more of a film on your skin, than any actually moisturization. I don&#x27;t know how actually to describe it, but if you&#x27;ve ever used a soap before that you then thought, I need to wash myself again to get this off of me, this is that soap.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.  I use it as a facial cleanser.  It has a nice fragrance and cleans my face well.</li>
            <li> There is a reason this item isn&#x27;t referred to as \\&quot;soap\\&quot;; it works and smells amazing as both a cleanser and moisturizer. You will love it!</li>
            <li> We love blood orange soap from Tarocco.  It smells great in the shower.  The whole Tarocco line is great, but the bar soap lasts the longest.</li>
            <li> It is great soap for men. I have bough it for years.</li>
            <li> Great Smell, love the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; particles embedded in it.  Very moisturizing when I ran out of Shaving cream I discovered I could actually shave with this soap and it felt great!</li>
