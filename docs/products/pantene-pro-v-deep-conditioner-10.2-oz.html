            <li>I read the reviews of this and people seemed to love it.  </li>
            <li>The results were like magic.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has SM too but the prices are considerably more.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mind paying more for it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt better</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such marvelous results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to detangle in minutes.</li>

            <li>Feels silky smooth!</li>
            <li>hair never felt better</li>
            <li>Okay, so calling out to all the AA naturals out there.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This smells great, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to get the ends of my hair then put it up in a bun until I&#x27;m done my showering.  </li>
            <li>I leave it in for more that 2-mins with a shower cap[while doing things around the house]</li>
            <li>love it love</li>
            <li>When I first started using this mask, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>It does a great job and making there hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I got this when it was on sale for a really good price, so I certainly can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>it seems my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>However, this product&#x27;s formulation did not leave my hair as smooth &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>and I have a good hair day nearly every day these days.  </li>
            <li>Better than a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer said, full of silicons and wax.  </li>
            <li>I found Fekkai way more pricey but the intense treatment worked miracles.</li>
            <li>I put this on after shower and leave it overnight in a braid, rinse it out in the morning with warm water, hair is soft and silking without added weight.</li>
            <li>nothing super special</li>
            <li>I really love this masque it does give moisture,it makes my hair very soft and give it so much slip which is what i love.</li>
            <li>Like seriously, it left my hair soo soft and the smell is sooo beautiful.</li>
            <li>I followed up with a blow dry and straighten and surprisingly my hair has SO MUCH BODY AND BOUNCE!!</li>
            <li>and my hair is nourished, soft, tangle free, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as good as some other higher-end products I have tried, but overall it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Love it, makes your hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Tangles come right out.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I wash my hair, which is usually twice a week, and it works great.</li>
            <li>As one might imagine, my dry hair looked amazing after blow drying....</li>
            <li>This masque worked the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for my hair (4A AA kinky/curly hair, very similar to Naptural85).</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I used a clarifying shampoo (Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil with apple cider vinegar-sulfate free and therefore color safe, btw) and the results were like night and day.  </li>
            <li>SM masks don&#x27;t have any silicone or paraben so the ingredients penetrated the cuticle leaving my hair hydrated, soft, strong and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I use less with Pantene Pro-V and love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to use Pantene&#x27;s product, but as long as you pay attention to the ingredients, you may find that some things can work for our hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and full of body after using this product.  </li>
            <li>However, as time went on, the results were less and less impressive.  </li>
            <li>Older deep conditions made by Pantene were much better.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels super silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, only having to keep it on your hair for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very easy to detangle and it dried soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The damaged hair was close to the scalp and was about two inches in length and a large portion in width.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product because it had mainly the same ingredients as the Pantene 2 minute deep conditioning repair vials but was available for a much more reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job as described.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think it would work...that fast.  </li>
            <li>I have to wash my hair every day because I have a very oily scalp.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I find that my color-treated hair looks and feels much healthier.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly unmannageable and tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have very course, color treated hair and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Just got a straight perm so my hair felt really damaged.</li>
            <li>I rinse it out with cooler water at the very end.  </li>
            <li>Smells incredible and always leaves my dry, thick curly hair luscious and aoft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling as soft and weightless as a feather and very manageable.</li>
            <li>this is a new def.</li>
            <li>These two ingredients coat the hair, not only weighing it down, but also preventing any beneficial ingredients from actually doing any good.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on combed carefully through under a shower cap for at least an hour regardless of the instructions and it is great to soften my course color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It worked but the price is outrageous, it was good but not that good</li>
            <li>My fine, thin curly hair feels bouncy and full of body after using this.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>all i can say is wow</li>
            <li>But if you really want a conditioning treatment that actually benefits your hair, you&#x27;ll use something else.  </li>

            <li>Keeps my hair soft and silky but not oily.</li>
            <li>It feels like Tresemme Natural Avocado Conditioner, but does not define my curls like a conditioner would.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it it down.</li>
            <li>SM is available at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and usually costs between $10-$11.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice (once a week for two weeks), and my hair was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly dry hair and this stuff really gets in there and does something about it.</li>
            <li>Love this for my thick, coarse, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.ir day nearly every day these days.  </li>

            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.ir day nearly every day these days.  </li>
            <li> This works really well on my children&#x27;s hair (biracial kids, one with straight/loose wave and the other with loose spiral curls).</li>
            <li> My hair which is fine and curly got really badly damaged by a hot iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive, designer brands with my long hair</li>
            <li> It does the work but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long enough .</li>
            <li> I tried this out for a few days and my hair is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and pantene masks are the only deep conditioner masques that leave my hair feeling silky, i have tried expensive to cheap products, pantene wins every time, caters to all hair types</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This does seem to moisturize my hair w/out making it feel greasy. It&#x27;s not quite as good as some other higher-end products I have tried, but overall it was pretty good. I have very dry, damaged hair. It is not exceptionally coarse or thick. I have relatively thin hair, and this does not seem to weigh it down. I got this when it was on sale for a really good price, so I certainly can&#x27;t complain. I wouldn&#x27;t pay big bucks for it, but when it is on sale, I would re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> Love this for my thick, coarse, color treated hair. Really does the job as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> After years of use hair dye, I noticed that my hair (where a ponytail would be) was brittle and frizzy.  The damaged hair was close to the scalp and was about two inches in length and a large portion in width.  After doing a bit of research on best products of the year for 2014 for hair, I decided to give this a try.  I used it twice (once a week for two weeks), and my hair was back to normal.  I really didn&#x27;t think it would work...that fast.  Wow.</li>
            <li> all i can say is wow i&#x27;m turning 50 next week and this took off 8 year overnight.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s your solution. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive, designer brands with my long hair and I use less with Pantene Pro-V and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair every day because I have a very oily scalp. The result is that the rest of my hair gets very dry. As one might imagine, my dry hair looked amazing after blow drying.... NOT. This masque worked the first time I used it. I could tell something awesome was happening when I could easier run my fingers through my hair after getting out of the shower (that never happens). After I blow dried, I was left with slightly frizzy, but mostly soft, bouncy hair.</li>
            <li> good stuff, nice for this frizzy hair day</li>
            <li> Masque works well. Great product</li>
            <li> It does the work but the effect doesn&#x27;t last long enough . Maybe my hair is just too dry.</li>
            <li> It worked but the price is outrageous, it was good but not that good, hair conditioner would have done the same thing, but I only used it twice so maybe my opinion will change. Besides the price I didn&#x27;t like the package, it should be in a tube or bottle. I didn&#x27;t like that I had to put my fingers in it to get it out, kind of a bad idea.</li>
            <li> This has to be the worst product ever made by Pantene.  So horrible it dried out my hair after one use.  As one reviewer said, full of silicons and wax.  Absolute CRAP !  In the garbage it goes.  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t buy it. Older deep conditions made by Pantene were much better.  This is the worst!</li>
            <li> Love it, makes your hair soft and shiny.  Superior conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair which is fine and curly got really badly damaged by a hot iron.  I read the reviews of this and people seemed to love it.  It did not work that well for me at all.  I did not feel like my hair was softer or coated after using this product for an intensive treatment.  I even tried combing it through and sleeping with the masque in and rinsing it out the next day to no avail.  It smelled really nice as most panted products do.  I found Fekkai way more pricey but the intense treatment worked miracles.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price!!!! Smells incredible and always leaves my dry, thick curly hair luscious and aoft.</li>
            <li> It works well but I prefer a tube. This is annoying to open with wet hands in the shower.</li>
            <li> This mask is just a heap of silicone.  And that&#x27;s bad for two reasons:  it coats the hair shaft so any beneficial ingredients can&#x27;t penetrate the cuticle and it builds up something fierce so that it weighs the hair down, making it unresponsive to styling.  When I first started using this mask, I loved it.  My hair was very easy to detangle and it dried soft, smooth and shiny.  However, as time went on, the results were less and less impressive.  My hair wouldn&#x27;t hold a curl and it started getting frizzy and dry again.  I used a clarifying shampoo (Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil with apple cider vinegar-sulfate free and therefore color safe, btw) and the results were like night and day.  But I went back to using this mask, not knowing at that point that it was the reason my hair was out of control.  And the same thing happened again!  Finally, I figured out that this mask must be the issue.  And then I actually read the ingredients and did some research.  This mask is almost entirely silicone and some added paraben (wax).  These two ingredients coat the hair, not only weighing it down, but also preventing any beneficial ingredients from actually doing any good.  So I stopped using it and started using Shea Moisture Manuka Honey or Raw Shea Butter masks instead.  SM masks don&#x27;t have any silicone or paraben so the ingredients penetrated the cuticle leaving my hair hydrated, soft, strong and very shiny.  The results were like magic.  Yes, SM is a bit more expensive.  But the masks are extremely thick and rich and concentrated so a little goes a long way.  There&#x27;s also a generous amount in each tub.  SM is available at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and usually costs between $10-$11.  Amazon has SM too but the prices are considerably more.  SM is the best hair care product line I&#x27;ve ever used (the shampoos and regular conditioners are amazing) and I don&#x27;t mind paying more for it.  My hair has never looked or felt better and I have a good hair day nearly every day these days.  If you don&#x27;t mind heavy, gooey silicone, then by all means use this Pantene mask.  But if you really want a conditioning treatment that actually benefits your hair, you&#x27;ll use something else.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.ir day nearly every day these days.  If you don&#x27;t mind heavy, gooey silicone, then by all means use this Pantene mask.  But if you really want a conditioning treatment that actually benefits your hair, you&#x27;ll use something else.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such marvelous results. Better than a hot oil treatment. My hair simply adores this stuff. Once a week and my hair is nourished, soft, tangle free, shiny, and strong.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves hair very moisturized. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  Having used this for several months now, once a week (a little goes a long way) I find that my color-treated hair looks and feels much healthier.  My jar is nearly empty so I will be repurchasing.  Also, this conditioner has a truly beautiful scent.  Thank you Pantene!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very curly unmannageable and tangled hair. I left this product in for a little longer than 2 minutes (I applied it while showering...I then shaved, washed, and did my routine). I then washed it out and my hair felt GREATTT!!!!!!!!! I was able to detangle in minutes. My hair feels super silky and soft. I followed up with a blow dry and straighten and surprisingly my hair has SO MUCH BODY AND BOUNCE!! this is a new def. go to product for me! I do not like the packaging (a little difficult to use in the shower without spilling) but besides that I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, only having to keep it on your hair for 2 minutes.  It makes my hair softer and a little less fly-away.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have EVER used. Stocked up b/c I can&#x27;t find in neighborhood stores</li>
            <li> Very good hair product.  Keeps my hair soft and silky but not oily.</li>
            <li> I have long, frizzy, curly, thick hair and this is the best.  I use it as a regular conditioner, but don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.  Probably not so great for thinner and finer hair at this frequency.  If they quit making their hair masques I don&#x27;t know what I will do!</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry hair and this stuff really gets in there and does something about it. I use it every time I wash my hair, which is usually twice a week, and it works great. I have short, fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it it down.</li>
            <li> Regular conditioner nothing super special</li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> 100% Love! I got this when my hair was in pretty bad shape. Breakage, split ends, the works! Added this to my hair care routine, and I gotta say my hair feels way better than it did before. Feels silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Long story short,&lt;br /&gt;My hair never felt better</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good customer service. I like the conditioner...it seems my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because it had mainly the same ingredients as the Pantene 2 minute deep conditioning repair vials but was available for a much more reasonable price.  However, this product&#x27;s formulation did not leave my hair as smooth &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  I have very long hair and use a curling iron on it every day.  I use this product on the ends and it detangles and protects beautifully!  I also like that you only need to use a small amount.  One tub/jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent , exactly as described</li>
            <li> This stuff does wonders for your hair. It has a great smell. Leaves hair feeling as soft and weightless as a feather and very manageable.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty good. Made my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;Not as deep as a conditioner as I would have expected though.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for awhile.  It works well for wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, so calling out to all the AA naturals out there. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for my hair (4A AA kinky/curly hair, very similar to Naptural85). I thought it would dry my hair out even though it is a product for moisture. Even after looking at the ingredients I was worried, but I figured hey, it&#x27;s only a few dollars so what-the-hey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I finally tried it out yesterday and let me just say, this product is THE bomb! Lol! Like seriously, it left my hair soo soft and the smell is sooo beautiful. It feels like Tresemme Natural Avocado Conditioner, but does not define my curls like a conditioner would. But still! It left my hair feeling so soft! I definitely recommend this for those with my type of hair. The first ingredient is water; I&#x27;ve noticed that all products that start with water usually works for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I didn&#x27;t think I would be able to use Pantene&#x27;s product, but as long as you pay attention to the ingredients, you may find that some things can work for our hair. I will purchasing this again in the future. Woot :~)!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a deep conditioner and have for years.  don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  I have very course, color treated hair and it works wonders.  I leave it on combed carefully through under a shower cap for at least an hour regardless of the instructions and it is great to soften my course color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I put this on after shower and leave it overnight in a braid, rinse it out in the morning with warm water, hair is soft and silking without added weight.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just got a straight perm so my hair felt really damaged. This smells great, and very moisturizing. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have dry, course, color-treated hair and I use this after I&#x27;m on the boat all day (salt water).  Tangles come right out.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin curly hair feels bouncy and full of body after using this.  The deep conditioner I put on immediately after shampooing and getting all the excess water out.  I only have to put a little bit on as it goes a long way.  I make sure to get the ends of my hair then put it up in a bun until I&#x27;m done my showering.  I rinse it out with cooler water at the very end.  After using this my hair feels great and manageable.</li>
            <li> I really love this masque it does give moisture,it makes my hair very soft and give it so much slip which is what i love.I leave it in for more that 2-mins with a shower cap[while doing things around the house] but i could feel the moisture as i was applying it,love it love it works great for my hair, well buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and full of body after using this product.  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile and finally decided to use it. I went swimming and the clorine ruined my hair. I tried this out for a few days and my hair is almost back to normal. The smell is really nice also. I leave this in my hair overnight and with other conditioners they are really thin but this one has a nice consistency. I worried it would get onto my face but since it&#x27;s thicker it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and pantene masks are the only deep conditioner masques that leave my hair feeling silky, i have tried expensive to cheap products, pantene wins every time, caters to all hair types</li>
            <li> This works really well on my children&#x27;s hair (biracial kids, one with straight/loose wave and the other with loose spiral curls). It does a great job and making there hair soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Is a very good product.</li>
