            <li>will be 100% Honest ,</li>
            <li>I liked the way he styled his hair and the packaging</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li>but I like it and would describe it as kind of woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li>This pomade has the best smell, and the best hold of any pomaded I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used quite the few.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the best, and the smell is great, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily and leaves a matte finish vs shiny.</li>
            <li>It has a good hold and leaves your hair really smooth.</li>
            <li>Washes out easy and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li>It washes out easily and gives me an all day hold!</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping, and love the product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Suavecito, my great hair looks so amazing that if it rivals Tom Selleck&#x27;s mustache.</li>

            <li>It is very light for pomade.</li>
            <li>The guys in my Barber shop love the product.</li>
            <li>I still find American Crew to have the best pomade product out there.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this s</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I bought two containers and received a free sticker!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to smell anything else throughout the day but</li>
            <li>I enjoy the shine it provides as well as the nice scent.</li>
            <li>Makes the hair look sexy.</li>
            <li>And i love that it shines and that it holds for along time.</li>
            <li>I love the hold and the aroma.</li>
            <li>--i wish i had more hold</li>
            <li>friggin love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than this pomade.</li>
            <li>First off this pomade smells abseloutley amazing!</li>
            <li>He loves this pomade and I love it on him.:)</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with the results for Suavecito.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>He did allow his hair to grow out a bit on top and in front</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Holds it right into place and smells good.</li>
            <li>Spreads on great, it&#x27;s thicker than any gel but not hard like a wax or goopy</li>
            <li>but unfortunately most of those products don&#x27;t have strong hold</li>
            <li>Standard hold is very good but firme (strong hold), ties it in.  </li>
            <li>Great hold, works easily, washes out completely with just water.</li>
            <li>Smells good as well, very water soluble, easy to get out</li>
            <li>Goes in easy and is easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>And removes easily.</li>
            <li>Washes out easy.</li>
            <li>Strong hold, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hold is strong but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have had a hell of a time finding a Pomade that doesn&#x27;t get crusty, look greasy or stop working two hours into the day.</li>
            <li>I find for me it works best when my hair is a little damp</li>
            <li>Fabulous product for a water based pomade.</li>
            <li>The problem I was having is that I don&#x27;t like shiny hair products that eventually turn crunchy and harden like cheap gel.</li>
            <li>On top of all of the above, it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Suavecito Pomade, original hold, manages my hair very well along with a nice hold.</li>
            <li>good product made in the USA which is something that I really support and will continue supporting.  </li>
            <li>quite unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like a light masculine musk.</li>
            <li>Want the hold that washes out clean, then this is it.  </li>
            <li>and I can just get it delivered straight to me :)</li>
            <li>not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 4 hours since I first put it on and the smell is still so strong that it&#x27;s literally making me nauseated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Holds the hairstyle all day and washes out quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li>quick shipping</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, no issues.</li>
            <li>Quick shipper.</li>
            <li>and it holds pretty good even when I&#x27;m outside working in the 100+ degree temps.</li>
            <li>So overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a pomade that holds really well, has a good matte finish while dry, and smells good</li>
            <li>It smells great, it can just be a little overpowering for awhile.</li>
            <li>A little to shiny for me, but holds great.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or holds the same as layrite.</li>
            <li>Starting to see it at nice men&#x27;s barber shops.</li>
            <li>worth price</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a medium shine with a low to medium hold, and it washes out pretty easily like most water-based</li>
            <li>Washes out very easily with a simple rinse.</li>
            <li>First time using pomade that my barber recommended trying and washes out easily with just water, it also has pretty decent smell to it as well</li>
            <li>It also has a good (but not overwhelming) scent, washes out easily and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Great pomade, has a decent hold have used pomades with stronger holds but the smell of this pomade is #1 hands down.</li>
            <li>It is not too hard or too soft, you can style your hair how you want and it smells awesome too!</li>
            <li>This pomade is by far the most reasonably priced pomade out there.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Suavecito, my hair looks so god damn incredible that it&#x27;d beat up Fabio&#x27;s lame-ass long blonde hair!</li>
            <li>I have only used this stuff four times and will no longer use it as the stench is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>When comparing to Layrite, Sauvecito requires more product for the same amount of shine and hold.</li>
            <li>I wore suavecito in my hair exactly once.</li>
            <li>* first time using this product</li>
            <li>Work&#x27;s real well!</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up at all in even mildly hot weather.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more of Suavecito Pomade.</li>
            <li>It does lose hold in the hot humid summers of the mid-west.</li>
            <li>The cost here with shipping is the same as most places sell it across the counter.  </li>
            <li>but I would rather have one that is able to last all day.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad the price is basically the same online</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It has a decently strong hold and is more flexible then the three flowers pomade and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or stiff.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants to try out pomade for the first time.</li>
            <li>Smells good and does hold the hair all day without it looking greasy or hard.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant and it&#x27;s washability is the same as any other water based pomade.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and the smell.</li>
            <li>Just a quarter sized spot goes through your hair very evenly.</li>
            <li>This scent is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>you can play with your hair without it fighting too much.</li>
            <li>Keeps my Marsha Brady straight hair in place and correct.&lt;br /&gt;Respect.</li>
            <li>but since I moved I don&#x27;t really know where to get it.</li>
            <li>but I will stick to Layrite at least until I find something superior for the price.</li>
            <li>The aroma is something like an aerosol hairspray and it is VERY strong, so strong that I have had people comment on how strong it smells; I will no longer use it because it gives me a bad headache when I have it in.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes your hair stay where it was when you combed it without the mess and nastiness of other hair products.</li>
            <li>Decent product</li>
            <li>A great product for strong hard to style thick hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It definitely does all of the things that Layrite does, except for one major flaw; It smells like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was at work and too busy to notice the stench most of the time, but every time I touched my hair, or had enough time to notice, I gagged a little.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product specifically because I was not allowed to wear a hat at my new job.</li>
            <li>I live in a high-humidity area, and even though it&#x27;s water soluble, it holds up until I shower it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little slick going on, but it dries nicely to provide a good firm hold.</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent (musky) and lasts him all day.</li>
            <li>out easy and a little water will rejuvenate your style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Crazy good hold, exactly what I want in a pomade.</li>
            <li>totally get that this is part of the appeal, and this stuff has a loyal following.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it&#x27;s extremely strong and works really well at controlling my thick unruly cowlick rittled hair.</li>
            <li>I guess the only plus is its not greasy like real pomade when it starts melting, and it washes out no problem.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount of shine and can harden a bit if over applied, but can be easily fixed with a wet comb through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>other reviewers were right on with the performance of Suavecito.</li>
            <li>And if it begins to let loose put a little water and the hold reacts to it :)</li>
            <li>Suavecito is easy on the hair and not greasy or hard.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my old school hipster barber shop sold this and ONLY this pomade</li>
            <li>The hold of this pomade is as expected, as is it&#x27;s setup time and workability is moderate and reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally not a picky man, but as I approach ye old age of 30 and father time has begun whittling away at my hairline, I suddenly find myself struggling to find a pomade that does the job.</li>
            <li>This is the first product to actually tame that cowlick.  </li>
            <li>It also reactivates really well with a little bit of water if you need to restyle it partway through the day.</li>

            <li> Smells good though</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the workability, hold, and smell of their original formula.</li>
            <li> its really awesome, id compare it to layrite super hold.</li>
            <li> hands down the best product there is, Smells great, wonderful hold.</li>

            <li> will be 100% Honest ,</li>
            <li> I liked the way he styled his hair and the packaging</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li> but I like it and would describe it as kind of woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li> This pomade has the best smell, and the best hold of any pomaded I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used quite the few.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the best, and the smell is great, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> Washes out very easily and leaves a matte finish vs shiny.</li>
            <li> It has a good hold and leaves your hair really smooth.</li>
            <li> Washes out easy and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> It washes out easily and gives me an all day hold!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, and love the product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Suavecito, my great hair looks so amazing that if it rivals Tom Selleck&#x27;s mustache.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It is very light for pomade.</li>
            <li> The guys in my Barber shop love the product.</li>
            <li> I still find American Crew to have the best pomade product out there.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this s</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I bought two containers and received a free sticker!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to smell anything else throughout the day but</li>
            <li> I enjoy the shine it provides as well as the nice scent.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair look sexy.</li>
            <li> And i love that it shines and that it holds for along time.</li>
            <li> I love the hold and the aroma.</li>
            <li> --i wish i had more hold</li>
            <li> friggin love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this pomade.</li>
            <li> First off this pomade smells abseloutley amazing!</li>
            <li> He loves this pomade and I love it on him.:)</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with the results for Suavecito.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> He did allow his hair to grow out a bit on top and in front</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Holds it right into place and smells good.</li>
            <li> Spreads on great, it&#x27;s thicker than any gel but not hard like a wax or goopy</li>
            <li> but unfortunately most of those products don&#x27;t have strong hold</li>
            <li> Standard hold is very good but firme (strong hold), ties it in.  </li>
            <li> Great hold, works easily, washes out completely with just water.</li>
            <li> Smells good as well, very water soluble, easy to get out</li>
            <li> Goes in easy and is easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> And removes easily.</li>
            <li> Washes out easy.</li>
            <li> Strong hold, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hold is strong but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have had a hell of a time finding a Pomade that doesn&#x27;t get crusty, look greasy or stop working two hours into the day.</li>
            <li> I find for me it works best when my hair is a little damp</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for a water based pomade.</li>
            <li> The problem I was having is that I don&#x27;t like shiny hair products that eventually turn crunchy and harden like cheap gel.</li>
            <li> On top of all of the above, it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Suavecito Pomade, original hold, manages my hair very well along with a nice hold.</li>
            <li> good product made in the USA which is something that I really support and will continue supporting.  </li>
            <li> quite unique.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like a light masculine musk.</li>
            <li> Want the hold that washes out clean, then this is it.  </li>
            <li> and I can just get it delivered straight to me :)</li>
            <li> not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 hours since I first put it on and the smell is still so strong that it&#x27;s literally making me nauseated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Holds the hairstyle all day and washes out quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> quick shipping</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, no issues.</li>
            <li> Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> and it holds pretty good even when I&#x27;m outside working in the 100+ degree temps.</li>
            <li> So overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a pomade that holds really well, has a good matte finish while dry, and smells good</li>
            <li> It smells great, it can just be a little overpowering for awhile.</li>
            <li> A little to shiny for me, but holds great.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or holds the same as layrite.</li>
            <li> Starting to see it at nice men&#x27;s barber shops.</li>
            <li> worth price</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a medium shine with a low to medium hold, and it washes out pretty easily like most water-based</li>
            <li> Washes out very easily with a simple rinse.</li>
            <li> First time using pomade that my barber recommended trying and washes out easily with just water, it also has pretty decent smell to it as well</li>
            <li> It also has a good (but not overwhelming) scent, washes out easily and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Great pomade, has a decent hold have used pomades with stronger holds but the smell of this pomade is #1 hands down.</li>
            <li> It is not too hard or too soft, you can style your hair how you want and it smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> This pomade is by far the most reasonably priced pomade out there.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Suavecito, my hair looks so god damn incredible that it&#x27;d beat up Fabio&#x27;s lame-ass long blonde hair!</li>
            <li> I have only used this stuff four times and will no longer use it as the stench is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> When comparing to Layrite, Sauvecito requires more product for the same amount of shine and hold.</li>
            <li> I wore suavecito in my hair exactly once.</li>
            <li> * first time using this product</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s real well!</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up at all in even mildly hot weather.</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more of Suavecito Pomade.</li>
            <li> It does lose hold in the hot humid summers of the mid-west.</li>
            <li> The cost here with shipping is the same as most places sell it across the counter.  </li>
            <li> but I would rather have one that is able to last all day.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad the price is basically the same online</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It has a decently strong hold and is more flexible then the three flowers pomade and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants to try out pomade for the first time.</li>
            <li> Smells good and does hold the hair all day without it looking greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant and it&#x27;s washability is the same as any other water based pomade.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and the smell.</li>
            <li> Just a quarter sized spot goes through your hair very evenly.</li>
            <li> This scent is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> you can play with your hair without it fighting too much.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Marsha Brady straight hair in place and correct.&lt;br /&gt;Respect.</li>
            <li> but since I moved I don&#x27;t really know where to get it.</li>
            <li> but I will stick to Layrite at least until I find something superior for the price.</li>
            <li> The aroma is something like an aerosol hairspray and it is VERY strong, so strong that I have had people comment on how strong it smells; I will no longer use it because it gives me a bad headache when I have it in.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair stay where it was when you combed it without the mess and nastiness of other hair products.</li>
            <li> Decent product</li>
            <li> A great product for strong hard to style thick hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It definitely does all of the things that Layrite does, except for one major flaw; It smells like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was at work and too busy to notice the stench most of the time, but every time I touched my hair, or had enough time to notice, I gagged a little.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product specifically because I was not allowed to wear a hat at my new job.</li>
            <li> I live in a high-humidity area, and even though it&#x27;s water soluble, it holds up until I shower it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little slick going on, but it dries nicely to provide a good firm hold.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent (musky) and lasts him all day.</li>
            <li> out easy and a little water will rejuvenate your style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Crazy good hold, exactly what I want in a pomade.</li>
            <li> totally get that this is part of the appeal, and this stuff has a loyal following.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it&#x27;s extremely strong and works really well at controlling my thick unruly cowlick rittled hair.</li>
            <li> I guess the only plus is its not greasy like real pomade when it starts melting, and it washes out no problem.</li>
            <li> Adds just the right amount of shine and can harden a bit if over applied, but can be easily fixed with a wet comb through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> other reviewers were right on with the performance of Suavecito.</li>
            <li> And if it begins to let loose put a little water and the hold reacts to it :)</li>
            <li> Suavecito is easy on the hair and not greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my old school hipster barber shop sold this and ONLY this pomade</li>
            <li> The hold of this pomade is as expected, as is it&#x27;s setup time and workability is moderate and reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not a picky man, but as I approach ye old age of 30 and father time has begun whittling away at my hairline, I suddenly find myself struggling to find a pomade that does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the first product to actually tame that cowlick.  </li>
            <li> It also reactivates really well with a little bit of water if you need to restyle it partway through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked putting hair styling products on because they always left my hair feeling weird or just didn&#x27;t hold good enough.</li>
            <li> It hold all day, through warm and cold weather, humid or dry.</li>
            <li> My husband had tried approximately one bajillion products for his hair, now that he&#x27;s wearing it longer and his old gel wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore, but wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with any of them.</li>
            <li> Even then, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Layrite.</li>
            <li> But since I frequently work outside and work on cars I feel like this was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> You can get other brands cheaper at your local drug store, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars.</li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t quite hold my hair in place as long as I would like without the need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I prefer to put it in while my hair is dry to maintain a matte finish</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does not take but a small amount and after about ten minutes its flexible enough if you want to come it through and soften it</li>
            <li> For a wet or dry look.</li>
            <li> Use a little to shape or use a lot for extra hold.</li>
            <li> Reactivates with a wet comb for whenever you need it.</li>
            <li> , it just looks like your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> You can use a hair mister to re wet your hair and it will hold for another 12 hours like you just put it on.</li>
            <li> It performs as expected.</li>
            <li> You can wet your hair again to get the desired effect</li>
            <li> I have really thick dense hair that I typically like to part and style into the classic &amp;#34;business cut&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s mexican with thick coarse hair that reaches the nape of his neck.</li>
            <li> And I have dark, wavy hair and its the only product known to tame my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> have tried other pomades and they dont beat this one.&lt;br /&gt;Crew</li>
            <li> My boyfriend slicks his hair back usually he wears tres Flores</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried other products, but none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve cycled through 5 other products before finding this stuff.</li>
            <li> /inconsistent like other pomades.</li>
            <li> Usually buy it from a local barber</li>
            <li> like i wanted too and does not have a crazy hard feel like most gels do.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who has very thick hair and a complete 360 degree cowlick in the very center of his front hairline.  </li>
            <li> Suavecito was a little cheaper, and according to reviews, it performs just as well if not better than Layrite, not to mention the label is totally badass!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m talking about some vending machine crap cologne you wear in 5th grade when you think $0.50 of effort will get girls to pay more attention to you.</li>
            <li> Suavecito, despite the odd decision on packaging, meets all of these criteria.</li>
            <li> I do wish the scent was a little lighter though.</li>
            <li> it holds throughout the day with just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> As soon as your head starts to sweat even a little bit</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little greasy, but is a pomade what do folks expect?</li>
            <li> It is a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a little shine, but you can control based on quantity of product.</li>
            <li> The hold is not too firm and its not flakey.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair a bit stiff tho.</li>
            <li> A little comb-through, and it still looks slick all day.</li>
            <li> advice to Suavecito, tweak or at least bring down the scent of the product a notch, please.</li>
            <li> No more flakes</li>
            <li> Layrite has a fragrance as well, but it&#x27;s very subtle and has virtually no smell once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> As the owner of an undercut, I&#x27;ve always used a combo of gel and wax to slick up my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a matte finish</li>
            <li> ill buy the firme next time</li>
            <li> its hard to explain.</li>
            <li> it loses its hold and my hair falls out of place.</li>
            <li> Keeps my crazy thick hair looking sharp with a gentelmens cut!</li>
            <li> Sensibly priced compared to outrageous cost of American Crew and other brands.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Cheesy packaging, however.</li>
            <li> smell is not to bad at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good deal on some great pomade. Haven&#x27;t tried many for comparison after my barber recommended sauvacito, haven&#x27;t needed to!</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. No more flakes and it smells great. Very masculine scent (musky) and lasts him all day. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and the best hair product I have ever used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I put it in damp hair and it holds it in place nicely. My hair is relatively stubborn and doesn&#x27;t like to be slicked to one side, this manages to hold it all day. Adds just the right amount of shine and can harden a bit if over applied, but can be easily fixed with a wet comb through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and works well, this will be my go to pomade!</li>
            <li> The guys in my Barber shop love the product.</li>
            <li> BEST POMADE ON THE PLANET!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or holds the same as layrite. But for the money it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for its value.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes your hair stay where it was when you combed it without the mess and nastiness of other hair products. Reactivates with a wet comb for whenever you need it.</li>
            <li> This is a geat pomade! Best hold I&#x27;ve ever had, and it smells great too!!</li>
            <li> For me this one of the best pomade</li>
            <li> Holds great without being sticky. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great good price will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Good product and good value.  I still find American Crew to have the best pomade product out there.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Noon greasy</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Awesome product</li>
            <li> The only pomade I use. Great smell, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling sticky or greasy. Holds the hairstyle all day and washes out quickly in the shower.</li>
            <li> The hold of this pomade is as expected, as is it&#x27;s setup time and workability is moderate and reasonable. I have only used this stuff four times and will no longer use it as the stench is overwhelming. The aroma is something like an aerosol hairspray and it is VERY strong, so strong that I have had people comment on how strong it smells; I will no longer use it because it gives me a bad headache when I have it in. This stuff works well but doesn&#x27;t agree with my nostrils.</li>
            <li> This pomade is by far the most reasonably priced pomade out there. The hold is not too firm and its not flakey. Nice manly smell as well. Great for over 18 hours a day.</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s hair product of its kind. Love this stuff. Starting to see it at nice men&#x27;s barber shops. Buy up now, demand is going to push up the price of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used in my hair. Holds excellent and lasts all day. I do wish the scent was a little lighter though. It smells great, it can just be a little overpowering for awhile.</li>
            <li> Great product! My boyfriend loved it. He uses it daily. Smells good and does hold the hair all day without it looking greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> First time using pomade that my barber recommended trying and washes out easily with just water, it also has pretty decent smell to it as well I would recommend to anyone who wants to try out pomade for the first time.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product for a water based pomade. Goes in easy and is easy to comb through. Awesome hold and scent! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff. It does make your hair a bit stiff tho. I love this stuff! Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this s*** !best pomade ! 👍🏽</li>
            <li> this is not their Firme Hold kind, i didnt realize there was a difference until i received, still held well</li>
            <li> When comparing to Layrite, Sauvecito requires more product for the same amount of shine and hold. Even then, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as Layrite. The smell was pleasant and it&#x27;s washability is the same as any other water based pomade. Decent product but I will stick to Layrite at least until I find something superior for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Layrite for over a year and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the workability, hold, and smell of their original formula. It tames my curly hair well, doesn&#x27;t feel or look crusty, like a gel does, and it washes out at the end of night. So why switch? Suavecito was a little cheaper, and according to reviews, it performs just as well if not better than Layrite, not to mention the label is totally badass! Suavecito also doesn&#x27;t contain any parabens, a known carcinogen, like Layrite does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewers were right on with the performance of Suavecito. It definitely does all of the things that Layrite does, except for one major flaw; It smells like cheap cologne. Now I&#x27;m not talking about some mid-grade cologne you wear to church sometimes, I&#x27;m talking about some vending machine crap cologne you wear in 5th grade when you think $0.50 of effort will get girls to pay more attention to you. I wore suavecito in my hair exactly once. Luckily I was at work and too busy to notice the stench most of the time, but every time I touched my hair, or had enough time to notice, I gagged a little. I couldn&#x27;t tell you why a scent is even necessary in a product like this. Layrite has a fragrance as well, but it&#x27;s very subtle and has virtually no smell once it&#x27;s dry. So until Suavecito gets an overhaul, despite the parabens, I&#x27;m sticking with Layrite.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and the smell. I just have to learn how to apply to my hair. I find for me it works best when my hair is a little damp or else it&#x27;s not too pliable.</li>
            <li> Sauvecito is my go-to pomade! Washes out easy and does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING. Washes out very easily with a simple rinse. Use a little to shape or use a lot for extra hold.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair looking great but gives me more acne for my forehead.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it works great for curly, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;No waxy feeling or build up. ( No flakes or white chunks in hair).&lt;br /&gt;It sets with ease as soon as you apply it to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Rinses out easy and a little water will rejuvenate your style.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other pomades and they dont beat this one.&lt;br /&gt;Crew pomade has lost my business after trying suavecito.&lt;br /&gt;Its also fairly priced.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I love it holds throughout the day with just a little bit.  And if it begins to let loose put a little water and the hold reacts to it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and amazing delivery!!</li>
            <li> Best pomade out there</li>
            <li> Good s*** first time using this product and it holds pretty good even when I&#x27;m outside working in the 100+ degree temps.</li>
            <li> works great and washes away easily.  Does not leave a greasy feel in your scalp like there is a jar of Vaseline on your head.</li>
            <li> Great pomade, has a decent hold have used pomades with stronger holds but the smell of this pomade is #1 hands down. Washes out very easily and leaves a matte finish vs shiny.</li>
            <li> A great product for strong hard to style thick hair. Holds it right into place and smells good. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Work&#x27;s real well! A little to shiny for me, but holds great.  Smells good too. Would but again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, strong hold.  And removes easily. I would recommend it too anyone. Good price too. I bought two containers and received a free sticker!</li>
            <li> Keeps my crazy thick hair looking sharp with a gentelmens cut!</li>
            <li> Great hold. Washes out easy.</li>
            <li> My husband had tried approximately one bajillion products for his hair, now that he&#x27;s wearing it longer and his old gel wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore, but wasn&#x27;t particularly happy with any of them. After looking for online reviews, I bought this for him and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m with those who CANNOT stand the scent of &amp;#34;cheap perfume&amp;#34; of this product. It&#x27;s been 4 hours since I first put it on and the smell is still so strong that it&#x27;s literally making me nauseated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating! You won&#x27;t be able to smell anything else throughout the day but this product; it overpowers any smell that surrounds you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a medium shine with a low to medium hold, and it washes out pretty easily like most water-based pomades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to Suavecito, tweak or at least bring down the scent of the product a notch, please. Actually, make it three notches!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Smells great an hold is good.</li>
            <li> As the owner of an undercut, I&#x27;ve always used a combo of gel and wax to slick up my hair. Someone told me about Suavecito, and how the hold is incredible, so I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really good stuff. Just a quarter sized spot goes through your hair very evenly. It&#x27;s a little slick going on, but it dries nicely to provide a good firm hold. There is, however, one distinct drawback, at least for me. This scent is very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally get that this is part of the appeal, and this stuff has a loyal following. But for me, the scent is just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality? Excellent. The smell? A bit overpowering. I&#x27;ll be switching back to my wax.</li>
            <li> good product made in the USA which is something that I really support and will continue supporting.  Suavecito is easy on the hair and not greasy or hard.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold up at all in even mildly hot weather. As soon as your head starts to sweat even a little bit it loses its hold and my hair falls out of place. I guess the only plus is its not greasy like real pomade when it starts melting, and it washes out no problem. But since I frequently work outside and work on cars I feel like this was a wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> Great pomade love it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Strong hold, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have really thick dense hair that I typically like to part and style into the classic &amp;#34;business cut&amp;#34; look. The problem I was having is that I don&#x27;t like shiny hair products that eventually turn crunchy and harden like cheap gel. I usually prefer a matte finish but unfortunately most of those products don&#x27;t have strong hold and my style would fall out partway through the day. This immediately stopped once I started using Suavacito. I prefer to put it in while my hair is dry to maintain a matte finish and I feel like it&#x27;s extremely strong and works really well at controlling my thick unruly cowlick rittled hair. It also reactivates really well with a little bit of water if you need to restyle it partway through the day. I feel like using it with water makes the hold even stronger! When you do use it with water it doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny greasy look to your hair, rather, it just looks like your hair is wet. On top of all of the above, it smells really good. It&#x27;s kind of like a light masculine musk. So overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a pomade that holds really well, has a good matte finish while dry, and smells good then this is your product</li>
            <li> hands down the best product there is, Smells great, wonderful hold. You can use a hair mister to re wet your hair and it will hold for another 12 hours like you just put it on.</li>
            <li> This product contains beeswax I&#x27;m convinced its made my hair softer with use and don&#x27;t even need conditioner when showering.</li>
            <li> Suavecito Pomade, original hold, manages my hair very well along with a nice hold. I enjoy the shine it provides as well as the nice scent. This is my go-to product.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best pomade on the market. It is water based so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy and gross. It washes out easily and gives me an all day hold! This is the only pomade I will buy and now a couple of my friends use it. Also, it smells great!</li>
            <li> Makes the hair look sexy. Nuf said.</li>
            <li> Really like it! Smells really good! And i love that it shines and that it holds for along time. GREAT!</li>
            <li> One of the best pomades available.  quick shipping</li>
            <li> Great product. Met my expectations, does what it was made to do. Will definitely buy more of Suavecito Pomade. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love the hold and the aroma.</li>
            <li> its really awesome, id compare it to layrite super hold. it straitens my hair out (i have curly hair) and it smells the best--i wish i had more hold mabye ill buy the firme next time</li>
            <li> Works good and smells great, like a cologne almost</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little greasy, but is a pomade what do folks expect? It performs as expected. It reactivates with water as described. I get all day hold out of it. I purchased this product specifically because I was not allowed to wear a hat at my new job. It is a little overpriced. You can get other brands cheaper at your local drug store, that is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. This is a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be 100% Honest ,one of coworkers accidentally left a container of this in the bathroom at work. I liked the way he styled his hair and the packaging so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Great product. It does lose hold in the hot humid summers of the mid-west.</li>
            <li> It keeps its shape through a sweaty bicycle commute, inside a helmet, drenched with sweat. A little comb-through, and it still looks slick all day. I live in a high-humidity area, and even though it&#x27;s water soluble, it holds up until I shower it out. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Crazy good hold, exactly what I want in a pomade.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best--nothing else comes closehttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Aj2NlCvVL._SS300_.jpg</li>
            <li> holds well and smells good</li>
            <li> Best thing out there!! Forealz</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I&#x27;ve tried others that are water-based, but Suavecito is the best. You only need a little bit and it goes a long way. And I have dark, wavy hair and its the only product known to tame my hairstyle. Thank you, Suavecito!</li>
            <li> friggin love this stuff. i tried american crew pomade but it can&#x27;t hold up(see what i did there?) to Suavecito!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping, and love the product!</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than this pomade.</li>
            <li> Killer stuff that lasts until you wash it out. Not sticky or flaky. Best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend slicks his hair back usually he wears tres Flores but after hearing about this he wanted to try it. He&#x27;s mexican with thick coarse hair that reaches the nape of his neck. First off this pomade smells abseloutley amazing! If you have ever smelled chrome cologne that&#x27;s what it smells like. It has a decently strong hold and is more flexible then the three flowers pomade and doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or stiff. If he messes up his hair or anything he wets a comb and fixes it. Then it stays all day. He loves this pomade and I love it on him.:)</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I&#x27;ve never liked putting hair styling products on because they always left my hair feeling weird or just didn&#x27;t hold good enough. I am more than pleased with the results for Suavecito. Holds and keeps my hair how I want it. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Want the hold that washes out clean, then this is it.  Standard hold is very good but firme (strong hold), ties it in.  Does not take but a small amount and after about ten minutes its flexible enough if you want to come it through and soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth price especially if you have prime shipping.  The cost here with shipping is the same as most places sell it across the counter.  With prime you&#x27;re saving a couple of bucks.</li>
            <li> This thing works great for my comb over</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used, works perfect.</li>
            <li> Works as advertized, makes my hair look suave as hell. Thanks to Suavecito, my great hair looks so amazing that if it rivals Tom Selleck&#x27;s mustache. Thanks to Suavecito, my hair looks so god damn incredible that it&#x27;d beat up Fabio&#x27;s lame-ass long blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Good. Leaves hair smelling nice.</li>
            <li> Great product. It has a good hold and leaves your hair really smooth. The smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have had a hell of a time finding a Pomade that doesn&#x27;t get crusty, look greasy or stop working two hours into the day. Suavecito, despite the odd decision on packaging, meets all of these criteria. It also has a good (but not overwhelming) scent, washes out easily and is reasonably priced. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, who has very thick hair and a complete 360 degree cowlick in the very center of his front hairline.  This is the first product to actually tame that cowlick.  He did allow his hair to grow out a bit on top and in front so I think that the overall improvement in style is from both the added length and the Suavecito.  He&#x27;s tried other products, but none have worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great price</li>
            <li> not a bad product. slicks your hair back real nice like i wanted too and does not have a crazy hard feel like most gels do. you can play with your hair without it fighting too much. smell is not to bad at all. quite unique. like a wood/foresr type. its hard to explain. i would buy this product again though.</li>
            <li> Suavecito is the best water based pomade on the market, I prefer it to layrite</li>
            <li> The only pomade I&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li> Great pomade for a lot of hairstyles! Smells good as well, very water soluble, easy to get out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not a picky man, but as I approach ye old age of 30 and father time has begun whittling away at my hairline, I suddenly find myself struggling to find a pomade that does the job. In fact, I&#x27;ve cycled through 5 other products before finding this stuff. Thankfully, my old school hipster barber shop sold this and ONLY this pomade and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is strong but not too strong. Spreads on great, it&#x27;s thicker than any gel but not hard like a wax or goopy/inconsistent like other pomades. You&#x27;ll get a little shine, but you can control based on quantity of product.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, no issues.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Marsha Brady straight hair in place and correct.&lt;br /&gt;Respect.</li>
            <li> I used to use axe pomade, and its like night and day with suavecito. It is not too hard or too soft, you can style your hair how you want and it smells awesome too! Will definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> My nephew loved, his hair looks good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a nice smell and consistency.  For me it doesn&#x27;t quite hold my hair in place as long as I would like without the need to reapply.You can wet your hair again to get the desired effect but I would rather have one that is able to last all day.  I can see how the smell can be hit or miss with some people but I like it and would describe it as kind of woodsy smell.  Also, this pomade is a bit pricey but it is comparable to others such as layrite.  Overall this is a quality pomade but I think I will try the stronger one next time.</li>
            <li> great product, great price!!! Excellent hold, washes out with ease. Sensibly priced compared to outrageous cost of American Crew and other brands. Cheesy packaging, however.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Usually buy it from a local barber but since I moved I don&#x27;t really know where to get it. Same thing as what I bought at my barber so I&#x27;m glad the price is basically the same online and I can just get it delivered straight to me :)</li>
            <li> Great product works perfect</li>
            <li> This pomade has the best smell, and the best hold of any pomaded I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used quite the few. It hold all day, through warm and cold weather, humid or dry. It&#x27;s pretty much the best, and the smell is great, I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on how good it smells. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. Quick shipper.</li>
            <li> still one of my go to&#x27;s. For a wet or dry look.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks, I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about 4 months now and I&#x27;m still only about halfway through the jar. Great hold, works easily, washes out completely with just water. It is very light for pomade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Smells good though</li>
            <li> Great product great price great service</li>
            <li> Smells so good and holds great</li>
