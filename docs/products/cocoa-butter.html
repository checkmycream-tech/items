            <li>i stuck as much of my face into the envelope/bag shipper as I could and just inhaled all of the amazing choco goodness!</li>
            <li>Excited to give as gifts!</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry, desert weather.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, and easy to incorporate into my face lotion recipie</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful solid bar and smells wonderful before you even have a chance to open the bag.</li>
            <li>Smells  of delicious chocolate, melts easily and evenly, spreads nicely in my body whip and doesn&#x27;t leave me a greasy mess!</li>
            <li>I purchased it to make my own lotion to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and found that it really made the lotion feel smooth and smell amazing.</li>
            <li>all I can say is, if your a fan off Better Shea Butter, then you will also fall in love with this rich and smooth to the touch Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be looking around anymore because their products are clearly very high quality and the customer service I received from the owner was exceptional.</li>
            <li>Smells AH-MAZING and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Packaging is neat, delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to shred for a recipe.  </li>
            <li>First time buying cocoa butter but thought this had a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>its my first time making my own body butter</li>
            <li>-this is the first product that me hit with the wonderful aroma before package open  and</li>
            <li>First, I love the Organic Cocoa Butter from Better Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s done wonders keeping my newborn, toddler, and my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>It feels great but the chocolate smell overwhelms any essential oil scents I want to add to the lotion I&#x27;m making.  </li>
            <li>really its amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been making a few of the recipes and all have come out wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the shea butter and have had the same great experience with using it in recipes.</li>
            <li>the heavenly scent just filled the air around me.</li>
            <li>It works great and smells terrific.  </li>
            <li>This product is simply light years ahead in quality.</li>
            <li>I made a simple body butter for my 2 yr old daughter for after her baths and she just smells so delicious, and leaves her skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li>company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, honestly, my morning schedule doesn&#x27;t really have a slot for a separate body-moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li>The owner is responsive, and she communicates free recipes and deals often.</li>
            <li>All the acne creams, home remedies, essential oils don&#x27;t come close to how great this works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>I used this to make a anti stretch mark cream for my wife and so far so good.</li>
            <li>and I used it to make lotion, salve and body butter last night and it melted nicely and made a nice end product.</li>
            <li>She just started to make natural skin care products for herself and she loved using this product</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth and natural!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is great, but can be strong for those who don&#x27;t like the sweet chocolate smell, you can just mix it with some essential oils.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t love at first</li>
            <li>I am incredibly picky about cocoa butter and every other body butter that I purchase to make my homemade products.</li>
            <li>This Cocoa Butter comes in 2 sealed bags and when you open it up it smells amazing, just like a chocolate bar!</li>
            <li>and it smells like rich chocolate.</li>
            <li>I have bought their shea butter many times, but this was my first purchase of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Better Shea butter has such a nice woodsy and nutty smell and a silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li>Product arrived exactly as shown.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Lie down and bask in the incredible smell of chocolate, knowing that your feet are all lubed up and there is no way you are getting out of bed to satisfy the craving for chocolate you now have.  </li>
            <li>Then rub it all over your clean feet.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful aroma and blends very well with my oils and other products.</li>
            <li>good price, fast, high quality</li>
            <li>Thanks Isabella:)</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky, and has a delicious chocolate fragrance that matches the most expensive cocoa butters on the market.  </li>
            <li>I used it make it into a body butter (along with coconut oil &amp; sweet almond oil).</li>
            <li>And you do get some cool recipes from this</li>
            <li>Let cool to room temp.</li>
            <li>Best products hands down!!!</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter blends beautifully with other ingredients!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different brands and this one is easy to work with, stays fresh and smells great!!</li>
            <li>Creamy, smooth and melts right into skin</li>
            <li>The butter has a sweet cocoa smell and melts quickly at body temperature.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter is clean and fragrant, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes.</li>
            <li>Smells good, melts easily over a steam bath, mix well with other oils.</li>
            <li>This stuff alone seriously smells so amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>Now and forever will be a loyal customer</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter was shipped quickly in the resealable brown bag as seen in the picture.</li>

            <li>Will be back soon to buy more :-)</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this to try.</li>

            <li>Amazing quality and love the minimal packaging!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, love the company, I bought other things from them and am very happy with them too, cant go wrong with this one if you enjoy a high quality natural emollient.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>I just love the all natural cocoa butter!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 Thank you so much Isabella!!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and non greasy!!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when opening this package was the heavenly smell!</li>
            <li>Try Better Shea Butter&#x27;s products and you&#x27;ll buy no other brands ....trust me !!!</li>
            <li>When you first open the package you are hit with its beautiful and natural chocolate smell!</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t add any essential oils because the pure cocoa butter is more effective on the skin in its pure state.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is such an amazing commodity.</li>
            <li>personally want to thank you for sharing your amazing products with customers like myself..</li>
            <li>and it is useful,</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly, and arrived in a double zip-lock packaging which kept it fresh, and made it very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and very high quality.</li>
            <li>but ive learned not to expect anything less from this company :P</li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I used it in my body butter and it smells good, but added it with other butters.</li>
            <li>Absolute success!</li>
            <li>i have been using it right  off the block...</li>
            <li>After experiencing Better Shea Butter&#x27;s sweet smelling Organic Cocoa Butter for just one week, I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter is very pure &amp; you get results.</li>
            <li>you are already in bed, rub a tiny amount of this 100% Pure Cocoa Butter in your palms to warm it up and liquefy it.  </li>
            <li>The quality is exceptional compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>It smelled like pure chocolate!</li>
            <li>Product was just as advertised - pure, organic cocoa butter!  </li>
            <li>Got this bag of amazingness in the mail super fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered 1 pound and cut a small slice off to make the body butter (stored rest in refrigerator).&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter was delivered on time and was very nicely packed.</li>
            <li>This is a top quality product; I&#x27;ve used other Cocoa butter before and the quality wasn&#x27;t as fine as this.  </li>
            <li>The shea butter rubs right on, but in kind of a gloppy, chunky way, so I ended up getting too much on me, and having to wait a long time before getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Homemade lotion was super easy to make and they even provide a simple recipe.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant and lucious!  </li>
            <li>Price + quality &#x3D; repeat customer;)</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend you try Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>This is second order of from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>Men who don&#x27;t like moisturize please try this product, for women usually are more aware and on top of products for face and body.</li>
            <li>The seller is not only approachable, but is kind enough to offer a free ebook of recipes and a sample of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>also first one that began to melt on touch of finger  </li>
            <li>First time buyer of this cocoa butter</li>
            <li>This is now the second product I purchase from this seller (Better Shea Butter)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery , will order again!</li>
            <li>Smells very chocolately!</li>
            <li>The resealable bag is clearly marked organic, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I love using this with my essential oils!</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter came plastic wrapped inside a resealable pouch and was exactly 16 ounces.</li>
            <li>I just had higher expectations for it&#x27;s usefulness and then didn&#x27;t follow through.</li>
            <li>The cocoa butter is harder, so it&#x27;s more of a pain to rub directly on to skin, but it&#x27;s also lighter, so it absorbs better.</li>
            <li>Will purchase again;)</li>
            <li>I love that the company sends different recipes for their product.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the cocoa butter, but add some essential oils.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I used it for was making lotion.</li>
            <li>Very easy to melt, I&#x27;m using it for face and arms, because my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li>Isabella is very knowledgable about the product she sells and is even kind enough to follow up and check on new product users like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely learning more recipes</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast, high quality cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Smells like pure dark chocolate and it is so smooth!!</li>

            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this very product and company to a handful of friends and family.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>cocoa butter comes as a very thick/firm block.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>this cocoa butter is very moisturizing</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks #</li>
            <li>My husband made beard butter using this, coconut oil, and jojoba oil and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>And I am a very picky person.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes while not leaving you greasy like straight coconut oil will.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm, has a nice chocolatey aroma but not too over bearing (7 out of 10) .</li>
            <li>The finished product was rich, and luxurious and didn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals of store bought lotion.</li>
            <li>I added sweet orange essential oil</li>
            <li>I am expecting a new pound of coco butter today!</li>
            <li>My order came fast and was nice and hard.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and properly.</li>
            <li>The sellers seem very professional, and it&#x27;s Prime!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would definitely highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am in California and we have had temperatures in high 90s when this product arrived.</li>
            <li>all of which were high quality and packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li>100 percent pure and natural</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>I have never used the microwave because a little patience and elbow grease is better to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty large piece so it should last her a while.</li>
            <li>Easy to melt and blend with other oils!</li>
            <li>The first body butter made received such a high review that I placed another order.  </li>
            <li>Very professional</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter is my new &#x27;go-to&amp;#34; for small order purchases.</li>
            <li>Used this with raw shea butter (yellow) and coconut oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more natural ways to help my dry old aged skin.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>It smells so natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed how much softer my skin is after only a week of use.</li>
            <li>Smells like chocolate and melts in your hands to apply directly on skin.</li>
            <li>Isabella has been so much help, not only with my purchases but also with recipes too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cocoa butter for lotions and soaps, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>The company also has a website where you can enter your Amazon order number and then download an e-book with 21 recipes for hair, face, and body products using all natural ingredients, in case you are looking for recipe ideas.</li>
            <li>It makes her skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Once it makes contact with the body you can just rub it around and it will begin to melt naturally.</li>
            <li>It does have the natural coco butter smell</li>
            <li>I used this cocoa butter in a few different recipes for body care products and really enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just been adding a few shavings of this in all my recipes for some extra cocoalicious goodness that my body and nose loves! :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s versitile and easy to work with, but being the nature of cocoa butter that has not been deodorized, the chocolate aroma can only be toned down but never muted.</li>
            <li>My skin was still pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It smells like a deep dark chocolate, but only better.  </li>
            <li>I previously ordered their Shea Butter and can&#x27;t believe how quickly I&#x27;m going though it.  </li>
            <li>The block of butter is in a plastic bag as well, when mine arrived it was a bit warm (and a little melty) from shipping, but that was easily fixed with a few minutes in refrigeration.</li>
            <li>So now I have this huge chunk of organic cocoa butter and not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li>an is very soothing especially when mixed with oils of your choice and</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter will moisturize your skin like no other.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that added bonus because no other product has done that for me.</li>
            <li>It is a solid bar, but can be quickly melted down to make a luxurious body butter.</li>
            <li>A little more spend than other raw brands but worth it.</li>
            <li>This company is professional, timely, and they take extra care in preparing the product.</li>
            <li>I added Lavender essential oil by Young Living.  </li>
            <li>Seller is quick to ship, very customer oriented and stands behind their product.</li>
            <li>but I am pretty sure it won&#x27;t be bad.</li>
            <li>is was my first time using raw cocoa butter, and after only 10 days, my stretch marks are noticibly lighter.</li>

            <li> I purchased it to make my own lotion to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and found that it really made the lotion feel smooth and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> all I can say is, if your a fan off Better Shea Butter, then you will also fall in love with this rich and smooth to the touch Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be looking around anymore because their products are clearly very high quality and the customer service I received from the owner was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Smells AH-MAZING and easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Packaging is neat, delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to shred for a recipe.  </li>
            <li> First time buying cocoa butter but thought this had a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> its my first time making my own body butter</li>
            <li> -this is the first product that me hit with the wonderful aroma before package open  and</li>
            <li> First, I love the Organic Cocoa Butter from Better Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s done wonders keeping my newborn, toddler, and my skin soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It feels great but the chocolate smell overwhelms any essential oil scents I want to add to the lotion I&#x27;m making.  </li>
            <li> really its amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making a few of the recipes and all have come out wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the shea butter and have had the same great experience with using it in recipes.</li>
            <li> the heavenly scent just filled the air around me.</li>
            <li> It works great and smells terrific.  </li>
            <li> This product is simply light years ahead in quality.</li>
            <li> I made a simple body butter for my 2 yr old daughter for after her baths and she just smells so delicious, and leaves her skin silky smooth!</li>
            <li> company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, honestly, my morning schedule doesn&#x27;t really have a slot for a separate body-moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> The owner is responsive, and she communicates free recipes and deals often.</li>
            <li> All the acne creams, home remedies, essential oils don&#x27;t come close to how great this works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a anti stretch mark cream for my wife and so far so good.</li>
            <li> and I used it to make lotion, salve and body butter last night and it melted nicely and made a nice end product.</li>
            <li> She just started to make natural skin care products for herself and she loved using this product</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth and natural!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is great, but can be strong for those who don&#x27;t like the sweet chocolate smell, you can just mix it with some essential oils.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t love at first</li>
            <li> I am incredibly picky about cocoa butter and every other body butter that I purchase to make my homemade products.</li>
            <li> This Cocoa Butter comes in 2 sealed bags and when you open it up it smells amazing, just like a chocolate bar!</li>
            <li> and it smells like rich chocolate.</li>
            <li> I have bought their shea butter many times, but this was my first purchase of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Better Shea butter has such a nice woodsy and nutty smell and a silky smooth feel.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as shown.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> Lie down and bask in the incredible smell of chocolate, knowing that your feet are all lubed up and there is no way you are getting out of bed to satisfy the craving for chocolate you now have.  </li>
            <li> Then rub it all over your clean feet.  </li>
            <li> It has a wonderful aroma and blends very well with my oils and other products.</li>
            <li> good price, fast, high quality</li>
            <li> Thanks Isabella:)</li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky, and has a delicious chocolate fragrance that matches the most expensive cocoa butters on the market.  </li>
            <li> I used it make it into a body butter (along with coconut oil &amp; sweet almond oil).</li>
            <li> And you do get some cool recipes from this</li>
            <li> Let cool to room temp.</li>
            <li> Best products hands down!!!</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter blends beautifully with other ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands and this one is easy to work with, stays fresh and smells great!!</li>
            <li> Creamy, smooth and melts right into skin</li>
            <li> The butter has a sweet cocoa smell and melts quickly at body temperature.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is clean and fragrant, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes.</li>
            <li> Smells good, melts easily over a steam bath, mix well with other oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff alone seriously smells so amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Now and forever will be a loyal customer</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter was shipped quickly in the resealable brown bag as seen in the picture.</li>
            <li> microwave it,  and use it for my growing pregnant belly.</li>

            <li> Amazing quality and love the minimal packaging!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, love the company, I bought other things from them and am very happy with them too, cant go wrong with this one if you enjoy a high quality natural emollient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li> I just love the all natural cocoa butter!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 Thank you so much Isabella!!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and non greasy!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when opening this package was the heavenly smell!</li>
            <li> Try Better Shea Butter&#x27;s products and you&#x27;ll buy no other brands ....trust me !!!</li>
            <li> When you first open the package you are hit with its beautiful and natural chocolate smell!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t add any essential oils because the pure cocoa butter is more effective on the skin in its pure state.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is such an amazing commodity.</li>
            <li> personally want to thank you for sharing your amazing products with customers like myself..</li>
            <li> and it is useful,</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly, and arrived in a double zip-lock packaging which kept it fresh, and made it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very fresh and very high quality.</li>
            <li> but ive learned not to expect anything less from this company :P</li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I used it in my body butter and it smells good, but added it with other butters.</li>
            <li> Absolute success!</li>
            <li> i have been using it right  off the block...</li>
            <li> After experiencing Better Shea Butter&#x27;s sweet smelling Organic Cocoa Butter for just one week, I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is very pure &amp; you get results.</li>
            <li> you are already in bed, rub a tiny amount of this 100% Pure Cocoa Butter in your palms to warm it up and liquefy it.  </li>
            <li> The quality is exceptional compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> It smelled like pure chocolate!</li>
            <li> Product was just as advertised - pure, organic cocoa butter!  </li>
            <li> Got this bag of amazingness in the mail super fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1 pound and cut a small slice off to make the body butter (stored rest in refrigerator).&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter was delivered on time and was very nicely packed.</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product; I&#x27;ve used other Cocoa butter before and the quality wasn&#x27;t as fine as this.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter rubs right on, but in kind of a gloppy, chunky way, so I ended up getting too much on me, and having to wait a long time before getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Homemade lotion was super easy to make and they even provide a simple recipe.</li>
            <li> Much higher quality.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and lucious!  </li>
            <li> Price + quality &#x3D; repeat customer;)</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend you try Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> This is second order of from Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> Men who don&#x27;t like moisturize please try this product, for women usually are more aware and on top of products for face and body.</li>
            <li> The seller is not only approachable, but is kind enough to offer a free ebook of recipes and a sample of Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> also first one that began to melt on touch of finger  </li>
            <li> First time buyer of this cocoa butter</li>
            <li> This is now the second product I purchase from this seller (Better Shea Butter)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery , will order again!</li>
            <li> Smells very chocolately!</li>
            <li> The resealable bag is clearly marked organic, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I love using this with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter came plastic wrapped inside a resealable pouch and was exactly 16 ounces.</li>
            <li> I just had higher expectations for it&#x27;s usefulness and then didn&#x27;t follow through.</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter is harder, so it&#x27;s more of a pain to rub directly on to skin, but it&#x27;s also lighter, so it absorbs better.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again;)</li>
            <li> I love that the company sends different recipes for their product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the cocoa butter, but add some essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I used it for was making lotion.</li>
            <li> Very easy to melt, I&#x27;m using it for face and arms, because my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> Isabella is very knowledgable about the product she sells and is even kind enough to follow up and check on new product users like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely learning more recipes</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, high quality cocoa butter.</li>

            <li> Real cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>

            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> cocoa butter comes as a very thick/firm block.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this cocoa butter is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> And I can get dressed straight away—no waiting for the greasiness to absorb.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks #</li>
            <li> My husband made beard butter using this, coconut oil, and jojoba oil and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> And I am a very picky person.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes while not leaving you greasy like straight coconut oil will.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm, has a nice chocolatey aroma but not too over bearing (7 out of 10) .</li>
            <li> The finished product was rich, and luxurious and didn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals of store bought lotion.</li>
            <li> I added sweet orange essential oil</li>
            <li> I am expecting a new pound of coco butter today!</li>
            <li> My order came fast and was nice and hard.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and properly.</li>
            <li> The sellers seem very professional, and it&#x27;s Prime!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would definitely highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am in California and we have had temperatures in high 90s when this product arrived.</li>
            <li> all of which were high quality and packaged well for shipping.</li>
            <li> 100 percent pure and natural</li>
            <li> WOW!!  </li>
            <li> I have never used the microwave because a little patience and elbow grease is better to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty large piece so it should last her a while.</li>
            <li> Easy to melt and blend with other oils!</li>
            <li> The first body butter made received such a high review that I placed another order.  </li>
            <li> Very professional</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is my new &#x27;go-to&amp;#34; for small order purchases.</li>
            <li> Used this with raw shea butter (yellow) and coconut oil to make my own body butter.</li>
            <li> I was looking for more natural ways to help my dry old aged skin.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> It smells so natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed how much softer my skin is after only a week of use.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate and melts in your hands to apply directly on skin.</li>
            <li> Isabella has been so much help, not only with my purchases but also with recipes too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cocoa butter for lotions and soaps, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> The company also has a website where you can enter your Amazon order number and then download an e-book with 21 recipes for hair, face, and body products using all natural ingredients, in case you are looking for recipe ideas.</li>
            <li> It makes her skin so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Once it makes contact with the body you can just rub it around and it will begin to melt naturally.</li>
            <li> It does have the natural coco butter smell</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter in a few different recipes for body care products and really enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been adding a few shavings of this in all my recipes for some extra cocoalicious goodness that my body and nose loves! :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s versitile and easy to work with, but being the nature of cocoa butter that has not been deodorized, the chocolate aroma can only be toned down but never muted.</li>
            <li> My skin was still pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It smells like a deep dark chocolate, but only better.  </li>
            <li> I previously ordered their Shea Butter and can&#x27;t believe how quickly I&#x27;m going though it.  </li>
            <li> The block of butter is in a plastic bag as well, when mine arrived it was a bit warm (and a little melty) from shipping, but that was easily fixed with a few minutes in refrigeration.</li>
            <li> So now I have this huge chunk of organic cocoa butter and not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> an is very soothing especially when mixed with oils of your choice and</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter will moisturize your skin like no other.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that added bonus because no other product has done that for me.</li>
            <li> It is a solid bar, but can be quickly melted down to make a luxurious body butter.</li>
            <li> A little more spend than other raw brands but worth it.</li>
            <li> This company is professional, timely, and they take extra care in preparing the product.</li>
            <li> I added Lavender essential oil by Young Living.  </li>
            <li> Seller is quick to ship, very customer oriented and stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> but I am pretty sure it won&#x27;t be bad.</li>
            <li> is was my first time using raw cocoa butter, and after only 10 days, my stretch marks are noticibly lighter.</li>
            <li> And i like my cream so much though it is a little bit pricey</li>
            <li> You have to shave off some as its not initially soft enough to pinch like with the Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> It seem to look old and dried out</li>
            <li> It took a long time to melt this butter also.</li>
            <li> the cocoa and shea butters helped, but not completely.</li>
            <li> I broke out from something unknown and it left scaring.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really terrific is that you can mix the product with other products you already have as I did with my sun-screen.</li>
            <li> It also gives off an extreme amount of chocolate stink despite me double bagging it, which is making me nauseous in the morning.</li>
            <li> I think the reason this product is working so well on my skin is because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; cocoa butter and not mixed with other additives like in the stores.</li>
            <li> I used this with raw coconut oil and whipped up a natural body butter...</li>
            <li> Its not every day you find products that you can not live without.</li>
            <li> , the cocoa butter found in stores smells nothing like this stuff, this actually smells like dark chocolate, my skin loves it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> Mix 1 part to part organic coconut oil and this organic cocoa butter - melt down in a double boiler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that widely known brand of cocoa butter in the little, white plastic jar for years.</li>
            <li> I received the cocoa butter faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money over the years on fake miracles in a bottle scams when I should have gone this natural route.</li>
            <li> I have made a few different things with it.  </li>
            <li> I can get some pretty big painful zits that take a few days to come to a head, and then  a week or two to completely heal.  </li>
            <li> A little harder than expected but not a major issue since I&#x27;m melting it down anyway.</li>
            <li> A little goods a long way in maintaining hair and restoring hydration to the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was so incredibly dry this winter that if I tried to wear any of my sweaters I ended up getting hives from the irritation, and I was desperate to find something vegan, economical, and without a lot of plastic product packaging, that would solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I threw out in the garbage all other  brands of shea butter that I have purchased .  </li>
            <li> Even after using it with other things in the body butter and chapstick you can still smell its yummy aroma.</li>
            <li> Some other companies reviews from customers stated that they ordered cocoa butter that should have been organic but had no labeling when it arrived.</li>
            <li> is that when you sweat and it gets extremely hot outside the cocoa butter will start to smell really bad.</li>
            <li> I melted it down and made lotion sticks.  </li>
            <li> I previously purchased from someone else and there is NO comparison.</li>
            <li> My daughter and mother in law have already stolen half of my stash after I let them try it out.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake in a previous review, I wish to correct that mistake now.  </li>
            <li> I already made a body butter from this coco butter, she&#x27;s butter, a little coconut oil and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I started out using a little</li>
            <li> I bought it to shave some off a little at a time,</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I found was it is hard to cut.</li>
            <li> I used this on a few of those sort of zits and it literally went down in size within a day or two!  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment is I can only give them 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I had my other bar for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I used a kitchen knife to shave off a small piece at a time.</li>
            <li> One of the other shea butters had such an unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> Very heavy chocolate smell</li>
            <li> and it set up hard as rock</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard, almost to the point where I can not cut it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t hard to scent them either.</li>
            <li> at least for my skin it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling like some lotions are known to do.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult because it comes in blocks.</li>
            <li> I use these two butters as the base  to ally natural bath and body products.</li>
            <li> BUT its hard as hell!</li>
            <li> Second time I bought from this company and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve used brands that packaged their cocoa butter in a plastic tub, which makes it nearly impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find any reviews from men who do.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it...</li>
            <li> At least I wasn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> extremely dangerous</li>
            <li> The bottom of my shower is crazy slippery now.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. Smells good, melts easily over a steam bath, mix well with other oils. A little goods a long way in maintaining hair and restoring hydration to the skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It feels great but the chocolate smell overwhelms any essential oil scents I want to add to the lotion I&#x27;m making.  I mix it with Shea butter and gett a better result.</li>
            <li> Only&lt;br /&gt;Problem with this product is I didn&#x27;t have enough of it. Very heavy chocolate smell</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate and it spreads on so nicely. How can I complain about that. Very happy with this company and will buy my products from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, looking forward to making good use of this.</li>
            <li> Best ever I&#x27;ll defenelly buy it aging</li>
            <li> Shea butter is such an amazing commodity. I previously purchased from someone else and there is NO comparison. Much higher quality. It&#x27;s deliciously creamy and melts and absorbs quickly. It is literally a magic potion. I made body butter for Christmas gifts and scrubs. I have been using it and it is wonderful for your skin and hair. Excited to give as gifts! This company is just as exceptional as their products. They are responsive, enthusiastic, professional, and their price to value is awesome. My only disappointment is I can only give them 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have not used the Cocoa Butter just yet. However, I do Iove the smell. I also like the fact that the Seller sends various recipes for making body creams and butters. Excellent job and I will purchase another when I finish using this one. The block is a nice size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make lotion bars with for my feet ...it is sooooo rich in scent and texture !!! Very nice product !!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, high quality cocoa butter. Smells AH-MAZING and easy to work with.  A little more spend than other raw brands but worth it. I also purchased the shea bottler and love it as well. I use these two butters as the base  to ally natural bath and body products. Love it...i have been using it right  off the block...can&#x27;t keep out of em:)</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter in a few different recipes for body care products and really enjoyed the results. It has a lovely smell and wonderful texture and is all around a very nice cocoa butter. I would definitely recommend this product and plan to use it again.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and lucious!  Perfect for dry, desert weather.  Price + quality &#x3D; repeat customer;)</li>
            <li> I bought the Shea Butter from this company and was very satisfied with the purchase. So I decided to buy the Cocoa Butter from them as well. And I am thrilled that I did. The quality is exceptional compared to other brands. The smell is great, but can be strong for those who don&#x27;t like the sweet chocolate smell, you can just mix it with some essential oils. I didn&#x27;t because I love the cocoa smell!!! Best products hands down!!! Definitely recommend you try Better Shea Butter. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! At least I wasn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> This company is great! They are truly dedicated to making sure the customer gets the best possible quality product.  The cocoa butter and shea butter are excellent quality and blend easily with other butters and essential oils. Good quality, great customer service and fast shipping, I won&#x27;t buy from anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought this cocoa butter and really its amazing, I love their packaging it can protect the butter and it is useful, Try it you will love it</li>
            <li> Literally the best cocoa butter I&#x27;ve ever used. Better Shea Butter brand continues to amaze me and I will continue to purchase their products on a regular basis! DOES NOT DISSAPOINT!!!</li>
            <li> First time buying cocoa butter but thought this had a nice smell.  This cocoa butter melted nicely for my deodorant bars.</li>

            <li> I love this product! I already made a body butter from this coco butter, she&#x27;s butter, a little coconut oil and jojoba oil. AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great Cocoa Butter.  Already used it, some Shea butter, beeswax and coconut oil to make some lotion bars.  Came out awesome.  Will use this company again.</li>
            <li> This organic cocoa butter is amazing. I used it to make a body butter and it smells like rich chocolate. I added sweet orange essential oil and it was heavenly and perfect in every way. The body butter I made is a huge hit and feels incredible. It is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I received the order in the  time frame given, and it smells soooooo good. I have a batch of soap already curing .I didn&#x27;t use any essential oils to scent this or coloring&#x27;s, as I will call it white chocolate bars.</li>
            <li> Love it and it&#x27;s amazing smell!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality,  wonderful smell and quick shipping.</li>

            <li> smells wonderful !!  BUT its hard as hell! i melted it with shea butter and it set up hard as rock</li>
            <li> I love this.  I&#x27;ve been making a few of the recipes and all have come out wonderfully!  I also purchased the shea butter and have had the same great experience with using it in recipes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is second order of from Better Shea Butter. The first body butter made received such a high review that I placed another order.  The shipping was fast and the customer service is superb! Very professional and I look forward to ordering more products. I also received a free recipe! Thanks Isabella:)</li>
            <li> AWESOME. Great aroma, makes you want to eat it. Easy to use. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Exactly what I was hoping for!</li>

            <li> Love it!! Smells like pure dark chocolate and it is so smooth!!</li>
            <li> Just love it. Mixing with Shea butter for face. Real cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> Their cocoa butter and shea butter are outstanding quality. The cocoa butter smells so yummy, just like it should.</li>
            <li> Smells great and easy to work with!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! When you first open the package you are hit with its beautiful and natural chocolate smell! I use this to make body butter at home and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter. Smells good and works well in DIY recipes. I also thought it was great that the seller followed up on my satisfaction. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> good price, fast, high quality but ive learned not to expect anything less from this company :P</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. Mostly I was amazed by the smell when I opened the bag! It smelled like pure chocolate! I&#x27;m in love with it. I can&#x27;t wait to start making my homemade beauty products with it!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this company. Love their products!!</li>
            <li> Men who don&#x27;t like moisturize please try this product, for women usually are more aware and on top of products for face and body. It&#x27;s difficult to find any reviews from men who do. This product is amazing. It&#x27;s the best Cocoa Butter I&#x27;ve ever used to put it mildly. I will never purchase another jar of Palmers. My skin was already perfection (lol), but now its beyond that. This product isn&#x27;t greasy, nor does it feel weighted on the skin. What&#x27;s really terrific is that you can mix the product with other products you already have as I did with my sun-screen. Perfection! The packing is understated and what&#x27;s inside is heaven. The seller is not only approachable, but is kind enough to offer a free ebook of recipes and a sample of Shea Butter. You can&#x27;t loose. You&#x27;ll end up with a great product and skin. Try it. Try this seller for a terrific product, experience and exchange. I am still raving about it all to my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Good products, works as described</li>
            <li> I can not believe the quality of this Organic Cocoa Butter By Better Shea Butter. The moment I opened the package the heavenly scent just filled the air around me. I have Better Shea Butter&#x27;s Ivory Organic Unrefined Shea Butter and Love it (read my glowing review for that) so I knew this Cocoa Butter was going to be good also, Oh My Goodness, it goes on like silk and makes my skin feel healthy again. Try Better Shea Butter&#x27;s products and you&#x27;ll buy no other brands ....trust me !!!</li>
            <li> Amazing cocoa butter &amp; great recipes</li>
            <li> I love this company! I have bought their shea butter many times, but this was my first purchase of cocoa butter. oh. my. goodness! i cant believe how amazing this smells! seriously. i stuck as much of my face into the envelope/bag shipper as I could and just inhaled all of the amazing choco goodness! i cant wait to add this to my body balms! super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great and smells terrific.  Keep sending those recipes.</li>
            <li> have been using cocoa butter for abt 15 years or so  -this is the first product that me hit with the wonderful aroma before package open  and also first one that began to melt on touch of finger  --smooth and very nice&lt;br /&gt;Only wish was in wafers -But  wouldnt be able to buy in summer if it was as would melt together anyway&lt;br /&gt;  great stuff</li>
            <li> Awesome.  I used this and the shea butter for making hair and body products at home.  Both products are great quality.  Also, the owner sent me an awesome recipe for making cocoa butter lotion bars.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and easy to incorporate into my face lotion recipie</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Also liked that the owner sent me an email making sure I recieved and if I had any questions.</li>
            <li> Smells delicous, I love that the company sends me some recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> When I got this I opened up the package and was blown away by the smell, the cocoa butter found in stores smells nothing like this stuff, this actually smells like dark chocolate, my skin loves it and I&#x27;m extremely sensitive. Wonderful product, love the company, I bought other things from them and am very happy with them too, cant go wrong with this one if you enjoy a high quality natural emollient.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the brick as it makes it easy to cut and weigh. Smells perfect and melts on contact with skin.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love!  Best I have used!!</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to be able to treat myself to this amazing cocoa butter....all I can say is, if your a fan off Better Shea Butter, then you will also fall in love with this rich and smooth to the touch Cocoa Butter. OMG! From the time opened my package, I can smell the divine scent. This cocoa butter will moisturize your skin like no other. Organic and Pure..Better Shea Butter you have done it again! Your product is the best..and your customer service is #1.&lt;br /&gt;I personally want to thank you for sharing your amazing products with customers like myself..Its not every day you find products that you can not live without. My skin glows after using both your Pure and Organic Shea Butter, and now the Cocoa Butter...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Tonette. J&lt;br /&gt;A  Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that widely known brand of cocoa butter in the little, white plastic jar for years. After experiencing Better Shea Butter&#x27;s sweet smelling Organic Cocoa Butter for just one week, I&#x27;ll never look back. This product is simply light years ahead in quality. Happy I found it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Once you try this Palmers is out the window. Leaves skins silky and retaining moisture all day, plus since it is organic, it has the pure chocolate smell. Outstanding. Now and forever will be a loyal customer 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Good quality cocoa butter. I made a whipped body butter with it and it turned out great.</li>
            <li> Another excellent product from Better Shea Butter! This Cocoa Butter comes in 2 sealed bags and when you open it up it smells amazing, just like a chocolate bar! It is a solid bar, but can be quickly melted down to make a luxurious body butter. I made a simple body butter for my 2 yr old daughter for after her baths and she just smells so delicious, and leaves her skin silky smooth! Great product with fast delivery. Isabella the owner is efficient and is there for any customer service questions you may have. I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Got this bag of amazingness in the mail super fast. It smells delightful and works great. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eva</li>
            <li> Best quality Cocoa Butter I have ever used! It smells like pure heaven (my husband thought it was food when it arrived). It makes my skin smooth and soft and it feels very natural. Love!</li>
            <li> It seem to look old and dried out</li>
            <li> Beautiful product!! Just as advertised. Creamy, smooth and melts right into skin</li>
            <li> Amazing, amazing, yummy stuff.  Well, yummy as in lovely to use.  This works great as an addition to a homemade lotion with coconut oil or another base oil.  Here&#x27;s an awesome way to keep your summertime feet luscious and soft:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you are already in bed, rub a tiny amount of this 100% Pure Cocoa Butter in your palms to warm it up and liquefy it.  Then rub it all over your clean feet.  When you are done, rub any remainder into your hands and forearms.  Lie down and bask in the incredible smell of chocolate, knowing that your feet are all lubed up and there is no way you are getting out of bed to satisfy the craving for chocolate you now have.  Win-win?  Yes, I think so. :)</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the quality of this shea butter. I used it to make a decadent body butter - and a skin healing balm. Better Shea butter has such a nice woodsy and nutty smell and a silky smooth feel. Both the body butter and healing balm came out wonderful and soothing to the skin.  I don&#x27;t like to sound negative, but After using  Shea butter from Better Shea Butter- I threw out in the garbage all other  brands of shea butter that I have purchased .  One of the other shea butters had such an unpleasant smell it actually  gave me a headache !  Thank you Better Shea Butter - I love your products and your customer service.  I cant wait to look at the Better Shea butter E book to look at more recipes.</li>
            <li> I love that this cocoa butter is unrefined and organic, and the quality seems excellent. The packaging is great too--I&#x27;ve used cocoa butters in a jar and the block method makes it MUCH easier to work with. The sellers seem very professional, and it&#x27;s Prime! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> This Cocoa Butter is wonderful! It is very fresh and very high quality. My skin drinks it up, and it smells delicious! It works well for lip balm, body butter, etc. (I found some great recipes on Pinterest). It shipped quickly, and arrived in a double zip-lock packaging which kept it fresh, and made it very easy to use. I would definitely highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for making my own stretch mark cream and my baby&#x27;s skin care products. i like the smell of it. It smells so natural. And i like my cream so much though it is a little bit pricey but it worths!</li>
            <li> I just love the all natural cocoa butter!  Totally awesome for the skin creams I am making!  Comes neatly packaged.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with smel of chocolate.  Packaging is neat, delivery was very quick. Very easy to melt, I&#x27;m using it for face and arms, because my skin is very dry. I like results, my skin is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;I like the seller, I would use them again.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with this product! I will definitely be a returning customer. The product arrived promptly and the quality and fragrance superb! I have recommended this very product and company to a handful of friends and family. My daughter and mother in law have already stolen half of my stash after I let them try it out.</li>
            <li> Smells SOOO good! Used this with raw shea butter (yellow) and coconut oil to make my own body butter. Mixed together on stove so it all blended as an oil and stored in mason jar!</li>
            <li> Just excellent.  Used in a body butter I made and it is great.  It does have a strong smell that I didn&#x27;t love at first but the product is just so great.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake in a previous review, I wish to correct that mistake now.  First, I love the Organic Cocoa Butter from Better Shea Butter.  Next I received the ebook in a timely manner.  It was in my email.  I saw the confirmation of email, email but I did not see when the ebook had arrived in my email in box.  For this, today (12/16/14) I gave Better Shea Butter three stars when they deserved five stars.  The recipes in the eBook look good.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.  I will most defiantly purchase from this company again.  Better Shea Butter please forgive me.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly and the quality is amazing. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make their own lotions or home made items!</li>
            <li> This is great cocoa butter. I&#x27;ve used several different brands and this one is easy to work with, stays fresh and smells great!! I use it in lotions both cream and solid and this is the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  Nothing smells better than this cocoa butter!! It smells like a deep dark chocolate, but only better.  I can&#x27;t get enough off this stuff, and this is the best quality!  I started making my own deodorants, lotion and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is just perfect!  It is smooth and silky, and has a delicious chocolate fragrance that matches the most expensive cocoa butters on the market.  Buy this product; use it alone, with The Better Shea Butter in a body lotion bar, or in your favorite homemade preparations.  You are sure to be happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!! Very pleased with this cocoa butter and it smells great! The cocoa butter arrived in the pictured packaging and in perfect condition. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth! This cocoa butter blends beautifully with other ingredients! Smells wonderful, I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product, and the service was amazing as well. I can&#x27;t wait to use the recipe they sent!</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this cocoa butter but couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I used this to make a anti stretch mark cream for my wife and so far so good. Slowly but surely learning more recipes This is now the second product I purchase from this seller (Better Shea Butter) and I&#x27;m sold. I won&#x27;t be looking around anymore because their products are clearly very high quality and the customer service I received from the owner was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Smells divine!  I added some of this Better Cocoa Butter to my homemade Better Shea Butter recipe.  This is a top quality product; I&#x27;ve used other Cocoa butter before and the quality wasn&#x27;t as fine as this.  100 percent pure and natural the way mother nature intended :)  I&#x27;ve just been adding a few shavings of this in all my recipes for some extra cocoalicious goodness that my body and nose loves! :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer..but the smell wasnt really great...</li>
            <li> THANK YOU ! INCREDIBLE FOR REAL !!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells amazing and feels great! I melted and whipped it up with their shea butter and coconut oil. I gave it as gifts to all my friends and we love!!!! Nice, smooth and natural!!! My skin glows!</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying cocoa butter and was very happy with my purchase. I made body butter and chapstick, they both turned out awesome!! This stuff alone seriously smells so amazing!!!! It&#x27;s smells of pure delicious cocoa. Even after using it with other things in the body butter and chapstick you can still smell its yummy aroma. I&#x27;ve noticed how much softer my skin is after only a week of use. I am pretty impressed with its quality. Will definitely be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced. Great quality. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife and she loved it. Smells like chocolate and melts in your hands to apply directly on skin. It&#x27;s a pretty large piece so it should last her a while. Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> This butter is ok . It has a weird smell to it...its chocolate but with a hint of something else. It took a long time to melt this butter also. I used it in my body butter and it smells good, but added it with other butters. I might order it again, but would find a better choice. Also the color is real yellow with white spots on the outside like it crystallized. It is just an OKAY butter.</li>
            <li> Smelled great. A little harder than expected but not a major issue since I&#x27;m melting it down anyway. Used it to make lip balms and lotion bars. Will buy from this vendor again if I ever need anymore!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and the customer service is good too.  I previously ordered their Shea Butter and can&#x27;t believe how quickly I&#x27;m going though it.  I started out using a little but as the season has changed and my skin has gotten drier I had to use more. Plus I started putting it on my hair and face.&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter comes as a very thick/firm block.  You have to shave off some as its not initially soft enough to pinch like with the Shea butter.  Maybe that depends on how you store it. I keep mine in my pantry.  The butter melts in the hands when you rub them together and it smells so delicious.  I will be reordering both products.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery , will order again!</li>
            <li> Smells very chocolately! The resealable bag is clearly marked organic, which is important to me. Some other companies reviews from customers stated that they ordered cocoa butter that should have been organic but had no labeling when it arrived. This smelled great and I used it to make lotion, salve and body butter last night and it melted nicely and made a nice end product. Can&#x27;t wait to try my products and will definitely order from this company again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.. I used it for lotion bars and my family and friends can&#x27;t get enough..</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT QUALITY! No impurities detected! I used it make it into a body butter (along with coconut oil &amp; sweet almond oil). It is SOOOOO Silky and the maximum part consists of cocoa butter. I ordered 1 pound and cut a small slice off to make the body butter (stored rest in refrigerator).&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter was delivered on time and was very nicely packed. No leaks. I am in California and we have had temperatures in high 90s when this product arrived. But it was solid as a brick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a wonderful product. Smells like heavenly chocolate. Feels like silk on skin. It hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores yet. I haven&#x27;t tasted it yet but I am pretty sure it won&#x27;t be bad. 😆</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter came packaged well and in good shape. It comes in a block about the shape of a brick and smells great. The only negative thing I found was it is hard to cut.</li>
            <li> I love using this with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> I really loved this product. I purchased it to make my own lotion to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and found that it really made the lotion feel smooth and smell amazing. It comes in a larger sized block and I used a spoon to scrape off the amount I needed. I recommend this for sure!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous cocoa butter to work with, smells incredible, melts so smoothly. Very happy with the product AND company.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as shown.&lt;br /&gt;It is a lovely cocoa butter.The aroma when opened was wonderful,just stood there and sniffed for a minute,mmmmmm&lt;br /&gt;I made a body butter using this cocoa butter,shea butter and coconut oil.It is great.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is my new &#x27;go-to&amp;#34; for small order purchases. This cocoa butter came plastic wrapped inside a resealable pouch and was exactly 16 ounces. It&#x27;s firm, has a nice chocolatey aroma but not too over bearing (7 out of 10) . It&#x27;s versitile and easy to work with, but being the nature of cocoa butter that has not been deodorized, the chocolate aroma can only be toned down but never muted. Check it out!</li>
            <li> Great product. First time I am doing hand lotion and came out perfect.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for about a week and I love it! I melt it and put it on every night and I can already see/feel a difference in my skin, not to mention the wonderful smell. If you are looking for authentic cocoa butter, this is your product.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and shea butter and I could not be happier. Homemade lotion was super easy to make and they even provide a simple recipe. The finished product was rich, and luxurious and didn&#x27;t have all the extra chemicals of store bought lotion. It is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The cocoa butter came in a ripped up outer bag and the block was inside a sandwich bag that was not zipped up. It is extremely hard, almost to the point where I can not cut it. It also gives off an extreme amount of chocolate stink despite me double bagging it, which is making me nauseous in the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was wanting to make my own lotion and I absolutely love it,  it blends well an is very soothing especially when mixed with oils of your choice and at least for my skin it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling like some lotions are known to do. I will definitely be Making this purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter. It has a wonderful aroma and blends very well with my oils and other products.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter was as described. Melts wonderfully and smells incredible. Will purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter was shipped quickly in the resealable brown bag as seen in the picture. The block of butter is in a plastic bag as well, when mine arrived it was a bit warm (and a little melty) from shipping, but that was easily fixed with a few minutes in refrigeration. The butter has a sweet cocoa smell and melts quickly at body temperature. I will be repurchasing from Better Shea Butter when I need more. Their customer service has been excellent and their products have been exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great consistency. Nice odor</li>
            <li> This does smell like chocolate. I bought it to shave some off a little at a time, microwave it,  and use it for my growing pregnant belly. I did it a few times then just found the palmers spray butters from the store a much easier way to do this before bed and after a shower. So now I have this huge chunk of organic cocoa butter and not sure what to do with it. Haha good product I just had higher expectations for it&#x27;s usefulness and then didn&#x27;t follow through.</li>
            <li> Melts smooth, nice smell, absorbs without feeling greasy. Enjoying the recipes that follow in the emails, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it and I love the recipes they sent.  GREAT, GREAT product with wonderful customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the cocoa butter I purchased. It arrived swiftly, good value and will purchase from them again. Isabella has been so much help, not only with my purchases but also with recipes too! I love her and the products! &amp;#60;3 Thank you so much Isabella!! Tina</li>
            <li> I am VERY impressed with this product.  It is silky smooth and smells so great.  It&#x27;s amazing all the things that you can do with it; I am especially excited to make homemade body butters/creams.  The customer service has also been very impressive.  I bought the Cocoa Butter and the Shea Butter.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I am incredibly picky about cocoa butter and every other body butter that I purchase to make my homemade products. Smells  of delicious chocolate, melts easily and evenly, spreads nicely in my body whip and doesn&#x27;t leave me a greasy mess! I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put in lotion bars I made for my mother. It was a perfect addition to the recipe!</li>
            <li> This smells delicious and shipped right away.  The packaging ensured it&#x27;s safe arrival.  It looks just like the photo.  I melted it down and made lotion sticks.  I&#x27;m very pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> Heaven sent and smell! I love this cocoa butter. I use it mostly on my face and my body. I would recommend it. It came package nice.</li>
            <li> I like the product I just don&#x27;t like the packaging. Wish it came in a container instead of a bag.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter worked out great as one of the ingredients in the body butters I made.  It melted perfectly without any residue.  I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and safely and smells amazing! It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted and exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> this cocoa butter is very moisturizing I love it smells very good</li>
            <li> I love this cocoa butter! It has a nice cocoa scent without being artificial. I use this for everything from whipped body butters to lip balm and it has never caused a reaction. Everyone loves my products containing this cocoa butter and I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells amazing. I&#x27;ve bought several products from the company &amp;#34;Better Shea Butter&amp;#34; all of which were high quality and packaged well for shipping. I use them in homemade lotions, soap, sunscreens etc. and will continue to purchase from this company.</li>
            <li> My skin was so incredibly dry this winter that if I tried to wear any of my sweaters I ended up getting hives from the irritation, and I was desperate to find something vegan, economical, and without a lot of plastic product packaging, that would solve the problem. I ordered this and the shea butter to use as straight-up body moisturizers. The cocoa butter is harder, so it&#x27;s more of a pain to rub directly on to skin, but it&#x27;s also lighter, so it absorbs better. And it smells good! The shea butter rubs right on, but in kind of a gloppy, chunky way, so I ended up getting too much on me, and having to wait a long time before getting dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the cocoa and shea butters helped, but not completely. My skin was still pretty dry. I did have much better results when I used them in DIY lotion recipes that I whipped up with an electric mixer. That&#x27;s probably the way to go. And you do get some cool recipes from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, honestly, my morning schedule doesn&#x27;t really have a slot for a separate body-moisturizing routine. Instead, a few weeks ago I started putting straight olive oil on an exfoliating poof and rubbing that in while still in the shower. Absolute success! My dry-skin problems are solved. And I can get dressed straight away—no waiting for the greasiness to absorb. I will say, however, that it&#x27;s *extremely dangerous*! The bottom of my shower is crazy slippery now. Try this at your peril. And/or invest in a textured shower mat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: I think both the butters are really great. They just weren&#x27;t perfect for what I needed. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using them in recipes for hand and foot creams, though.</li>
            <li> You get a huge amount and smells wonderful! Great deal!</li>
            <li> Easy to melt and blend with other oils! It smells wonderful!! Very moisturizing and non greasy!! Will purchase again;)</li>
            <li> Great Cocoa Butter! I have been making lip balm, lotion bars and plan to make more. They have turned out great. I love the smell of the Cocoa Butter it great quality. I will order it again! I love that the company sends different recipes for their product. Now I have even more projects I want to to try. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> If i need Cocoa Butter again I would reorder this. It is a big solid bar and smelled like cocoa butter should. I used it for skin care products and it is lovely. It mixed well with bees wax and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love this! Used for lotion bars. Very moisturizing and smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells amazing.  I like that it&#x27;s packaged in a block, so it&#x27;s easy to shred for a recipe.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used brands that packaged their cocoa butter in a plastic tub, which makes it nearly impossible to use.  I&#x27;ve used this cocoa butter for lotions and soaps, and it leaves my skin incredibly soft.  I love this company as well.  The owner is responsive, and she communicates free recipes and deals often.</li>
            <li> I was buying the Shea Butter from this company and as a last minute splurge I purchased the Cocoa Butter too. The best decision. The smell is amazing and I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;ll be buying this again and would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get my package. It arrived on time and just as pictured. As soon as I am about to run out I will be ordering it again. Thanks again for a great product and service.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great Cocoa Butter using it in my homemade cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Love. Your cocoa butter. So easy to use and smells delicious.  I will be using your Shea butter also</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.  Would recommend to anyone wanting to make their own skin care products.  The eBook is full of great recipes.  I have tried several of them.  They are easy to follow and work great.  Great price &amp; service, too.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter is so amazing! The quality is fantastic! This will be the only cocoa butter that I will ever use. I love it!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when opening this package was the heavenly smell! This cocoa butter works great for DIY projects (I used it to make lotion and deodorant) because it melts and mixes wonderfully, but it can also be used as is for a quick &amp;#34;lotion bar&amp;#34; application. I will definitely purchase this product in the future, as well as recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome cocoa butter, smells wonderful and I was very pleased with good customer service and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I love how it came in two sealed bags because it&#x27;s easier to get the amount you need without digging into a jar. The smell is amazing and it&#x27;s done wonders keeping my newborn, toddler, and my skin soft and smooth! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for pure cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> Very high quality cocoa butter - and the smell is heavenly!  Will be back soon to buy more :-)</li>
            <li> I was looking for more natural ways to help my dry old aged skin.  Nothing on the market seemed to work.  Saw so many recipes for making your own body butter.  So happy with the results, and it&#x27;s so easy to make your own whipped cream.  I love the smell of the cocoa butter, but add some essential oils.  I have some I put on at night, with lavender in it, in the morning I use it with lemon oil to give me a quick shot of energy along with feeling soft.  My 60 plus body just loves me for this!</li>
            <li> I bought both this cocoa butter and the shea butter from this company, and I am pleased with both products. The cocoa butter is clean and fragrant, suitable to use directly on the skin or for my homemade skin care product recipes. The company also has a website where you can enter your Amazon order number and then download an e-book with 21 recipes for hair, face, and body products using all natural ingredients, in case you are looking for recipe ideas.</li>
            <li> I broke out from something unknown and it left scaring. This was great to help heal my skin. I do need to find a better way of using it. It was a little difficult because it comes in blocks. Otherwise, it does it job as it should!</li>
            <li> I love this Cocoa Butter.  I heat it up and my skin is radiant because of it.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this to try. It smells absolutely wonderful. It feels amazing on your skin. I used it to make lotion bars and they turned out beautiful. Leaves my skin silky, yet not greasy.. Seller is quick to ship, very customer oriented and stands behind their product. I would def. recommend this Seller.</li>
            <li> My order came fast and was nice and hard. I use coco butter in my bath melts and moisturizing bars. Wasn&#x27;t hard to scent them either. As of now this is who I will be ordering my butters from.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but i just had to for this cocoa butter. It was shipped quickly and properly. It smells AMAZING!!! I use it for my DIY organic creams for my daughter who has eczema. It makes her skin so soft and supple. Absorbs quickly and she smells great! Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> a wonderful addition to my homemade soaps, I also cut a piece of cocoa butter right  off the block for moisturizing, makes your skin feel wonderful, absorbs quickly, without making you feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome, smells heavenly</li>
            <li> Love this cocoa butter great smell. Fast shipping. Great company !!!!!</li>
            <li> I received the cocoa butter faster than expected. It is a beautiful solid bar and smells wonderful before you even have a chance to open the bag. I used a kitchen knife to shave off a small piece at a time. It turns your bath into relaxation bliss and moisturizers your skin like nothing else. I also use it at night for feet and elbows and it works like magic!</li>
            <li> Came very fast and smells wonderful!  Can&#x27;t wait to start using!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product before and I really enjoyed it. I am expecting a new pound of coco butter today! :) I had my other bar for at least 6 months. This company is professional, timely, and they take extra care in preparing the product. The cocoa butter is very pure &amp; you get results. You can&#x27;t beat the price either. The key to using it is body heat. Once it makes contact with the body you can just rub it around and it will begin to melt naturally. I have never used the microwave because a little patience and elbow grease is better to me. It does have the natural coco butter smell &amp; so I use it at night before I go to bed. I have also noticed that my stretch marks have begun to lighten and shrink a lot. I didn&#x27;t expect that added bonus because no other product has done that for me. I have used everything from the high-end creams to the basic Palmers without ever seeing any results. I wasted so much money over the years on fake miracles in a bottle scams when I should have gone this natural route. I think the reason this product is working so well on my skin is because it&#x27;s &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; cocoa butter and not mixed with other additives like in the stores. Overall, it appears to quench the skin and improve that dented look that women get after having kids. Please DO NOT change the formula or add anything to the product like another poster suggested because it will change how it works and right now it is working GREAT! Thanks #Please don&#x27;t add any essential oils because the pure cocoa butter is more effective on the skin in its pure state. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Nothing feel like this</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality! Heavenly scent! A+++</li>
            <li> Amazing quality and love the minimal packaging!</li>
            <li> great quality products and superb customer service... highly recommend...</li>
            <li> Great product and even better owner! Isabella is very knowledgable about the product she sells and is even kind enough to follow up and check on new product users like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is was my first time using raw cocoa butter, and after only 10 days, my stretch marks are noticibly lighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I have made a few different things with it.  My husband made beard butter using this, coconut oil, and jojoba oil and it worked very well.  We made a lotion with just this and coconut oil, which is also great for massage oil.  And the best thing I made with it is acne cream.  I have never had anything work better for acne!!  All the acne creams, home remedies, essential oils don&#x27;t come close to how great this works.  I added Lavender essential oil by Young Living.  I can get some pretty big painful zits that take a few days to come to a head, and then  a week or two to completely heal.  I used this on a few of those sort of zits and it literally went down in size within a day or two!  I&#x27;m not saying it will work for everyone, because everyone is different.  And I have tried just about EVERYTHING!  Even trying Manuka Honey (which has a lot of great reviews for clearing acne) didn&#x27;t work so well.  I don&#x27;t know what it is about Shea Butter and Lavender that does it, but this has been and will be my go to acne cream!</li>
            <li> Second time I bought from this company and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. Feels amazing in your skin without leaving a film of &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;. I love making DIY body lotions so this product is perfect! And I am a very picky person.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter. She just started to make natural skin care products for herself and she loved using this product</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells great. I bought this to make my own cocoa butter body butter. Although it smells great and went on smooth the issue I had is that when you sweat and it gets extremely hot outside the cocoa butter will start to smell really bad. So if you work outside then stick with regular butter.</li>
            <li> I love everything about it! It smells amazing and it melts down perfectly for DIY projects. The first thing I used it for was making lotion. It was packaged just as its shown in the picture and it came in a timely manner which was great. I think it&#x27;s a great product and I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a quality cocoa butter for their DIY needs.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter smells delicious and is great to make whipped oils! Mix 1 part to part organic coconut oil and this organic cocoa butter - melt down in a double boiler. Let cool to room temp. Whip for 10 minutes in a kitchen aid. Moisturizes while not leaving you greasy like straight coconut oil will. Definitely will purchase again when I need to restock!</li>
            <li> Product was just as advertised - pure, organic cocoa butter!  Great product.  Doctor recommended this for to treat our son&#x27;s scar from a recent fall.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I quality is amazing. Will purchase again and tell all my oily friends</li>
            <li> Love this Cocoa butter!!! It has an amazing chocolate smell it makes me want to eat it. My skin is loving it. I will not use anything else but Cocoa butter and Shea butter for my skin. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days and my skin feels great. Very happy with product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the Better Shea Butter products!! The Cocoa butter is probably my favorite.. smells so good.. its my first time making my own body butter and I am loving it..</li>
            <li> Amazing product, made some wonderful body butters. Smells really good.</li>
