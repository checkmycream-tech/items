            <li>I&#x27;m sure the polish will be fab</li>
            <li>so it has pretty good coverage too.</li>
            <li>Im new to doing my own nails and havent had a problem yet!</li>
            <li>Love the rich color and the application.</li>
            <li>It easily lasts 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>My favorites so far are Grand Jewels, June Bride, Izzy Wizzy &amp; Good Gossip.</li>
            <li>Perfect black color, goes on smooth, looks great for black tips with some glitter or for a design, looks good</li>
            <li>Black is always a great color!!</li>
            <li>and it worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I arrived quickly and safely to KS thru my mailbox.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Its a perfect black!</li>
            <li>I actually traded my polish for my manicure &amp; the bottle was used by many others at my salon!!</li>
            <li>I received it 10 days after the original purchase...</li>
            <li>color is rich &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>The gel has a crisp, almost plastic appearance, making for a clean &amp; elegant application.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>The color just rubs right off!</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying some more of this.</li>
            <li>Great smooth black color.</li>
            <li>who doesnt love a good black polish?</li>
            <li>It is a nice black that coats nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, perfectly black polish.  </li>
            <li>thank you very much for the product, remains haunted, I loved it, thanks for the attention and the speed with which they work, 100% recommended, greetings and thanks</li>
            <li>This is color works very well and looks pretty good because it is very shiney.</li>
            <li>Delivery super quick.</li>
            <li>so you have to apply alittle or it will get to your cuticle quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so very happy with the Gelish black shadow gel, it applies very smooth and easy and with two coats you have a true black nail</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of gel polishes, but so far this one works great!</li>
            <li>I also use various glitters on top to enhance which makes it my favorite gelish product right now.</li>
            <li>This has a very nice black color.</li>
            <li>Received within a few days and is great price for the size.</li>
            <li>You need 3 thin coats to get good coverage but it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Two coats was enough for a nice finish.</li>
            <li>A beautiful black, but much more sheer than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Really needs 3 coats for full opaqueness, unless you are using a sparkle.</li>
            <li>Harmony Gelish Black Shadow: arrived on time, good quality</li>
            <li>but this is very runny, very see through, and it shrinks under the light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, especially with the ultra shiny UV top coat, the only thing that would make it better is if it had a shimmer or glittery look.</li>
            <li>I love the Gelish brand and have several colors.</li>
            <li>is so much pretty and chic</li>
            <li>and I love gelish, but this shade goes on very thin and seems more runny then most gelish polish.</li>
            <li>shiny and black and smooth, what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>To achieve a full black I need five coats or more, which I just don&#x27;t have the patience for.</li>
            <li>Perfect black as black.</li>
            <li>Just a nice pure black.</li>
            <li>Black shadow looks great by itself- very deep and shiny.</li>
            <li>This polish has withstood a SERIOUS beating and it still looks as gorgeous as it did the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A very nice solid black soak off gel.</li>
            <li>Very fancy.</li>
            <li>Goes on very evenly and holds up for weeks.</li>
            <li>The color of this gel polish is very streaky.</li>
            <li>It is really runny &amp; watery</li>
            <li>so much-</li>
            <li>But I wanted to rate the price NOW as they are more affordable than the other Amazon vendors I&#x27;ve been obtaining Gelish from and wanted to remind myself to return to AFL again.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this deep dark solid black, it is so shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>I love you Gelish, but this shade is not worth it.</li>
            <li>i want to use all my new colors!</li>
            <li>and this is the perfect one I put three to four thin coasts and cure extra 2 mins since its a dark color and add one coat of twinkle and it looks fabulous its a must..</li>
            <li>If you want/need/like a black polish I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just know this one may take longer than others you may have and require more post application clean-up / touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I hesitated because of the name, because I thought it might be sheer, or brownish black, but it is the perfect black.</li>
            <li>I love black nail polish.</li>
            <li>However, this black is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a classic look rather than gothic as some see it.  </li>
            <li>...actually HAVE NOT received the polish yet - it should be here in a couple days (like 4 total so pretty fast!).  </li>
            <li>Mine goes on smoothly, no problems at all,  and it&#x27;s a beautiful classic black.</li>
            <li>This colour is dark black with just two coats, great shine too.</li>
            <li>It has a thicker texture than normal, but it&#x27;s alright, I&#x27;m not too picky.</li>
            <li>but they marked it as shipped a full two days before it ever left their facility.</li>
            <li>A deep, dark, true black, that was completely opaque in two coats (I did three for good measure, because I like the strength of multiple coats, but you could most definitely get away with two).</li>
            <li>I love black nail polish!  </li>
            <li>This I&#x27;s a nice black ONLY I&#x27;f applied 3 times.</li>
            <li>I love this Black Shadow color and love this product, it stays on for at least 2 weeks even with all the cleaning i do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of watery when u apply it so it leaves uneven streaks so the 3rd coat evens it out.</li>
            <li>I love the gelish products and I know that generally they are not true to color...</li>
            <li>reviewers here seem to have gotten panicky over the way it looks with only one the first coat.</li>
            <li>I also have shaken the bottle for more than 20 minutes to try to fully saturate the pigments, however this was all done in vain as the color is still a very streaky watered down grey.</li>
            <li>but it is a sexy basic black color.</li>
            <li>It has cut my spending and time down significantly compared to going to my nail salon.  </li>
            <li>This black is PLENTY black but is a bit more interesting shade of black than a \\&quot;patent leather\\</li>
            <li>Well, this one was a bit old</li>
            <li>I really like dark polishes with black being my favorite.</li>
            <li>As previous reviewers said the shine is without question but you will need at least three coats or more to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>Basic black gel polish, and it dried super fast with my LED light nail dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great traditional solid black, so if you are looking for that &#x27;Racheal Zoe&#x27; black, this one is perfection.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s the right color that I need, cure within time that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>Takes about three coats to be a true black.</li>
            <li>No hidden blue or other color somewhere within or when it hits the light.</li>
            <li>(I live in the third world much of the year where manicurists are about as well trained as your next door neighbor.</li>
            <li>Normally when you open a new polish you assume it&#x27;s going to smell a certain way, and that the texture will be smooth and not too thin.</li>
            <li>Just not black.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting this..looks black in regular light...</li>
            <li>Normally Gelish makes a very solid formula</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I expected it would be/ wanted.</li>
            <li>I love this black is covers so well unlike the other brands that are streaky and wont cover the nail.</li>
            <li>Gelish Black shadow is a dark black color great for a reverse french manicure.</li>
            <li>The thinness is even more of a problem when you apply with your &#x27;weak&#x27; hand.</li>
            <li>I keep wondering if I just happened to have a bad batch because I have other colors that are wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, long wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li>It a shade that is just a whisper more soft than cornball plain black.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless it comes out a beautiful, opaque black with two coats every single time whether a poorly trained or well trained manicurist applies it.</li>
            <li>Remember that dark colors take a bit longer to cure (3 minutes in UV) and you might need to add a third coat to make sure you get the color of black you want.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still much thinner than the other colors.</li>
            <li>have spent the past couple of days experimenting with different colors layered over the top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new in the gel manicure world, my experience is fairly limited.</li>
            <li>I am a very busy, single, working mother of four children ages 13, 10, &amp; 4 (twins) and am constantly moving, cleaning, dressing, batheing, you name it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, its a true black color &amp; with the Gelish topcoat applied over it, it has a glossy finish.</li>
            <li>and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>

            <li> This is color works very well and looks pretty good because it is very shiney.</li>
            <li> Delivery super quick.</li>
            <li> so you have to apply alittle or it will get to your cuticle quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very happy with the Gelish black shadow gel, it applies very smooth and easy and with two coats you have a true black nail</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of gel polishes, but so far this one works great!</li>
            <li> I also use various glitters on top to enhance which makes it my favorite gelish product right now.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice black color.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days and is great price for the size.</li>
            <li> You need 3 thin coats to get good coverage but it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Two coats was enough for a nice finish.</li>
            <li> A beautiful black, but much more sheer than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Really needs 3 coats for full opaqueness, unless you are using a sparkle.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish Black Shadow: arrived on time, good quality</li>
            <li> but this is very runny, very see through, and it shrinks under the light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, especially with the ultra shiny UV top coat, the only thing that would make it better is if it had a shimmer or glittery look.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish brand and have several colors.</li>
            <li> is so much pretty and chic</li>
            <li> and I love gelish, but this shade goes on very thin and seems more runny then most gelish polish.</li>
            <li> shiny and black and smooth, what more can I say?  </li>
            <li> To achieve a full black I need five coats or more, which I just don&#x27;t have the patience for.</li>
            <li> Perfect black as black.</li>
            <li> Just a nice pure black.</li>
            <li> Black shadow looks great by itself- very deep and shiny.</li>
            <li> This polish has withstood a SERIOUS beating and it still looks as gorgeous as it did the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A very nice solid black soak off gel.</li>
            <li> Very fancy.</li>
            <li> Goes on very evenly and holds up for weeks.</li>
            <li> The color of this gel polish is very streaky.</li>
            <li> It is really runny &amp; watery</li>
            <li> so much-</li>
            <li> But I wanted to rate the price NOW as they are more affordable than the other Amazon vendors I&#x27;ve been obtaining Gelish from and wanted to remind myself to return to AFL again.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this deep dark solid black, it is so shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> I love you Gelish, but this shade is not worth it.</li>
            <li> i want to use all my new colors!</li>
            <li> and this is the perfect one I put three to four thin coasts and cure extra 2 mins since its a dark color and add one coat of twinkle and it looks fabulous its a must..</li>
            <li> If you want/need/like a black polish I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just know this one may take longer than others you may have and require more post application clean-up / touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I hesitated because of the name, because I thought it might be sheer, or brownish black, but it is the perfect black.</li>
            <li> I love black nail polish.</li>
            <li> However, this black is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I think it has a classic look rather than gothic as some see it.  </li>
            <li> ...actually HAVE NOT received the polish yet - it should be here in a couple days (like 4 total so pretty fast!).  </li>
            <li> Mine goes on smoothly, no problems at all,  and it&#x27;s a beautiful classic black.</li>
            <li> This colour is dark black with just two coats, great shine too.</li>
            <li> It has a thicker texture than normal, but it&#x27;s alright, I&#x27;m not too picky.</li>
            <li> but they marked it as shipped a full two days before it ever left their facility.</li>
            <li> A deep, dark, true black, that was completely opaque in two coats (I did three for good measure, because I like the strength of multiple coats, but you could most definitely get away with two).</li>
            <li> I love black nail polish!  </li>
            <li> This I&#x27;s a nice black ONLY I&#x27;f applied 3 times.</li>
            <li> I love this Black Shadow color and love this product, it stays on for at least 2 weeks even with all the cleaning i do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of watery when u apply it so it leaves uneven streaks so the 3rd coat evens it out.</li>
            <li> I love the gelish products and I know that generally they are not true to color...</li>
            <li> reviewers here seem to have gotten panicky over the way it looks with only one the first coat.</li>
            <li> I also have shaken the bottle for more than 20 minutes to try to fully saturate the pigments, however this was all done in vain as the color is still a very streaky watered down grey.</li>
            <li> but it is a sexy basic black color.</li>
            <li> It has cut my spending and time down significantly compared to going to my nail salon.  </li>
            <li> This black is PLENTY black but is a bit more interesting shade of black than a \\&quot;patent leather\\</li>
            <li> Well, this one was a bit old</li>
            <li> I really like dark polishes with black being my favorite.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers said the shine is without question but you will need at least three coats or more to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> Basic black gel polish, and it dried super fast with my LED light nail dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great traditional solid black, so if you are looking for that &#x27;Racheal Zoe&#x27; black, this one is perfection.</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s the right color that I need, cure within time that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Takes about three coats to be a true black.</li>
            <li> No hidden blue or other color somewhere within or when it hits the light.</li>
            <li> (I live in the third world much of the year where manicurists are about as well trained as your next door neighbor.</li>
            <li> Normally when you open a new polish you assume it&#x27;s going to smell a certain way, and that the texture will be smooth and not too thin.</li>
            <li> Just not black.</li>
            <li> so I was expecting this..looks black in regular light...</li>
            <li> Normally Gelish makes a very solid formula</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I expected it would be/ wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this black is covers so well unlike the other brands that are streaky and wont cover the nail.</li>
            <li> Gelish Black shadow is a dark black color great for a reverse french manicure.</li>
            <li> The thinness is even more of a problem when you apply with your &#x27;weak&#x27; hand.</li>
            <li> I keep wondering if I just happened to have a bad batch because I have other colors that are wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, long wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li> It a shade that is just a whisper more soft than cornball plain black.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless it comes out a beautiful, opaque black with two coats every single time whether a poorly trained or well trained manicurist applies it.</li>
            <li> Remember that dark colors take a bit longer to cure (3 minutes in UV) and you might need to add a third coat to make sure you get the color of black you want.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still much thinner than the other colors.</li>
            <li> have spent the past couple of days experimenting with different colors layered over the top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new in the gel manicure world, my experience is fairly limited.</li>
            <li> I am a very busy, single, working mother of four children ages 13, 10, &amp; 4 (twins) and am constantly moving, cleaning, dressing, batheing, you name it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, its a true black color &amp; with the Gelish topcoat applied over it, it has a glossy finish.</li>
            <li> and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you remember to do thin coats and cure just a bit longer than the lighter colors, or it will wrinkle and could tint your topcoat black.</li>
            <li> It creates a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> Im currently wearing black with Vegas Lights on top and just completed the Tough Mudder without ONE single chip or break!</li>
            <li> I have a shade called Jet Set (dark denim gray) and it&#x27;s very thick and easy to apply, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with this particular shade.</li>
            <li> I ordered several other items the same time as this on a Thursday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cure correctly no matter how long you leave it in the dryer.</li>
            <li> I used 4 as it still didn&#x27;t look dark enough.  </li>
            <li> I used 3 coats and even then, it wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough.  </li>
            <li> I was so torn: I really really wanted this color, but the reviews about the shrinking issues sounded pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I posted a picture of my oh-so-cute black french mani.</li>
            <li> I like to do French nail using this black color.</li>
            <li> The last thing I wanted was to get a product that behaved oddly.</li>
            <li> My daughter also introduced me to galaxy nail art &amp; is currently sporting half the universe on her fingers.</li>
            <li> Finally I find a color that is actually black.</li>
            <li> I order one and it is almost black with either a blue or purple tint.</li>
            <li> So ordered, and was a BIG bottle compared to the little ones at the store.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, minimal shrinking.</li>
            <li> Two coats of this, and the color is a watered down misty grey.</li>
            <li> As a big fan of Gelish, I felt like I needed to add a black polish to my collection, and this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Completely deep dark black.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other colors mine is runny.</li>
            <li> The quality of this gel polish is on par with every other Gelish product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It works as directed, however, it&#x27;s quite runny compared to the other gelish colors.</li>
            <li> Because its a dark color, it also takes longer to cure than other lighter colors.</li>
            <li> When sandwiched between harmony;s Gel foundation base and top it off (as instructed)</li>
            <li> The color is just as the name states, black.</li>
            <li> I like to paint my mails black every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I looked for black color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> if you want black, this is black, it fulfills all expectations of a black gel polish</li>
            <li> It really is black, black, black.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs black in there collection</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for Gelish Black Shadow</li>
            <li> gave Black Shadow a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Black Shadow.</li>
            <li> This one is actually black.</li>
            <li> Its Black gel polish.</li>
            <li> You have to do 2-3 coats for it to be completely black.</li>
            <li> &quot; black.</li>
            <li> This is not a true black but rather a brownish lack.  </li>
            <li> , I had to have Black Shadow in my little Gelish</li>
            <li> I gotta admit I was a little worried about investing in black polish.</li>
            <li> Just takes a few coats to get desired shade.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black!</li>
            <li> If you want a black this is your polish!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I read other reviews, but I did my research online and checked out different swatches before buying.</li>
            <li> I did the usual recommended nail prep, with one exception: I skipped the ph bond (I never purchased the ph bond and the few manicures I did myself lasted around 20 days).</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the &#x27;basic black&#x27; and have actually been a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually apply about 2-3 coats and never have had a problem with gelish.</li>
            <li> I think that it is one of the harder polishes to apply thinly and evenly</li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;ve seen black nail polish the application appeared sloppy &amp; gave the person wearing it a harsh, Gothic look, but my daughter kept asking</li>
            <li> Black is a difficult color and this does take 3 coats to appear black.  </li>
            <li> Someone told me it is impossible to cure the black correctly, have tried double the time, still no luck.</li>
            <li> Black nail polish can tend to be a bit Goth and tired for my taste.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time.</li>
            <li> Applying it in thick coats is NOT the answer.</li>
            <li> This polish has a very thin consistency compared to my other Gelish polishes, which makes it a little difficult to work with in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with black.</li>
            <li> This took an extra 6 days :(</li>
            <li> It took me three thin layers to reach the opaque look that I wanted.</li>
            <li> No, they are worse because they&#x27;ve never ever seen</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It takes 4 thin coats to make it opaque but because of the shrinking, it looks very bad when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> It was not an ugly color.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gelish Black shadow is a dark black color great for a reverse french manicure. Love the rich color and the application.</li>
            <li> Great color, great brand, love it!</li>
            <li> I like the color and quality.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I read other reviews, but I did my research online and checked out different swatches before buying. I posted a picture of my oh-so-cute black french mani. It&#x27;s a great color! I would buy with confidence. Remember that dark colors take a bit longer to cure (3 minutes in UV) and you might need to add a third coat to make sure you get the color of black you want.</li>
            <li> I really like dark polishes with black being my favorite. This polish is really great. You need 3 thin coats to get good coverage but it looks amazing. I pair it with a glitter polish on top, Vegas Nights. Absolutely love it. I get a lot of compliments on the combination. Love Gelish!</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish brand and have several colors. I was looking forward to the &#x27;basic black&#x27; and have actually been a bit disappointed. As previous reviewers said the shine is without question but you will need at least three coats or more to get full coverage. However I found that the consistency leaves a lot to be desired. Unlike the other colors mine is runny. This allows it to run under the cuticle nail bed making the nails look not as good as they could. Mind you I&#x27;m not a professional so I&#x27;m sure some of it is user error but it&#x27;s still much thinner than the other colors. The thinness is even more of a problem when you apply with your &#x27;weak&#x27; hand. Applying it in thick coats is NOT the answer. That leads to chunky coats that pool in the sidewall where the nail meets your finger and it will peel up.  If you want/need/like a black polish I wouldn&#x27;t say don&#x27;t buy this, just know this one may take longer than others you may have and require more post application clean-up / touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, long wearing nail polish. The color is just as the name states, black. It&#x27;s very pretty, especially with the ultra shiny UV top coat, the only thing that would make it better is if it had a shimmer or glittery look.</li>
            <li> Great product and just what I was looking for. I usually apply about 2-3 coats and never have had a problem with gelish.</li>
            <li> Great traditional solid black, so if you are looking for that &#x27;Racheal Zoe&#x27; black, this one is perfection. I got two coats to work so it has pretty good coverage too.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look the same when u get it and in the picture they show but I still liked the color.</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned problems with application and curing of this color. Mine goes on smoothly, no problems at all,  and it&#x27;s a beautiful classic black.</li>
            <li> I like to paint my mails black every once in awhile. This is color works very well and looks pretty good because it is very shiney. I would recommend if you like to go gothic every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I looked for black color.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much pretty and chic color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I need to draw a line some time,  definitely I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this Black Shadow color and love this product, it stays on for at least 2 weeks even with all the cleaning i do. I recommend you try this color for Halloween!</li>
            <li> This polish has a very thin consistency compared to my other Gelish polishes, which makes it a little difficult to work with in my opinion. Because its a dark color, it also takes longer to cure than other lighter colors. Other than that, its a true black color &amp; with the Gelish topcoat applied over it, it has a glossy finish. I think I&#x27;ll get a lot of use out of this one!</li>
            <li> Love it. What&#x27;s there to say? it&#x27;s black! Went on well, no rippling. Took 3 coats.</li>
            <li> Completely deep dark black. This is what I wanted. I like to do French nail using this black color. Very fancy.</li>
            <li> shiny and black and smooth, what more can I say?  if you want black, this is black, it fulfills all expectations of a black gel polish</li>
            <li> A beautiful black, but much more sheer than I was expecting. Really needs 3 coats for full opaqueness, unless you are using a sparkle. Wears well.</li>
            <li> Received within a few days and is great price for the size. Lasted for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE Gelish products! Im new to doing my own nails and havent had a problem yet! No chipping, no peeling, no lifting, none of it! It easily lasts 2-3 weeks. I fill mine every 2 weeks becuase i want to use all my new colors! Im currently wearing black with Vegas Lights on top and just completed the Tough Mudder without ONE single chip or break! SOO happy with my nails and this product!</li>
            <li> It really is black, black, black. Goes on very evenly and holds up for weeks. I love the Gelish line.</li>
            <li> This is not a true black but rather a brownish lack.  It was not an ugly color.  Just not black.</li>
            <li> Normally when you open a new polish you assume it&#x27;s going to smell a certain way, and that the texture will be smooth and not too thin. Well, this one was a bit old I think. It has a thicker texture than normal, but it&#x27;s alright, I&#x27;m not too picky.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage. This is a beautiful, perfectly black polish.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs black in there collection and this is the perfect one I put three to four thin coasts and cure extra 2 mins since its a dark color and add one coat of twinkle and it looks fabulous its a must..I love it</li>
            <li> Takes about three coats to be a true black.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a fellow newbie DIY&#x27;er out there reading this review I want to help you make up your mind. After reading the reviews for Gelish Black Shadow I was so torn: I really really wanted this color, but the reviews about the shrinking issues sounded pretty bad. I&#x27;m new in the gel manicure world, my experience is fairly limited. The last thing I wanted was to get a product that behaved oddly. Well, I ordered it anyway, I had to have Black Shadow in my little Gelish collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave Black Shadow a try. It was my third time doing my gel manicure myself. I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience. I did the usual recommended nail prep, with one exception: I skipped the ph bond (I never purchased the ph bond and the few manicures I did myself lasted around 20 days). I used Gelish foundation and Gelish top coat. It took me three thin layers to reach the opaque look that I wanted. It cured in 30 seconds under Gelish 18G LED lamp and I experienced no shrinking/bubbling issues whatsoever. If there were any issues with the formula or the batch, the issue must have been resolved. The quality of this gel polish is on par with every other Gelish product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Black is a difficult color and this does take 3 coats to appear black.  I used 4 as it still didn&#x27;t look dark enough.  It ended up looking great.</li>
            <li> Love this gel polish! Color is great and quality is excellent. So shiny!</li>
            <li> Gelish is the best gel available and the color is perfect! I will absolutely be buying some more of this.</li>
            <li> who doesnt love a good black polish? I love this black is covers so well unlike the other brands that are streaky and wont cover the nail.</li>
            <li> A very nice solid black soak off gel. I hesitated because of the name, because I thought it might be sheer, or brownish black, but it is the perfect black. A deep, dark, true black, that was completely opaque in two coats (I did three for good measure, because I like the strength of multiple coats, but you could most definitely get away with two). I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased with the results. Just make sure you remember to do thin coats and cure just a bit longer than the lighter colors, or it will wrinkle and could tint your topcoat black.</li>
            <li> It works as directed, however, it&#x27;s quite runny compared to the other gelish colors.</li>
            <li> i LIKE it, I&#x27;m wearing it now. I just wish they would find some way to keep gels from leaking out of the bottle.  The top always gets all gunky.  But it happens to all my gels so it&#x27;s not their fault.</li>
            <li> What more can you say or ask for. It is a nice black that coats nicely. Great for layering over tape for designs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Gelish line.  It has cut my spending and time down significantly compared to going to my nail salon.  I had been spending between $50-70 and 2 hours every two weeks in nail salons.  Now that I have this system...I WILL NEVER GO back to the salon again.  I can&#x27;t get enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a week and there is not a chip, scratch or crack in my polish.  I am a very busy, single, working mother of four children ages 13, 10, &amp; 4 (twins) and am constantly moving, cleaning, dressing, batheing, you name it.  This polish has withstood a SERIOUS beating and it still looks as gorgeous as it did the first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have six colors and plan to continue growing my collection.  If you have any doubts, push them aside; this product is PHENOMENAL!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite color ever! Its a perfect black!</li>
            <li> As a big fan of Gelish, I felt like I needed to add a black polish to my collection, and this one fits the bill! Black shadow looks great by itself- very deep and shiny. I also have tried it with glitter polish on top, which is fun for going out, and for Halloween I used it for jack-o-lantern faces over orange cream dream, which was cute and looked great! A must-have for gelish fans!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It looks especially good with Vegas Nights over it but it is a sexy basic black color.</li>
            <li> The color of this gel polish is very streaky. I keep wondering if I just happened to have a bad batch because I have other colors that are wonderful. Two coats of this, and the color is a watered down misty grey. To achieve a full black I need five coats or more, which I just don&#x27;t have the patience for. I also have shaken the bottle for more than 20 minutes to try to fully saturate the pigments, however this was all done in vain as the color is still a very streaky watered down grey.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Color stays on for 2 to 3 weeks making my gel manicure beautiful. When sandwiched between harmony;s Gel foundation base and top it off (as instructed) It creates a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and I love gelish, but this shade goes on very thin and seems more runny then most gelish polish.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice black color. I used it for Halloween. I was a zombie. I looked the part!!!</li>
            <li> Black is always a great color!! I actually traded my polish for my manicure &amp; the bottle was used by many others at my salon!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this deep dark solid black, it is so shiny and pretty. Two coats was enough for a nice finish.</li>
            <li> thank you very much for the product, remains haunted, I loved it, thanks for the attention and the speed with which they work, 100% recommended, greetings and thanks</li>
            <li> Basic black gel polish, and it dried super fast with my LED light nail dryer.  I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands of gel polishes, but so far this one works great!</li>
            <li> Great Staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and beautiful glossy coverage!</li>
            <li> This colour is dark black with just two coats, great shine too. Delivery super quick.</li>
            <li> Great polish. works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect black color, goes on smooth, looks great for black tips with some glitter or for a design, looks good</li>
            <li> I love the gelish products and I know that generally they are not true to color...so I was expecting this..looks black in regular light... Step outside and it&#x27;s like a navy blue...very chic still...I like it and am wearing it now...I ordered from JV beauty supply...and while it was with in its &amp;#34;shipping estimate&amp;#34; time apon arrival... I received it 10 days after the original purchase...I get that shipping times can vary...but they marked it as shipped a full two days before it ever left their facility. I ordered several other items the same time as this on a Thursday and I received them all the following Monday! This took an extra 6 days :(</li>
            <li> Really nice color... Just takes a few coats to get desired shade.</li>
            <li> Harmony Gelish Black Shadow: arrived on time, good quality-it&#x27;s the right color that I need, cure within time that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Black Shadow. Normally Gelish makes a very solid formula but this is very runny, very see through, and it shrinks under the light so it&#x27;s difficult to work with. I have a shade called Jet Set (dark denim gray) and it&#x27;s very thick and easy to apply, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with this particular shade. It takes 4 thin coats to make it opaque but because of the shrinking, it looks very bad when you&#x27;re done. I love you Gelish, but this shade is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with black. This item is exactly what I expected it would be/ wanted. It goes with everything.</li>
            <li> I have used Gelish products religiously for two years.  Love all of it except this color, it bubbles.  Did four manicures, and all have peeled within three days.  Someone told me it is impossible to cure the black correctly, have tried double the time, still no luck.</li>
            <li> I gotta admit I was a little worried about investing in black polish. Every time I&#x27;ve seen black nail polish the application appeared sloppy &amp; gave the person wearing it a harsh, Gothic look, but my daughter kept asking &amp; I finally gave in. So happy I gave in!&lt;br /&gt;The color is rich &amp; shiny. The gel has a crisp, almost plastic appearance, making for a clean &amp; elegant application.&lt;br /&gt;We have spent the past couple of days experimenting with different colors layered over the top. My favorites so far are Grand Jewels, June Bride, Izzy Wizzy &amp; Good Gossip. My daughter also introduced me to galaxy nail art &amp; is currently sporting half the universe on her fingers. Very cool!</li>
            <li> Finally I find a color that is actually black. I have had a hard time. I order one and it is almost black with either a blue or purple tint. This one is actually black.</li>
            <li> Its Black gel polish. You have to do 2-3 coats for it to be completely black. I arrived quickly and safely to KS thru my mailbox.&lt;br /&gt; Would I re purchase again? YES! I love black nail polish. It is really runny &amp; watery so you have to apply alittle or it will get to your cuticle quickly. I&#x27;m trying Shellac next to see if it&#x27;s not as watery. It lasts until I peel my nails off (within 2 weeks w/o chipping)</li>
            <li> I love all the Gelish products. They are good quality and are affordable. will continue to add to my color collection.</li>
            <li> I love this polish but have not used it yet. I can&#x27;t wait to try it though. It has been a while since i&#x27;ve used my gelish.</li>
            <li> I really liked this nail polish. Great for Halloween time. I think that it is one of the harder polishes to apply thinly and evenly but gelish is a great product and with practice anyone can master it. I am soon going to try the matte finish with this one!</li>
            <li> I love black nail polish!  I think it has a classic look rather than gothic as some see it.  However, this black is not my favorite.  I used 3 coats and even then, it wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough.  I put a sparkle over it to improve, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever wear it alone.</li>
            <li> Great color, but shipping took way longer than it should of.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner and it was very good.. I have used it once only after I got it and it worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Black nail polish can tend to be a bit Goth and tired for my taste. This black is PLENTY black but is a bit more interesting shade of black than a \\&quot;patent leather\\&quot; black. It a shade that is just a whisper more soft than cornball plain black. I adore it, and it has been the only polish I have worn since I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers here seem to have gotten panicky over the way it looks with only one the first coat. It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to work. Nonetheless it comes out a beautiful, opaque black with two coats every single time whether a poorly trained or well trained manicurist applies it. (I live in the third world much of the year where manicurists are about as well trained as your next door neighbor. No, they are worse because they&#x27;ve never ever seen a good manicure.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff so much- what a treat to be able to wear it for about three weeks and have it look like you just had your nails done yesterday; always so shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Goes on well, minimal shrinking.</li>
            <li> I got gelish from Sally beauty to start, but they didn&#x27;t have this color. So ordered, and was a BIG bottle compared to the little ones at the store. Great color though, and won&#x27;t need to buy more for awhile.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cure correctly no matter how long you leave it in the dryer. The color just rubs right off!</li>
            <li> ...actually HAVE NOT received the polish yet - it should be here in a couple days (like 4 total so pretty fast!).  But I wanted to rate the price NOW as they are more affordable than the other Amazon vendors I&#x27;ve been obtaining Gelish from and wanted to remind myself to return to AFL again.  I&#x27;m sure the polish will be fab -- I will follow up with a strictly polish review.</li>
            <li> Perfect black as black. I also use various glitters on top to enhance which makes it my favorite gelish product right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very happy with the Gelish black shadow gel, it applies very smooth and easy and with two coats you have a true black nail I recommend this gel polish!</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. If you want a black this is your polish! It&#x27;s a really good color in my opinon :)</li>
            <li> Great smooth black color. No hidden blue or other color somewhere within or when it hits the light. Just a nice pure black.</li>
            <li> This I&#x27;s a nice black ONLY I&#x27;f applied 3 times. So that&#x27;s why i give it a 4 star. It&#x27;s kind of watery when u apply it so it leaves uneven streaks so the 3rd coat evens it out. Btw, I&#x27;m a manicurist.</li>
