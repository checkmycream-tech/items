            <li>I even like this better than my straightening iron because there is literally no frizz.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I will be shopping with you guys more often.</li>
            <li>It took me 2 times to really get my curls looking great with this.</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>So I gave in and I am so glad I did</li>
            <li>I have been getting so many complements .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it !</li>
            <li>, i got lots of complements from my friends after using this iron, i am falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>sure makes the experience quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li>whatever it is it works better than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure makes the experience quicker and easier.  </li>
            <li>The best part is it only takes about 10 - 15 seconds per curl ( I put a lot of hair on the wand</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>However, I LOVE the way it curls my sister&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this wand</li>
            <li>I would buy 100 more of these curling irons if I could afford it.</li>
            <li>I really love the curls that this iron creates.</li>
            <li>I love it, I looked around for a curling iron and found this one.</li>
            <li>BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO WATCH A YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>Great iron, it produces soft &amp; shiny curls every time and doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair!</li>
            <li>Worth the investment !!</li>
            <li>So far, I am so happy and my hair looks healthy with no split ends</li>
            <li>With that said, the decision was easy to return the Bed Head and keep the Sedu.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros: weight, size, sleek look, swivel cord, auto-shut off, easy to use,</li>
            <li>I think part of the reason for the efficiency is that the hair slides off the clipless barrel so easily without tangle.</li>
            <li>It gave me beautiful curls after only 10 seconds in my hair.</li>
            <li>it is fine and oily .</li>
            <li>It heats up so quickly and my curls hold!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and I have already burned myself a milllion times, USE THE HEAT GLOVE!</li>
            <li>But more importantly, my hair felt so soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>The best curling iron i ever used, i bought the 25mm size and it was perfict for me, my hair is long not very thick and this product give my hair a fantastic look and value</li>
            <li>but soon it becomes easy to style hair in the way you want, be it light, bouncy waves or tighter curls, I would recommend it to anyone looking for soft waves that remain shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I tried the Bed Head first on fresh clean hair and found that it performed OK.</li>
            <li>This curling iron really delivers as promised... and more.</li>
            <li>And, losing the clip really does give better curls and waves.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can sleep on them and be good to go the next day too.</li>
            <li>I was able to hold it in my hands throughout my whole styling process.</li>
            <li>All the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>when I did it, I love it even more the next day after sleeping on the curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burned myself on the jawline, forehead and my wrist, luckily the burns did not leave visible scars.</li>
            <li>Fantastic curling iron,fabulous results on first try.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>However, this thing gets VERY hot and even with the protective mitten you can still hurt yourself if you use it too close to your face.</li>
            <li>But with this curling iron the curls come out seemingly effortless (and way more natural looking than rollers) in just a manner of minutes!</li>
            <li>I purchased this clipless curling iron after watching some video reviews online and let me just say its worth the price.</li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>Kind of wish I could make it just a tiny bit wider.</li>
            <li>Sedu thinks about everything, from a nice long swivel cord to the heat-resistant glove as the barrel gets very hot</li>
            <li>It gets super hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast!</li>
            <li>this gets super hot so please use the right setting for your hair type&lt;</li>
            <li>It has a long cord, which I love!.</li>
            <li>but I do not think I have the right hair for it.</li>
            <li>After having my hair cut just below my ears I found the wand a little more challenging to use but still figured it out.  </li>
            <li>All the other positive reviews are true!!!</li>
            <li>Having used no products at all in my hard to curl, fine hair, I was very satisfied with the results of the $30 Bed Head.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other high end irons, on the highest heat you get just enough for great curl, but not too much to risk burn</li>
            <li>Gets hot</li>
            <li>Do get some heat protecting products as this thing gets hot.</li>
            <li>but I really think this iron is worth the money.f</li>
            <li>but I really think this iron is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I&#x27;d love to see is a longer barrel.</li>
            <li>I think the smaller barrel size (19mm) would have been better for me</li>
            <li>it does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>My first impression was how sleek and polished it looks.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to get the curls I want with the traditional clip iron, however this one gives you  just the look you want without the fish trails and tangled hair.</li>
            <li>(I burned my ear the first time I used it).</li>
            <li>People only complain about this product mainly because they are not used to using just a wand, so they burn themselves very easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just way better with a flat iron than with a curler).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The high heat setting is perfect for tight spiral curls on long hair.</li>
            <li>in fact I paid $30 less than most places that sell the Sedu Revolution!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to wear long sleeves when using this iron to protect your arms</li>
            <li>Just be careful because it is super easy to get burned with this wand.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, but with the Sedu my curls or waves last all day</li>
            <li>Low setting is for fine hair, medium and high settings are for more coarse</li>
            <li>but other than that small nit, I really love this iron and how it makes gorgeous waves and curls in longer hair.</li>
            <li>I had long hair when I purchased the wand and found it very easy to create soft waves.  </li>
            <li>And very eastbay to use</li>
            <li>I have NEVER used a product I like so much.</li>
            <li>It takes maybe 10 minutes to do the whole head for me and lasts about 4 hours without product and all day with.</li>
            <li>The glove really helps get all the hair in.</li>
            <li>I have VERY stick straight hair</li>
            <li>Sometimes you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>the curl size is really all about: 1) how much hair you wrap around the wand  </li>
            <li>Minimal protection is better than no protection at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>I am one who was never able to figure out how to curl hair and have it come out looking nice.</li>
            <li>Also I love that the iron has a flip down stand,</li>
            <li>While the curls from the Bed Head quickly became less defined over the course of several hours, I was able to still maintain the waves for days until my hair was washed.</li>
            <li>The glove is really clever and allows you to get the curl all the way to the bottom of each length of hair without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>This iron gets very hot very fast, so please be careful and use the glove it comes with.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20 - 30 seconds per curl, on high, to achieve the results I want.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has an automatic setting when you turn it on, which prevents you from using high setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little more tricky.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, she fell in love and ordered one THAT day.  </li>
            <li>but it never got hot enough to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Super LONG cord for this who need it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>but WOW!</li>
            <li>I made sure to use small sections of hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many irons in the past and this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li>I was almost positive that the sedu would not perform as well because I found that the package states it only heats up to 350degrees.</li>
            <li>Now... you have to be careful, as this glove is not Asbestos, but you can be a little more aggressive in winding your hair down to the ends for sure.</li>
            <li>Despite trying multiple settings, this product does not curl effectively and what little shape it produces does not last.</li>
            <li>Her hair curls differently than mine because it is so straight naturally -</li>
            <li>Outside of the price, the end result of using the clipless curling iron from Sedu is absolutely mind blowing.</li>
            <li>I also had no trouble getting use to not having a clamp .</li>
            <li>I was overly surprised that the Sedu wand worked so well.  </li>
            <li>When I picked it up, I was surprised to see how lightweight it was.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li>I sloppily used larger sections of again freshly washed and dried hair with this iron and even held it in for shorter lengths of time and got very nicely well defined curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly understand the technology behind the hair penetrating heat of the Sedu (especially with a lower temperature), but whatever it is it works better than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has 3 heat settings (low, med, high)</li>
            <li>The Bed Head had a much longer barrel which I found that even with my extremely long hair I did not utilize the barrel in its entirety.</li>
            <li>I double checked at a beauty supply store near my house and was so pleasantly surprised that I did not over pay for this product...</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, it is worth the $$$ I spent for it.</li>
            <li>This one does the job beyond words, it heats up almost instantly and I can do my whole head in 30 minutes resulting in curls that last for days.</li>
            <li>You can get burned if your not careful so please use caution.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and I actually went out to buy the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>I tried it for 5 seconds and the result was soft, luscious waves--something I could not seem to achieve with a regular iron with clips.</li>
            <li>so I expected nothing less with the curling iron, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Sedu flat iron 2 years ago on Amazon and it is still going strong with use at least 3 times per week</li>
            <li>The look is very modern not cheap looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing the research on the various curling wands available because of the type of hair that I have: Thick, Curly, Coarse hair, I thought I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>Press and hold the higher setting for a few seconds</li>
            <li>My co-worker (who has naturally straight hair) wanted to give it a try because she had never tried a clipless iron (neither had i), so I brought it to work for her to try on some down time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is VERY thick and it did not curl as easily as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I was concerned not only about the size and that it would only give me tight curls but that it wouldn&#x27;t even get hot enough to produce curls</li>
            <li>They both have thick, dark hair, and we used the same hair product, so I&#x27;m sure it was the quality of the iron that determined the damage to the hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the little \\&quot;kick stand\\&quot; as well, and also the auto shut off feature (which you can disable if needed).</li>

            <li> The best part is it only takes about 10 - 15 seconds per curl ( I put a lot of hair on the wand</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> However, I LOVE the way it curls my sister&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this wand</li>
            <li> I would buy 100 more of these curling irons if I could afford it.</li>
            <li> I really love the curls that this iron creates.</li>
            <li> I love it, I looked around for a curling iron and found this one.</li>
            <li> BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO WATCH A YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> Great iron, it produces soft &amp; shiny curls every time and doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair!</li>
            <li> Worth the investment !!</li>
            <li> So far, I am so happy and my hair looks healthy with no split ends</li>
            <li> With that said, the decision was easy to return the Bed Head and keep the Sedu.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros: weight, size, sleek look, swivel cord, auto-shut off, easy to use,</li>
            <li> I think part of the reason for the efficiency is that the hair slides off the clipless barrel so easily without tangle.</li>
            <li> It gave me beautiful curls after only 10 seconds in my hair.</li>
            <li> it is fine and oily .</li>
            <li> It heats up so quickly and my curls hold!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and I have already burned myself a milllion times, USE THE HEAT GLOVE!</li>
            <li> But more importantly, my hair felt so soft and amazing.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron i ever used, i bought the 25mm size and it was perfict for me, my hair is long not very thick and this product give my hair a fantastic look and value</li>
            <li> but soon it becomes easy to style hair in the way you want, be it light, bouncy waves or tighter curls, I would recommend it to anyone looking for soft waves that remain shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I tried the Bed Head first on fresh clean hair and found that it performed OK.</li>
            <li> This curling iron really delivers as promised... and more.</li>
            <li> And, losing the clip really does give better curls and waves.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can sleep on them and be good to go the next day too.</li>
            <li> I was able to hold it in my hands throughout my whole styling process.</li>
            <li> All the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> when I did it, I love it even more the next day after sleeping on the curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned myself on the jawline, forehead and my wrist, luckily the burns did not leave visible scars.</li>
            <li> Fantastic curling iron,fabulous results on first try.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> However, this thing gets VERY hot and even with the protective mitten you can still hurt yourself if you use it too close to your face.</li>
            <li> But with this curling iron the curls come out seemingly effortless (and way more natural looking than rollers) in just a manner of minutes!</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipless curling iron after watching some video reviews online and let me just say its worth the price.</li>
            <li> So worth the price.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> Kind of wish I could make it just a tiny bit wider.</li>
            <li> Sedu thinks about everything, from a nice long swivel cord to the heat-resistant glove as the barrel gets very hot</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast!</li>
            <li> this gets super hot so please use the right setting for your hair type&lt;</li>
            <li> It has a long cord, which I love!.</li>
            <li> but I do not think I have the right hair for it.</li>
            <li> After having my hair cut just below my ears I found the wand a little more challenging to use but still figured it out.  </li>
            <li> All the other positive reviews are true!!!</li>
            <li> Having used no products at all in my hard to curl, fine hair, I was very satisfied with the results of the $30 Bed Head.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other high end irons, on the highest heat you get just enough for great curl, but not too much to risk burn</li>
            <li> Gets hot</li>
            <li> Do get some heat protecting products as this thing gets hot.</li>
            <li> but I really think this iron is worth the money.f</li>
            <li> but I really think this iron is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I&#x27;d love to see is a longer barrel.</li>
            <li> I think the smaller barrel size (19mm) would have been better for me</li>
            <li> it does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> My first impression was how sleek and polished it looks.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to get the curls I want with the traditional clip iron, however this one gives you  just the look you want without the fish trails and tangled hair.</li>
            <li> (I burned my ear the first time I used it).</li>
            <li> People only complain about this product mainly because they are not used to using just a wand, so they burn themselves very easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just way better with a flat iron than with a curler).&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The high heat setting is perfect for tight spiral curls on long hair.</li>
            <li> in fact I paid $30 less than most places that sell the Sedu Revolution!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to wear long sleeves when using this iron to protect your arms</li>
            <li> Just be careful because it is super easy to get burned with this wand.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, but with the Sedu my curls or waves last all day</li>
            <li> Low setting is for fine hair, medium and high settings are for more coarse</li>
            <li> but other than that small nit, I really love this iron and how it makes gorgeous waves and curls in longer hair.</li>
            <li> I had long hair when I purchased the wand and found it very easy to create soft waves.  </li>
            <li> And very eastbay to use</li>
            <li> I have NEVER used a product I like so much.</li>
            <li> It takes maybe 10 minutes to do the whole head for me and lasts about 4 hours without product and all day with.</li>
            <li> The glove really helps get all the hair in.</li>
            <li> I have VERY stick straight hair</li>
            <li> Sometimes you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the curl size is really all about: 1) how much hair you wrap around the wand  </li>
            <li> Minimal protection is better than no protection at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it it as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> I am one who was never able to figure out how to curl hair and have it come out looking nice.</li>
            <li> Also I love that the iron has a flip down stand,</li>
            <li> While the curls from the Bed Head quickly became less defined over the course of several hours, I was able to still maintain the waves for days until my hair was washed.</li>
            <li> The glove is really clever and allows you to get the curl all the way to the bottom of each length of hair without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> This iron gets very hot very fast, so please be careful and use the glove it comes with.</li>
            <li> It takes about 20 - 30 seconds per curl, on high, to achieve the results I want.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It has an automatic setting when you turn it on, which prevents you from using high setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little more tricky.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, she fell in love and ordered one THAT day.  </li>
            <li> but it never got hot enough to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Super LONG cord for this who need it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> but WOW!</li>
            <li> I made sure to use small sections of hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many irons in the past and this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li> I was almost positive that the sedu would not perform as well because I found that the package states it only heats up to 350degrees.</li>
            <li> Now... you have to be careful, as this glove is not Asbestos, but you can be a little more aggressive in winding your hair down to the ends for sure.</li>
            <li> Despite trying multiple settings, this product does not curl effectively and what little shape it produces does not last.</li>
            <li> Her hair curls differently than mine because it is so straight naturally -</li>
            <li> Outside of the price, the end result of using the clipless curling iron from Sedu is absolutely mind blowing.</li>
            <li> I also had no trouble getting use to not having a clamp .</li>
            <li> I was overly surprised that the Sedu wand worked so well.  </li>
            <li> When I picked it up, I was surprised to see how lightweight it was.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> I sloppily used larger sections of again freshly washed and dried hair with this iron and even held it in for shorter lengths of time and got very nicely well defined curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly understand the technology behind the hair penetrating heat of the Sedu (especially with a lower temperature), but whatever it is it works better than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has 3 heat settings (low, med, high)</li>
            <li> The Bed Head had a much longer barrel which I found that even with my extremely long hair I did not utilize the barrel in its entirety.</li>
            <li> I double checked at a beauty supply store near my house and was so pleasantly surprised that I did not over pay for this product...</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend, it is worth the $$$ I spent for it.</li>
            <li> This one does the job beyond words, it heats up almost instantly and I can do my whole head in 30 minutes resulting in curls that last for days.</li>
            <li> You can get burned if your not careful so please use caution.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and I actually went out to buy the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> I tried it for 5 seconds and the result was soft, luscious waves--something I could not seem to achieve with a regular iron with clips.</li>
            <li> so I expected nothing less with the curling iron, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Sedu flat iron 2 years ago on Amazon and it is still going strong with use at least 3 times per week</li>
            <li> The look is very modern not cheap looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing the research on the various curling wands available because of the type of hair that I have: Thick, Curly, Coarse hair, I thought I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Press and hold the higher setting for a few seconds</li>
            <li> My co-worker (who has naturally straight hair) wanted to give it a try because she had never tried a clipless iron (neither had i), so I brought it to work for her to try on some down time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY thick and it did not curl as easily as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I was concerned not only about the size and that it would only give me tight curls but that it wouldn&#x27;t even get hot enough to produce curls</li>
            <li> They both have thick, dark hair, and we used the same hair product, so I&#x27;m sure it was the quality of the iron that determined the damage to the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the little \\&quot;kick stand\\&quot; as well, and also the auto shut off feature (which you can disable if needed).</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get it right</li>
            <li> Worth the extra few $$$ in comparison to other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> It has a shorter barrel than the extra long Bed Head</li>
            <li> glove provided was identical to the one provided with the Bed Head and it allowed me to make contact with the barrel long enough to curl my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m on fire.</li>
            <li> glove provided was identical to the one provided with the Bed Head and it allowed me to make contact with the barrel long enough to curl my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m on fire.</li>
            <li> I have VERY resistant, heavy, thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> As for my hair type, it&#x27;s naturally curly (mix of african american/caucasion hair), long ( 2 or more inches past my bra line ) and just knowing how difficult it can be to get my hair to do something (other than what I don&#x27;t want it to do )</li>
            <li> so it may not be that long for you ?? )</li>
            <li> how long you hold the wand in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> she has long hair (about bra length).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> If it annoys you to use the curler in the opposite hand over your head, then you can hold it upside down with the same hand as the side you&#x27;re curling</li>
            <li> Works great/fast and holds a curl for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It gives her those loose, beachy waves.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to hold it upside down and with the opposite hand of the side you&#x27;re curling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little short for very long hair.</li>
            <li> My previous experience for my waist length straight hair is that I needed at least 400 to hold a curl all day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair would sometimes get tangled up in the stand on back of iron as it protrudes quite a bit when curling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing i would warn about is that if you don&#x27;t use the heat resistant glove, you may burn yourself a few times until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> but that seems a bit wide for my length hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any other curling iron before</li>
            <li> One of the other fellow dance moms purchased a $30 Con-Air one.</li>
            <li> Advise watching Utube video on how to use it...and also be very careful not to burn yourself on wrist, ears,or face due to extreme heat.</li>
            <li> Mine gives me tight ringlets if i want them, or loose curls (i opt for these).  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try this on my daughter&#x27;s hair being that she has thick, straight, hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair hardly ever held a curl, or I spent a long time setting rollers.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries before you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> You still want to hold the iron upside down though.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> how tight you pull your hair around the wand and 3)</li>

            <li> a little wind blown but w/ curls still holding on and that was w/o using any product of any kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedu</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling wand a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I go, the curl will hold for a few days..</li>
            <li> A few things to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediately, I know this is no cheap product (despite the cost).</li>
            <li> I do not want ringlets that are too small.  </li>
            <li> ( my walk time is usually for an hr or so in this N.C. summer heat ) and upon my return I still had curls..</li>
            <li> and wow, I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> If you have hard to curl hair get it !</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, but thin.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I hated having to use heat on her hair, so I thought I&#x27;d spend the money and use it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My hair hardly ever held a curl, or I spent a long time setting rollers. But with this curling iron the curls come out seemingly effortless (and way more natural looking than rollers) in just a manner of minutes! Love. I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing the larger one, too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this clipless curling iron after watching some video reviews online and let me just say its worth the price. This comes with a heat resistant glove which if you don&#x27;t have a lot of practice with iron&#x27;s like this trust me I WOULD USE IF I WAS YOU. It gets super hot. but here are some PRO&#x27;s and CON&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;1. has 3 heat settings (low, med, high) this gets super hot so please use the right setting for your hair type&lt;br /&gt;2. Leaves wavy curls which I LOVE (Because you have to twist your hair around it and its clipless so no indent).&lt;br /&gt;3. Super LONG cord for this who need it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The look is very modern not cheap looking.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gets hot fast.&lt;br /&gt;6. Comes with the heat resistant glove so you don&#x27;t have to purchase this by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not come with a heat resistant pouch or carrier. (Mine did because I ordered mine on Folica.com)&lt;br /&gt;2. The price (but you get what you pay for)&lt;br /&gt;3. You can get burned if your not careful so please use caution.&lt;br /&gt;4. The glove is not 100% heat proof you can still feel the heat SO BE CAREFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL I LOVE THIS IRON. I got the 19mm size and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling wand a few months ago.  It took a little practice but I finally mastered it.  I had long hair when I purchased the wand and found it very easy to create soft waves.  After having my hair cut just below my ears I found the wand a little more challenging to use but still figured it out.  I get a lot of compliments when I use the wand and am so happy I purchased it.  I have thick, naturally wavy hair.  It takes about 20 - 30 seconds per curl, on high, to achieve the results I want.</li>
            <li> Fantastic curling iron,fabulous results on first try. Advise watching Utube video on how to use it...and also be very careful not to burn yourself on wrist, ears,or face due to extreme heat.Hubby said&lt;br /&gt; my hair looked incredible after first time curling hair. Very big heads up on this item.</li>
            <li> Excellent , very happy  with it. I recommend it  100 %. I Love it. Useful!!!!!! And very eastbay to use</li>
            <li> After trying a similar product on Halloween this year, I had to get one for myself. Many may disagree, but the price I paid for this product ($120) is UNHEARD of !!! I double checked at a beauty supply store near my house and was so pleasantly surprised that I did not over pay for this product... in fact I paid $30 less than most places that sell the Sedu Revolution!  Outside of the price, the end result of using the clipless curling iron from Sedu is absolutely mind blowing. I love my hair. I loved it yesterday when I did it, I love it even more the next day after sleeping on the curls.  My hair is very long and extremely thick. I have NEVER used a product I like so much. I even like this better than my straightening iron because there is literally no frizz. I used maybe 2 squirts of hairspray and I didn&#x27;t need anymore.  Not to mention... I placed the order on Wednesday and my curling iron was sitting on my door on Friday ! &#x3D;)  After purchasing this I will never go anywhere else for hair products. I will forever be a Sedu lover. Thank you for your amazing product , and thank you Amazon for the great price !! I will be shopping with you guys more often.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get it right but WOW! So worth the price. I have VERY resistant, heavy, thick straight hair. It takes maybe 10 minutes to do the whole head for me and lasts about 4 hours without product and all day with. Do get some heat protecting products as this thing gets hot. Great investment.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron. I am one who was never able to figure out how to curl hair and have it come out looking nice. It took me 2 times to really get my curls looking great with this. I love this iron. Really simple to use. The glove really helps get all the hair in. You can touch the iron with the glove on but you can&#x27;t hold it on the iron otherwise you will feel the heat come through. I use the medium setting. Highly recommend. I have used many irons in the past and this is by far the easiest.</li>
            <li> I was back and fourth on spending the money on this . So I gave in and I am so glad I did I have VERY stick straight hair it will not hold a curl at all it is fine and oily . But this iron works great I even have curl the next day ! Best of all I don&#x27;t need any product . If you have hard to curl hair get it ! I have been getting so many complements . I also had no trouble getting use to not having a clamp . Worth the investment !! I can&#x27;t say enough great things about it !</li>
            <li> I love this wand! It heats up so quickly and my curls hold! Comes with a heat protectant glove. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best curling iron i ever used, i bought the 25mm size and it was perfict for me, my hair is long not very thick and this product give my hair a fantastic look and value, i got lots of complements from my friends after using this iron, i am falling in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair.  I do not want ringlets that are too small.  Should I get the 25 mm or the 38 mm?</li>
            <li> I bought this iron about 3-years ago. Really liked it until it started turning off on its own while using it. Of course it only has a two year warranty. My next one won&#x27;t be this brand.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you really get what you pay for. I purchased a $30 Bed Head curling wand (Curlipops) in the same diameter as this one to compare the two. I was almost positive that the sedu would not perform as well because I found that the package states it only heats up to 350degrees. My previous experience for my waist length straight hair is that I needed at least 400 to hold a curl all day. I tried the Bed Head first on fresh clean hair and found that it performed OK. The Bed Head had a much longer barrel which I found that even with my extremely long hair I did not utilize the barrel in its entirety. It also came with an awesome silicone tip that you can use to handle the end of the iron. I made sure to use small sections of hair. While the curls from the Bed Head quickly became less defined over the course of several hours, I was able to still maintain the waves for days until my hair was washed. Having used no products at all in my hard to curl, fine hair, I was very satisfied with the results of the $30 Bed Head. My only complaint is that my hair would sometimes get tangled up in the stand on back of iron as it protrudes quite a bit when curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would&#x27;ve thought that I would be even happier with the Sedu. It has a shorter barrel than the extra long Bed Head but that&#x27;s ok. I sloppily used larger sections of again freshly washed and dried hair with this iron and even held it in for shorter lengths of time and got very nicely well defined curls. The resulting curls were noticeably softer and not crispy feeling. And to boot, the curls stayed defined for several days. Even when I brushed it out, the curls somehow managed to bounce back. It was pretty impressive. But more importantly, my hair felt so soft and amazing. Also I love that the iron has a flip down stand, a feature I&#x27;ve never seen before. With that said, the decision was easy to return the Bed Head and keep the Sedu. I don&#x27;t exactly understand the technology behind the hair penetrating heat of the Sedu (especially with a lower temperature), but whatever it is it works better than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove provided was identical to the one provided with the Bed Head and it allowed me to make contact with the barrel long enough to curl my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m on fire. I do have a little confession that I forgot to return the silicone tip that came with the Bed head but it fits the Sedu perfectly as well. With any clipless wand you will have to get used to maneuvering it differently from the clipped wands and not get burned but the lower heat combined with even heat distribution sure makes the experience quicker and easier.  I do wish they had included a case but I really think this iron is worth the money.f the Sedu (especially with a lower temperature), but whatever it is it works better than the Bed Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glove provided was identical to the one provided with the Bed Head and it allowed me to make contact with the barrel long enough to curl my hair without feeling like I&#x27;m on fire.

            <li> This curling iron really delivers as promised... and more. The high heat setting is perfect for tight spiral curls on long hair. Unlike many other high end irons, on the highest heat you get just enough for great curl, but not too much to risk burn (oh, we all know that smell, girls! ugh!). And, losing the clip really does give better curls and waves. The glove is really clever and allows you to get the curl all the way to the bottom of each length of hair without burning your fingers. Now... you have to be careful, as this glove is not Asbestos, but you can be a little more aggressive in winding your hair down to the ends for sure. I really like the little \\&quot;kick stand\\&quot; as well, and also the auto shut off feature (which you can disable if needed). The only thing that I&#x27;d love to see is a longer barrel. It is a little short for very long hair. but other than that small nit, I really love this iron and how it makes gorgeous waves and curls in longer hair.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loved this gift for this Christmas! Works great/fast and holds a curl for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipless curling iron in the 25mm size and I love it! I couldn&#x27;t stop looking at my hair!! When considering this wand and the size.. I was concerned not only about the size and that it would only give me tight curls but that it wouldn&#x27;t even get hot enough to produce curls and wow, I was wrong!  The best part is it only takes about 10 - 15 seconds per curl ( I put a lot of hair on the wand so it may not be that long for you ?? )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a curling iron and I actually went out to buy the \\&quot;old school\\&quot; spring curling iron but before I left I decided to do a review on the clipless / wand curling irons and I&#x27;m glad I did.  As for my hair type, it&#x27;s naturally curly (mix of african american/caucasion hair), long ( 2 or more inches past my bra line ) and just knowing how difficult it can be to get my hair to do something (other than what I don&#x27;t want it to do ) I was overly surprised that the Sedu wand worked so well.  The size is perfect...the curl size is really all about: 1) how much hair you wrap around the wand  ( youtube the steps to show you how to curl with the Sedu clipless iron ) 2) how tight you pull your hair around the wand and 3) how long you hold the wand in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go, the curl will hold for a few days.. I&#x27;ve curled it before going out for a walk ( my walk time is usually for an hr or so in this N.C. summer heat ) and upon my return I still had curls.. a little wind blown but w/ curls still holding on and that was w/o using any product of any kind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sedu is a winner in my book!!</li>
            <li> Great clipless curling iron. Curls stay in all day. Heats up quickly and has an extra long cord. Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> I recently ordered one of these in hopes that it would work on my shoulder length hair. It doesn&#x27;t produce the curls I was hoping for since my hair is short.  However, I LOVE the way it curls my sister&#x27;s hair - she has long hair (about bra length).  It gives her those loose, beachy waves.  The curls last forever too.  Just be careful because it is super easy to get burned with this wand.  I can&#x27;t stand trying to use the glove. It over complicates the entire process.  I think the smaller barrel size (19mm) would have been better for me but I&#x27;m still glad I purchased this one.  I can use it when I grow my hair out or wear my hair extensions.  Either way, great curling wand!</li>
            <li> Great iron, it produces soft &amp; shiny curls every time and doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily, but with the Sedu my curls or waves last all day &amp; I can sleep on them and be good to go the next day too.</li>
            <li> Was recommend it to me from a celebrity hair stylish, from Sally Hersberger downtown dalon in Manhattan, and is the best buy ever, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After doing the research on the various curling wands available because of the type of hair that I have: Thick, Curly, Coarse hair, I thought I would give this one a try.  I&#x27;m so happy by the results and I can&#x27;t wait to try this on my daughter&#x27;s hair being that she has thick, straight, hard to curl hair.  I imagine that this will be successful on her as well.  Would definitely recommend, it is worth the $$$ I spent for it.</li>
            <li> My sister got the 25mm curling iron for me and I can&#x27;t stop using it.  My co-worker (who has naturally straight hair) wanted to give it a try because she had never tried a clipless iron (neither had i), so I brought it to work for her to try on some down time.  Long story short, she fell in love and ordered one THAT day.  Her hair curls differently than mine because it is so straight naturally - she gets more of voluminous waves, which are beautiful.  Mine gives me tight ringlets if i want them, or loose curls (i opt for these).  The only thing i would warn about is that if you don&#x27;t use the heat resistant glove, you may burn yourself a few times until you get used to it.  If you&#x27;re worried about that, just use the glove!! Check out some youtube video reviews if you still have any questions.  If you&#x27;re reading reviews and wondering if it works.....yes....it does EXACTLY what it says it will do.  It gets extremely hot (so use heat protectant on your hair) and it leaves beautiful results!</li>
            <li> I use this curler occasionally when I dress up, and it&#x27;s the only one that&#x27;s never left dents in my hair.  A few things to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You&#x27;re supposed to hold it upside down and with the opposite hand of the side you&#x27;re curling.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It gets very hot.  I burned my neck a couple of times (not the iron&#x27;s fault I&#x27;m just way better with a flat iron than with a curler).&lt;br /&gt;3. It comes with a protective glove, use the glove!  It goes on the hand that&#x27;s not holding the curler.&lt;br /&gt;4. If it annoys you to use the curler in the opposite hand over your head, then you can hold it upside down with the same hand as the side you&#x27;re curling (I do this).  It&#x27;s just a little more tricky.  You still want to hold the iron upside down though.&lt;br /&gt;5. Low setting is for fine hair, medium and high settings are for more coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;6. It has an automatic setting when you turn it on, which prevents you from using high setting.  Press and hold the higher setting for a few seconds and it will release the automatic setting.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this wand but I do not think I have the right hair for it. My hair is VERY thick and it did not curl as easily as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast! Love it!</li>
            <li> My first impression was how sleek and polished it looks. Immediately, I know this is no cheap product (despite the cost). When I picked it up, I was surprised to see how lightweight it was. I was able to hold it in my hands throughout my whole styling process. It gave me beautiful curls after only 10 seconds in my hair. I tried it for 5 seconds and the result was soft, luscious waves--something I could not seem to achieve with a regular iron with clips. The heat is distributed evenly so there&#x27;s nothing to worry about heat damage on your hair. However, it can burn skin. People only complain about this product mainly because they are not used to using just a wand, so they burn themselves very easily. This iron gets very hot very fast, so please be careful and use the glove it comes with. Minimal protection is better than no protection at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: weight, size, sleek look, swivel cord, auto-shut off, easy to use, AND IT MAKES WONDERFUL WAVES/CURLS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: ...it can burn my skin?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it it as much as I thought I would.  Nothing at all wrong with the product; just more time consuming without the clip.</li>
            <li> I would buy 100 more of these curling irons if I could afford it. Makes perfect waves and curls.. Kind of wish I could make it just a tiny bit wider. But the Iron itself is very nice! It has a long cord, which I love!. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts me a long time. I also bought the 1.5&amp;#34; iron.. but that seems a bit wide for my length hair. Overall I would reccomend this to others time and time again.</li>
            <li> I really love the curls that this iron creates. I haven&#x27;t had any other curling iron before so I cannot do any comparisons. I&#x27;ve had it for a week now and I used it couple of times. So far, I am so happy and my hair looks healthy with no split ends and I haven&#x27;t used any heat protectors.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! All the other positive reviews are true!!! Ditto ditto ditto&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering a second one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Despite trying multiple settings, this product does not curl effectively and what little shape it produces does not last. Shame.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I love it, I looked around for a curling iron and found this one. I have never been able to get the curls I want with the traditional clip iron, however this one gives you  just the look you want without the fish trails and tangled hair. It gets very hot and I have already burned myself a milllion times, USE THE HEAT GLOVE! I would also recommend getting some kind of heat puch for it so that you don&#x27;t ruin it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my daughter for her dance competitions. I hated having to use heat on her hair, so I thought I&#x27;d spend the money and use it. Boy was I glad! One of the other fellow dance moms purchased a $30 Con-Air one. It actually heated up quicker than mine and did it&#x27;s job faster, however, her daughter&#x27;s hair is so damaged while my daughter&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even look it has ever had any heat to it. They both have thick, dark hair, and we used the same hair product, so I&#x27;m sure it was the quality of the iron that determined the damage to the hair. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but so worth it!</li>
            <li> this is the only curler that leaves my curls in. best curler out there!</li>
            <li> All the reviews are true. Its the best hair styling product I have ever purchased. I have lots of hair, but thin. With a medium heat setting I curl my entire head in 7 strands, 5-10 min. With a curl prepping product the curls last 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Worth the extra few $$$ in comparison to other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER. SHE TELLS ME SHE LIKES IT.  THE BOX DID NOT HAVE ANT INSTRUCTIONS BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO WATCH A YOU TUBE VIDEO ON HOW IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Sedu flat iron 2 years ago on Amazon and it is still going strong with use at least 3 times per week so I expected nothing less with the curling iron, I was not disappointed. Sedu thinks about everything, from a nice long swivel cord to the heat-resistant glove as the barrel gets very hot (I burned my ear the first time I used it). The product is packaged beautifully and is the best curling iron I have ever used. It takes a few tries before you get the hang of it but soon it becomes easy to style hair in the way you want, be it light, bouncy waves or tighter curls, I would recommend it to anyone looking for soft waves that remain shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Had to get used to using it, but once I did, I love the curls!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use - great curls effortlessly and easy to travel with. The glove is a must when using on your hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Conair curling iron but it never got hot enough to really curl my hair. This one does the job beyond words, it heats up almost instantly and I can do my whole head in 30 minutes resulting in curls that last for days. I think part of the reason for the efficiency is that the hair slides off the clipless barrel so easily without tangle. However, this thing gets VERY hot and even with the protective mitten you can still hurt yourself if you use it too close to your face. I&#x27;ve burned myself on the jawline, forehead and my wrist, luckily the burns did not leave visible scars. It&#x27;s better to wear long sleeves when using this iron to protect your arms</li>
