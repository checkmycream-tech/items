            <li>This really  good  cream.</li>
            <li>Feels good...</li>
            <li>This is good anti-aging cream/moisturizer, but the cleanser they make is PHENOMENAL!</li>
            <li>Well,gotta be honest,I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Rich, soothing product that feels great on the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find one that I can REALLY see results from.</li>
            <li>Finally i found best creams for me.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is too sticky, it made my face oily, whenever i used this i&#x27;ve notice that my wrinkles became more vissible</li>
            <li>Price was ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>great product - really have noticed a reduction in fine lines (I also bought the eye serum).  </li>
            <li>USAGE, I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED A MORE YOUTHFUL NATURAL FEEL TO MY FACE,NOT</li>
            <li>You have to put it on lightly.</li>
            <li>Great face cream, but 1 oz is not enough.</li>
            <li>I have found no other moisturizer works as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but rich.</li>
            <li>Please remember also ladies to take a potent multi-vitamin as I&#x27;m sure this is also helping my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I use same company eye cream  and face cleanser all works good.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I have been having trouble with breakouts and this is working well,</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of this at TJ Maxx and as most people know thier products change quite frequently</li>
            <li>Bought this at Sears the 1st time and should have known nothing good would come from it; nothing is the operative word and although very inexpensive, save your pennies for something that actually works.</li>
            <li>Is a good product for the money but a little sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different projects.  </li>
            <li>I think I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a fair review.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but when I receive it, the bottle was out of the package and the bottle cap was loose and some of the product leaked out.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference on both fine lines and deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>You not gonna  see fast result  </li>
            <li>Really smooths the skin.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement on wrinkles, however i will wait another month to make a decision.</li>
            <li>I really like the results from using this product</li>
            <li>really look younger.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>no iritation, not sticky, if you let it completely sink in before applying make-up and does not clog pores, and has only a slight pleasant fragrance, I will definatly purchase again and I&#x27;m getting some now before I run out.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results on the wrinkles, but so far, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>far from it!</li>
            <li>This is,for me,the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually delivers on its promise.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be a pump action cream, but the entire top was not on tight.  </li>
            <li>If you want real results in same price range, check out alpha hydrox products but a word of caution....</li>
            <li>AT BED TIME.&lt;br /&gt;IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND SMOOTH INSTEAD OF HEAVY AND GREASY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they may only carry one of a certain item, so when I went back</li>
            <li>Full of hope and promises,and ultimately letting me down...</li>
            <li>I first tried this on a lark,thinking well,it will probably be just like any other &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I had some pretty dark scarring on one side of this area,and used a lot of cover-up on it.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ve spent more money,on worse things!!</li>
            <li> a few days later they were out!</li>
            <li> Big waste of my money!</li>

            <li> Any product in which the 1st ingredient listed begins with H2O is not worth your while, unless you are truly buying water to drink folks!</li>
            <li> It firms skin immediately and provides a smooth base for application of foundation.  </li>

            <li> NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This stuff is too expensive to be so poorly delivered.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me,now I feel like I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>

            <li> Is a good product for the money but a little sticky. You have to put it on lightly. Good to use at night time or whenever you don&#x27;t have to put on makeup, so as to not clog pores.  A good price at Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different projects.  I&#x27;m so happy to find one that I can REALLY see results from.</li>
            <li> great product - really have noticed a reduction in fine lines (I also bought the eye serum).  Been using for about 3 months and think it works great!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this at TJ Maxx and as most people know thier products change quite frequently and they may only carry one of a certain item, so when I went back a few days later they were out! This is a great product, I have been having trouble with breakouts and this is working well, no iritation, not sticky, if you let it completely sink in before applying make-up and does not clog pores, and has only a slight pleasant fragrance, I will definatly purchase again and I&#x27;m getting some now before I run out. Please remember also ladies to take a potent multi-vitamin as I&#x27;m sure this is also helping my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works.  When I opened it and tried to use it, the bottle just fell apart on me.  It is supposed to be a pump action cream, but the entire top was not on tight.  I had to throw it away since it was drying out and I had nothing else to put it in.  Big waste of my money!</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying this and I stated before I like the way this moisturizer works for me will be ordering again and looking hopefully it comes in a larger bottle</li>
            <li> I USE THE ANTI-AGING MOISTURIZER MORNING AND NIGHT AT BED TIME.&lt;br /&gt;IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND SMOOTH INSTEAD OF HEAVY AND GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;SINCE USAGE, I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED A MORE YOUTHFUL NATURAL FEEL TO MY FACE,NOT TOO DRY OR OILY.</li>
            <li> Great face cream, but 1 oz is not enough. Need to sell larger bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best under makeup cream I have found.</li>
            <li> This really  good  cream. I use same company eye cream  and face cleanser all works good. You not gonna  see fast result  .I use about  6 month and i have  no wrinkles. Finally i found best creams for me.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice moisturizer.  Lightweight, but rich. Really smooths the skin.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results on the wrinkles, but so far, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon. I have found no other moisturizer works as good as this one. Keeps all wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Sears the 1st time and should have known nothing good would come from it; nothing is the operative word and although very inexpensive, save your pennies for something that actually works. Surgical alternative as they claim? .....far from it! Any product in which the 1st ingredient listed begins with H2O is not worth your while, unless you are truly buying water to drink folks! If you want real results in same price range, check out alpha hydrox products but a word of caution....they work so well that you need to build up tolerance, and please please please, ALWAYS wear sunscreen with these or any products!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this on a lark,thinking well,it will probably be just like any other &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; serum.Full of hope and promises,and ultimately letting me down...Well,gotta be honest,I LOVE this stuff! This is,for me,the first product I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually delivers on its promise.I can&#x27;t believe the difference on both fine lines and deep wrinkles.Especially my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;,between my eyes,and my nasal-labial folds.I had some pretty dark scarring on one side of this area,and used a lot of cover-up on it.Now I don&#x27;t use any,other than basic foundation over my entire face.I had never used a retinol product b4.Now,at least with this product,I know what  the press is all about! Unfortunately for me,now I feel like I can&#x27;t be without it.But considering what some stuff costs,this is cheap,compared.I&#x27;m not saying it will work for everyone,but for me,it&#x27;s da bomb!! Try it.You&#x27;ve spent more money,on worse things!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is too sticky, it made my face oily, whenever i used this i&#x27;ve notice that my wrinkles became more vissible so it doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It firms skin immediately and provides a smooth base for application of foundation.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement on wrinkles, however i will wait another month to make a decision.</li>
            <li> This products doesn&#x27;t have Retinol in the ingredients... Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Isododecane, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Glyceryl Stearate, Potassium Palmitoyl Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cetearyl Alchohol, PEG-100 Stearate, Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline, Hydrolyzed Lola Implexa Extract</li>
            <li> Love the product, but when I receive it, the bottle was out of the package and the bottle cap was loose and some of the product leaked out.  This stuff is too expensive to be so poorly delivered.  NOT HAPPY.</li>
            <li> It feels creamy but it hasn&#x27;t helped any.  I have not finished the bottle yet.  I wanted to finish my other face&lt;br /&gt;cream before I started this one.  I think I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a fair review.</li>
            <li> I really like the results from using this product</li>
            <li> Rich, soothing product that feels great on the face.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  WILL REODER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Amazing,&lt;br /&gt;I really look younger.&lt;br /&gt;Best and fastest results ever.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 65, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot if products.</li>
            <li> Was delivered  on time. Price was ok.</li>
            <li> Great service, great product!</li>
            <li> This product was not right for me.  It went on well, but it did not improve my skin.  I could not recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is good anti-aging cream/moisturizer, but the cleanser they make is PHENOMENAL!</li>
            <li> Feels good... Still waiting for my youthfull look to return though...</li>
            <li> This product really works. If you use it as directed you will see a difference. I love it. And the eye cream is great too!</li>
