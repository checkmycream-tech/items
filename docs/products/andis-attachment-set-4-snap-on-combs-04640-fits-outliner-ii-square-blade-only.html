            <li>the other 3 attachments fit snug and perfect although they do pull hair like a Mfer lol....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely buy them again, knowing what I know now, but just be prepared to move those blades forward a bit to get the best trim out of these guards.</li>
            <li>These guards are perfect for trimming and cleaning up any facial hair.</li>
            <li>Its okay, does the job.</li>
            <li>The perfect attachments for my Andis hair trimmer,  enough choices for my needs.</li>
            <li>comb.&lt;br /&gt;This can happen, but I believe there should be more of a selection.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have to rate these at 3 stars or &#x27;&#x27;ok&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>, i am glad i made this purchase.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;ll clean it up nice, after that make sure u oil it.</li>
            <li>I cant fine another set with any more.</li>
            <li>but these were supposed to fit mine and they aren&#x27;t as well fitting</li>
            <li>take it easy&#x27;&#x27; when trimming your beard up....</li>
            <li>I mostly got the outliner II trimmer to trim the bottom edge of my mustache because it has a narrower blade than a full size trimmer.  </li>
            <li>They work fine</li>
            <li>It fits and works fine</li>
            <li>I have the outlinerII and he has that, the &#x27;outliner T&#x27; which is cool for the face more accurate but cant/</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>The combs fit well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with all plastic combs where the clip gradully weakened until the combs wouldn&#x27;t stay securely on the clippers.  </li>
            <li>I have to adjust the guard so that it would fit my clippers.  </li>
            <li>When I got the guard I had to adjust and trim the guards so that they would fit.  </li>
            <li>I did ask Andis if they had a shorter comb that fit and was told &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;,  No complaints.</li>
            <li>AndThe combs fit the Outliner Ii Square Blade</li>
            <li>That being said, I am not 100% sure the Andis clippers are exactly made for attachments.  </li>
            <li>I needed these clips for my  Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer and they fit and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good product for grooming facial hair.</li>
            <li>If you want longer or something you need to get these full size metal/plat/chrome looking ones that are about $100 maybe</li>
            <li>I have the Andis Outliner II edger blade and with these attachments, I can do a full haircut and style with this one blade.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was quick too.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for that and trims really close.  </li>
            <li>Cuts evenly and comes in the right sizes.</li>
            <li>the price was right and the arrived on time</li>
            <li>They could include bigger ones in the package, but they are ok.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that for that it sucked.</li>
            <li>I double checked to make sure that these guards were made for my clippers.  </li>
            <li>The first set lasted almost 4 years.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, too!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they advertise that they should do.</li>
            <li>First off the company took almost 2 weeks to send them</li>
            <li>my first shave</li>
            <li>The sizes are a good selection for reasonable beard lengths and they aren&#x27;t nearly as pointy and sharp as the combs for the Andis Master Clipper.  </li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>The only available addons for the Andis Outliner II.</li>
            <li>It really pulled my beard hairs.</li>
            <li>its a bit too much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted these cause</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second they just didn&#x27;t fit my needs &amp; the combs are too long, so I gave them away.</li>
            <li>is the ONLY set of combs available as far as I know for the Outliner II.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these liners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the seller and the attachments for those who need Andis accessories.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>No negative comments about this product.  </li>
            <li>other than that they work fine</li>
            <li>My beard is huge in a few days.</li>
            <li>Just note that the trimmer they are for isn&#x27;t really made for what you use these blades for so it does take extra time and on occasion they do cause pulling.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap razors and clippers from the store.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product 3 stars because I require blades that give a much closer shave as I do not wear too much facial hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Middle Eastern and have thick dense hair and it works ok w me,</li>
            <li>You can fade your beard, cut down your mustache, or keep just the right amount of hair on your chin strap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ensure the guard is on properly and tried every conceivable angle of trimming.  </li>
            <li>A good price for these, but after using them on my beard a couple times the cutter started yanking hair out instead of cutting.</li>
            <li>the pieces are loose and have a very loud rattle when the shaver is turned on.</li>
            <li>a complete unit for dry shaving, beard trimming and line ups.</li>
            <li>because first off the 1/4 attachment does not fit properly on your clippers, but does work if you know what you&#x27;re doing and</li>

            <li> a complete unit for dry shaving, beard trimming and line ups.</li>
            <li> because first off the 1/4 attachment does not fit properly on your clippers, but does work if you know what you&#x27;re doing and</li>
            <li> The attachments fit well, but I was expecting the smallest size to be much smaller so that they can trim down beards or facial hair to a really small size.</li>
            <li> For now, I just use my old clippers (w/ its combs) to trim my beard down low but use the Outliner (w/o comb) to edge and get stubble.</li>
            <li> The smallest one is still to thick for me - not suitable for trimming your beard unless you are ZZ TOP.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used em yet but the metal clipping keep em in place, sturdy, may last long like expected.</li>
            <li> so I tried several other of the clips and they worked</li>
            <li> If I put it on, as other reviewers have said, it snags me constantly.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to trim your beard down too low, these may work for you, but if you like that look, you may need to figure something else out</li>
            <li> Working For My Machine Not Much To Say Am Not A barber Trying To Save Some Greens And Lost Time.</li>
            <li> The set is minimal.</li>
            <li> It does what is expected.</li>
            <li> Not as durable as i expected</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve figured out that you have to cut a little, then pull back, cut a little, then pull back, going just a little farther each time</li>
            <li> The smallest one isn&#x27;t small enough for a shadow.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;ve used other trimmer/comb combinations without this issue.</li>
            <li> (I order other set of combs &amp; clipper and received them both within in 3 days...</li>
            <li> Not the T shaped blade but the other one.</li>
            <li> They work but the plastic points are sharp and hurt.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a sharp cut w/o having to use other clippers!</li>
            <li> If you use a Hair Cutting blade with the Outliner edger, you can do any cut out there right now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably take my sander to them like I did with my Master Clipper combs, but these will require significantly less modification.</li>
            <li> even a lil less on sale.</li>
            <li> but it was missing one guard.</li>
            <li> These did not fit my andis.</li>
            <li> This is a problem I have never had using the plain Outliner II.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do not fit the Andis clippers I recently bought.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this attachment will mess yo face up son.  </li>
            <li> The snap-on combs are really hard plastic, with metal clips, and once you snap those buggahs on, they won&#x27;t move a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I felt a few painful tugs, like one every 5 seconds or so, where I finally removed the attachment and just estimated the length by hand.  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong with the design cause beard trimming with these guys was not fun.  </li>
            <li> Not a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> It is frustrating that I cannot use my preferred size but its not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> The hair-pulling becomes incredibly painful and makes beard trimming slow and difficult.</li>
            <li> Also snags your hair while you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
            <li> Very painful to use these.</li>

            <li> Stable and works well with the Andis Trimmer. Cuts evenly and comes in the right sizes. Good product for grooming facial hair.</li>
            <li> These attachments are excellent quality, snap on perfectly, and hold on to the Andis clippers masterfully.  That being said, I am not 100% sure the Andis clippers are exactly made for attachments.  If you take apart the clippers and move the blade forward a bit it helps out substantially.  These attachments work very well, but you will find yourself going over areas a few times to ensure that all of your beard is trimmed to the same length.  You do not have to worry at all about the guards moving, shifting, or anything like that.  The snap-on combs are really hard plastic, with metal clips, and once you snap those buggahs on, they won&#x27;t move a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy them again, knowing what I know now, but just be prepared to move those blades forward a bit to get the best trim out of these guards.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these as an addition to the Outliner II that I recently bought. As a matter of fact, they are the reason why I bought the Outliner II vs. the T-Outliner. The combs fit well but I wish they was one that cut lower so I can have my beard thinner. For now, I just use my old clippers (w/ its combs) to trim my beard down low but use the Outliner (w/o comb) to edge and get stubble. If you don&#x27;t need to trim your beard down too low, these may work for you, but if you like that look, you may need to figure something else out like I had to do!</li>
            <li> A good price for these, but after using them on my beard a couple times the cutter started yanking hair out instead of cutting. I thought it was the clippers so I tried several other of the clips and they worked so I deduced it was that specific size of the attachments. It is frustrating that I cannot use my preferred size but its not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> These guards are perfect for trimming and cleaning up any facial hair. You can fade your beard, cut down your mustache, or keep just the right amount of hair on your chin strap. I highly recommend these liners.</li>
            <li> About as good as clipper attachments go. I don&#x27;t recall my andis clipper model number but these were supposed to fit mine and they aren&#x27;t as well fitting as I think they should be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know they made these! Not only can I shave, but now I dont need another set of clippers to keep my goatee maintained!</li>
            <li> They work fine but I would have liked to have more attachments.  I cant fine another set with any more.</li>
            <li> It fits and works fine</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 3 stars because I require blades that give a much closer shave as I do not wear too much facial hair. However, for those who rock shades and such, I think they will be quite suited to shape and maintain those styles.</li>
            <li> I use these on my Outliner II for beard trimming.  The sizes are a good selection for reasonable beard lengths and they aren&#x27;t nearly as pointy and sharp as the combs for the Andis Master Clipper.  However, they are still a bit pointy and poke/jab your skin on occasion.  I&#x27;ll probably take my sander to them like I did with my Master Clipper combs, but these will require significantly less modification.</li>
            <li> Wish they were offered in something that does not break</li>
            <li> Great delivery time , as advertised .</li>
            <li> These are the real deal. With the 4 attachments for the Outliner II you&#x27;re beard is set. If you want longer or something you need to get these full size metal/plat/chrome looking ones that are about $100 maybe even a lil less on sale. I&#x27;m Middle Eastern and have thick dense hair and it works ok w me, My beard is huge in a few days. so... and my homie who&#x27;s a barber is a brother that hooks up fades and facial hair to all the dudes around the hood. Like up to 10 a day. I have the outlinerII and he has that, the &#x27;outliner T&#x27; which is cool for the face more accurate but cant/wont take any attachments, and da big $100 chrome ones, that has a gang of attachments.  You gotta oil em every coupla days to once a week and you can take off the blade and push it up a tiny bit for a closer shave and can brush the inside. Also fill a cap of rubbing alcohol and put the corner/edge of the clippers in the cap of alcohol and turn it on. That&#x27;ll clean it up nice, after that make sure u oil it. Durable! But i dunno abt their $10 dollar ones. Yea man the prices on Amazon are the same price as the wholesaler we buy them from. Where fades and fancy facial hair are bein hooked up, theyre using Andis&#x27;. And Amazon got em for the wholesaler price!</li>
            <li> These are rubbish. I got them to trim my facial hair, they cause the clippers to pull your hair though. They are unuseable....if thats a word..</li>
            <li> The smallest one is still to thick for me - not suitable for trimming your beard unless you are ZZ TOP.</li>
            <li> The only available addons for the Andis Outliner II. The smallest one isn&#x27;t small enough for a shadow. If I put it on, as other reviewers have said, it snags me constantly. It does not make for a good experience. I&#x27;ll have to find a different razor if this is all they have to offer.</li>
            <li> They could include bigger ones in the package, but they are ok.  No negative comments about this product.  They have very good quality.</li>
            <li> I mostly got the outliner II trimmer to trim the bottom edge of my mustache because it has a narrower blade than a full size trimmer.  It works fine for that and trims really close.  I also bought a set of the attachment combs for trimming my beard.  At first I thought that for that it sucked. It really pulled my beard hairs. So I was going to advise skipping the comb attachments. By the way, I&#x27;ve used other trimmer/comb combinations without this issue. However I&#x27;ve figured out that you have to cut a little, then pull back, cut a little, then pull back, going just a little farther each time, it solves that problem.  You may or may not be able to tell from the photo but the clips that hold the combs onto the trimmer are metal which is very good.  I&#x27;ve had a problem with all plastic combs where the clip gradully weakened until the combs wouldn&#x27;t stay securely on the clippers.  I don&#x27;t think that will happen with these.</li>
            <li> Its okay, does the job. But the difference between the shortest one and zero(no combs) its a bit too much.</li>
            <li> I have to adjust the guard so that it would fit my clippers.  I double checked to make sure that these guards were made for my clippers.  When I got the guard I had to adjust and trim the guards so that they would fit.  I don&#x27;t recommend these guards at all.</li>
            <li> Working For My Machine Not Much To Say Am Not A barber Trying To Save Some Greens And Lost Time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase as they arrived at time and they fit perfectly. Highly recommend the seller and the attachments for those who need Andis accessories.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Delivery was quick too.  I did ask Andis if they had a shorter comb that fit and was told &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;,  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these. The first set lasted almost 4 years. They snap on and stay in place.</li>
            <li> I received item on time...but it was missing one guard. It had 2 of the same size. 2, 1/4 and no 1\8 th. And that was the guard needed.</li>
            <li> This kit made my razor usable for trimming my goatee. Lots of choices for depth and they click on solidly. Very inexpensive, too!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy. Wish they came with the product. I haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet, but they do what they are suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Great item, really good fit and High Quality material! Buy with confidense</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used em yet but the metal clipping keep em in place, sturdy, may last long like expected. Yes!</li>
            <li> They get the job done.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR SOME TIME NOW.</li>
            <li> The perfect attachments for my Andis hair trimmer,  enough choices for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as advertised!!!</li>
            <li> AndThe combs fit the Outliner Ii Square Blade well. I did not notice an pulling when using them. The set is minimal. Shorter combs need to be added to the set. However it goes the job/</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do not fit the Andis clippers I recently bought.</li>
            <li> the pieces are loose and have a very loud rattle when the shaver is turned on. other than that they work fine</li>
            <li> These did not fit my andis. I really wanted these cause I wanted a sharp cut w/o having to use other clippers!</li>
            <li> Just bought these to go with my Andis Outliner II. Great value, makes the Outliner II a complete unit for dry shaving, beard trimming and line ups. Get em!!!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they advertise that they should do. Just note that the trimmer they are for isn&#x27;t really made for what you use these blades for so it does take extra time and on occasion they do cause pulling. Just a trait of using these on this trimmer nothing of fault with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. it block hair to be cut. It was a waist of money. F--</li>
            <li> It does what is expected. I would recommend these attachments to anyone who has purchased Andis Outliner II Trimmer.  These should last a while too.</li>
            <li> Package contained two 1/4 inch and no 3/8 inch comb.&lt;br /&gt;This can happen, but I believe there should be more of a selection.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY set of combs available as far as I know for the Outliner II.</li>
            <li> First off the company took almost 2 weeks to send them (I order other set of combs &amp; clipper and received them both within in 3 days...no express rush either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second they just didn&#x27;t fit my needs &amp; the combs are too long, so I gave them away.</li>
            <li> The attachments fit well, but I was expecting the smallest size to be much smaller so that they can trim down beards or facial hair to a really small size.</li>
            <li> I would have to rate these at 3 stars or &#x27;&#x27;ok&#x27;&#x27; because first off the 1/4 attachment does not fit properly on your clippers, but does work if you know what you&#x27;re doing and you &#x27;&#x27;tweek&#x27;&#x27; your hands a lil bit....the other 3 attachments fit snug and perfect although they do pull hair like a Mfer lol....so you kind of gotta &#x27;&#x27;take it easy&#x27;&#x27; when trimming your beard up....But what can u expect from knock offs from China that cost $7 bucks... There is no Official Andis attachment for the Outliner II so you either go without or you buy these cheapies, thats what i did.</li>
            <li> For some reason these pull hair when trying trim a beard.  I&#x27;ve ensure the guard is on properly and tried every conceivable angle of trimming.  Very painful to use these.</li>
            <li> THESE SNAP ON COMBS ARE A NECESSARY COMPONENT FOR THE ANDIS OUTLINER SQUARE BLADE TRIMMER. VERY EASY TO USE AND A TRIMMING LENGTH TO SUIT YOUR DESIRED BEARD LENGTH.</li>
            <li> I use these to shave my pubs.</li>
            <li> I needed these clips for my  Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer and they fit and worked perfectly. Good product.</li>
            <li> they fit perfect i like them a lot, i am glad i made this purchase. the price was right and the arrived on time</li>
            <li> Not as durable as i expected</li>
            <li> fits my clipper perfectly ...love them</li>
            <li> Clips on sturdily to the Outliner II, but the attachments trap (beard) hair between the blade and the plastic. This is a problem I have never had using the plain Outliner II. The hair-pulling becomes incredibly painful and makes beard trimming slow and difficult.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this attachment will mess yo face up son.  This will pinch off those hairs till your eyes get watery.  5 stars if you are going to use these as an interrogation technique.</li>
            <li> Fits clipper as intended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I have the Andis Outliner II edger blade and with these attachments, I can do a full haircut and style with this one blade.  However, I do not recommend to do that.  If you use a Hair Cutting blade with the Outliner edger, you can do any cut out there right now.  Great product and great value.</li>
            <li> I got these and the outliner 2 trimmer and they fit perfectly. Not the T shaped blade but the other one.</li>
            <li> These fit my Andis outliners perfectly!! Now I&#x27;m able to keep my beard evenly groomed! A must have if you already have the liners!</li>
            <li> Those combs fit and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> They work but the plastic points are sharp and hurt.  Also snags your hair while you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap razors and clippers from the store. Get the Andis clippers with these attachments. Very happy and makes like a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Works great. Used it to shave my head!</li>
            <li> Let me put it this way.  ouch.  ouch and ouch.  Something is wrong with the design cause beard trimming with these guys was not fun.  my first shave and I felt a few painful tugs, like one every 5 seconds or so, where I finally removed the attachment and just estimated the length by hand.  Not a pleasant experience.  (can I return these used?).  I&#x27;m guessing not.</li>
