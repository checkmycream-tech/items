            <li>/&gt;Everytime I wearing it somebody makes a comments about what good smell and ask me what Im wearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that sweet and for me it is one of the best perfumes ever !</li>
            <li>I Love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>It will be ideal for people who love strong sweet/spicy fragrances.</li>
            <li>A very light smell, doesn&#x27;t over power</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t wearing fragrance more to please those around us?  </li>
            <li>I love it, and I have been using it for about 20 years, on and off, as a daytime scent.</li>
            <li>ok it was ok</li>
            <li>I simply love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Do not stayable, but smells pretty good</li>
            <li>100% original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sweet.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that this scent is very alluring and exotic, but too intense for the warm climate.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume based on reviews stating that the scent is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Very sexy and mysterious.</li>
            <li>By the way, right here they sell the tester version of this fragrance, so if you don&#x27;t care what the bottle looks like, I say to buy it.  </li>

            <li>It makes me feel very feminine.</li>
            <li>I used to love other Salvador Dali perfume when I was living in much colder climate.</li>
            <li>I especially like to spray it on right before bed</li>
            <li>Thanks God, it is still the original scent, unlike some others that do not come even close to what i remember from the past.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so fresh and long lasting</li>
            <li>It smells much stronger than expected and its definitely not something i would wear.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s true in my case.</li>

            <li> Also, the price here was almost half from the local mall rat  perfume supplier, who said Salvador had discontinued this line of perfume..</li>
            <li> This price is less than half of what it is sold for at stores anywhere, even online.  </li>
            <li> would agree with balsamic, but I don&#x27;t sense in it wood, or citrus, and definitely not sweet or fruit.</li>
            <li> Say no more.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to describe the fragrance.</li>

            <li> When I first met my husband for the first time, we went to the Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg,Florida.  The gift shop had some testers for fragrance and when I tried Laguna my then boyfriend said I smelled delicious!  Say no more.  Isn&#x27;t wearing fragrance more to please those around us?  This fragrance is so fresh and long lasting I can&#x27;t understand how they can call it an Eau De Toilette.  It should be called perfume.  I especially like to spray it on right before bed and when I wake up in the morning I can still smell this wonderful scent.  By the way, right here they sell the tester version of this fragrance, so if you don&#x27;t care what the bottle looks like, I say to buy it.  I discovered it after I placed my order, but know better for next time.  This price is less than half of what it is sold for at stores anywhere, even online.  Definitely try it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to describe the fragrance. I saw it described as:&lt;br /&gt;sweet&lt;br /&gt;woody&lt;br /&gt;citrus&lt;br /&gt;balsamic&lt;br /&gt;fruity&lt;br /&gt;I would agree with balsamic, but I don&#x27;t sense in it wood, or citrus, and definitely not sweet or fruit. In my mind, this fragrance is something of another universe, cannot be associated with anything we know in our life. I love it, and I have been using it for about 20 years, on and off, as a daytime scent. Thanks God, it is still the original scent, unlike some others that do not come even close to what i remember from the past.</li>
            <li> We receided this product  at the Garden Hotel  in perfect conditio ok it was ok I will recommend to may relatives and friends</li>
            <li> for 22 year I use this perfume, LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume! Very sexy and mysterious.This one is a must have for any collection!! And at this price,you cant lose!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s not that sweet and for me it is one of the best perfumes ever !</li>
            <li> 100% responsable el perfumes me llego en buen estado volver√≠a con este vendedor aaaaaaaa bb c d n d r</li>
            <li> It smells much stronger than expected and its definitely not something i would wear. But I should have sampled before buying so that was my fault.</li>
            <li> my all time favourite!</li>
            <li> Do not stayable, but smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Very good! 100% original.</li>
            <li> I simply love this perfume. It makes me feel very feminine. It&#x27;s light and sweet. without being overpowering. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to love other Salvador Dali perfume when I was living in much colder climate. I bought this perfume based on reviews stating that the scent is fresh and clean. I guess, tastes are different. My opinion is that this scent is very alluring and exotic, but too intense for the warm climate. At least it&#x27;s true in my case. It will be ideal for people who love strong sweet/spicy fragrances.</li>
            <li> It arrived even earlier! Excellent.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s fav bottle and its all she uses. A very light smell, doesn&#x27;t over power and I like it too. Also, the price here was almost half from the local mall rat  perfume supplier, who said Salvador had discontinued this line of perfume..hrrumpf</li>
            <li> Its fresh!&lt;br /&gt;Everytime I wearing it somebody makes a comments about what good smell and ask me what Im wearing.</li>
