            <li>It works and smells great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great unflavored, uncolored lip smoother.</li>
            <li>; they are great products.</li>
            <li>It has no scent or flavor either which is great.</li>
            <li>IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>These feel and smell great.</li>
            <li>This solved that because the stick wont move unless you remove the cap.. Great for anybody who keeps a stick in their pocket.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I love this chap stick, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Perfect great super superb,best product ever,great prices!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve struggled with good lip protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than any I&#x27;ve used (in a good way) and I like that.</li>
            <li>I also use an additional product if I plan to be out in the sun for a while, since this doesn&#x27;t have SPF (which is good for me, since I like to control when I use sunblock).</li>
            <li>good price too for 6.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost fragrance-free, but there&#x27;s a hint of something that smells good.    </li>
            <li>and I can never find a good chapstick that I don&#x27;t get \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was a good price</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Very potent lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip gloss!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>So glad I discovered that Nivea re-packaged it and sells Hydro Care as A Kiss of Moisture in the U.S.!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm of all time!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Really love this product!  </li>
            <li>My wife (and me :)) loves it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>If you like light lip balms that glide on and feel silky, as opposed to lip balms that are creamier or waxier, this is a great one.</li>
            <li>Purchased because of amazing reviews</li>
            <li>Amazingly moisturizing</li>
            <li>Nivea is fabulous and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>It really is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>It cost a great deal more, but was not any more effective than this.  </li>
            <li>I use nothing else, and yes i really own six tubes of this stuff (purchased separately...</li>
            <li>: Glides on nice.</li>
            <li>the best lip balm  and curative  really works  and wears well</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t effective in moisturizing my chapped lips in the winter.</li>
            <li>I keep this in the pocket of every jacket I own.</li>
            <li>Before I can use this lip balm I warm each of the tubes up to the point that the balm starts to almost melt (it becomes mushy).</li>
            <li>It is  one of the  best product on the market,  soft  and smooth and feels really good on the lips.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This by far the best I have used and continue to use.  </li>
            <li>This six pack is the best value for money I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>and this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light, unique smell/flavor.  </li>
            <li>It applies very smoothly, leaving your lips with a nice light feeling.  </li>
            <li>Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li>This is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>I love this, its not a gloss, its more like chapstick...</li>
            <li>Plus I love the container</li>
            <li>My daughters love it :-).</li>
            <li>For a while I haven&#x27;t found it at any store any more,so I&#x27;m glad amazon has it.</li>
            <li>I make sure I have one in my pocket before going out.  </li>
            <li>OK, but shipped as all lose pieces, not in the packaging as shown.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite -</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>It certainly is much better quality in every way over Chapstick.  </li>
            <li>I use this during the day and mostly at night as part of my beauty ritual.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a lip balm that is the be all and end all (probably doesn&#x27;t exist), but this is my favorite default lip balm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nivea moisture lip stuff for a while and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>bought a pack of six as this brand is our favorite and everybody wanted one.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>One of my most favorite drugstore lip balms.</li>
            <li>Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>More words words</li>
            <li>and soon they will crack more which causes you to put more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so it dries my lips out even more.</li>
            <li>I like this one better than any of the others in the Nivea lineup.</li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of lip balm (Blistex, Carmex, Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees) for many years.  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best lip moisturizer in the market!</li>
            <li>Some &amp;#34;chap sticks&amp;#34; leave your lips shiny, this does not, it&#x27;s more of a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, tinted women&#x27;s balms, lip glosses, chap sticks, ect...</li>
            <li>My parents and I are great fans and receiving the sticks in packs of 6 makes it very convenient for me-</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both fantastic!</li>
            <li>recommend this for people who truly care about their lips!  :)</li>
            <li>I purchased the set of six lip balms and it&#x27;s put my mind at ease about running out and not being able to find</li>
            <li>Perfect, simple lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I find this to work better.</li>
            <li>None better in my experience.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>At first I bought this because of the name - Nivea is really good with moisturizing lotions and stuff like that, so I thought their lipcare might be pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I keep mine in my pocket and it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; or rather softens slightly to a more vaseline-like consistency, which i find to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Goes on moist, offers great protection.</li>
            <li>is my favorite because of the smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a superior product and very</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer in a tube that I have found that I really love!</li>
            <li>Easy exchange and re-delivery.</li>
            <li>My lips felt better quickly and by the end of the day, they were almost healed.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a pack of this product today and will remain a loyal Nivea user!</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little bit cheaper, but it smell very good!!!</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing, non-irritating, free of fragrance, menthol,</li>
            <li>This one does not glide on as smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t have any sun protection in it.</li>
            <li>Gluten free as per company website.  </li>
            <li>I found myself loving it so much, I just gave away some of the sticks to people to try.</li>
            <li>My lips stay smooth.  </li>
            <li>it is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li>Keeps lips moist and free of chapping.</li>
            <li>this leaves your lips silky smooth and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>My Dr says the Bees Wax is an important part of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>A good idea unless you&#x27;re sensitive to them.  </li>
            <li>Goes on soft &amp; smooth and feels really good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I was buying &amp;#34;Sugar&amp;#34; at Sephora for $25 a pop, this works equally as well; no burning (very sensitive lips), no waxiness, just silky wonderful moisture.</li>
            <li>Larger size, easier to not lose or forget, feels nice and most importantly doesn&#x27;t cause my lips to burn and peel like some flavors of the Chapstick brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique design is a plus to.  </li>
            <li>I seem incapable of not losing these before they run out - so the bulk past is perfect.</li>
            <li>The product works great on dry lips and the tube lasts a while.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip care currently on the market.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this to see if it worked better based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I try to always keep extra on hand and one with me at all times, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>I have very chapped lips and have used many through the years.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip balm so much.</li>
            <li>they offer excellent protection, heal dry lips quickly, and leave your lips feeling moist and soft for hours.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it claims to be, pure, smooth moisture; I also love the wider, chunkier sticks.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and heals my lips quickly.</li>
            <li>Does a great job moisturizing day to day, but if my lips gets very chapped, this isn&#x27;t emollient enough.</li>
            <li>The whole blue part is the cap, kind of like a lipstick, very secure.</li>
            <li>suitable for men as well as women, and my 5 year old even has one.</li>
            <li>Most lip products have SPF which I am very sensitive too</li>
            <li>This is not always in stock at the stores where I normally shop, I very much appreciate being able to buy it in bulk at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It lasts all night, goes on smooth and is very silky.</li>
            <li>They go on gentle and smooth, without a waxy film.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite ChapStick I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>Either way I recommend getting it, completely worth buying.</li>
            <li>My favorite light, non-sunscreen, stick lip balm is Labello Hydro Care, which is sold only in Canada and Europe.</li>
            <li>its a great product, but its kind of expensive here at amazon, try walmart instead</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always empty at the grocery store and drug store because its so good.  </li>
            <li>I use this product regularly to keep my lips smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years, back when it was Labello-branded, and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Received this fast, packaging was very neat and everything was very clean.</li>
            <li>I was so right.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is just right.</li>
            <li>I put this on right away &amp; within a day</li>
            <li>It is super smooth and leaves lips feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips very smooth after a few days of use too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect blend of moisturizing without containing harsh ingredients such a menthol.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this when i was on accutane under the brand name labello, and it was the only thing that worked, and fabulously at that.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in the drugstores, so it&#x27;s great that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I love these and can not find them in my local stores.</li>
            <li>Love this chapstick and can only find it online</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips healthy, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO MANY different lip balms, sticks, glosses, etc.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my lips feel soft, supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm of all times and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  </li>
            <li>I remember spending more than 2 hour driving from store to store one day trying to find this stuff when my last stick was reaching the end.  </li>
            <li>As long as my lips aren&#x27;t peeling and cracking, especially at the corners, I&#x27;m usually pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at a Drug Store in the Asheville Mountains.</li>
            <li>I received my first tube in my Christmas stocking and it is now my lip balm of choice.</li>
            <li>it keeps my lips soft and smooth and hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li>The first pack I got was all cracked and damaged.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is protected in its sleeve, better than regular chap stick.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t believe there is a better lip moisturizer on the market...</li>
            <li>Good for everyday routine care.  </li>
            <li>This is way less smooth and more waxy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>the research I&#x27;ve read, what many people like about certain lip balms is actually just a gimmick that makes you think it&#x27;s doing something when in fact it&#x27;s actually causing your lips to crack more.</li>
            <li>IÂ´ve used it for various years and it works great when none of the other lip products work for me and trust me</li>
            <li>It has a sweet kinda floral scent, maybe an orangecicle and a soft floral note.</li>
            <li>I honestly have to say there is no other chapstick that can beat Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care.</li>
            <li>but I do live in the U.S., and maybe a European product will always be better.  </li>
            <li>The only downfall I have for it, that keeps it from being a five star is the fact that with even the tiniest amount of heat (such as in someones pocket) it melts rather quickly, even quicker then most chapsticks.</li>
            <li>This can be achieved by carrying it in your pants pocket for a few days or leaving it in a warm car out in the sun, after which you can bring it back indoors where the balm will cool and become firm again but apply much more smoothly.</li>
            <li>it does feel great putting it on, but then a few minutes later, it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li>This chapstick goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your lips look greasy like regular Chapstick brand does.   </li>
            <li>I bought a pack for the whole family and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my lips really well.  </li>
            <li>This product really keeps my lips moist at all times.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to very chapped lips.</li>
            <li>This is the only lip moisturizer on the market that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips in any way, but keeps them smooth, moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes as compared to those waxy products that you feel after application.</li>
            <li>You just gently put it on and that&#x27;s plenty.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing and protective to the lips.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and absorbs without leaving a waxy feel.</li>
            <li>Very moisture on the lips.  </li>
            <li>This also glides over your lips much easier.</li>
            <li>It worked so fast to help begin the healing of my cracked lips.</li>
            <li>I really like this chapstick and can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t survive the wash or dryer cycle very well.</li>
            <li>I will never use another lip balm again and I try to spread the word as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Thanks for always having this product in stock.  </li>
            <li>I learned it has a low melting point as It fell apart in globs when I took it out on the boat with me and left it in the warm cabin.  </li>
            <li>i just like the one i previously used better (also Nivea lip balm, but light blue in color on the cover) since that one has a very slight sweet scent which i really love.</li>
            <li>As a chapstick addict, I&#x27;ve tried many but this is very long lasting, mild smelling, and creamy.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my lips and seems to last longer than other glosses and chap stuff.</li>
            <li>especially after being in your pocket, it gets a little soft,&amp; just goes on your lips beautifully.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other lip balm.</li>
            <li>Your money would be much better spent on Burt Bees!</li>
            <li>This plain chapstick provides incredible moisture (some of the other styles don&#x27;t, including the SPF version).</li>
            <li>My lips get dry, chap and bleed regularly, so intense moisture is really important for me.</li>
            <li>My lips are fairly sensitive and this really help my lips!</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite lip care product.</li>
            <li>I know I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>For some reason it is hard to find in the drugstore - maybe it sells out right away - so I was glad that I could order six from Amazon and be stocked up for a while.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no overwhelming scent or taste, and does what it promises keeps my lips smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I do think there are other brands out there, but these are not bad for kids and for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the little bit more, especially since it comes in a 6 pack.  </li>
            <li>It sounds weird but smells great.</li>
            <li>It does not tingle or feel heavy, just a lovely supple and moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>My lips became dramatically more chapped and itchy after switching to this for a few days.  </li>
            <li>But this Nivea chapstick is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and after going through at least 6 tubes over the past years, it hasn&#x27;t stopped working.</li>
            <li>This Nivea Essential Lip Care is worth every penny -</li>
            <li>one for mom, another for dad, a stick to keep at my desk, another in my bag, a fresh spare to give to a guest to keep, and a final one for my mom to use on any damaged skin areas that aren&#x27;t the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly revives damaged, cracked, and chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li>I literally have one anywhere I&#x27;d be sitting for more than a few minutes at a time -- bedside, desk, car and I  </li>
            <li>These not only do not affect me in any way, but they manage to keep my lips super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Keeps your lips soft and will diffidently order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to sun block products and they seem to be in everything these days.  </li>
            <li>I am very allergic to lip products and even regular ol&#x27; Chapstick would work my lips into a fit of dry red itchiness.</li>
            <li>It still works great on your lips, but suffers from a fatal flaw: if you carry it around in your pocket like I do, the heat from being close to your body turns the product to mush.</li>
            <li>And the twisting mechanism never seems to break free from the center of the actual balm like it always did in my chapstick.</li>
            <li>After regular use, it really makes my lips feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>A year ago I read an article about secrets of professional makeup artists, and this product was listed as one of the &amp;#34;secrets&amp;#34; for keeping lips moist.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your lips soft.</li>
            <li>get a bit soft if I keep it in my pants pocket</li>
            <li>We have used it on my 2 years old son, and it keeps his lips moisture. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a young child, my family is from Germany amd</li>
            <li>Gives a shine and keeps them soft.</li>
            <li>I had been using a plain old advanced formula petroleum jelly product for years.  </li>
            <li>An important note, for me, the other \\&quot;A Kiss of .....\\&quot; blends by Nivea did not work well on my lips, only the \\&quot;A Kiss of MOISTURE.\\</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday lip balm for people who don&#x27;t have problems with serious chapping.</li>
            <li>We have tried other lip treatments, but have found this line does the job better than any other we have tried.</li>
            <li>Checked the ingredients in these tubes against the even older tube I had been using with no burning sensation amd found that the ingredients were the same.</li>
            <li>I think it smells mildly like black pepper (although nobody else agrees with me); it has no fruity flavour, no tint, nothing like that</li>
            <li>I believe others have the same idea as it is nearly always sold out at the department store in the town I live.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this at my local stores recently, they&#x27;ve only been carrying the other Nivea lip balms that are either scented or have sun protection.  </li>
            <li>my lips are back to normal.</li>
            <li>line up in ingredients - instead of the normal &amp;#34;main/major ingredients&amp;#34;, petroleum, water (which is actually the primary/major ingredient in a lot of lip care products - to which I did not know!), wax.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I bought the 3 pack offered in a drugstore once, and none of the other were as effective or as gentle on my lips as this one.&lt;br /&gt;The lip care stick itself is very, very faintly scented, it reminds me ever so slightly of fresh cucumbers, or something else very fresh and clean, but it is so faint</li>
            <li>I occasionally cannot find it in the stores where I live, so I looked on Amazon and, of course they had it.</li>
            <li>I live in mortal terror that this product will be discontinued so every time I find it in my local store, I buy all the sticks I can find.</li>
            <li>During the winter or during dry weather, I use this during the day and Aquaphor (the healing ointment, not the lip treatment) at night, and that works really well for me.</li>
            <li>and I buy enough to last the whole year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really stumped on what it is that is in the other lip care products I have purchased that doesn&#x27;t agree with my lips, but whatever it is, it is apparently not in this particular formula.</li>
            <li>It goes on extremely smooth and isn&#x27;t as hard, which is a plus when applying.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I use these often and the last box of 6 I got completely turned to mush and evaporated.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive lips so that if I use a regular lip product, my lips start to itch and peel.</li>
            <li>I actually makes your lips feel soft and moist without looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips soft and moist and I only need to apply it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>The name says it all -- &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34; I have been using this product for several years now and have yet to find anything that keeps my lips nearly as moisturized.</li>
            <li>but the more I put on the worse it got until I stopped and bought Alba chapstick which works</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of a kid&#x27;s glue stick and is different than the other Nivea lip balms which are a little more waxy.</li>
            <li>This lip moisturizer is a high quality product that is so helpful in preventing chapped and or dry lip.  </li>
            <li>When i first get a tube it seems hard, but after a few hours in the pocket...so smooth, never waxy or drying.</li>
            <li>Anyone who used the other stuff, try this, it really works to heal, moisturize, and give our lips the care they need.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s bees, carmex, chapstick, some other lesser known ones that were recommended and didn&#x27;t really care for any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works to keep desert dry lips soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The only lip balm that isn&#x27;t &#x27;addictive&#x27;, does not dry my lips out and actually heals my skin.</li>
            <li>Extremely disppointed in the new formula.</li>
            <li>I was really going crazy trying to find the dark blue kiss of moisture because it really works better than any of the other nivea products and has no color and flavor.  </li>

            <li> These feel and smell great.</li>

            <li> you&#x27;ve struggled with good lip protection.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than any I&#x27;ve used (in a good way) and I like that.</li>
            <li> I also use an additional product if I plan to be out in the sun for a while, since this doesn&#x27;t have SPF (which is good for me, since I like to control when I use sunblock).</li>
            <li> good price too for 6.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost fragrance-free, but there&#x27;s a hint of something that smells good.    </li>
            <li> and I can never find a good chapstick that I don&#x27;t get \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a good price</li>

            <li> So glad I discovered that Nivea re-packaged it and sells Hydro Care as A Kiss of Moisture in the U.S.!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Really love this product!  </li>
            <li> My wife (and me :)) loves it!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> If you like light lip balms that glide on and feel silky, as opposed to lip balms that are creamier or waxier, this is a great one.</li>
            <li> Purchased because of amazing reviews</li>
            <li> Amazingly moisturizing</li>
            <li> Nivea is fabulous and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> It really is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It cost a great deal more, but was not any more effective than this.  </li>
            <li> I use nothing else, and yes i really own six tubes of this stuff (purchased separately...</li>
            <li> : Glides on nice.</li>
            <li> the best lip balm  and curative  really works  and wears well</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t effective in moisturizing my chapped lips in the winter.</li>
            <li> I keep this in the pocket of every jacket I own.</li>
            <li> Before I can use this lip balm I warm each of the tubes up to the point that the balm starts to almost melt (it becomes mushy).</li>
            <li> It is  one of the  best product on the market,  soft  and smooth and feels really good on the lips.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This by far the best I have used and continue to use.  </li>
            <li> This six pack is the best value for money I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light, unique smell/flavor.  </li>
            <li> It applies very smoothly, leaving your lips with a nice light feeling.  </li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li> This is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I love this, its not a gloss, its more like chapstick...</li>
            <li> Plus I love the container</li>
            <li> My daughters love it :-).</li>
            <li> For a while I haven&#x27;t found it at any store any more,so I&#x27;m glad amazon has it.</li>
            <li> I make sure I have one in my pocket before going out.  </li>
            <li> OK, but shipped as all lose pieces, not in the packaging as shown.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite -</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> It certainly is much better quality in every way over Chapstick.  </li>
            <li> I use this during the day and mostly at night as part of my beauty ritual.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a lip balm that is the be all and end all (probably doesn&#x27;t exist), but this is my favorite default lip balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea moisture lip stuff for a while and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> bought a pack of six as this brand is our favorite and everybody wanted one.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> One of my most favorite drugstore lip balms.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> More words words</li>
            <li> and soon they will crack more which causes you to put more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so it dries my lips out even more.</li>
            <li> I like this one better than any of the others in the Nivea lineup.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of lip balm (Blistex, Carmex, Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees) for many years.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best lip moisturizer in the market!</li>
            <li> Some &amp;#34;chap sticks&amp;#34; leave your lips shiny, this does not, it&#x27;s more of a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, tinted women&#x27;s balms, lip glosses, chap sticks, ect...</li>
            <li> My parents and I are great fans and receiving the sticks in packs of 6 makes it very convenient for me-</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both fantastic!</li>
            <li> recommend this for people who truly care about their lips!  :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the set of six lip balms and it&#x27;s put my mind at ease about running out and not being able to find</li>
            <li> Perfect, simple lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I find this to work better.</li>
            <li> None better in my experience.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> At first I bought this because of the name - Nivea is really good with moisturizing lotions and stuff like that, so I thought their lipcare might be pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I keep mine in my pocket and it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; or rather softens slightly to a more vaseline-like consistency, which i find to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Goes on moist, offers great protection.</li>
            <li> is my favorite because of the smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a superior product and very</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer in a tube that I have found that I really love!</li>
            <li> Easy exchange and re-delivery.</li>
            <li> My lips felt better quickly and by the end of the day, they were almost healed.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a pack of this product today and will remain a loyal Nivea user!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit cheaper, but it smell very good!!!</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing, non-irritating, free of fragrance, menthol,</li>
            <li> This one does not glide on as smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t have any sun protection in it.</li>
            <li> Gluten free as per company website.  </li>
            <li> I found myself loving it so much, I just gave away some of the sticks to people to try.</li>
            <li> My lips stay smooth.  </li>
            <li> it is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and stays on for hours.  </li>
            <li> Keeps lips moist and free of chapping.</li>
            <li> this leaves your lips silky smooth and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> My Dr says the Bees Wax is an important part of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> A good idea unless you&#x27;re sensitive to them.  </li>
            <li> Goes on soft &amp; smooth and feels really good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I was buying &amp;#34;Sugar&amp;#34; at Sephora for $25 a pop, this works equally as well; no burning (very sensitive lips), no waxiness, just silky wonderful moisture.</li>
            <li> Larger size, easier to not lose or forget, feels nice and most importantly doesn&#x27;t cause my lips to burn and peel like some flavors of the Chapstick brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique design is a plus to.  </li>
            <li> I seem incapable of not losing these before they run out - so the bulk past is perfect.</li>
            <li> The product works great on dry lips and the tube lasts a while.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip care currently on the market.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this to see if it worked better based on the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I try to always keep extra on hand and one with me at all times, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I have very chapped lips and have used many through the years.  </li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much.</li>
            <li> they offer excellent protection, heal dry lips quickly, and leave your lips feeling moist and soft for hours.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it claims to be, pure, smooth moisture; I also love the wider, chunkier sticks.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and heals my lips quickly.</li>
            <li> Does a great job moisturizing day to day, but if my lips gets very chapped, this isn&#x27;t emollient enough.</li>
            <li> The whole blue part is the cap, kind of like a lipstick, very secure.</li>
            <li> suitable for men as well as women, and my 5 year old even has one.</li>
            <li> Most lip products have SPF which I am very sensitive too</li>
            <li> This is not always in stock at the stores where I normally shop, I very much appreciate being able to buy it in bulk at Amazon.</li>
            <li> It lasts all night, goes on smooth and is very silky.</li>
            <li> They go on gentle and smooth, without a waxy film.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite ChapStick I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> Either way I recommend getting it, completely worth buying.</li>
            <li> My favorite light, non-sunscreen, stick lip balm is Labello Hydro Care, which is sold only in Canada and Europe.</li>
            <li> its a great product, but its kind of expensive here at amazon, try walmart instead</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always empty at the grocery store and drug store because its so good.  </li>
            <li> I use this product regularly to keep my lips smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years, back when it was Labello-branded, and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Received this fast, packaging was very neat and everything was very clean.</li>
            <li> I was so right.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is just right.</li>
            <li> I put this on right away &amp; within a day</li>
            <li> It is super smooth and leaves lips feeling moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips very smooth after a few days of use too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect blend of moisturizing without containing harsh ingredients such a menthol.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this when i was on accutane under the brand name labello, and it was the only thing that worked, and fabulously at that.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the drugstores, so it&#x27;s great that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love these and can not find them in my local stores.</li>
            <li> Love this chapstick and can only find it online</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips healthy, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO MANY different lip balms, sticks, glosses, etc.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my lips feel soft, supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm of all times and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  </li>
            <li> I remember spending more than 2 hour driving from store to store one day trying to find this stuff when my last stick was reaching the end.  </li>
            <li> As long as my lips aren&#x27;t peeling and cracking, especially at the corners, I&#x27;m usually pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at a Drug Store in the Asheville Mountains.</li>
            <li> I received my first tube in my Christmas stocking and it is now my lip balm of choice.</li>
            <li> it keeps my lips soft and smooth and hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> The first pack I got was all cracked and damaged.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is protected in its sleeve, better than regular chap stick.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t believe there is a better lip moisturizer on the market...</li>
            <li> Good for everyday routine care.  </li>
            <li> This is way less smooth and more waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> the research I&#x27;ve read, what many people like about certain lip balms is actually just a gimmick that makes you think it&#x27;s doing something when in fact it&#x27;s actually causing your lips to crack more.</li>
            <li> IÂ´ve used it for various years and it works great when none of the other lip products work for me and trust me</li>
            <li> It has a sweet kinda floral scent, maybe an orangecicle and a soft floral note.</li>
            <li> I honestly have to say there is no other chapstick that can beat Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care.</li>
            <li> but I do live in the U.S., and maybe a European product will always be better.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall I have for it, that keeps it from being a five star is the fact that with even the tiniest amount of heat (such as in someones pocket) it melts rather quickly, even quicker then most chapsticks.</li>
            <li> This can be achieved by carrying it in your pants pocket for a few days or leaving it in a warm car out in the sun, after which you can bring it back indoors where the balm will cool and become firm again but apply much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> it does feel great putting it on, but then a few minutes later, it&#x27;s gone</li>
            <li> This chapstick goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your lips look greasy like regular Chapstick brand does.   </li>
            <li> I bought a pack for the whole family and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my lips really well.  </li>
            <li> This product really keeps my lips moist at all times.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to very chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip moisturizer on the market that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips in any way, but keeps them smooth, moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes as compared to those waxy products that you feel after application.</li>
            <li> You just gently put it on and that&#x27;s plenty.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing and protective to the lips.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and absorbs without leaving a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> Very moisture on the lips.  </li>
            <li> This also glides over your lips much easier.</li>
            <li> It worked so fast to help begin the healing of my cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I really like this chapstick and can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t survive the wash or dryer cycle very well.</li>
            <li> I will never use another lip balm again and I try to spread the word as much as I can.</li>
            <li> Thanks for always having this product in stock.  </li>
            <li> I learned it has a low melting point as It fell apart in globs when I took it out on the boat with me and left it in the warm cabin.  </li>
            <li> i just like the one i previously used better (also Nivea lip balm, but light blue in color on the cover) since that one has a very slight sweet scent which i really love.</li>
            <li> As a chapstick addict, I&#x27;ve tried many but this is very long lasting, mild smelling, and creamy.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my lips and seems to last longer than other glosses and chap stuff.</li>
            <li> especially after being in your pocket, it gets a little soft,&amp; just goes on your lips beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> Your money would be much better spent on Burt Bees!</li>
            <li> This plain chapstick provides incredible moisture (some of the other styles don&#x27;t, including the SPF version).</li>
            <li> My lips get dry, chap and bleed regularly, so intense moisture is really important for me.</li>
            <li> My lips are fairly sensitive and this really help my lips!</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite lip care product.</li>
            <li> I know I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> For some reason it is hard to find in the drugstore - maybe it sells out right away - so I was glad that I could order six from Amazon and be stocked up for a while.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no overwhelming scent or taste, and does what it promises keeps my lips smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I do think there are other brands out there, but these are not bad for kids and for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the little bit more, especially since it comes in a 6 pack.  </li>
            <li> It sounds weird but smells great.</li>
            <li> It does not tingle or feel heavy, just a lovely supple and moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> My lips became dramatically more chapped and itchy after switching to this for a few days.  </li>
            <li> But this Nivea chapstick is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and after going through at least 6 tubes over the past years, it hasn&#x27;t stopped working.</li>
            <li> This Nivea Essential Lip Care is worth every penny -</li>
            <li> one for mom, another for dad, a stick to keep at my desk, another in my bag, a fresh spare to give to a guest to keep, and a final one for my mom to use on any damaged skin areas that aren&#x27;t the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly revives damaged, cracked, and chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li> I literally have one anywhere I&#x27;d be sitting for more than a few minutes at a time -- bedside, desk, car and I  </li>
            <li> These not only do not affect me in any way, but they manage to keep my lips super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Keeps your lips soft and will diffidently order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to sun block products and they seem to be in everything these days.  </li>
            <li> I am very allergic to lip products and even regular ol&#x27; Chapstick would work my lips into a fit of dry red itchiness.</li>
            <li> It still works great on your lips, but suffers from a fatal flaw: if you carry it around in your pocket like I do, the heat from being close to your body turns the product to mush.</li>
            <li> And the twisting mechanism never seems to break free from the center of the actual balm like it always did in my chapstick.</li>
            <li> After regular use, it really makes my lips feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> A year ago I read an article about secrets of professional makeup artists, and this product was listed as one of the &amp;#34;secrets&amp;#34; for keeping lips moist.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your lips soft.</li>
            <li> get a bit soft if I keep it in my pants pocket</li>
            <li> We have used it on my 2 years old son, and it keeps his lips moisture. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a young child, my family is from Germany amd</li>
            <li> Gives a shine and keeps them soft.</li>
            <li> I had been using a plain old advanced formula petroleum jelly product for years.  </li>
            <li> An important note, for me, the other \\&quot;A Kiss of .....\\&quot; blends by Nivea did not work well on my lips, only the \\&quot;A Kiss of MOISTURE.\\</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday lip balm for people who don&#x27;t have problems with serious chapping.</li>
            <li> We have tried other lip treatments, but have found this line does the job better than any other we have tried.</li>
            <li> Checked the ingredients in these tubes against the even older tube I had been using with no burning sensation amd found that the ingredients were the same.</li>
            <li> I think it smells mildly like black pepper (although nobody else agrees with me); it has no fruity flavour, no tint, nothing like that</li>
            <li> I believe others have the same idea as it is nearly always sold out at the department store in the town I live.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this at my local stores recently, they&#x27;ve only been carrying the other Nivea lip balms that are either scented or have sun protection.  </li>
            <li> my lips are back to normal.</li>
            <li> line up in ingredients - instead of the normal &amp;#34;main/major ingredients&amp;#34;, petroleum, water (which is actually the primary/major ingredient in a lot of lip care products - to which I did not know!), wax.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I bought the 3 pack offered in a drugstore once, and none of the other were as effective or as gentle on my lips as this one.&lt;br /&gt;The lip care stick itself is very, very faintly scented, it reminds me ever so slightly of fresh cucumbers, or something else very fresh and clean, but it is so faint</li>
            <li> I occasionally cannot find it in the stores where I live, so I looked on Amazon and, of course they had it.</li>
            <li> I live in mortal terror that this product will be discontinued so every time I find it in my local store, I buy all the sticks I can find.</li>
            <li> During the winter or during dry weather, I use this during the day and Aquaphor (the healing ointment, not the lip treatment) at night, and that works really well for me.</li>
            <li> and I buy enough to last the whole year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really stumped on what it is that is in the other lip care products I have purchased that doesn&#x27;t agree with my lips, but whatever it is, it is apparently not in this particular formula.</li>
            <li> It goes on extremely smooth and isn&#x27;t as hard, which is a plus when applying.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use these often and the last box of 6 I got completely turned to mush and evaporated.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive lips so that if I use a regular lip product, my lips start to itch and peel.</li>
            <li> I actually makes your lips feel soft and moist without looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips soft and moist and I only need to apply it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> The name says it all -- &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34; I have been using this product for several years now and have yet to find anything that keeps my lips nearly as moisturized.</li>
            <li> but the more I put on the worse it got until I stopped and bought Alba chapstick which works</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of a kid&#x27;s glue stick and is different than the other Nivea lip balms which are a little more waxy.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is a high quality product that is so helpful in preventing chapped and or dry lip.  </li>
            <li> When i first get a tube it seems hard, but after a few hours in the pocket...so smooth, never waxy or drying.</li>
            <li> Anyone who used the other stuff, try this, it really works to heal, moisturize, and give our lips the care they need.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s bees, carmex, chapstick, some other lesser known ones that were recommended and didn&#x27;t really care for any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works to keep desert dry lips soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The only lip balm that isn&#x27;t &#x27;addictive&#x27;, does not dry my lips out and actually heals my skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely disppointed in the new formula.</li>
            <li> I was really going crazy trying to find the dark blue kiss of moisture because it really works better than any of the other nivea products and has no color and flavor.  </li>
            <li> Nivea is the only brand of chapstick I will use due to sensitive lips.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so smooth and soft, and my lips are pretty much repaired so it doesn&#x27;t look all nasty.</li>
            <li> I have switched back and am hopeful my lips will return back to their normal chapped-ness level within a few days.</li>
            <li> it is hard to really nail down a particular scent.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time, not too goey and actually does what it says - MOISTURIZES!  </li>
            <li> - makes the lipstick go on smoother, even though that way the color doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I used to use aquaphor a lot on my lips, and I still will if they are REALLY dry, but I use this daily, and before bed</li>
            <li> (it was called Labello then) very smooth...not hard like chap stick or runny like Vaseline, with no flavor or odor, no color.</li>
            <li> It has a light but noticeable citrus/vanilla scent and leaves a faint shimmer on your lips--definitely not a gloss, and not a sparkly shimmer, but there&#x27;s a sheen there.</li>
            <li> i have suffered from chapped lips for as long as i can remember.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and the product is not old or expired.</li>
            <li> When I opened a tue 7 months later, I put it on my lips and it tasted bitter like soap and burned</li>
            <li> The lip balm lasts a long time on your lips and keeps them moisturized.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN ON AUTO ORDER WITH THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried other tubea from the same 6 tube package and had the same bitter, burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea Essential since day 1 and have never switched to other brands.</li>
            <li> Other people must do the same thing because it almost is always out of stock!</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth</li>
            <li> My lips started to flake and were so dry making me reapply</li>
            <li> my lips end up dry year-round.  </li>
            <li> I have had dry lips to the point of them cracking, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of lip balms that caused my lips to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I officially went on a hunt for a routine lip care product that works well for my chronic dry lips -</li>
            <li> I wanted to stock up on Chapstick because I get really dry lips.</li>
            <li> they reformulated the balm to be firmer, as in it feels very solid as you press it to your lips and doesn&#x27;t leave as much balm behind as it used to.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, I&#x27;m just a French soul trapped in this American body.  </li>
            <li> I especially like to use this under lipsticks as base and kind of leaves a glossy finish without having a sticky gloss.</li>
            <li> This is a little greasy, so if you prefer a lip balm that you can barely feel this is probably not for you, but I like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lip balm that I use all the way down to the nub.</li>
            <li> Larger than typical size which is easier to find.&lt;br</li>
            <li> might try the one they have for men next time that has less of a glare</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I spent a year buying various glosses--probably half a dozen, at least.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Leaves a shiny wet look on your lips.</li>
            <li> I spent 3 months looking for this stuff at every drugstore, Target, Walmart, gas station, and corner store</li>
            <li> One next to the bed, and a few scattered around.</li>
            <li> I also like to apply a thick layer at bed time so that the lips are fully moisturized and soft when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> I also had a bad reaction to getting my upper lip waxed &amp; it got super dry/flakey.</li>
            <li> , the cap cant just pop off, like on other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried other lip treatments, but they weren&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> /buttery going on, but soothing, not hot.</li>
            <li> The packaging is moot because they come in a packed with a bunch of other things.</li>
            <li> its a larger size&lt;br /&gt;tub than the usual lip ice.</li>
            <li> Stores seem to carry every other Nivea chapstick except the Kiss of Moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, even other Nivea lip balms and they just coat my lips.  </li>
            <li> Nivea Kiss of Moisture seems to avoid the problem I&#x27;ve had with other balms in that if I go a day or two without using it, it won&#x27;t cause my lips to chap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is that after I first found this in stores years ago, I was NEVER able to find it again.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry and chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> My friends have even borrowed some of mine on random occasions and have always commented positively on the Nivea brand.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this on Amazon and did feel very crazy being a six pack of nivea</li>
            <li> I use it year round as weather is very dry here in California.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally for me.</li>
            <li> This is really not flavored at all, you just get the raw product here.  </li>
            <li> Mellow with a slight vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it has a slightly glossly sheen, nothing serious, but if you are male and that might bother you, keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I buy it a half dozen at a time</li>
            <li> Kiss of Moisture seriously works for me and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> Had used Burt&#x27;s Bees previously</li>
            <li> with some pretty disappointing results.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried out there (30+ years of trial and error), this is the ONLY lip balm product that my lips don&#x27;t get addicted to.</li>
            <li> The design on the pack I ordered was a little funky, but it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from purchasing it in bulk.</li>
            <li> My lips are extremely sensitive and will get itchy and flaky if I use the wrong lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just threw out 5 unused sticks of this, what a waste...</li>
            <li> I use this as a primer before lipstick because it&#x27;s non-waxy and keeps my lips from being dried out from the pigment.</li>
            <li> No candy taste or heavy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few friends</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly; no sticky, tacky feel.  </li>
            <li> I order a few</li>
            <li> I sometimes use this on especially rough patches of skin on my body and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> One star removed because--- A few years ago (when they redesigned the label)</li>
            <li> If stuff like \\&quot;Chap Stik\\&quot; brand and other similar things leave your lips feeling worse than when you used them, I seriously recommend you giving this Nivea</li>
            <li> This product is a must-try for anyone tired of picking at their dry lips.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I do it, but I do.</li>
            <li> Not many chapsticks have done this for me.   </li>
            <li> Been using it for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> that is easier to hold onto than the small ones, which I tend to drop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently my lips were so dry and painful that I thought they were going to bleed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lip balm, some of which made the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find lip balms that do not contain SPF.  </li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t find it at Target and needed one so badly, I settled for \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm\\&quot; and \\&quot;Soft Lips Beeswax Lip</li>
            <li> Although that doesn&#x27;t mean i feel like i need to wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> No more cherry-flavored candle wax on my lips!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve lived in dry, sunny or cold weather climates,  </li>
            <li> Essential Lip Care did what I was beginning to think was impossible: moisturize my lips without making them peel, burn or somehow harden/stiffen the outer layer of my lips.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, if you put lip balm on and it feels like it&#x27;s tingling or burning at all that&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can go on very thick</li>
            <li> It may make it seem like it&#x27;s doing something &amp;#34;Medical&amp;#34; but all it&#x27;s doing is irritating your lips</li>
            <li> SPF - all I hate in other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t just get a bad tube either, I&#x27;ve continued to buy this product since the brand switch and the past 6-12 months</li>
            <li> or I had to order online and pay expensive Canadian Post shipping.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have this disgusting habit where if my lips are dry and flaky, I rip off the flaky parts</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste bad though, and I even started to like it.</li>
            <li> Does the trick without leaving bad tasting glop on your lips or having that waxy feeling some lip care sticks have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Temporary moisture which leads to bad lips.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 5 years now, and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m terribly spoiled by it.  </li>
            <li> That may seem boring, but it lasts a lot longer and you don&#x27;t need to use it as often.</li>
            <li> They modified their formula and it&#x27;s awful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Soft and low odor.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite ChapStick I have ever used in my life. I believe others have the same idea as it is nearly always sold out at the department store in the town I live. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> BEST chapstick!!! I honestly have to say there is no other chapstick that can beat Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every lip balm on the market. This is my favorite one. It is moisturizing, non-irritating, free of fragrance, menthol, SPF - all I hate in other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other brands and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> i have suffered from chapped lips for as long as i can remember. i tried this chapstick but will never buy it again. it does feel great putting it on, but then a few minutes later, it&#x27;s gone and it&#x27;s time to reapply!</li>
            <li> I put this on every night before bed. It has a sweet kinda floral scent, maybe an orangecicle and a soft floral note. It sounds weird but smells great. It lasts all night, goes on smooth and is very silky. I love this, its not a gloss, its more like chapstick...Plus I love the container, the cap cant just pop off, like on other lip balms. I am a user for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Bought this after repeated reactions to Chapstick brand variants.  Larger size, easier to not lose or forget, feels nice and most importantly doesn&#x27;t cause my lips to burn and peel like some flavors of the Chapstick brand.</li>
            <li> Very good product, makes my lips feel moist.  It doesn;t&lt;br /&gt;feel waxy.  I think it is hypo-allergenic too, as it is the&lt;br /&gt;only lip balm I can use.  Quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughters love it :-).</li>
            <li> I love this chap stick, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. For a while I haven&#x27;t found it at any store any more,so I&#x27;m glad amazon has it.</li>
            <li> At first I bought this because of the name - Nivea is really good with moisturizing lotions and stuff like that, so I thought their lipcare might be pretty good too. I was so right. This chapstick goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your lips look greasy like regular Chapstick brand does.   I have this disgusting habit where if my lips are dry and flaky, I rip off the flaky parts and sometimes I do it to the extent where my lips bleed. Not sure why I do it, but I do. This results in unattractive lips. I put Kiss of Moisture on at night before bed, and in the morning my lips are almost healed! They&#x27;re so smooth and soft, and my lips are pretty much repaired so it doesn&#x27;t look all nasty. Not many chapsticks have done this for me.   It&#x27;s just great and makes your lips all supple! Definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> Very potent lip moisturizer. I also appreciate how it does not taste like anything. I bought a pack for the whole family and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this exclusively ever since I came across it.  I especially appreciate that it has no flavor, including no mint or menthol (which burns!) It is exactly what it claims to be, pure, smooth moisture; I also love the wider, chunkier sticks.  I make sure I have one in my pocket before going out.  This is not always in stock at the stores where I normally shop, I very much appreciate being able to buy it in bulk at Amazon.</li>
            <li> OK, but shipped as all lose pieces, not in the packaging as shown.</li>
            <li> The only chapstick I will ever use.  I used to always have chapped lips, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem for years because of this chapstick.  I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> best I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer in a tube that I have found that I really love! I occasionally cannot find it in the stores where I live, so I looked on Amazon and, of course they had it. I bought this pack of six and I keep them everywhere-in my purse, in my car, in the pockets of my jacket, on my end table where I sit etc so I&#x27;m never without it. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip gloss!  It moisturizes my lips really well.  I buy this lip gloss in bulk because I don&#x27;t like to run out.</li>
            <li> It is  one of the  best product on the market,  soft  and smooth and feels really good on the lips.  Amazon price is just right.</li>
            <li> I love these and can not find them in my local stores. I ordered this 6 pack to share with my mom and I am very happy with the product. It was delivered on time and the product is not old or expired. The product works great on dry lips and the tube lasts a while.</li>
            <li> The best chapstick ever made and I have been through all kinds of brands.</li>
            <li> Love this. The only lip balm that doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no overwhelming scent or taste, and does what it promises keeps my lips smooth, and soft. It really is the best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used! The only downfall I have for it, that keeps it from being a five star is the fact that with even the tiniest amount of heat (such as in someones pocket) it melts rather quickly, even quicker then most chapsticks. Either way I recommend getting it, completely worth buying.</li>
            <li> We have tried other lip treatments, but have found this line does the job better than any other we have tried.</li>
            <li> This used to be the hydrating tube with SPF 4, but they have changed that to A Kiss of Smoothness without noting the change.  This is way less smooth and more waxy feeling.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time, not too goey and actually does what it says - MOISTURIZES!  No need to constantly reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve lived in dry, sunny or cold weather climates,  you&#x27;ve struggled with good lip protection.  Look no further. I&#x27;ve tried everything from organic honey bees wax to medicated tubes to high-end cosmetic balms, NIVEA does it again. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. Recently my lips were so dry and painful that I thought they were going to bleed. I&#x27;d tried other lip treatments, but they weren&#x27;t working. A friend recommended this and it&#x27;s wonderful. My lips felt better quickly and by the end of the day, they were almost healed.</li>
            <li> I prefer Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Smoothness to this one.  This one does not glide on as smoothly, and it doesn&#x27;t have any sun protection in it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. It&#x27;s a plus they sell this in bulk at this price. This product really keeps my lips moist at all times.</li>
            <li> Love this chapstick and can only find it online</li>
            <li> My favourite lip balm ever.  Gluten free as per company website.  No minty or tingly stuff in it.  Mellow with a slight vanilla scent.  Very soothing to very chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Bought this package of 6 Nivea Lip Balms in October 2014. When I opened a tue 7 months later, I put it on my lips and it tasted bitter like soap and burned so I had to scrub it off. Checked the ingredients in these tubes against the even older tube I had been using with no burning sensation amd found that the ingredients were the same. Then I tried other tubea from the same 6 tube package and had the same bitter, burning sensation. Will not buy this product from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite - I love the way it feels. I used to use aquaphor a lot on my lips, and I still will if they are REALLY dry, but I use this daily, and before bed and I like the way it feels. Keeps my lips healthy, especially in the winter. The design on the pack I ordered was a little funky, but it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from purchasing it in bulk. It&#x27;s the only lip balm that I use all the way down to the nub.</li>
            <li> Nivea Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care did what I was beginning to think was impossible: moisturize my lips without making them peel, burn or somehow harden/stiffen the outer layer of my lips. I have tried SO MANY different lip balms, sticks, glosses, etc. with some pretty disappointing results. That is, until I discovered this product. This is the only lip moisturizer on the market that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my lips in any way, but keeps them smooth, moisturized and supple. I&#x27;m really stumped on what it is that is in the other lip care products I have purchased that doesn&#x27;t agree with my lips, but whatever it is, it is apparently not in this particular formula. If stuff like \\&quot;Chap Stik\\&quot; brand and other similar things leave your lips feeling worse than when you used them, I seriously recommend you giving this Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care a try. An important note, for me, the other \\&quot;A Kiss of .....\\&quot; blends by Nivea did not work well on my lips, only the \\&quot;A Kiss of MOISTURE.\\&quot; I bought the 3 pack offered in a drugstore once, and none of the other were as effective or as gentle on my lips as this one.&lt;br /&gt;The lip care stick itself is very, very faintly scented, it reminds me ever so slightly of fresh cucumbers, or something else very fresh and clean, but it is so faint it is hard to really nail down a particular scent. I have to put it up close to my nose to smell it as I do not smell it or taste in when I wear it. It feels rather creamy/buttery going on, but soothing, not hot. It leaves no color or waxy feeling at all. It does not tingle or feel heavy, just a lovely supple and moisturizing effect. I try to always keep extra on hand and one with me at all times, it&#x27;s that good. Since I&#x27;ve been using this, my lips feel soft, supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughters found this lip balm to be one of the best they have ever tried. It really moisturizes as compared to those waxy products that you feel after application. After application you don&#x27;t even know it is there and it definitely keeps your lips from drying out&lt;br /&gt;for the day. You don&#x27;t have to apply every hour on the hour like cheaper products.</li>
            <li> this is the best of Nivea&#x27;s lip moisturizers!</li>
            <li> I have always just used the moisturizing Chapstick but this stuff is awesome. It goes on extremely smooth and isn&#x27;t as hard, which is a plus when applying.  You just gently put it on and that&#x27;s plenty.  This is really not flavored at all, you just get the raw product here.  It doesn&#x27;t taste bad though, and I even started to like it. It certainly is much better quality in every way over Chapstick.  It&#x27;s well worth the little bit more, especially since it comes in a 6 pack.  I found myself loving it so much, I just gave away some of the sticks to people to try.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm I have ever tried. I have used it for ages and don&#x27;t see me change anytime soon/ever.</li>
            <li> My lips are extremely sensitive and will get itchy and flaky if I use the wrong lip moisturizer. This is only one I&#x27;ve tried to date that always moisturizes my lips without causing any problems. It&#x27;s not addictive like Chapstick, so I actually only have to apply 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm EVERRR! You don&#x27;t have to keep applying it. It&#x27;s thicker than any I&#x27;ve used (in a good way) and I like that. Leaves a shiny wet look on your lips. Very nice. Hint: especially after being in your pocket, it gets a little soft,&amp; just goes on your lips beautifully.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell.  My lips stay smooth.  I learned it has a low melting point as It fell apart in globs when I took it out on the boat with me and left it in the warm cabin.  KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT and its a great product.</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering Nivea Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care a couple of years ago, I used a prestige brand lip moisturizer from a department store.  It cost a great deal more, but was not any more effective than this.  I use this during the day and mostly at night as part of my beauty ritual.  It is very soothing and protective to the lips.  What I like is that it does not contain any SPF, which I would not want in a product I use overnight.  It is hard to find lip balms that do not contain SPF.  A year ago I read an article about secrets of professional makeup artists, and this product was listed as one of the &amp;#34;secrets&amp;#34; for keeping lips moist.  For some reason it is hard to find in the drugstore - maybe it sells out right away - so I was glad that I could order six from Amazon and be stocked up for a while.</li>
            <li> I especially like this lip balm because it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF in it - I&#x27;m very sensitive to sun block products and they seem to be in everything these days.  A good idea unless you&#x27;re sensitive to them.  It is very moisturizing and absorbs without leaving a waxy feel.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip care currently on the market. Used to be sold in stores but for some reason I don&#x27;t find it on shelves anymore and so I purchase it on Amazon. I use it year round as weather is very dry here in California. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s on  my subscribe and save account.  I get several every month.  Best lip moisturizer I have tried.  Thanks for a great product.  Monica</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm I have ever used. Like the way to use it.  No more&lt;br /&gt;squeezing until you get some out.  This is like putting lipstick on just that simple.</li>
            <li> The best lip product for the price. I was buying &amp;#34;Sugar&amp;#34; at Sephora for $25 a pop, this works equally as well; no burning (very sensitive lips), no waxiness, just silky wonderful moisture.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keeps your lips soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works very well. We would buy this product again. The price is great and so is the product.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Nivea lip products but like this one best. Goes on soft &amp; smooth and feels really good on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;Does get a bit soft if I keep it in my pants pocket but now that the weather&#x27;s getting cooler I can keep it in my jacket pocket.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and heals my lips quickly. I also like that it leaves a glossy sheen, as if I am wearing a gloss instead of a balm.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use these often and the last box of 6 I got completely turned to mush and evaporated. One I kept on my desk at work, had one in my car, and one on the end table in the living room. All garbage. Extremely disppointed in the new formula.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday lip balm for people who don&#x27;t have problems with serious chapping. But it&#x27;s a lip balm of a specific type. If you like light lip balms that glide on and feel silky, as opposed to lip balms that are creamier or waxier, this is a great one. I note some reviewers saying it&#x27;s unisex. It has a light but noticeable citrus/vanilla scent and leaves a faint shimmer on your lips--definitely not a gloss, and not a sparkly shimmer, but there&#x27;s a sheen there. Whether you&#x27;re a man or woman, if you don&#x27;t want to look like you&#x27;re wearing lip product, this probably isn&#x27;t the balm for you--you will need something waxier. Does a great job moisturizing day to day, but if my lips gets very chapped, this isn&#x27;t emollient enough. During the winter or during dry weather, I use this during the day and Aquaphor (the healing ointment, not the lip treatment) at night, and that works really well for me. I also use an additional product if I plan to be out in the sun for a while, since this doesn&#x27;t have SPF (which is good for me, since I like to control when I use sunblock). I have yet to find a lip balm that is the be all and end all (probably doesn&#x27;t exist), but this is my favorite default lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is just what I need for my lip addiction.The packaging is moot because they come in a packed with a bunch of other things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea moisture lip stuff for a while and love it.  That is why I bought it again - and I&#x27;ll keep buying.  It feels good on my lips and seems to last longer than other glosses and chap stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm of all times and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  I spent 3 months looking for this stuff at every drugstore, Target, Walmart, gas station, and corner store I went to.  I remember spending more than 2 hour driving from store to store one day trying to find this stuff when my last stick was reaching the end.  I was really going crazy trying to find the dark blue kiss of moisture because it really works better than any of the other nivea products and has no color and flavor.  I was so glad to find this on Amazon and did feel very crazy being a six pack of nivea but now I have sticks of this everywhere... purse, nightstand, car, bf&#x27;s car, office drawer.  And I even had 1 left to give to a friend!</li>
            <li> I love this.  IÂ´ve used it for various years and it works great when none of the other lip products work for me and trust me IÂ´ve tried MANY!!!!</li>
            <li> bought a pack of six as this brand is our favorite and everybody wanted one.  good price too for 6.  its a larger size&lt;br /&gt;tub than the usual lip ice.</li>
            <li> I had been using a plain old advanced formula petroleum jelly product for years.  I decided to try this to see if it worked better based on the positive reviews.  My lips became dramatically more chapped and itchy after switching to this for a few days.  I have switched back and am hopeful my lips will return back to their normal chapped-ness level within a few days. Maybe I just happen to be allergic to one of the ingredients in this or something, I dunno, but for me this is a zero star product. Just threw out 5 unused sticks of this, what a waste...</li>
            <li> ...because there is no soapy taste in my mouth after applying. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years now and my risk for getting herpes infections was reduced for about 95%</li>
            <li> *I have this review posted under the labello product as well, since they are the same product*  I had originally purchased this when i was on accutane under the brand name labello, and it was the only thing that worked, and fabulously at that. Since then i have gotten hooked! Although that doesn&#x27;t mean i feel like i need to wear it all the time. I think it smells mildly like black pepper (although nobody else agrees with me); it has no fruity flavour, no tint, nothing like that (but they do sell ones that have those things if you want them). I keep mine in my pocket and it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; or rather softens slightly to a more vaseline-like consistency, which i find to be more comfortable. When i first get a tube it seems hard, but after a few hours in the pocket...so smooth, never waxy or drying. The Labello tube looks the same except for the name. The whole blue part is the cap, kind of like a lipstick, very secure. And the twisting mechanism never seems to break free from the center of the actual balm like it always did in my chapstick. It has never opened in my pocket, and i always have one in there. I have one in my jeans pocket, one in my purse. One next to the bed, and a few scattered around. I use nothing else, and yes i really own six tubes of this stuff (purchased separately...this six pack is a great idea!). it is FABULOUS. The two things i should point out are that it does not contain sunscreen. If you want a product with sunblock, you need the one with the yellow cap (some others has spf too). Plus, it has a slightly glossly sheen, nothing serious, but if you are male and that might bother you, keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> My favorite light, non-sunscreen, stick lip balm is Labello Hydro Care, which is sold only in Canada and Europe. I used to buy it when I went to Canada or I had to order online and pay expensive Canadian Post shipping. So glad I discovered that Nivea re-packaged it and sells Hydro Care as A Kiss of Moisture in the U.S.! Hard to find in the drugstores, so it&#x27;s great that Amazon carries it. I use this as a primer before lipstick because it&#x27;s non-waxy and keeps my lips from being dried out from the pigment. No candy taste or heavy fragrance.  I hope Amazon never stops carrying this 6-pack deal!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time!</li>
            <li> It works and smells great.</li>
            <li> Very moisture on the lips.  We have used it on my 2 years old son, and it keeps his lips moisture. .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I buy it a half dozen at a time so I have it everywhere I go all the time. That way I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing it the way I lose my sunglasses. It&#x27;s great unflavored, uncolored lip smoother. Does the trick without leaving bad tasting glop on your lips or having that waxy feeling some lip care sticks have. I like to use it underneath my lipstick - makes the lipstick go on smoother, even though that way the color doesn&#x27;t last as long. I don&#x27;t care. As long as my lips aren&#x27;t peeling and cracking, especially at the corners, I&#x27;m usually pretty happy. Definitely recommend as a staple cosmetic. I know I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Nivea is the only brand of chapstick I will use due to sensitive lips. This plain chapstick provides incredible moisture (some of the other styles don&#x27;t, including the SPF version). A drawback I&#x27;ve learned to deal with is now my lips leave a residue on drinking glasses.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s the best chapstick I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Would put 5 stars but melts in summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and it&#x27;s awesome. Does not have an oily/shining look when applied. I prefer this over regular Chapstick or blistex. I&#x27;ve recommended it to a few friends and now they can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite drugstore lip balms. It is super smooth and leaves lips feeling moisturized and soft. The lip balm lasts a long time on your lips and keeps them moisturized. I especially like to use this under lipsticks as base and kind of leaves a glossy finish without having a sticky gloss. I also like to apply a thick layer at bed time so that the lips are fully moisturized and soft when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend</li>
            <li> I have very chapped lips and have used many through the years.  This by far the best I have used and continue to use.  Keeps my list moist for a longer period of time.  And I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying over and over again ever 30 minutes like I did with the others I have used.  This also glides over your lips much easier.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for 10 years to help her deal with the moisture variations in our local weather.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. This six pack is the best value for money I&#x27;ve found so far. This is a little greasy, so if you prefer a lip balm that you can barely feel this is probably not for you, but I like it&#x27;s moisturizing effects. My lips get dry, chap and bleed regularly, so intense moisture is really important for me. My lips are fairly sensitive and this really help my lips! I use it multiple times a day to keep my lips moisturized. After regular use, it really makes my lips feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm on the market!</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little bit cheaper, but it smell very good!!! Love this lip balm. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Received this fast, packaging was very neat and everything was very clean. I first bought this at a Drug Store in the Asheville Mountains. It worked so fast to help begin the healing of my cracked lips. I have dry mouth and this makes my lips dryer. Anyone who used the other stuff, try this, it really works to heal, moisturize, and give our lips the care they need.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive lips so that if I use a regular lip product, my lips start to itch and peel. The search is over, though! I found what works for me - and I must say, it is the best! \\&quot;Nivea A Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care\\&quot; is just perfect! It works well with zero allergic reaction. It moisturizes generously with a long-lasting effect. It&#x27;s almost fragrance-free, but there&#x27;s a hint of something that smells good.    I ran out of this Nivea lip balm before I could get a replacement. Since I couldn&#x27;t find it at Target and needed one so badly, I settled for \\&quot;Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm\\&quot; and \\&quot;Soft Lips Beeswax Lip Conditioner\\&quot;; they are great products. However, they are not working for me; I&#x27;m back to having irritated lips. I am ordering a pack of this product today and will remain a loyal Nivea user!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find this at my local stores recently, they&#x27;ve only been carrying the other Nivea lip balms that are either scented or have sun protection.  Those all irritate my lips, this one is the best!</li>
            <li> Almost the same as the European &amp;#34;Labello&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like this chapstick and can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Best Chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used. If I feel my lips getting chapped I put this on right away &amp; within a day my lips are back to normal. I also had a bad reaction to getting my upper lip waxed &amp; it got super dry/flakey. I put this on overnight &amp; they were both gone the next day. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and best price!!</li>
            <li> I have chronic chapped lips and I can never find a good chapstick that I don&#x27;t get \\&quot;immune\\&quot; to. But this Nivea chapstick is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried and after going through at least 6 tubes over the past years, it hasn&#x27;t stopped working. It leaves your lips feeling moisturized but not in the greasy, filmy way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is that after I first found this in stores years ago, I was NEVER able to find it again. Stores seem to carry every other Nivea chapstick except the Kiss of Moisture. Finding this on Amazon is a godsend. Even if you have to buy six at a time, it ends up being cheaper than purchasing separately and you always have backup for when you lose a tube (which we all know is bound to happen).</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a good price and I needed them for my entire family of 10. They seem to work well if you remember to reply often. I do think there are other brands out there, but these are not bad for kids and for the price!</li>
            <li> Purchased because of amazing reviews BUT this chapstick does NOT work well.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Glides on nice. Larger than typical size which is easier to find.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: DRIES out your lips after a short time! My lips started to flake and were so dry making me reapply but the more I put on the worse it got until I stopped and bought Alba chapstick which works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Temporary moisture which leads to bad lips. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> This is a lip moisturizer/conditioner.  I actually makes your lips feel soft and moist without looking greasy.  It has the consistency of a kid&#x27;s glue stick and is different than the other Nivea lip balms which are a little more waxy.</li>
            <li> I have been dedicated to this specific Nivea chapstick for years and swear by it. As a chapstick addict, I&#x27;ve tried many but this is very long lasting, mild smelling, and creamy.</li>
            <li> its a great product, but its kind of expensive here at amazon, try walmart instead</li>
            <li> I received my first tube in my Christmas stocking and it is now my lip balm of choice. Goes on moist, offers great protection. No more cherry-flavored candle wax on my lips!</li>
            <li> It works to keep desert dry lips soft and moisturized. More words words words words words words words words words</li>
            <li> Best chapstick I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using chapstick for 40 years.  I like how it does not contain SPF so I can use it at bedtime.  Goes on smoothly; no sticky, tacky feel.  Truly moisterizes lips.  Been using it for the past 3 years.</li>
            <li> Really love this product!  It glides on smoothly and stays on for hours.  Keeps lips moist and free of chapping.</li>
            <li> Amazingly moisturizing</li>
            <li> this leaves your lips silky smooth and well moisturized. I think there is also an spf factor built in. Seems to last longer than chapstick too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just gotta keep remember to remove from my pocket prior to washing my clothes. The product doesn&#x27;t survive the wash or dryer cycle very well. Not the Nivea&#x27;s fault, but mine...</li>
            <li> My wife (and me :)) loves it! The best lip balm out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a bunch of research on different lip balms trying to find one that wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;addictive&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve tried Burt&#x27;s bees, carmex, chapstick, some other lesser known ones that were recommended and didn&#x27;t really care for any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the research I&#x27;ve read, what many people like about certain lip balms is actually just a gimmick that makes you think it&#x27;s doing something when in fact it&#x27;s actually causing your lips to crack more. To put it simply, if you put lip balm on and it feels like it&#x27;s tingling or burning at all that&#x27;s bad. It may make it seem like it&#x27;s doing something &amp;#34;Medical&amp;#34; but all it&#x27;s doing is irritating your lips and soon they will crack more which causes you to put more on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is different in that you put it on and it just feels like moisture. That may seem boring, but it lasts a lot longer and you don&#x27;t need to use it as often. I will never use another lip balm again and I try to spread the word as much as I can. Don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I feel like this is the only lip balm that actually moisturizes my lips.  I&#x27;ve tried others, even other Nivea lip balms and they just coat my lips.  Kiss of Moisture seriously works for me and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this lip balm. Most lip products have SPF which I am very sensitive too and so it dries my lips out even more. This Nivea Essential Lip Care is worth every penny - it keeps my lips soft and smooth and hydrated for hours. I like this one better than any of the others in the Nivea lineup.</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer is a high quality product that is so helpful in preventing chapped and or dry lip.  My Dr says the Bees Wax is an important part of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a young child, my family is from Germany amd they would ship it to us. (it was called Labello then) very smooth...not hard like chap stick or runny like Vaseline, with no flavor or odor, no color. suitable for men as well as women, and my 5 year old even has one.</li>
            <li> Best chap stick ever! The first pack I got was all cracked and damaged. Easy exchange and re-delivery. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I swear by this lip balm.  I have used all kinds of lip balm (Blistex, Carmex, Vaseline, Burt&#x27;s Bees) for many years.  I work in a laboratory, which is humidity and temperature controlled, so my lips end up dry year-round.  I have had dry lips to the point of them cracking, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of lip balms that caused my lips to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.  The Nivea lip balm prevents both of these.  It makes my lips soft and moist and I only need to apply it twice a day.  This product is a must-try for anyone tired of picking at their dry lips.</li>
            <li> Just received these lip moisturizer and it&#x27;s the best. I have been using Nivea Essential since day 1 and have never switched to other brands. Nivea always saves my lips from drying out and chapped. Definitely one of the best lip moisturizer in the market!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best lip balm on Amazon. Nivea is fabulous and this is a great price. This is my 4th order of this chap stick. My husband and I are never without lip balm. It moisturizes and does not dry out your lips. It has no scent or flavor either which is great.</li>
            <li> I am an addict and they scratch my itch.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN ON AUTO ORDER WITH THIS PRODUCT FOR A LONG TIME.  IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND I CAN GET IT ON AUTO ORDER CHEAPER THAN AT A PHARMACY.</li>
            <li> I officially went on a hunt for a routine lip care product that works well for my chronic dry lips - this wasn&#x27;t in any of my local stores.  Also I was looking for a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; line up in ingredients - instead of the normal &amp;#34;main/major ingredients&amp;#34;, petroleum, water (which is actually the primary/major ingredient in a lot of lip care products - to which I did not know!), wax.  This one fit the bill. It&#x27;s unique design is a plus to.  It applies very smoothly, leaving your lips with a nice light feeling.  Some &amp;#34;chap sticks&amp;#34; leave your lips shiny, this does not, it&#x27;s more of a matte finish.  Very nice, light, unique smell/flavor.  Good for everyday routine care.  I like it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is protected in its sleeve, better than regular chap stick. Sometimes it can go on very thick and i end up wiping off the excess.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much. I am very allergic to lip products and even regular ol&#x27; Chapstick would work my lips into a fit of dry red itchiness. These not only do not affect me in any way, but they manage to keep my lips super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, tinted women&#x27;s balms, lip glosses, chap sticks, ect...and this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve used. I will stick with this one forever, or until they stop making it. Great product!!! Even all of my family uses it now too.</li>
            <li> Works well, apply to lips during day and sometimes before bed. Keeps your lips soft and will diffidently order more.</li>
            <li> Perfect everything! Thumbs up! Cant say enuff about the product, price and shipping! Awesome! Perfect great super superb,best product ever,great prices! Cant complain</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry and chapped lips.  I have tried other lip balm, some of which made the problem worse.  This product has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> good product. i just like the one i previously used better (also Nivea lip balm, but light blue in color on the cover) since that one has a very slight sweet scent which i really love.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t believe there is a better lip moisturizer on the market... I buy these for myself and all of my grandchildren... they offer excellent protection, heal dry lips quickly, and leave your lips feeling moist and soft for hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always empty at the grocery store and drug store because its so good.  I order a few so I have one in my purse, on my desk and in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm that can handle the dehydrated zone that exists on the surface of my lips.  I have tried everything that is out there and this is the only one I have found that can help me during the winter.  Great stuff.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These feel and smell great. I seem incapable of not losing these before they run out - so the bulk past is perfect.</li>
            <li> the best lip balm  and curative  really works  and wears well</li>
            <li> Your money would be much better spent on Burt Bees! It wasn&#x27;t effective in moisturizing my chapped lips in the winter.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I use. I can only buy this one in Canada though or on line. We go to Canada once a year and I buy enough to last the whole year. I have been using it for 20 plus years. It used to be called Labello.  We didn&#x27;t make it to Canada this year my husband had a stroke 10 days before we were to leave so I will be buying it on line till next year!</li>
            <li> This lip moisturizer works fantastically. My parents and I are great fans and receiving the sticks in packs of 6 makes it very convenient for me- one for mom, another for dad, a stick to keep at my desk, another in my bag, a fresh spare to give to a guest to keep, and a final one for my mom to use on any damaged skin areas that aren&#x27;t the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly revives damaged, cracked, and chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li> I spent a year buying various glosses--probably half a dozen, at least.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite because of the smooth texture. I also like the long&lt;br /&gt;cap that is easier to hold onto than the small ones, which I tend to drop.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> The only lip balm that isn&#x27;t &#x27;addictive&#x27;, does not dry my lips out and actually heals my skin. I sometimes use this on especially rough patches of skin on my body and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> this is the only chapstick that works well for my lips. Love it. Gives a shine and keeps them soft.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite lip care product. Unlike every other product I&#x27;ve tried out there (30+ years of trial and error), this is the ONLY lip balm product that my lips don&#x27;t get addicted to. Kiehl&#x27;s, Burts, Chapstick, Blistex, you name it; they all have a tendency to make your lips drier when you don&#x27;t continue using the product. I use this specific product for winter and they have a lighter blue packaging product which I use for summer. They&#x27;re both fantastic! My friends have even borrowed some of mine on random occasions and have always commented positively on the Nivea brand. It&#x27;s a superior product and very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for people who truly care about their lips!  :)</li>
            <li> They say everyone has their preferred lip balm and this is definitely my holy grail. I live in mortal terror that this product will be discontinued so every time I find it in my local store, I buy all the sticks I can find. Other people must do the same thing because it almost is always out of stock! Thankfully, Amazon comes to the rescue. I purchased the set of six lip balms and it&#x27;s put my mind at ease about running out and not being able to find more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect blend of moisturizing without containing harsh ingredients such a menthol. I have very dry skin and my lips are prone to being chapped. Nivea Kiss of Moisture seems to avoid the problem I&#x27;ve had with other balms in that if I go a day or two without using it, it won&#x27;t cause my lips to chap. So, whatever the ingredients are, please don&#x27;t change them, Nivea!</li>
            <li> Perfect, simple lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lip balm. I keep this in the pocket of every jacket I own. Had used Burt&#x27;s Bees previously but I find this to work better.</li>
            <li> Nivea makes the best lip moisturizer!  They go on gentle and smooth, without a waxy film. I use this product regularly to keep my lips smooth and healthy. Thank you Nivea!</li>
            <li> The name says it all -- &amp;#34;Kiss of Moisture.&amp;#34; I have been using this product for several years now and have yet to find anything that keeps my lips nearly as moisturized. I literally have one anywhere I&#x27;d be sitting for more than a few minutes at a time -- bedside, desk, car and I  sometimes keep one in my pants pocket.  One star removed because--- A few years ago (when they redesigned the label) they reformulated the balm to be firmer, as in it feels very solid as you press it to your lips and doesn&#x27;t leave as much balm behind as it used to.  Before I can use this lip balm I warm each of the tubes up to the point that the balm starts to almost melt (it becomes mushy). This can be achieved by carrying it in your pants pocket for a few days or leaving it in a warm car out in the sun, after which you can bring it back indoors where the balm will cool and become firm again but apply much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to stock up on Chapstick because I get really dry lips. Nivea moisturizes perfectly for me and doesn&#x27;t sting like some chapsticks do. Makes your lips very smooth after a few days of use too &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Essential Lip Care, 0.17-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;u say pack of 6 why i only get one?</li>
            <li> I used to always carry &amp;#34;Chapstick&amp;#34; brand in my pocket but the knob would always twist and cause the stick to rise and get mashed into the cap.  This solved that because the stick wont move unless you remove the cap.. Great for anybody who keeps a stick in their pocket.  My only gripe is that it is shiney... might try the one they have for men next time that has less of a glare</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally for me. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 5 years now, and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m terribly spoiled by it.  None better in my experience.  but I do live in the U.S., and maybe a European product will always be better.  What can I say, I&#x27;m just a French soul trapped in this American body.  Thanks for always having this product in stock.  Please keep it up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for years, back when it was Labello-branded, and really liked it. Then Nivea took over and started changing the formula. It still works great on your lips, but suffers from a fatal flaw: if you carry it around in your pocket like I do, the heat from being close to your body turns the product to mush. Literally, you&#x27;ll try to put it on your lips and it comes off in globs. I didn&#x27;t just get a bad tube either, I&#x27;ve continued to buy this product since the brand switch and the past 6-12 months every tube I&#x27;ve had has had this issue. They modified their formula and it&#x27;s awful now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might say \\&quot;Keep it in a different place then!\\&quot;, but look, I&#x27;m a guy and when I&#x27;m not wearing a coat (which I don&#x27;t wear when I&#x27;m at work in a office) I&#x27;ve only got my pant pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the PERFECT product and they screwed it up.</li>
