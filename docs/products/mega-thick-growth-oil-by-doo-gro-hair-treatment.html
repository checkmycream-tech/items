            <li>but I love this PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coconut oil is wayyyy better:)</li>
            <li>I found a site that&#x27;s giving PSN codes away for free!</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using it my scalp breathed a sigh of relief! :)</li>
            <li>but it surely does work for me...</li>
            <li>After a day or two more the hair on my nape was flakey too.  </li>
            <li>Castor oil and products from the rainforest (Gemzon) work better.</li>
            <li>Its an okay product.</li>
            <li>have been able to see more length will update after a month</li>
            <li>Im quite impressed by such quick results</li>
            <li>I feel that the smell is too strong, and I almost can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Also, less than wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>Got this from my local rite aid but had to come write a review and let people know how great it is.</li>
            <li>I APPLY IT TO MY SCALP, EDGES, NAPE AND HAIR LIGHTLY.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t even care because it&#x27;s really making my hair grow.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews on this product and was really excited to try it</li>
            <li>I keep a clean scalp, I don&#x27;t get dandruff or anything, but once I started using this</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really not bad at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and longer than before people are like wow your hair is even longer its GREAT!!and  very easy to use</li>
            <li>This might be good for someone who has extremely dry hair though.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and leaves my hair feeling super soft after shampooing</li>
            <li>June 17, 2012: I have continued to use this product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I also love all of the natural ingredients that this product has in it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product, hoping I might have some success with it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Her hair was STILL left damp and reflective [and NOT the good sort of shine that a healthy head of hair has, but more like the shine that homeless people who haven&#x27;t showered for a few months</li>
            <li>it still wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I have crotchet braids in right now</li>
            <li>Was very pleasantly surprised at what good condition it left my hair in.</li>
            <li>Overall, it did seem to make my hair thicker and more sleek, but if I were to use it again I would dump it into a little spray bottle so that I could disperse it throughout my hair more evenly and more sparingly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a test run as a hot oil treatment first before trying to add it to my regimen.</li>
            <li>But after about seven minutes my scalp just felt hot and sore</li>
            <li>Mommy is coming back :)</li>
            <li>this is an OIL, so its not something I would think most white people could use without their hair looking like it has, well, OIL in it.</li>
            <li>BTW, it is NOT difficult to shampoo out; I shampoo once and even conditon, and my hair turns out beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I USE THIS TO ADD SHINE, AND FOR HOT OIL TREATMENTS.</li>
            <li>but I stopped after the first attempt.</li>
            <li>After using it once I realized how healthy, shinier, and thicker my hair felt the next day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff after I deep condition my hair</li>
            <li>On the back it says it&#x27;s safe on relaxed hair</li>
            <li>Got this to use as a hot oil treatment after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this product will work, but unfortunately it is not.</li>
            <li>The thing about your face breaking out if you sleep in it, don&#x27;t read this review if your trying to find out information about that because unlike most people I sleep on my back so my face isn&#x27;t affected by the oil on the pillow.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it it gave me a lot if volume.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Well no i dont use the hot comb anymore</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, worked well, thank you!</li>
            <li>It is best used by people with frizz trouble or who have curly and rough hair that has management issues.</li>
            <li>The one completely positive thing about the oil is its price.</li>
            <li>Hair definitely feels stronger and even more thick and has a good shine now.</li>
            <li>I was not upset, since I figured the odds it wouldn&#x27;t work would be pretty high.</li>
            <li>I did try the Doo Gro Triple Strength Growth Lotion when the store was out of the Oil, and it took 3 shampoos to completely wash out--beware if you have white hair like mine.s product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Using this on the whole hair strands (root to tip) really helps with the hair and its dryness.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work all the time.</li>
            <li>keeps it really moist.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It has made my hair grow very well.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it and probably won&#x27;t try to use it again</li>
            <li>absolutely will not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a whole bottle over about 1 month~6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I just got this today in the mail, I don&#x27;t straighten or really do anything to my hair except put shampoo and conditioner in it when I&#x27;m in the shower</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put to much on or it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>So im going to use it this whole year</li>
            <li>makes my hair very oily</li>
            <li>your hair is really growing/ getting thicker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>If you want fast growth I would oil my scalp 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my hair look really greasy</li>
            <li>After my very first use, I noticed major improvement.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product, and a little does go a long way, (accidently used too much)</li>
            <li>[Be extremely weary of this product AND the many favorable reviews]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Like many other products that are targeted towards African-American hair, this does not cause hair growth, but hair loss.</li>
            <li>; sweet almond oil is the 3rd ingredient and thats all my nose can detect.</li>
            <li>Now, my hair is short and full.</li>
            <li>My first time going natural</li>
            <li>I usually have to cover my hair with plastic hair cover just to make sure I can stand it for at least a good ten minutes for the oil to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>and it was super flat.</li>
            <li>I didnt know it at the time, but I had developed Hypothyroidism, which will wreak absolute havoc on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Also, I got 4 new zits over the next 2 days, which I attribute to this product, since I rarely get acne.     </li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE GROWING LONG, CUT THE SPLIT ENDS FIRST!</li>
            <li>Just because my hair grew that fast with in 2 1/2 weeks does not mean you will get the same results, but these are the results I had.</li>
            <li>but i do use a hot comb or flat iron...</li>
            <li>I only used this one time (over the weekend) and it made my hair super greasy (unsurprising, since it&#x27;s oil) and gross.</li>
            <li>I recently experienced some damage to my hair due to a relaxer and an incompetent stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it couple times only and dumped it in the trash.it smells like pure soya bean oil.</li>
            <li>I put a dime size of this in maybe a tiny bit more and blow dry it, then I flat iron it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li>No this Jo that, and I completely turned away from doo gro.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair so soft and succulent, I didn&#x27;t realize til my 7th twist that I had nothing but this oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>Not imagine all the things I&#x27;ve missed while listening to \\&quot;natural hair</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural now &amp; it is noticeably thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I tried to measure my growth so far while still in the braids and it looks like in some areas 1/2 inch already.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s really oil, obviously because its an oil based product).</li>
            <li>Makes my daughters hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I attempted to return it and the seller (CBS Express) was completely unprofessional.</li>
            <li>BUT I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL OILS.</li>
            <li>Although It made my hair unbelievably soft, but I was at work and noticed my scalp was itching</li>
            <li>I am natural.</li>
            <li>After only 3 1/2 weeks Im already seeing how much thicker my hair is.</li>
            <li>this product promotes thick hair, it makes your hair grow healthy,</li>
            <li>To be honest I only bought this stuff because I tried doing scene hair by cutting it myself and I cut a layer of my hair clean off.</li>
            <li>Hair is more delicate than it seems so my general conclusion is use what works for YOU.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is especially formulated for African American hair or what, but I&#x27;m white / hispanic mixed and most Af.</li>
            <li>In general it is not necessary for African-Americans to have super long hair.</li>
            <li>my hair grew long and really fast.</li>
            <li>had heard about using oil in your hair to revive it, but I was scared to try, thinking it counter-intuitive when I work so hard to keep my hair free of NATURAL oil.</li>
            <li>When I got back to my room, I used the mega thick growth oil like 4 or more times in a week</li>
            <li>I did try the Doo Gro Triple Strength Growth Lotion when the store was out of the Oil, and it took 3 shampoos to completely wash out--beware if you have white hair like mine.</li>
            <li>(not sure why when the rest of my family has gorgeous thick hair).</li>
            <li>cuz $6.99 is pretty over priced for me if i can find it in store for less.</li>
            <li>First off, I have also had pretty thin hair</li>
            <li>This thing made my hair itch so much and not being able to scratch it made me crazy.  </li>
            <li>dry, leaving my hair damp and overly greasy with a 1940s sheen that made me feel like I should be combing my hair with my collar popped on a leather jacket at the drive-in movies, and would weigh my hair down like I was always fresh out of the shower</li>
            <li>- so she gave it a try following all the instructions, and literally (true story from today, which prompted me to write this review) ended up late to a new career she just started, because it was so unbelievably messy and greasy in her blonde hair that she had to take a SECOND frantic shower to wash as much out as she could.</li>
            <li>I was left with no other choice than to cut it short.</li>
            <li>I used barely any and it completely destroyed my hair and caused it to be so oily that I spent ten minutes trying to rinse it out</li>
            <li>This is my second time going natural, but long story short my hair is damaged why?</li>
            <li>If you put a normal amount on your scalp every other night it shouldn&#x27;t be too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a little over a month,and my hair has grown SO much thicker.</li>

            <li> I keep a clean scalp, I don&#x27;t get dandruff or anything, but once I started using this</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really not bad at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and longer than before people are like wow your hair is even longer its GREAT!!and  very easy to use</li>
            <li> This might be good for someone who has extremely dry hair though.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and leaves my hair feeling super soft after shampooing</li>
            <li> June 17, 2012: I have continued to use this product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I also love all of the natural ingredients that this product has in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, hoping I might have some success with it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Her hair was STILL left damp and reflective [and NOT the good sort of shine that a healthy head of hair has, but more like the shine that homeless people who haven&#x27;t showered for a few months</li>
            <li> it still wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I have crotchet braids in right now</li>
            <li> Was very pleasantly surprised at what good condition it left my hair in.</li>
            <li> Overall, it did seem to make my hair thicker and more sleek, but if I were to use it again I would dump it into a little spray bottle so that I could disperse it throughout my hair more evenly and more sparingly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a test run as a hot oil treatment first before trying to add it to my regimen.</li>
            <li> But after about seven minutes my scalp just felt hot and sore</li>
            <li> Mommy is coming back :)</li>
            <li> this is an OIL, so its not something I would think most white people could use without their hair looking like it has, well, OIL in it.</li>
            <li> BTW, it is NOT difficult to shampoo out; I shampoo once and even conditon, and my hair turns out beautifully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I USE THIS TO ADD SHINE, AND FOR HOT OIL TREATMENTS.</li>
            <li> but I stopped after the first attempt.</li>
            <li> After using it once I realized how healthy, shinier, and thicker my hair felt the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff after I deep condition my hair</li>
            <li> On the back it says it&#x27;s safe on relaxed hair</li>
            <li> Got this to use as a hot oil treatment after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product will work, but unfortunately it is not.</li>
            <li> The thing about your face breaking out if you sleep in it, don&#x27;t read this review if your trying to find out information about that because unlike most people I sleep on my back so my face isn&#x27;t affected by the oil on the pillow.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it it gave me a lot if volume.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Well no i dont use the hot comb anymore</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, worked well, thank you!</li>
            <li> It is best used by people with frizz trouble or who have curly and rough hair that has management issues.</li>
            <li> The one completely positive thing about the oil is its price.</li>
            <li> Hair definitely feels stronger and even more thick and has a good shine now.</li>
            <li> I was not upset, since I figured the odds it wouldn&#x27;t work would be pretty high.</li>
            <li> I did try the Doo Gro Triple Strength Growth Lotion when the store was out of the Oil, and it took 3 shampoos to completely wash out--beware if you have white hair like mine.s product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Using this on the whole hair strands (root to tip) really helps with the hair and its dryness.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work all the time.</li>
            <li> keeps it really moist.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It has made my hair grow very well.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really like it and probably won&#x27;t try to use it again</li>
            <li> absolutely will not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a whole bottle over about 1 month~6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I just got this today in the mail, I don&#x27;t straighten or really do anything to my hair except put shampoo and conditioner in it when I&#x27;m in the shower</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put to much on or it will make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> So im going to use it this whole year</li>
            <li> makes my hair very oily</li>
            <li> your hair is really growing/ getting thicker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> If you want fast growth I would oil my scalp 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my hair look really greasy</li>
            <li> After my very first use, I noticed major improvement.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product, and a little does go a long way, (accidently used too much)</li>
            <li> [Be extremely weary of this product AND the many favorable reviews]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like many other products that are targeted towards African-American hair, this does not cause hair growth, but hair loss.</li>
            <li> ; sweet almond oil is the 3rd ingredient and thats all my nose can detect.</li>
            <li> Now, my hair is short and full.</li>
            <li> My first time going natural</li>
            <li> I usually have to cover my hair with plastic hair cover just to make sure I can stand it for at least a good ten minutes for the oil to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> and it was super flat.</li>
            <li> I didnt know it at the time, but I had developed Hypothyroidism, which will wreak absolute havoc on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Also, I got 4 new zits over the next 2 days, which I attribute to this product, since I rarely get acne.     </li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE GROWING LONG, CUT THE SPLIT ENDS FIRST!</li>
            <li> Just because my hair grew that fast with in 2 1/2 weeks does not mean you will get the same results, but these are the results I had.</li>
            <li> but i do use a hot comb or flat iron...</li>
            <li> I only used this one time (over the weekend) and it made my hair super greasy (unsurprising, since it&#x27;s oil) and gross.</li>
            <li> I recently experienced some damage to my hair due to a relaxer and an incompetent stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it couple times only and dumped it in the trash.it smells like pure soya bean oil.</li>
            <li> I put a dime size of this in maybe a tiny bit more and blow dry it, then I flat iron it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural.</li>
            <li> No this Jo that, and I completely turned away from doo gro.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so soft and succulent, I didn&#x27;t realize til my 7th twist that I had nothing but this oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not imagine all the things I&#x27;ve missed while listening to \\&quot;natural hair</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural now &amp; it is noticeably thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I tried to measure my growth so far while still in the braids and it looks like in some areas 1/2 inch already.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s really oil, obviously because its an oil based product).</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I attempted to return it and the seller (CBS Express) was completely unprofessional.</li>
            <li> BUT I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL OILS.</li>
            <li> Although It made my hair unbelievably soft, but I was at work and noticed my scalp was itching</li>
            <li> I am natural.</li>
            <li> After only 3 1/2 weeks Im already seeing how much thicker my hair is.</li>
            <li> this product promotes thick hair, it makes your hair grow healthy,</li>
            <li> To be honest I only bought this stuff because I tried doing scene hair by cutting it myself and I cut a layer of my hair clean off.</li>
            <li> Hair is more delicate than it seems so my general conclusion is use what works for YOU.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is especially formulated for African American hair or what, but I&#x27;m white / hispanic mixed and most Af.</li>
            <li> In general it is not necessary for African-Americans to have super long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair grew long and really fast.</li>
            <li> had heard about using oil in your hair to revive it, but I was scared to try, thinking it counter-intuitive when I work so hard to keep my hair free of NATURAL oil.</li>
            <li> When I got back to my room, I used the mega thick growth oil like 4 or more times in a week</li>
            <li> I did try the Doo Gro Triple Strength Growth Lotion when the store was out of the Oil, and it took 3 shampoos to completely wash out--beware if you have white hair like mine.</li>
            <li> (not sure why when the rest of my family has gorgeous thick hair).</li>
            <li> cuz $6.99 is pretty over priced for me if i can find it in store for less.</li>
            <li> First off, I have also had pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> This thing made my hair itch so much and not being able to scratch it made me crazy.  </li>
            <li> dry, leaving my hair damp and overly greasy with a 1940s sheen that made me feel like I should be combing my hair with my collar popped on a leather jacket at the drive-in movies, and would weigh my hair down like I was always fresh out of the shower</li>
            <li> - so she gave it a try following all the instructions, and literally (true story from today, which prompted me to write this review) ended up late to a new career she just started, because it was so unbelievably messy and greasy in her blonde hair that she had to take a SECOND frantic shower to wash as much out as she could.</li>
            <li> I was left with no other choice than to cut it short.</li>
            <li> I used barely any and it completely destroyed my hair and caused it to be so oily that I spent ten minutes trying to rinse it out</li>
            <li> This is my second time going natural, but long story short my hair is damaged why?</li>
            <li> If you put a normal amount on your scalp every other night it shouldn&#x27;t be too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a little over a month,and my hair has grown SO much thicker.</li>
            <li> I usually put it in my hair, wait 10 min or longer to deep condition and then wash out since I have very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li> Although she&#x27;s used countless products and has immeasurably more experience than I do, she referred to it as a mixture of pure baby oil, olive oil cooking spray, and WD-40 residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the pee-yellow disappointing grease-fest mess Doo Gro... or, DON&#x27;T GRO they should call it (unless used motor oil causes clinical hair growth).</li>
            <li> I AM GROWING MY HAIR LONG, SO I AM USING THIS WITH BOAR HAIR BRUSHES, WOODEN COMBS, AND RENPURE HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> and it says you can use it daily on dry hair, which is what I did.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product as I have a very thin Asian hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I am white and have thin, baby-fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> Product Arrived on time using this Product for growing your hair is just off the charts my hair has grown so long since using this Product.yes</li>
            <li> took a  long to time to get her, hope it works</li>
            <li> About a year ago, my formerly oily hair became extremely dry, brittle, frizzy, unmanageable, static-y, refused to grow, and was shedding at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and my hair was previously damaged from over processing.</li>
            <li> My scalp was red and small red bumps showed up not long after.</li>
            <li> I assumed the bleach was finally taking its toll, so I went in the opposite direction and started coloring my hair very dark brown.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, and does the job, and brought my hair back to life, however, DO NOT SLEEP WITH IT ON YOUR HAIR, kind of common sense, but i fail to realize that if this chemical gets on your pillow, and gets rubbed onto your face, you&#x27;ll break out.. BADLY.</li>
            <li> Dry hair, dry ends.</li>
            <li> Not once did my hair feel dry.</li>
            <li> and when my hair looks dry</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS FOR DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR HAIR ( SHEDDING, DAMAGED HAIR, DRY HAIR)</li>
            <li> and then I dry my hair with a towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had split ends even though I never brush my hair until it&#x27;s fully dry.</li>
            <li> I AM CAUCASIAN WITH DARK BLONDE HAIR.</li>
            <li> It would also eventually aggregate at the bottom of my hair shafts and pool into these puddles of gooey oil and then ultimately streak down my forehead and neck (</li>
            <li> Since using it my hair is about halfway down my back.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a little bit of this.</li>
            <li> hair products work on my extremely course, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It really works my hair is no longer thin.  </li>
            <li> my hair already grows fast but the thin spots are no longer there</li>
            <li> While wet, I start applying this oil to my scalp.</li>
            <li> One of the few that actually seems to help!  </li>
            <li> One thing that I do not really like about this product is sometimes</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought this product after another tearful session with my curling iron (I use to tame the dry frizz), thinking I had nothing left to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So only being able to afford the Mega Thick Growth Oil, I have been using it for 2 and a half weeks and have grown an inch of hair back from having a bad sew-in and having to butcher chop my hair.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using other products for thickening and faster growth</li>
            <li> It might work for other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it can be used everyday, but I only use it once or twice a week because it makes my hair feel a little greasy.</li>
            <li> She too had been suffering hair loss worse than mine and said that the Doo Gro product line had helped her alot, and it did, after using various products on her hair, I could feel and see the thickness and growth of her hair coming back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its my hair texture (I&#x27;m black and mexican) which is thick n curly but not real course or what</li>
            <li> Exercise your common sense, and use this product only at home.</li>
            <li> it has helped my hair grow a bit faster but meh its not worth the agony for me.</li>
            <li> this review is ONLY for the Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil.</li>
            <li> this review is ONLY for the Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil.</li>
            <li> Oil can get down between your hair when braid it</li>
            <li> it weighs down your hair.</li>
            <li> I hate how oily this product is; I haven&#x27;t seen any growth with this oil in the last month and it runs everywhere if you don&#x27;t quickly rub it in the scalp; I won&#x27;t order this item again; I foolishly reordered this product because of the rave reviews online.</li>
            <li> NO matter how LITTLE I used - it was like the liquid metal from the T1000 in Terminator 2, the particles would find each other and decide to make greasefalls on my head)...</li>
            <li> a lot less hair was coming out when i picked it</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of previous experience.  </li>
            <li> They are making fools of Black people.</li>
            <li> None of these companies that are geared towards Black hair are black owned.  </li>
            <li> It use to be to my shoulders and now after about 3 and a half weeks it has grew 2 inches.</li>
            <li> and my hair has less breakage when I run my hand through it, because it stops breakage</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product--I dont see how anyone could fail to benefit from its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> COSTS.est mess</li>
            <li> I used to wear tight headbands all of the time</li>
            <li> Or I would apply a little to my fingertips and massage just a little bit into my scalp.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair and it worked for a little while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a longer way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s itchy a little</li>
            <li> and the smell was a little funky.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever relaxed your hair, you know that you need to not scratch your hair for a little while before</li>
            <li> The oil made my hair a little too oily though.</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing my hair</li>
            <li> and I used it everyday that week.  </li>
            <li> It was worse than any relaxer burn, it actually made me cry.  </li>
            <li> The next day behind my ears where the oil went was flakey.  </li>
            <li> If I could give it less than a star I would!</li>
            <li> but it usually makes my scalp tingle for a little then stop</li>
            <li> but if it does not work for you and you are not African American, PLEASE don&#x27;t give it a bad review.</li>
            <li> and my hair has always grown extremely slow because the longest it has been was a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I usually massage it into my scalp 2x wk</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> im not sure.</li>
            <li> I have to admit it did help a lot with hair breakage, but I guess it was just a little irritating to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I received a rude response of &amp;#34;absolutely not.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> at least now we now why they call it Goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first when I got the hair cut, I felt very sad and my hair looked weird</li>
            <li> I dont think it&#x27;s supposed to grow longer, but instead grow thick.</li>
            <li> And my hair is thick and longer.</li>
            <li> Doo Gro mega thick stopped the breaking in 24 hours get this product if you want to save your hair</li>
            <li> but i notice a difference on how thick my hair is now</li>
            <li> would never (and I mean NEVER)</li>
            <li> tried using the Doo Gro &amp;#34;Mega Thick Growth Oil&amp;#34; (hard to type that without laughing after having experience with this bottle of grease) for a few weeks with utmost consistency, and was so underwhelmed in every way it is hard to decide what claim to start with where it failed</li>
            <li> My hair used to be long until the cold weather severely dealt with it.</li>
            <li> You will notice how thick it becomes and when it starts growing, watch out!</li>
            <li> do not use this product if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> and it kept itching worse and worse and started burning.</li>
            <li> PEOPLE SHOULDN&#x27;T GIVE FALSE HOPES.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DON&#x27;T. ALSO, I HAD AN EXTREMELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW FOAM HAIR COLORS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking badly, every time I combed or ran my fingers through it I would have at least 20 - 40 strands break off from the root.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Shocked that a company could respond so rudely.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Trial and error is just part of the game!</li>
            <li> cause it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> I will no longer be using this product I think, despite all the bad this product does keep the frizz away and adds shine and softness.</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews and I have had it in my hair for about an hour now</li>
            <li> just irritated my head so bad.</li>
            <li> This time :(</li>
            <li> THEY ARE REALLY REALLY BAD!</li>
            <li> have - absolutely disgusting]</li>
            <li> All in all, this is QUITE LITERALLY the worst example of &amp;#34;SNAKE OIL&amp;#34; I have ever seen, maybe they meant snake-oil and not growth-oil?</li>
            <li> All in all, this is QUITE LITERALLY the worst example of &amp;#34;SNAKE OIL&amp;#34; I have ever seen, maybe they meant snake-oil and not growth-oil?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is also a great product.  It really works my hair is no longer thin.  It worked for me in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I only used this one time (over the weekend) and it made my hair super greasy (unsurprising, since it&#x27;s oil) and gross. I left it in for about 24hrs and had to lather my hair with shampoo 2x to get it out. Also, I got 4 new zits over the next 2 days, which I attribute to this product, since I rarely get acne.     Overall, it did seem to make my hair thicker and more sleek, but if I were to use it again I would dump it into a little spray bottle so that I could disperse it throughout my hair more evenly and more sparingly. Or I would apply a little to my fingertips and massage just a little bit into my scalp. I would also recommend tying your hair back so the oil doesn&#x27;t get on your face and cause you to break out.</li>
            <li> The hair product touts itself as a hair growth/thickness stimulant: on this count, I find the oil lacking. It is best used by people with frizz trouble or who have curly and rough hair that has management issues. The one completely positive thing about the oil is its price.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and longer than before people are like wow your hair is even longer its GREAT!!and  very easy to use</li>
            <li> this product promotes thick hair, it makes your hair grow healthy, perfect for rebuilding and strong body doo gro has changed my hair for the better</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally beauty supply store locally. I wanted to give it a test run as a hot oil treatment first before trying to add it to my regimen. Within a minute after applying there was some tingling but I just assumed that was the tea tree oil. But after about seven minutes my scalp just felt hot and sore so I immediately washed it out. My scalp was red and small red bumps showed up not long after. I have used a majority of the oils listed as ingredients individually and have not shown any sensitivity so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s this product over an actual allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week, i started using Doo gro because i chemically damaged my hair and it thinned out in areas so i had to chop it all off (im a guy). so I&#x27;ve been using  for a week like i said and i have to say my hair has been growing faster my hair already grows fast but the thin spots are no longer there so i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Oil can get down between your hair when braid it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this thing makes your hair grow or stimulates follicles...-and I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m natural. 100% 4a-4b and ladies, we know what that means. Dry hair, dry ends. Last night my mom bought this for her hair, she&#x27;s relaxed. While going into my journey, there were so many damn rules. No this Jo that, and I completely turned away from doo gro. So my mom buying this, I put on this front I did not care for it. Later last night, I went to wash my hair. I decide to do a twistout on my hair. While wet, I start applying this oil to my scalp. By accident, not realizing I forgot to put my Cantu Leave In, I started detangling...and I did it with ease. This product made my hair so soft and succulent, I didn&#x27;t realize til my 7th twist that I had nothing but this oil in my hair. Using this on the whole hair strands (root to tip) really helps with the hair and its dryness. Not once did my hair feel dry. Not imagine all the things I&#x27;ve missed while listening to \\&quot;natural hair rules\\&quot;?? Screw that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doo gro? Mommy is coming back :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. Apply to the scalp, rub it in with finger pads, and to your preference, apply more to the rest of hair.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  One of the few that actually seems to help!  I could noticeably see strength and growth in my hair!</li>
            <li> First off, I am white and have thin, baby-fine, long hair. About a year ago, my formerly oily hair became extremely dry, brittle, frizzy, unmanageable, static-y, refused to grow, and was shedding at an alarming rate. I didnt know it at the time, but I had developed Hypothyroidism, which will wreak absolute havoc on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bleached my hair for 15 years because of going prematurely gray (another symptom of low thyroid). I assumed the bleach was finally taking its toll, so I went in the opposite direction and started coloring my hair very dark brown. Although this did help bring some life back to my hair, I still wasnt getting the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard about using oil in your hair to revive it, but I was scared to try, thinking it counter-intuitive when I work so hard to keep my hair free of NATURAL oil. I broke down and bought this product after another tearful session with my curling iron (I use to tame the dry frizz), thinking I had nothing left to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product simply changed my life. After my very first use, I noticed major improvement. My hair is shiny, bouncy, frizz-free, and experiencing re-growth. Its also enabled me to begin lightening my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is an OIL, so its not something I would think most white people could use without their hair looking like it has, well, OIL in it. I put it on at night before bed, drenching my hair and scalp with it, and wash out the next day. I wouldnt dream of leaving the house with this on my hair--again, its an OIL. Exercise your common sense, and use this product only at home. BTW, it is NOT difficult to shampoo out; I shampoo once and even conditon, and my hair turns out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also happen to love the smell; sweet almond oil is the 3rd ingredient and thats all my nose can detect. I highly recommend this product--I dont see how anyone could fail to benefit from its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE June 17, 2012: I have continued to use this product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better. For those using this for re-growth alone: it may take a couple of months to see results so give it time to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to stress this review is ONLY for the Doo Gro Mega Thick Growth Oil. I did try the Doo Gro Triple Strength Growth Lotion when the store was out of the Oil, and it took 3 shampoos to completely wash out--beware if you have white hair like mine.s product steadily since first leaving this review and my hair has never looked better.

            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work all the time. I tried it on my hair and it worked for a little while. My sister tried it on her hair and it works better on her hair than mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 months now and I love it. I&#x27;m African American and my hair was previously damaged from over processing. I wear my hair natural now &amp; it is noticeably thicker and longer. A little goes a longer way. I usually massage it into my scalp 2x wk and when my hair looks dry I use a dime-size portion and rub from root to ends. i love this product and would def recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I use this product with my extensions. I&#x27;ve been using other products for thickening and faster growth so I cannot attribute my results to this product but it is a great oil to keep your scalp moist when using extensions. I squeeze the tip into areas of my scalp through my weaves and massage it in 3-4 times a week. keeps it really moist. I also use the Doo Gro Anti Itch oil which works wonders. Controls itch for about 4 days. Can also be used as a great hot oil treatment. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE HAIR OIL BESIDES MY JOJOBA OIL. I USE THIS TO ADD SHINE, AND FOR HOT OIL TREATMENTS. I AM CAUCASIAN WITH DARK BLONDE HAIR. I AM GROWING MY HAIR LONG, SO I AM USING THIS WITH BOAR HAIR BRUSHES, WOODEN COMBS, AND RENPURE HAIR PRODUCTS. I RECOMMEND THIS FOR DRY HAIR. IF YOU ARE GROWING LONG, CUT THE SPLIT ENDS FIRST! YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR TIME IF YOU DON&#x27;T. ALSO, I HAD AN EXTREMELY AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH THE NEW FOAM HAIR COLORS THAT ARE ON THE MARKET. DO NOT BUY THEM. THEY ARE REALLY REALLY BAD! EMAIL ME IF YOU WOULD LIKE MY STORY. IT TOOK 3+ MONTHS FOR MY HAIR TO RECOVER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been only using thi product for only a week and My hair has definitely grown! I have crotchet braids in right now but I can tell the difference. It&#x27;s itchy a little but that is because your hair is growing faster. I tried to measure my growth so far while still in the braids and it looks like in some areas 1/2 inch already. Im quite impressed by such quick results and I look forward to seeing the results when I take this out! :)</li>
            <li> I have trouble growing my hair but when I used this product, my hair was starting to grow like never before! I have been using this (Doo Gro) for years. It is the only brand i will use in my hair. This oil makes your hair shiney but not too greasy and thats why i love it! Of Course use it sparingly, dont drench your head in it! lol For those who dont know, this was made for African-Americans. It works for others too but if it does not work for you and you are not African American, PLEASE don&#x27;t give it a bad review.</li>
            <li> This oil is very good, within two weeks my front hair has grown over an inch. my hair is a lot ,ore thicker and healther. I use it every morning and night</li>
            <li> After suffering hair loss within the last 6 months, my aunt (relaxed) recommended Doo Gro products. She too had been suffering hair loss worse than mine and said that the Doo Gro product line had helped her alot, and it did, after using various products on her hair, I could feel and see the thickness and growth of her hair coming back. So only being able to afford the Mega Thick Growth Oil, I have been using it for 2 and a half weeks and have grown an inch of hair back from having a bad sew-in and having to butcher chop my hair. I am happy with the product, and a little does go a long way, (accidently used too much) but I love this PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote. Just because my hair grew that fast with in 2 1/2 weeks does not mean you will get the same results, but these are the results I had.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product 3 times now and I really like the way it leaves my hair soft and manageable. It actually makes your hair thicker as advertised. Good product.</li>
            <li> I will say this, it definetly made my hair thicker and stronger. a lot less hair was coming out when i picked it</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I add it to some of the products that I already own. It has made my hair grow very well. I also love all of the natural ingredients that this product has in it.</li>
            <li> Bought this product in the store and was wondering if anyone else had this itching problem. I don&#x27;t know if its my hair texture (I&#x27;m black and mexican) which is thick n curly but not real course or what but there are times I scratch to the point where I&#x27;m bleeding. Now I have resorted to pating my hair like I have weave in it cause it hurts so bad. I will no longer be using this product I think, despite all the bad this product does keep the frizz away and adds shine and softness. yes...it has helped my hair grow a bit faster but meh its not worth the agony for me. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S if it itches grab some mittens.</li>
            <li> First off, I have also had pretty thin hair and I&#x27;m 27 (not sure why when the rest of my family has gorgeous thick hair). I read a lot of the reviews on this product and was really excited to try it but I stopped after the first attempt. I used barely any and it completely destroyed my hair and caused it to be so oily that I spent ten minutes trying to rinse it out and the smell was a little funky. It might work for other&#x27;s but I didn&#x27;t really like it and probably won&#x27;t try to use it again</li>
            <li> I use this product for my waves and I have noticed my hair getting thicker. I dont think it&#x27;s supposed to grow longer, but instead grow thick. With waves, I used to have what looked liked a bald spot because of the part on my crown. Now it&#x27;s gone! This also gives my hair a wonderful shine! Not the best smell, but oh well.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually makes your hair grow. I love this stuff. I use this for when I&#x27;m not going out (it&#x27;s really oil, obviously because its an oil based product). Then I use their leave-in conditioner before I go out. Just having the product in your hair makes your hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> Great, wonderful product I love that it&#x27;s a oil and not a grease. It won&#x27;t clog my scalp and I only have to use a little bit of this.</li>
            <li> he utilizado el aceite por varios dias; lo hago cada ocho dias lo dejo en la noche en el cuero cabelludo, hago masajes circulares y luego lo lavo al dia siguiente, he tenido excelentes resultados pues mi cabello recobro vida, esta mas saludable y manejable, y ha parado la caida.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving the product.</li>
            <li> Omg!!! do not use this product if you have thin hair. it weighs down your hair. absolutely will not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil is wayyyy better:)</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, hoping I might have some success with it. Unfortunately it did not work for me at all. I was not upset, since I figured the odds it wouldn&#x27;t work would be pretty high. I attempted to return it and the seller (CBS Express) was completely unprofessional. I politely asked if I could return the item for a refund, since it did not work as advertised. I received a rude response of &amp;#34;absolutely not.&amp;#34;  Shocked that a company could respond so rudely. The remainder of their email was equally as unprofessional. Will never purchase from CBS Express again.</li>
            <li> I recently experienced some damage to my hair due to a relaxer and an incompetent stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I took control of my hair care I decided I needed to do something to get my hair back on track.  My research indicated that these products would help moisturize, stimulate growth and occlude all and any shedding.  I was amazed and you will be as well.  Ethnic women....you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This oil is not greasy and gives your hair a great texture and shine. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t feel like you put oil in your hair. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Got this from my local rite aid but had to come write a review and let people know how great it is. I have baby fine thin hair and it was so damaged from dying it all the time. After using it once I realized how healthy, shinier, and thicker my hair felt the next day. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it does make your hair feel oily, so I use it before bed and shower the next morning. But it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, and does the job, and brought my hair back to life, however, DO NOT SLEEP WITH IT ON YOUR HAIR, kind of common sense, but i fail to realize that if this chemical gets on your pillow, and gets rubbed onto your face, you&#x27;ll break out.. BADLY.</li>
            <li> Product Arrived on time using this Product for growing your hair is just off the charts my hair has grown so long since using this Product.yes i will reorder again thank so much.have a great day.</li>
            <li> [Be extremely weary of this product AND the many favorable reviews]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the Doo Gro &amp;#34;Mega Thick Growth Oil&amp;#34; (hard to type that without laughing after having experience with this bottle of grease) for a few weeks with utmost consistency, and was so underwhelmed in every way it is hard to decide what claim to start with where it failed miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would never (and I mean NEVER) dry, leaving my hair damp and overly greasy with a 1940s sheen that made me feel like I should be combing my hair with my collar popped on a leather jacket at the drive-in movies, and would weigh my hair down like I was always fresh out of the shower (if I used Vaseline to shampoo my hair that is). It would also eventually aggregate at the bottom of my hair shafts and pool into these puddles of gooey oil and then ultimately streak down my forehead and neck (NO matter how LITTLE I used - it was like the liquid metal from the T1000 in Terminator 2, the particles would find each other and decide to make greasefalls on my head)... at least now we now why they call it Goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave up and asked my wife if she would like to try it before I could joyfully throw it away - so she gave it a try following all the instructions, and literally (true story from today, which prompted me to write this review) ended up late to a new career she just started, because it was so unbelievably messy and greasy in her blonde hair that she had to take a SECOND frantic shower to wash as much out as she could. Her hair was STILL left damp and reflective [and NOT the good sort of shine that a healthy head of hair has, but more like the shine that homeless people who haven&#x27;t showered for a few months have - absolutely disgusting] Although she&#x27;s used countless products and has immeasurably more experience than I do, she referred to it as a mixture of pure baby oil, olive oil cooking spray, and WD-40 residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the pee-yellow disappointing grease-fest mess Doo Gro... or, DON&#x27;T GRO they should call it (unless used motor oil causes clinical hair growth). All in all, this is QUITE LITERALLY the worst example of &amp;#34;SNAKE OIL&amp;#34; I have ever seen, maybe they meant snake-oil and not growth-oil? AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS.est mess Doo Gro... or, DON&#x27;T GRO they should call it (unless used motor oil causes clinical hair growth). All in all, this is QUITE LITERALLY the worst example of &amp;#34;SNAKE OIL&amp;#34; I have ever seen, maybe they meant snake-oil and not growth-oil? AVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS.</li>
            <li> Guess what? I found a site that&#x27;s giving PSN codes away for free! [...]hair very very very good stuff too</li>
            <li> PEOPLE SHOULDN&#x27;T GIVE FALSE HOPES. THATS NOT NICE.&lt;br /&gt;HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE PROMISED YOU. NICE RESULTS,PROMISING YOU.</li>
            <li> This product iched my scalp.I don&#x27;t know it will do that. I told my co-worker she told me that Do Gro oil have A no ich product.</li>
            <li> I used a whole bottle over about 1 month~6 weeks. I have to admit it did help a lot with hair breakage, but I guess it was just a little irritating to my scalp. I keep a clean scalp, I don&#x27;t get dandruff or anything, but once I started using this I had my nails in my head all the time. Once I stopped using it my scalp breathed a sigh of relief! :) Also, less than wonderful smell. But it&#x27;s really not bad at all. Even with the itching, it did bring back a lot of elasticity to my hair. But I use Kemi Oil and that works for me. Hair is more delicate than it seems so my general conclusion is use what works for YOU. Trial and error is just part of the game!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27; like this oil.it&#x27;s greesy and don&#x27;t smell good.used it couple times only and dumped it in the trash.it smells like pure soya bean oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of previous experience.  I had stopped using it and decided to return to the product.  When you find something that works, it is best to stick with it. I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing. I have used one bottle. And my hair is thick and longer. I went to a baby shower recently and everyone thought i had extentions on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I have only been using this for a little over a month,and my hair has grown SO much thicker. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY HAIR GROWTH BUT I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL OILS. I APPLY IT TO MY SCALP, EDGES, NAPE AND HAIR LIGHTLY. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY HAIR IS STRONGER, THICKER AND HEALTHIER. I ALSO USE IT ON MY DAUGHTER HAIR. IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR HAIR ( SHEDDING, DAMAGED HAIR, DRY HAIR) GIVE THIS A TRY. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this stuff is especially formulated for African American hair or what, but I&#x27;m white / hispanic mixed and most Af.Am. hair products work on my extremely course, dry hair. This stuff was AWFUL!!! It&#x27;s SO greasy I had to shampoo my hair FIVE TIMES TO GET IT OUT! Which caused even more damaged!! If I could give it less than a star I would! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> My hair used to be long until the cold weather severely dealt with it. I was left with no other choice than to cut it short. At first when I got the hair cut, I felt very sad and my hair looked weird cause I just relaxed it and it was super flat. When I got back to my room, I used the mega thick growth oil like 4 or more times in a week and I realized it made my hair shine and added volume to my hair. Now, my hair is short and full. I love this product! Although it might not work for eveyone but it surely does work for me...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff after I deep condition my hair I put a dime size of this in maybe a tiny bit more and blow dry it, then I flat iron it and it feels so soft,shinny and silky. It does wonders and my hair seems to be getting thicker &amp; longer as well.</li>
            <li> On the back it says it&#x27;s safe on relaxed hair (which is what I have) and it says you can use it daily on dry hair, which is what I did.  I got this a week before I planned to relax my hair and I used it everyday that week.  If you&#x27;ve ever relaxed your hair, you know that you need to not scratch your hair for a little while before because if you do the relaxer will burn you.  This thing made my hair itch so much and not being able to scratch it made me crazy.  A couple days before relaxing I decided to put this anti itch thing in my hair. I don&#x27;t remember the name but it usually makes my scalp tingle for a little then stop but this time it felt like fire in my hair.  It was worse than any relaxer burn, it actually made me cry.  I had only put it on my nape and it became red and sore.  I had to wash my hair that day and I didn&#x27;t relax it until almost two weeks after. The next day behind my ears where the oil went was flakey.  After a day or two more the hair on my nape was flakey too.  I had to go back to school like that and it was just horrible.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker but it did stop shedding but atter that week I had a lot if shedding so it still wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Like many other products that are targeted towards African-American hair, this does not cause hair growth, but hair loss. I would like to know if they are putting hair remover in this stuff. They are making fools of Black people. None of these companies that are geared towards Black hair are black owned.  In general it is not necessary for African-Americans to have super long hair. Castor oil and products from the rainforest (Gemzon) work better.</li>
            <li> I hate how oily this product is; I haven&#x27;t seen any growth with this oil in the last month and it runs everywhere if you don&#x27;t quickly rub it in the scalp; I won&#x27;t order this item again; I foolishly reordered this product because of the rave reviews online.</li>
            <li> Got this to use as a hot oil treatment after reading reviews. Was very pleasantly surprised at what good condition it left my hair in. Great to put on and use with a heat cap as well! I usually put it in my hair, wait 10 min or longer to deep condition and then wash out since I have very fine but thick hair. If I left it in, it&#x27;d look greasy. Hair definitely feels stronger and even more thick and has a good shine now.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product as I have a very thin Asian hair. I was hoping that this product will work, but unfortunately it is not. It does makes my hair shinier, but it does not seem to help me grow any hair yet - after 6 months used. One thing that I do not really like about this product is sometimes I feel that the smell is too strong, and I almost can&#x27;t stand it. I usually have to cover my hair with plastic hair cover just to make sure I can stand it for at least a good ten minutes for the oil to be absorbed. Would I get this product again? I don&#x27;t think so. I think my search for hair growth product is still on.</li>
            <li> I just got this today in the mail, I don&#x27;t straighten or really do anything to my hair except put shampoo and conditioner in it when I&#x27;m in the shower and then I dry my hair with a towel. I&#x27;ve always had split ends even though I never brush my hair until it&#x27;s fully dry. To be honest I only bought this stuff because I tried doing scene hair by cutting it myself and I cut a layer of my hair clean off. It started to grow back though and my hair has always grown extremely slow because the longest it has been was a little past my shoulders. I read the bad reviews and I have had it in my hair for about an hour now and there&#x27;s no itching. I didn&#x27;t expect any results from one hour of using it though lol. The thing about your face breaking out if you sleep in it, don&#x27;t read this review if your trying to find out information about that because unlike most people I sleep on my back so my face isn&#x27;t affected by the oil on the pillow. I will update tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white and bought this after I cut all of my hair off. I used it for days, once a day but stopped. Although It made my hair unbelievably soft, but I was at work and noticed my scalp was itching and it kept itching worse and worse and started burning. Had to wash my hair 3 times in one shower to get it all out, but that isn&#x27;t surprising since its an oil and not the problem. just irritated my head so bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff will grow your hair.  You will notice how thick it becomes and when it starts growing, watch out!</li>
            <li> When I first applied it it gave me a lot if volume. Don&#x27;t put to much on or it will make your hair greasy. Anyways, in 2 weeks my hair has gotten thicker and longer. It use to be to my shoulders and now after about 3 and a half weeks it has grew 2 inches. If you put a normal amount on your scalp every other night it shouldn&#x27;t be too greasy.</li>
            <li> Its an okay product. Nourishes the hair but not for me..</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am natural. This is my second time going natural, but long story short my hair is damaged why? im not sure. My first time going natural my hair grew long and really fast. This time :( blah not at all.  Anyhow my best friend gave me a bottle of this stuff and i started to see a difference in days. I use it all over my head when need. So im going to use it this whole year and we will see. Still no perm but i do use a hot comb or flat iron...Well no i dont use the hot comb anymore cuz i gave myself a ball spot in the back of my head lol..but try it Doo Grow works!</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking badly, every time I combed or ran my fingers through it I would have at least 20 - 40 strands break off from the root. Doo Gro mega thick stopped the breaking in 24 hours get this product if you want to save your hair</li>
            <li> Definitely helps your hair grow</li>
            <li> No too good..gave me dandruff</li>
            <li> the oil works nicely keeps teh hair with shine and moisture</li>
            <li> makes my hair very oily but i notice a difference on how thick my hair is now</li>
            <li> I bought this from a grocery store and decided to try it, it&#x27;s been a week now I noticed it made my spilt ends stronger and thicker and my hair has less breakage when I run my hand through it, because it stops breakage have been able to see more length will update after a month</li>
            <li> This is a really good hair oil. After only 3 1/2 weeks Im already seeing how much thicker my hair is. Only thing is I foumd this oil at my local beauty supply store for $3.50 So I&#x27; d rather buy it from the store cuz $6.99 is pretty over priced for me if i can find it in store for less.</li>
            <li> like it , seems working</li>
            <li> took a  long to time to get her, hope it works</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in February. Before using the product my hair was at my shoulders. Since using it my hair is about halfway down my back. I started seeing growth about 1 month after using it however. People would also tell me &amp;#34;wow your hair is really growing/ getting thicker&amp;#34;. If you want fast growth I would oil my scalp 2-3 times a week. Product smells good too</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my hair look really greasy sometimes but I honestly don&#x27;t even care because it&#x27;s really making my hair grow. I used to wear tight headbands all of the time and I noticed my hair was getting thinner up front... I&#x27;ve probably been using this for about a month and I&#x27;m loving the results and I&#x27;m not the only one to notice!</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and arrived on time in perfect condition. The oil made my hair a little too oily though. It says on the bottle that it can be used everyday, but I only use it once or twice a week because it makes my hair feel a little greasy. This might be good for someone who has extremely dry hair though. I purchased this to help my hair grow and for split ends. It does help my ends, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, worked well, thank you!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it is helping my hair grow yet.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and leaves my hair feeling super soft after shampooing I haven&#x27;t seen growth because I bearly have 1 week using it but It is a really good product. :)</li>
