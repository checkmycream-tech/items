            <li>Cute over a bright color :) It is a little thin</li>
            <li>Not enough dots, most of the Polish was clear.</li>
            <li>(Due to the amount of polish I had to put on to get more than 5 dots per nail.)</li>
            <li>No shimmer or sparkle but lots of color liked using it with hot pink and white gel underneath.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute, but too few to count.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this to make fun french tips</li>
            <li>It is a very young looking polish and can be worn with a variety of colors.</li>
            <li>This is my first gelish purchase and probably my last.</li>
            <li>It looks like little sprinkles and is adorable over a pink, blue or white color.</li>
            <li>Was hard to give it a 5 star since I received the mini bottle of polish instead of the full size.  </li>

            <li> Was hard to give it a 5 star since I received the mini bottle of polish instead of the full size.  </li>
            <li> However, the dot coverage is not nearly as good as the picture suggests and this was really quite hard to get the dots evenly distributed, even more so than other glitter type gelish polishes i have used</li>
            <li> I gave this polish to my daughter as a Easter present with a lot of other polishes</li>
            <li> Clear, messy polish with a few dots that slid to the sides of my nails before I could cure them.</li>
            <li> Adds a little extra touch to plain nail color.  </li>
            <li> This color is like little rainbow confetti pieces.  </li>
            <li> and they were THICK to get the dots off...</li>
            <li> you are going to have some thick nails.</li>
            <li> Downside is to get the effect it is supposed to have, have to put on fairly thick ...</li>
            <li> The base is clear.  </li>
            <li> I decided to do two coats over just the base coat and the result reminded me a bit of Jackson Pollack&#x27;s artwork.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> my nails looked horrible.).</li>

            <li> Love it!! Great for accent nails</li>
            <li> I gave this polish to my daughter as a Easter present with a lot of other polishes and she love this one so much that she put it on for Easter. It would be great for parties too. It arrive quickly. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love this color. Just the perfect amount of fun to add to any solid color! Works great for nail art designs as well. This product lasts and last and will grow out before it ever chips off!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Clear, messy polish with a few dots that slid to the sides of my nails before I could cure them. (Due to the amount of polish I had to put on to get more than 5 dots per nail.) This is my first gelish purchase and probably my last.</li>
            <li> This color is like little rainbow confetti pieces.  It is not shiny like glitter at all.  It is VERY cool.</li>
            <li> While I LOVE Gelish and doing my own gel nails, I&#x27;m not in love with this particular &#x27;color&#x27;.  In order to have anywhere close to the amount of &#x27;dots&#x27;, you have to apply about two hundred coats.  (Okay, so I did three and they were THICK to get the dots off...my nails looked horrible.). The dots sink to the bottom of the bottle and there is just simply not enough.  They&#x27;re cute, but too few to count.  These are matte colored dots, not glitter.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend, her nails turned out great.</li>
            <li> Fun  for a nail accent or all fingers! Very pretty</li>
            <li> Best gel, gelish delivers a very good quality gel, not cheap but worth it</li>

            <li> Not enough dots, most of the Polish was clear.</li>
            <li> I found this to be quite adorable. It looks like sprinkles but like another reviewer stated, I&#x27;d you want overall coverage you are going to have some thick nails. That being said I find that if I lay the bottle on its side before I did my nails, I got a bit more of the sprinkles. I decided to do two coats over just the base coat and the result reminded me a bit of Jackson Pollack&#x27;s artwork. Very cute.</li>
            <li> This polish has become one of my favorites! I love all the colorful dots and it covers very well. I&#x27;ve used this to make fun french tips and I&#x27;ve also used this to add &amp;#34;sprinkles&amp;#34; to my cupcake/birthday nails. Lots of fun!</li>
            <li> Cute over a bright color :) It is a little thin so be sure to wipe the brush off before you use it!</li>
            <li> Love this gel...lots of colors in it..matte dots of fine looking confetti. Downside is to get the effect it is supposed to have, have to put on fairly thick ...probably need more dots in it so you get plenty on the brush when applying. Vendor was great and very quick with shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this as a topper.  It is a very young looking polish and can be worn with a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I was not to sure about this until I put it over the top of Gossip Girl and it is adorable!!!!</li>
            <li> Adds a little extra touch to plain nail color.  The base is clear.  I put it on a Lavendar shade and it looked awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look like the have multi colored sprinkles on them so cute. No shimmer or sparkle but lots of color liked using it with hot pink and white gel underneath.</li>
