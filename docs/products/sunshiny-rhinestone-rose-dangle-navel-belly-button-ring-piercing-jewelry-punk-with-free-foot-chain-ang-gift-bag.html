            <li> Just came in the mail surprised the hell out of me wasn&#x27;t expecting this belly ring today but i love it and i can actually wear it my piercing doesnt feel sore yet great product for the money time of delivery was a bit long for me though</li>
            <li> I order this belly ring because i thought it was beautiful and when the shipment arrived it wasnt even this one. They sent me a blue butterfly one. I didnt not pay for a butterfly i wanted this one</li>
            <li> I just got it today and it&#x27;s perfect! It&#x27;s even cuter than shown in the picture! It&#x27;s not too heavy on my belly button either unlike most of the dangly rings that I own.</li>
            <li> Broke on me before I even got to wear it</li>
            <li> this belly button ring is gorgeous! it&#x27;s light weight, and the delivery was so fast!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but looks pretty. Haven&#x27;t had the chance to put it on though because my piercing is still healing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute I love it!</li>
            <li> Got it for my girl . A couple months ago and she still has it brand new. It was worth buying</li>
            <li> It broke on the second day</li>
            <li> This belly button ring was absolutely Gorgeous!!! Came a few weeks early too! Expected it to be really cheap because of the price but it wasn&#x27;t at all!!!</li>
            <li> this was a birthday gift. she loved it</li>
            <li> Looked great gf loves it.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful I&#x27;m in love !</li>
            <li> I love this ring so much!!! Super cute, lightweight for a dangling ring, and it is super good quality! I have worn it everyday ever since I got it back in June. Definitely recommend this ring!</li>
            <li> This is the cutest thing ever and it manages to face the right way when in the piercing. It was very nice with my piercing and didn&#x27;t cause any issues! This is precious, adorable, and a great choice for your jewelry collection. By only issue with it, I don&#x27;t care about this but some might, is that the red rose fades each time exposed to water. Before wearing it for the first time I went to sterilize it in a bowl of warm salt water and the water turned red. Over time (about two months of wearing it) the red has really faded but it&#x27;s still obviously red and I really don&#x27;t mind this change. It&#x27;s seriously a darling piece!</li>
            <li> I love my belly ring, its pretty and doesnt look cheap! BUT I was upset that it came like three weeks late...</li>
            <li> Super cute! No problems. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone!</li>
