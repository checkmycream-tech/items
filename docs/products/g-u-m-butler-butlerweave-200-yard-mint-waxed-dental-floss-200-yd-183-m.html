            <li>This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>My dentist used to offer samples of this great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that good.</li>
            <li>Also, the container is vertical and fairly compact.    </li>
            <li>so was delighted when I found it online.  </li>
            <li>good quality by the way..</li>
            <li>hummm good stuff</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Got this a sample from my dentist and it was so superior in cleaning and strength that I immediately started hunting for it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product by GUM.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave wax residue on your teeth, which is very important!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more!</li>
            <li>Great price and strong.  </li>
            <li>and I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These container are nice too.</li>
            <li>Got a sample from dentist and liked it, so I had to find it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, I discovered the GUM floss, which (1) has a superior method for winding the floss up so that it pulls out very smoothly/consistently,(2) has a thickness/surface that is perfect for cleaning my teeth, and (3)</li>
            <li>It does a good job without breaking and is easy to grip.</li>
            <li>The trade off, I suppose, is that it is also very strong.</li>
            <li>It rarely breaks while I am flossing and it does a great job at removing food particles from my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li>This floss is sturdy and does not break or shred as easily as many brands.  </li>
            <li>Even though it is waxed, it is not silky smooth like Glide, and therefore cleans my teeth more effectively.  </li>
            <li>Unlike J&amp;J Reach floss, this stuff is composed of more lightweight strands, which tend to fray and then get stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li>It is not only the best, but also the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>this is cheap but durable!</li>
            <li>So my coworkers don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m about to floss my teeth while I&#x27;m at my desk.  :-).</li>
            <li>This is a better product to packaging ratio.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful because of a very different weave.  </li>
            <li>Better quality</li>
            <li>Better than ribbon floss.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>If you floss regularly (and I hope you do), this is a great choice for you!</li>
            <li>I can no longer find this product in local stores, so I am very happy with the quality, price, and shipping of the G-U-M Butlerweave dental floss.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve had this product for some time now :)</li>
            <li>They provide much more dental floss for the money.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is 200 yards because it lasts and lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s OK for home use.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a better job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li>I tried 20 different varieties and this is the best for me.</li>
            <li>its ok .Strong but not quite as strong as Johnsons</li>
            <li>In addition, since it feels like a thicker thread, it&#x27;s more comfortable on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and does not slip in my hands like</li>
            <li>This floss is strong, does not slip, and does not break.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waxed for easy use and has a fine mint taste.</li>
            <li>Used to use the unwaxed fine floss which easily shreds.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipper!</li>
            <li>If you want the floss covered (protect from dust and whatever), the lid is an important component.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the longest floss available.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>The texture of the floss \\&quot;grips\\&quot; between the teeth to clean the area well, while stimulating the gums.  </li>
            <li>I floss daily and it seems I&#x27;ll never run out, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>Another advantage is that you get a full 200 yards of floss with this product, which lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>Works great, thicker than previously thought.</li>
            <li>in other words, this is floss is good, cheap, and really really really plentiful!</li>
            <li>I get the samples from my dentist, but have not been able to find it in any pharmacy, though most carry other G.U.M. products.  </li>
            <li>However, the quality of the material that makes up this floss is that much superior to any other floss that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried every one that I could find.</li>
            <li>Yeah, this floss works - for the most part - but it advertises on the packaging that its \\&quot;special weave resists shredding\\&quot;, and this is nothing short of a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its larger size means it&#x27;s easy to find and that you won&#x27;t be running out too quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this product!</li>
            <li>will definitely be ordering more of this once I run out.</li>
            <li>glad it lasted a while &amp; actually is minty</li>
            <li>Even using two hands, half the time it will fall off again because the front and back of the nearly symmetrical lid must be perfectly aligned.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and had not been able to find it in the stores lately</li>
            <li>FIRST, the good points:  The BUM Butlerweave floss is a little thicker than basic original floss and has a bit of texture to it, so it seems to clean a little better.  </li>
            <li>If fact, it is SO strong that you can re-use the same piece for days if you want.</li>
            <li>my mom likes this dental floss so much.</li>
            <li>The floss is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that there is so much floss in this container (200 yards).  </li>
            <li>I have tried at least five different brands of floss on the market and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>the Publix brand are much cheaper</li>
            <li>Every other floss I have ever tried is better than this.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll be pulling the roll out of these like I did so many times with the other brands.</li>
            <li>However, with extra width comes a significant gain in durability.</li>
            <li>You will pay 25%-30% more than Publix brand and not sure it worth for home use.  </li>
            <li>So, harder to work with while being more dependable than most - for far less money per yard.</li>
            <li>You can use less and get a greater result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised to see all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.   </li>
            <li>The first few pulls were fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break or shred as easily as the other &#x27;leading&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li>and you have to open up the container to get things right again</li>
            <li>However, professional need high quality floss and Reach Dentotape is that.  </li>
            <li>I did not expect that level of an easy pull, but if you have some tight gaps this floss will make you work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same that I get at the dentist&#x27;s office every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this product from the same source in the future.</li>
            <li>like there&#x27;s no cleaning action going on.</li>
            <li>Normal floss lids lift up and tilt back.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a couple of reviews saying it&#x27;s either too thick or that it shreds easily, but neither of these has been a issue for me.</li>
            <li>then the average floss I can get at the local pharmacy and also more product for less price.</li>
            <li>The floss works just as well as most any other flosses I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because my teeth are very close together, but I&#x27;ve never had difficulty getting other flosses between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Much easier than typical floss.</li>
            <li>This floss somehow manages to be both rough enough to catch small particles and still smooth enough not shred and get caught between my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, you can get 200 yards (a lot) of this floss for a really good price (I paid $4.40) and it does manage to floss your teeth, so it is not all bad.</li>

            <li> Much easier than typical floss.</li>
            <li> This floss somehow manages to be both rough enough to catch small particles and still smooth enough not shred and get caught between my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, you can get 200 yards (a lot) of this floss for a really good price (I paid $4.40) and it does manage to floss your teeth, so it is not all bad.</li>
            <li> Only one minor issue for me with this product, the wax is not enough to make it anywhere close to the slickness of Glide.</li>
            <li> This may sound weird, but I would NEVER buy this product again because of this basic design flaw in its packaging.</li>
            <li> I will say that this floss is a little stiffer than other brands, which I happen to really like.</li>
            <li> The mint flavor is not as good as in some other flosses, although it is not all that bad.</li>
            <li> Last straw was the other night when it actually peeled off, bunched up, and got stuck between two molars.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really tough, yet it is still easy to cut on the little metal tab under the lid.</li>
            <li> You can still typically floss when it&#x27;s like this, but it&#x27;s annoying, and much less effective when your floss suddenly splits into much thinner</li>
            <li> provides use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This floss is strong and not too thick nor too thin plus in onntainers this size it last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> shreds every single time you floss a tooth.</li>
            <li> It takes two hands to get the little lid to sit squarely back on the container.  </li>
            <li> It is a total waste of time, time, time, time.</li>
            <li> I do think the rough texture might help with cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stress enough not to waste your money on this POS.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product through Amazon in the future, because I cannot seem to find it in the usual stores.</li>
            <li> Floss is supposed to get other junk out from between my teeth; it should not - nay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find it at the local store.</li>
            <li> SECOND, the negative:  </li>
            <li> This stuff shreds immediately, gets trapped between my teeth and breaks, leaving threads jammed in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I managed to pry it out, leaving my gums sore, and using another brand of floss and a lot of sharp tools to poke and prod, so I didn&#x27;t have to go to the dentist for $100 to get dental floss, of all things pried out from between two teeth!</li>
            <li> It is a little wider than traditional dental floss, or at least I seem to think so.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it&#x27;s 200yds while everything else on the shelf was 30 or less.</li>
            <li> I had used this dental floss previously and could not find it again in a store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had floss manage to get stuck between my teeth several times because it sometimes shreds enough to make it impossible to maneuver the floss out from your teeth.</li>
            <li> If you teeth are tight it might not work as well.</li>
            <li> G_U_M Butlerweave is thicker and a little rougher so it does not fall off your fingers.</li>
            <li> I have a few tight teeth, so</li>
            <li> This one must come all the way off, be set aside, and is an irritating bother to get back in place.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this floss everyday for about a week now and it will start shredding after flossing about two teeth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wound very tight, the strands almost melted together, so that often it gets stuck</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars, but it does have a small flaw.</li>
            <li> Only problem....very difficult to find at retail stores..drug &amp; discount stores.</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> I ended up leaving a message for my dentist begging for an appointment to get it out the next day, it was so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Note that this floss is hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t break continuously like \\&quot;Glide\\</li>
            <li> The only bad part is it starts to tear wear</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad yarn of floss, but there is no telling - at least until I finish it and replace it.</li>
            <li> I have used the J&amp;J Reach floss in the 200 yard format for decades but in recent years it&#x27;s deteriorated in quality: (1)</li>
            <li> its a bit tough to get this thicker weave through it.</li>
            <li> I just hate to waste all that plastic packaging for so little floss.</li>
            <li> how expensive waxed thread is.</li>
            <li> (a pain in the rear), and (2) it&#x27;s become very thin so that it feels</li>
            <li> I was getting really frustrated with the poor quality of the Reach floss.</li>
            <li> So how expensive would that flossing have been?!  </li>
            <li> Not very good, but not the worst either.</li>
            <li> I always feel bad about the amount of plastic used for the amount of floss held in the 50 yd containers.  </li>
            <li> That is the worst!</li>
            <li> The lid is AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> Worst floss I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> What a terrible lying company.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stay away.  This stuff shreds immediately, gets trapped between my teeth and breaks, leaving threads jammed in my teeth. Spend the extra money and buy a proper dental floss.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave wax residue on your teeth, which is very important!  I absolutely love it!  The only bad part is it starts to tear wear I have fillings.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m reviewing FLOSS. However, the quality of the material that makes up this floss is that much superior to any other floss that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried every one that I could find. I have close teeth and some gum issues, so I need to floss well. This floss somehow manages to be both rough enough to catch small particles and still smooth enough not shred and get caught between my teeth. It&#x27;s just that good. I would have given it 5 stars, but it does have a small flaw. The mint flavor is not as good as in some other flosses, although it is not all that bad. Another advantage is that you get a full 200 yards of floss with this product, which lasts a good long time. Highly recommended.   Note that this floss is hard to find in retail stores. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this product!</li>
            <li> You should fire the guy who put this program together.  It is a total waste of time, time, time, time.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this and I am thrilled. I&#x27;ve saved money; my teeth are cleaner. Great product!It&#x27;s also a good price!</li>
            <li> So grateful to find G.U.M Butlerweave floss at Amazon.  I get the samples from my dentist, but have not been able to find it in any pharmacy, though most carry other G.U.M. products.  This floss is sturdy and does not break or shred as easily as many brands.  Even though it is waxed, it is not silky smooth like Glide, and therefore cleans my teeth more effectively.  In addition, since it feels like a thicker thread, it&#x27;s more comfortable on my fingers.  My dental hygienist uses this product with her patients.</li>
            <li> It kinda shocks me how expensive waxed thread is. That said, there is lots of it and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s strong and does not slip in my hands like Glide does. If fact, it is SO strong that you can re-use the same piece for days if you want.</li>
            <li> Not very good, but not the worst either. At least it doesn&#x27;t break continuously like \\&quot;Glide\\&quot; floss does.  And it&#x27;s very cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised to see all the positive reviews. I bought it because it&#x27;s 200yds while everything else on the shelf was 30 or less. I just hate to waste all that plastic packaging for so little floss. But this is crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s because my teeth are very close together, but I&#x27;ve never had difficulty getting other flosses between my teeth. This floss will break before I can get it between some of my teeth. The force causes it to tighten around my fingers and cut off the blood supply, while bits get stuck in between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it would be alright if I had gaps in between my teeth. I do think the rough texture might help with cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your teeth are close together, stay away! Every other floss I have ever tried is better than this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s EXACTLY the same that I get at the dentist&#x27;s office every 6 months.  Great price and strong.  I am ordering more!</li>
            <li> Unlike J&amp;J Reach floss, this stuff is composed of more lightweight strands, which tend to fray and then get stuck in my teeth. That is the worst!</li>
            <li> What can you say about dental floss?  It&#x27;s well-priced and seems to last forever.  I floss daily and it seems I&#x27;ll never run out, which is good.  I think it works as well as any floss would work.</li>
            <li> FIRST, the good points:  The BUM Butlerweave floss is a little thicker than basic original floss and has a bit of texture to it, so it seems to clean a little better.  The 200 yd. sized package means it doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced often....a plus.  Also, the container is vertical and fairly compact.    SECOND, the negative:  The lid is AWFUL.  It takes two hands to get the little lid to sit squarely back on the container.  Even using two hands, half the time it will fall off again because the front and back of the nearly symmetrical lid must be perfectly aligned.  There is no \\&quot;click\\&quot; or sense of \\&quot;seating\\&quot; when it&#x27;s in place.  If you want the floss covered (protect from dust and whatever), the lid is an important component.  Normal floss lids lift up and tilt back.  This one must come all the way off, be set aside, and is an irritating bother to get back in place.   This may sound weird, but I would NEVER buy this product again because of this basic design flaw in its packaging.</li>
            <li> Only one minor issue for me with this product, the wax is not enough to make it anywhere close to the slickness of Glide. I did not expect that level of an easy pull, but if you have some tight gaps this floss will make you work. The trade off, I suppose, is that it is also very strong. So, harder to work with while being more dependable than most - for far less money per yard.</li>
            <li> Lots of it.&lt;br /&gt;And cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or in other words, this is floss is good, cheap, and really really really plentiful!</li>
            <li> Still not enough wax on this waxed dental floss . Other than that its ok .Strong but not quite as strong as Johnsons</li>
            <li> This floss is strong, does not slip, and does not break. It shreds though, that is why I gave it a four-star rating.</li>
            <li> I love this product and had not been able to find it in the stores lately so was delighted when I found it online.  My order arrived promptly.  This floss is strong and not too thick nor too thin plus in onntainers this size it last a very long time.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I had used this dental floss previously and could not find it again in a store.  It is not only the best, but also the cheapest.  It does not tear.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to run out so I bought the longest floss available. It works well and there is a lot there.&lt;br /&gt;Ron</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the flossers with the floss on a stick. Much easier than typical floss.</li>
            <li> Thinner than the identically labeled sample I get at my dentist&#x27;s office.  Sometimes shreds.  Would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> my mom likes this dental floss so much. this is cheap but durable! I recommended if for everyone!!!!!!!! thank you</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  I keep a container in my desk at work and when I pull some out, it makes NO noise.  So my coworkers don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m about to floss my teeth while I&#x27;m at my desk.  :-). The floss is also very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These container are nice too. I doubt I&#x27;ll be pulling the roll out of these like I did so many times with the other brands.</li>
            <li> Shreds in your mouth. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> what is there to review on a dental floss?.. oh yeah.. good quality by the way.. minty.. waxy? hummm good stuff</li>
            <li> I like that there is so much floss in this container (200 yards).  I always feel bad about the amount of plastic used for the amount of floss held in the 50 yd containers.  This is a better product to packaging ratio.  The floss works just as well as most any other flosses I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample from my dentist but could not find it in stores.  It is wonderful because of a very different weave.  You can use less and get a greater result.  I ordered in quantity and will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I like the gum brand floss and especially the butterweave.  It does not shred when you use. it. A good buy.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market....especially for \\&quot;tight\\&quot; teeth.  Only problem....very difficult to find at retail stores..drug &amp; discount stores.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Better quality then the average floss I can get at the local pharmacy and also more product for less price. Great Packaging!!! Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a big difference between dental flosses, but there is.  Got this a sample from my dentist and it was so superior in cleaning and strength that I immediately started hunting for it.  I could never find it in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product in local pharmacies or grocery stores so went online. This specific floss was given to me after a periodontal procedure. I like it. It does a good job without breaking and is easy to grip. Better than ribbon floss.</li>
            <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here.</li>
            <li> when bought , what sold me was the fact it is 200 yds.! Still using since received, that has been a minute. Works great, thicker than previously thought. Still works though - Good Buy!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least five different brands of floss on the market and this is by far the best.  I discovered it when given to me as a sample from my dentist.  The texture of the floss \\&quot;grips\\&quot; between the teeth to clean the area well, while stimulating the gums.  I will be purchasing this product through Amazon in the future, because I cannot seem to find it in the usual stores.</li>
            <li> My dentist used to offer samples of this great stuff.  No more.  Then I tried to find it in stores.  No luck.  It is the best floss there is.</li>
            <li> This is a good product by GUM.  I purchased the regular size for many&lt;br /&gt;years but this 200 yd. provides use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me samples of GUM floss for years and I loved it.  It was stronger and easier to use then any floss I could find at the store.  When he stopped giving away the samples, I again tried various brands.  Then I found it on Amazon.  I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best dental floss I have ever used. It is a little wider than traditional dental floss, or at least I seem to think so. However, with extra width comes a significant gain in durability. This stuff is really tough, yet it is still easy to cut on the little metal tab under the lid. I will say that this floss is a little stiffer than other brands, which I happen to really like. It is very good at getting all the plaque out from between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering more of this once I run out.</li>
            <li> Great price. It&#x27;s hard to find it at the local store.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this floss works - for the most part - but it advertises on the packaging that its \\&quot;special weave resists shredding\\&quot;, and this is nothing short of a lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this floss everyday for about a week now and it will start shredding after flossing about two teeth. You can still typically floss when it&#x27;s like this, but it&#x27;s annoying, and much less effective when your floss suddenly splits into much thinner strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had floss manage to get stuck between my teeth several times because it sometimes shreds enough to make it impossible to maneuver the floss out from your teeth. Floss is supposed to get other junk out from between my teeth; it should not - nay, it must not become that junk that gets stuck between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you can get 200 yards (a lot) of this floss for a really good price (I paid $4.40) and it does manage to floss your teeth, so it is not all bad. Maybe I just got a bad yarn of floss, but there is no telling - at least until I finish it and replace it. All I know is that it shreds a lot, which is worsened by the fact that it is \\&quot;designed\\&quot; to resist shredding.</li>
            <li> Worst floss I&#x27;ve ever bought! shreds every single time you floss a tooth. Can&#x27;t stress enough not to waste your money on this POS. What a terrible lying company.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t break or shred as easily as the other &#x27;leading&#x27; brand.</li>
            <li> I have used the J&amp;J Reach floss in the 200 yard format for decades but in recent years it&#x27;s deteriorated in quality: (1) it&#x27;s wound very tight, the strands almost melted together, so that often it gets stuck and you have to open up the container to get things right again (a pain in the rear), and (2) it&#x27;s become very thin so that it feels like there&#x27;s no cleaning action going on. I was getting really frustrated with the poor quality of the Reach floss. Fortunately, I discovered the GUM floss, which (1) has a superior method for winding the floss up so that it pulls out very smoothly/consistently,(2) has a thickness/surface that is perfect for cleaning my teeth, and (3) it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the J&amp;J Reach floss! I noticed a couple of reviews saying it&#x27;s either too thick or that it shreds easily, but neither of these has been a issue for me.</li>
            <li> A great dental floss that is perfect for a shared bathroom. It&#x27;s waxed for easy use and has a fine mint taste. Its larger size means it&#x27;s easy to find and that you won&#x27;t be running out too quickly. If you floss regularly (and I hope you do), this is a great choice for you!</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use. I have a few tight teeth, so its a bit tough to get this thicker weave through it.</li>
            <li> This is the highest quality dental floss that I have ever used, and it takes forever to use it all up.  I can no longer find this product in local stores, so I am very happy with the quality, price, and shipping of the G-U-M Butlerweave dental floss.  I will definitely buy more of this product from the same source in the future.</li>
            <li> I still have floss left &amp; I&#x27;ve had this product for some time now :) glad it lasted a while &amp; actually is minty</li>
            <li> Used to use the unwaxed fine floss which easily shreds.  Bought this on sale, and it works almost as well.</li>
            <li> The first few pulls were fine. Then suddenly it all began shredding when using it.  Last straw was the other night when it actually peeled off, bunched up, and got stuck between two molars.  I ended up leaving a message for my dentist begging for an appointment to get it out the next day, it was so uncomfortable.  So how expensive would that flossing have been?!  I managed to pry it out, leaving my gums sore, and using another brand of floss and a lot of sharp tools to poke and prod, so I didn&#x27;t have to go to the dentist for $100 to get dental floss, of all things pried out from between two teeth!</li>
            <li> They are of excellent quality and inexpensive compared to retail.  They provide much more dental floss for the money.  I totally recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is the best floss ever.  It rarely breaks while I am flossing and it does a great job at removing food particles from my teeth and gums.  I love that it is 200 yards because it lasts and lasts and lasts.  The minty flavor is a bonus and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my dental office even thoughy the Publix brand are much cheaper and it&#x27;s OK for home use.  However, professional need high quality floss and Reach Dentotape is that.  You will pay 25%-30% more than Publix brand and not sure it worth for home use.  If I were regular consumer I would buy from Publix $0.89 for 55 yards</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find locally, so I got it here.  Got a sample from dentist and liked it, so I had to find it.  Quick shipper!</li>
            <li> G_U_M Butlerweave is thicker and a little rougher so it does not fall off your fingers. It seems to do a better job of cleaning the teeth. I tried 20 different varieties and this is the best for me. If you teeth are tight it might not work as well.</li>
