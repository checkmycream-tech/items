            <li>great price great product</li>
            <li>The everlasting rum color was great too, kind of a bronzy brown.</li>
            <li>Well I guess the good part is the color did stay</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it would look good on everyone.</li>
            <li>I use many of these throughout the year and have for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>this is one of my 4 favorite colors</li>
            <li>My favorite lipstick..</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this color on me.</li>
            <li>and I like those better.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied :)</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I brought this product from store, better quality and fresher</li>
            <li>Very complimentary!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that the lip color comes off easily with my face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and have a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>and I just love that Revlon has kept the color and the line for a long time now, allowing me to continue to use this great product.</li>
            <li>I clean my lips first(sometimes</li>
            <li>The color I used initially is not made anymore, but this Everlasting Rum is almost as good.  </li>
            <li>I hope i can get so more soon thanks again.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brands of lipstick that are supposed to last for hours.</li>
            <li>Not too much!</li>
            <li>For most of my life, my lipstick disappeared ten minutes after I put it on.</li>
            <li>a pretty color tho.)</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t affect it!</li>
            <li>I have used Revlon ColorStay for years now and won&#x27;t ever buy any other kind.  </li>
            <li>This is a very flattering color</li>
            <li>so thank you so much,</li>
            <li>and I wear it daily, although I usually do not use the clear gloss over the top.  </li>
            <li>I love this colour and it is so hard to get it here in N.Z</li>
            <li>so you should probably keep applying a clear gloss throughout the day maybe every 2 hours, and</li>
            <li>maybe this color really compliments my lips, because I have this in unlimited mulberry too and it doesn&#x27;t have the same affect(still</li>
            <li>It was old, did not go on the lip right, dried them out,  </li>
            <li>After its dried, I put on a clear gloss on, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be the clear gloss that&#x27;s attached to it.</li>

            <li> I DO NOT press my lips together, or go over it several times like you would with other lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it makes my lips look bigger</li>
            <li> Lasts ALL day with eating and drinking, the only bad thing I can say is that it can feel very drying</li>
            <li> This beats all the other brands hands down!!</li>
            <li> and I have at least 4 other colors I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so yucky to be too tired to do this before bed and to wake up with glop on your face).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use many of these throughout the year and have for quite some time now. this is one of my 4 favorite colors and I just love that Revlon has kept the color and the line for a long time now, allowing me to continue to use this great product. you can put this stuff on in the morning and it will still be there, as an undertint, by the time you go to bed. I put gloss over it throughout the day to keep my lips moist as I like them that way.&lt;br /&gt;its a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brands of lipstick that are supposed to last for hours. This beats all the other brands hands down!! I can apply it before work, and it is still there when I leave. This color is gorgeous! Not too much! Very complimentary! Anyone can wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a very flattering color and I wear it daily, although I usually do not use the clear gloss over the top.  I always remove it at night along with my other makeup (it&#x27;s so yucky to be too tired to do this before bed and to wake up with glop on your face).  It stays perfect all day and doesn&#x27;t come off when you kiss people or eat.  Can easily be removed either with Neutrogena eye makeup remover or CVS drugstore&#x27;s eye makeup remover that is less expensive than the Neutrogena brand.  I hope they never discontinue this color, which is similar to Fawn that I believe may be discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product works.  I wake up the  next day with it on.  This is my second tube of this color and I have at least 4 other colors I have purchased.  Does not run into lines around mouth, if you have that concern.</li>
            <li> Long lasting coverage.  Doesn&#x27;t come off on my glass  when I drink.  Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and have a wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li> For most of my life, my lipstick disappeared ten minutes after I put it on. This stays forever. The best review comes from a cosmetologist who called everyone over to see my beautiful &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; lip color. They would not believe it was Everlasting Rum Color stay by Revlon.  Don&#x27;t ever stop selling this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the only long lasting lip color that actually seems to stay on all day.  The everlasting rum color was great too, kind of a bronzy brown.</li>
            <li> Well I guess the good part is the color did stay..bad part was there were times it removed skin as well to get the color to come off!</li>
            <li> Been using this color for years. Great neutral color that stays on for about eight hers. With a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> stays on through eating &amp; drinking!</li>
            <li> My favorite lipstick..Lasts unlike any other.</li>
            <li> I have used Revlon ColorStay for years now and won&#x27;t ever buy any other kind.  The color I used initially is not made anymore, but this Everlasting Rum is almost as good.  This lipstick will literally stay on all day.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  It is the bomb.  I would give it 6 stars if that were an option.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip color product I have ever found. The color is beautiful and it stays on my lips all day, even after eating. I only have to apply my lip color once in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off at night. What&#x27;s even better is that the lip color comes off easily with my face cleanser. I don&#x27;t think I will ever try another lip color product. This one is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought everlasting rum and I absolutely love this color on me. It&#x27;s darker than a nude color but can still be an every day look. I&#x27;m not sure why it makes my lips look bigger maybe this color really compliments my lips, because I have this in unlimited mulberry too and it doesn&#x27;t have the same affect(still a pretty color tho.) I have an olive color skin tone and my lips are medium sized I would say, not big but not skinny, so I don&#x27;t know if it would look good on everyone. I clean my lips first(sometimes I exfoliate before I put it on and it does help), then I apply a coat and let it dry. I DO NOT press my lips together, or go over it several times like you would with other lip glosses. After its dried, I put on a clear gloss on, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be the clear gloss that&#x27;s attached to it. I usually use the clear stick I get from other lipsticks similar to this because they aren&#x27;t liquids and I like those better.  Lasts ALL day with eating and drinking, the only bad thing I can say is that it can feel very drying so you should probably keep applying a clear gloss throughout the day maybe every 2 hours, and also I might see tiny flakes come off after I eat or on my water bottle but it really doesn&#x27;t affect it! I look in the mirror after and it looks the same.  Comes off with an oil based makeup remover. Satisfied :)</li>
            <li> great price great product</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Stays on even when eating greasy foods. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this colour and it is so hard to get it here in N.Z i dont think they sell it here anymore so thank you so much, I hope i can get so more soon thanks again.</li>
            <li> It was old, did not go on the lip right, dried them out,  I brought this product from store, better quality and fresher</li>
