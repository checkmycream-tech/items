            <li>I just wanted to brush my teeth and have the toothbrush do a good job.  </li>

            <li>it was a good performer.  </li>

            <li>The product seems to be good quality, but I can&#x27;t seem to get used to the vibration against my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I think my problem is that I don&#x27;t like electric toothbrushes, however I am persisting because I think it does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleanest my teeth have ever been, and I&#x27;ve used good quality electric toothbrushes before.</li>
            <li>Good while it lasted, but do keep your receipt even after eight months or so because these are prone to stop working and they won&#x27;t give you anything without a receipt.</li>
            <li>Snaps on and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>You might want to check around for good buys on this.</li>

            <li>The brush head works great for a more crowded mouth.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with this</li>

            <li>He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have both been happy Sonicare users for many years.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Purchased this Sonicare at advice of dentist to strengthen gum line; was definitely worth the purchase as my dentist now says gums are in great shape!</li>
            <li>I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better than Oral-B.  Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We have used Soniccare brushes in our home for well over 15 years and just had to purchase a replacement motor, great brush and much more compact than the one we have used all these years.</li>
            <li>Also, very healthy for your gums.</li>
            <li>Great price I have to say as in the pharmacy stores they are about $100 or more.</li>
            <li>Always great and much better than a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li>He uses it faithfully every day and is very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I found that this model is a great happy medium of not too cheap, very light and efficient for the money.</li>

            <li>I love Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE bubbles!</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of keeping my teeth looking good and feeling almost as clean as if I had just gone to the dental</li>
            <li>Very happy will never stop using it because it clean my teeth so well :)</li>
            <li>The package came very quickly and was in great shape.  </li>
            <li>The unit appears to be great quality, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  </li>

            <li>Toothbrush does a great job and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>very nice and easy to use, recommended</li>
            <li>This device is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use this brush as I thought I could, and Amazon was amazing in helping me get a refund.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Customer service for sonicare  is amazing.  </li>
            <li>my teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li>The timer on this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Slim, light and a joy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazing cleaning with this product.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare is amazing.  </li>
            <li>And the difference in cleanliness, tartar build-up (I have ZERO now!), and gum health is amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel this was an amazing accomplishment.</li>
            <li>It also uses a Lithium battery and it is amazing that it holds it&#x27;s charge for two to three weeks before needing to be recharged.</li>
            <li>This one is amazing and you can&#x27;t feel a film on your teeth when you are thru brushing.</li>
            <li>Still loving this brush.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare Hx6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is an excellent value at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a case for it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this model and felt the design was an improvement.</li>
            <li>Looks exceptionally nice.</li>
            <li>Its good but def not the top of the line.</li>
            <li>works nicely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize all the hype about electric toothbrushes but after trying a battery operated brush from CVS, I wanted the real thing and am very happy with this.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Sonicare products for a number of years and wanted to get our daughter one of her own.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the brush itself seems to be working quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>own both and prefer the Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself, and liked it so well</li>
            <li>I own a three speed version of one of these and bought this one as a gift.</li>
            <li>feels really nice and its convenient that its rechargeable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to find out what kind of warranty replacement coverage there might be on this unit.</li>
            <li>I called Customer service and, after a rather lengthy wait time (being honest here)</li>
            <li>I have always liked the quad pacer feature.  </li>
            <li>The timer is a good reminder to get my 2 minutes in and the box says to switch out the brush heads every 3 months, but they can go for more.</li>
            <li>The difference was literally astounding.  </li>
            <li>Works well, is compact, lightweight and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really handy for getting in those hard-to-reach places like wisdom teeth and at the gumline, plus it&#x27;s been about a month since I bought it</li>
            <li>this is my third sonicare and my dentist is very happy with the results.recommended to anyone great purchased</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more efficient than manual brushing and is good for the gums.</li>
            <li>It is a nice sleek design and</li>
            <li>The seller was from the UK and if he were honest, would have brought this to my attention.  </li>
            <li>Would have also been nice to include a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW don&#x27;t get the rotary kind.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans your teeth, making for great dental checkups!</li>
            <li>I don’t find Sonic seals for this model; it would be nice to have those.</li>
            <li>That alone makes me thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I also liked the improved design brushes and the attachment that doesn&#x27;t allow water and tooth paste to leak into the case.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted one of her own but preferred a rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li>Battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Recharge nice and this unit has served me well.</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>And I really take good care of it!!!</li>
            <li>timer is nice</li>
            <li>But I do much prefer this brush, this I think is the best electric toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li>There is some kind of faulty glitche in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I own both brands, Oral-B 4000 series and this Sonicare.</li>
            <li>them have  been very understanding, delightful and apologetic for my inconvenience .. .</li>
            <li>The brush does a great job, much better than I was able to do with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare products for many years with good performance.</li>
            <li>No hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I am appreciative of the reviewer that suggested that I follow up.</li>
            <li>Good product, but WaterPik is better for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a toothbrush I liked as welll as this  </li>
            <li>Nice, efficient rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an automatic stop, so I can kind of just brush and forget about it until it stops itself.</li>
            <li>and it was good, but this Sonicare is better.</li>
            <li>Nothing but nice things to say about this brush...</li>
            <li>I am a &amp;#34;thrifty&amp;#34; person and not prone to spending this kind of money on myself.</li>
            <li>Awesome toothbrush, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The brush also is contoured to get in between teeth as well, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I did not tell them I was using this, they just must think I am going nuts on my own and attacking those cavity creeps on my own.</li>
            <li>Timer to help keep you honest.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Buy nice or buy twice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sanitary cap is a nice addition</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that it pings after 30 seconds</li>
            <li>It has the nice 2 min timer letting you know</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure this toothbrush is great for your teeth and gums, I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than twenty seconds.  </li>
            <li>This is a very handy toothbrush with essential functions, perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li>The very nice smooth feeling is replicated with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a person who bought the original Sonicare and was happy with it - needed to be charged once a week,</li>
            <li>is a great toothbrush and well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied my teeth feel very very smooth</li>
            <li>First off, I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am very happy (as is my dental hygienist)  with the cleaning results.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush did a great job of keeping my teeth clean but died after 2.5 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of the older e Series and was very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered another (at great expense) because it keeps my teeth clean, but if I have to order one a year, it will get pricey.</li>
            <li>this model is very good value, and I do not see benefits of getting the higher end ones</li>
            <li>Manufacturer said the Easy Clean model is the quietest (!!!).  </li>
            <li>This new updated style has resolved that problem perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My new dentist encouraged me to get one, and I&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s good at holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Great purchase from Amazon with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really good service from Philips, I have been a customer of them many years for many products.&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li>The timer is a great way to insure you are getting and adequate cleaning.</li>
            <li>I feel the vibrate is very strong</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to return it and purchase this one!</li>
            <li>I love this thing, LOVE IT !  </li>
            <li>Easy Clean is my favorite, it is the best one of the many I have owned.</li>
            <li>Best of all teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li>There are many excellent reviews for this toothbrush on here, hundreds in fact, so I just want to highlight some of my main observations:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Just a really good, effective clean for your teeth.</li>
            <li>The rep I spoke with convinced me to buy their deluxe brush heads, claiming they were much better.  </li>
            <li>This brush is clearly the best design.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>This model for the price offers the best value.</li>
            <li>It works great and is actually fun to use.  </li>
            <li>but i definitely loved the smooth after the dentist feel it gave to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I feel my teeth and gums are in the best condition they&#x27;ve ever been after using this brush for about a month so far.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my husband and he is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing after brushing and love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>so hopefully it&#x27;s as effective, which I&#x27;m sure it is.</li>
            <li>So far they are impressed with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>One of the best toothbrush I ever had so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips should put every effort into making the unit complete and perfect and drop the effort to nickel and dime the consumer.</li>
            <li>Just as effective as healthy</li>
            <li>This is a great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric brush I have had in 20 years.  </li>
            <li>love it ... easy to use and good to travel with.</li>
            <li>Recommended strongly!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I researched many of the available models and the Easy Clean seemed like the best option.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED my original Sonicare, but I consider this one trash.  </li>
            <li>Great clean feel and easy on the gums!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They absolutely are the best available for oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>This would make a great wedding gift for a couple, or a great graduation present.</li>
            <li>It;s a good tool and gets my teeth clean</li>
            <li>The materials of this toothbrush are superior to the Oral-B and the heads fit much better.</li>
            <li>It seems trivial, but it really is a great product for helping you keep up your smile :)</li>
            <li>I searched and compared prices at all the major stores and this was the best buy.</li>
            <li>It produces great results and it is very convenient to use!  SS</li>
            <li>Also, the Easy-Start ramping up period over the first 2 weeks is a great way to get used to the brush without your gums being aggravated.</li>
            <li>First, the size is great.</li>
            <li>I was pretty happy with that.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with how my teeth feel after using it, and love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li>This one is much easier to clean and it does a great job!  </li>
            <li>and it is very light weight.</li>
            <li>Teeth are very important to maintain.  </li>
            <li>stock bristles are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean and brush very easy to use and stays charged</li>
            <li>Good fit in the palm and easy to guide.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>The product is aptly named as it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>You are making a huge mistake if you don&#x27;t use sonicare!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>but if they did im sure it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li>the money you pay for (if not on the more inexpensive side)</li>
            <li>and I feel like my teeth are still much better off than with manual brushing / flossing alone.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare brush is so much better</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>I bought a Sonicare Elite back in 2003, and it was the BEST toothbrush I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Our dentist is pleased too.......  : )</li>
            <li>am enjoying and</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I exceed the 2 minutes every time now, just making sure I am thorough.  </li>
            <li>After research I found that this one has all the necessary features at the best price.  </li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel wonderful, I&#x27;d never go back to old-fashioned toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I love the slender, sleek style.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>He was impressed enough that everyone in the family now has one.</li>
            <li>We like the timing modes that can be used to make sure you&#x27;re giving all your teeth ample cleaning time.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush will buy another when the time comes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my experience \\&quot;Can you hear me better now?\\&quot; volume will not be maintained throughout the call</li>
            <li>Not all of us have a bathroom with more than two outlets.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has it all: the brushing cycle is not like most electric toothbrush options.</li>
            <li>They love these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll update this review for sure when I try it out.</li>
            <li>I wonder how the handle and the heads will stand up to three months of  repeated pulling off and pushing on, 4 or more times a day.</li>
            <li>Charger and handle and top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all posted :)</li>
            <li>The manufacturer, Phillips, needs to practice better quality control of the packaging of their product.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>(then I&#x27;ll erase all this and complain about the battery :)</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(it used the e-series screw-on toothbrush heads), and I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded to this one.</li>
            <li>After not having been able to visit a dentist for a couple years, I was told by my dentist to try out the Sonicare</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I took her advice.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and you get a better price buying it on here than Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  </li>
            <li>I have used an electric toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking to get White 710, but this works perfect.</li>
            <li>If I want to brush more for whiting purpose, just push the button one more time.</li>
            <li>I feel I saved $15:)</li>
            <li>Hopefully my teeth will be in better shape in 6 months :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine a Sonicare with more power.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the built in quad-timer than beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>The basic Sonicare is excellent.</li>
            <li>would not pay more (let alone twice) for any of the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; versions.</li>
            <li>Philips seemed to me to have more experience and more research into the mechanics at this price point and that tilted me toward the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>From having to replace so many toothbrushes?</li>
            <li>No cavities on my latest check-up.  </li>
            <li>There are so many options.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW IT TELLS ME</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this.</li>
            <li>I also have one and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been buying Sonicare toothbrushes for years and am always satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful and it makes brushing fly by without having to watch the time.</li>
            <li>Just stopped being able to charge at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the feeling I experience when I have finished brushing.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>(and I love that it beeps after every 30 seconds so that you know to switch up your brushing area).</li>
            <li>Dental check-ups are now much better.</li>
            <li>Glad the kids have already moved out or I&#x27;d be buying them one too.</li>
            <li>The replacement brush tips can be pricey but you should be able to find \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; package deals every now and then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I went to another dentist for cleaning recently and he just told me that my oral health was excellent.</li>
            <li>How they&#x27;re able to charge using plastic on plastic</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer helps keep you on pace and the fact that it runs for 2 minutes is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>There is no doubt in my mind that my dental hygienist will be impressed at my next visit!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>After three months with this toothbrush, my teeth feel better than ever.  </li>
            <li>and they all love it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE it</li>
            <li>always so satisfied I&#x27;ve never been tempted to try another brand.  </li>
            <li>Love Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li>After brushing I feel like my mouth is much more cleaner, and there is no holes in the toothbrush part where residual toothpaste gets stuck and has to be washed out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than the e-series</li>
            <li>Much better than my e-series.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>This one also has a much better battery life.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed my unit and it has improved the cleaning of my teeth according to my Dentist.</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare myself and love it</li>
            <li>I love Amazon</li>
            <li>and I love their Prime service, but they dropped the ball on this one.  </li>
            <li>Third Sonicare this is the best.</li>
            <li>Everything works perfectly well and it&#x27;s much more efficient in terms of cleaning than my last one.</li>
            <li>I probably get only 8 weeks use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement.</li>
            <li>The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all that the description claimed it would be, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>But this one is very simple, one speed, but perfect!</li>
            <li>My gums feel much better and are no longer bleeding.  </li>
            <li>THE PHILIPS SONICARE EASYCLEAN HAS A PHENOMENAL 3 WEEK BATTERY LIFE, WHILE</li>
            <li>but now i love brushing my teeth and</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my teeth love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>minutes flies by and is almost slightly enjoyable to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>Some better than others.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>They make another model where the brush screws onto the top.  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li>Totally enjoyable and beneficial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the device is as it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding toothbrush for the money.</li>
            <li>This model is much better than the higher-end models.</li>
            <li>so it is better.  </li>
            <li>I also really love how it buzzes to signal that I need to switch to another part of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush is like most Phillips Sonicare type.  </li>
            <li>It was probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in recent years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li>just got done having a bridge put in top</li>
            <li>A rinse of the head and motor body after every use is worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>started getting more &amp;#34;4s&amp;#34; for gum gaps a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;went to the dentist yesterday and 75% of the gum shrinkage improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, an ingenious design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but not as powerful as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>More of a tickle than anything.</li>
            <li>just buy the better brush heads.  </li>
            <li>we love them.</li>
            <li>glad to not have to screw on brush heads but rather</li>
            <li>I also love that it make a noise every 30 seconds so you can rotate every section of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Faster motion means more scrubs per minute</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the improvements.</li>
            <li>Electric toothbrushes have mostly solved my gum disease</li>
            <li>it was OK.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for in this case and this toothbrush is fantastic !  </li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Love sonicare</li>
            <li>I had this for more than one year</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My dad love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely one of the best consumer products I&#x27;ve purchased in a while.</li>
            <li>From my research it seems like you can pay more for a sonicare toothbrush, but you don&#x27;t get much more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We love Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I like them better because they rotate at a faster RPM.  </li>
            <li>dentist (without knowing I was using this brush) said in my last visit that my teeth and gums looked great, and that she couldn&#x27;t find any plaque to scrape off during the cleaning!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had one for many years....</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>no need for more buttons, more accessories (except for the case),  more lights, more programs etc.</li>
            <li>If I need to brush some more, I turn it on again.</li>
            <li>My teeth got noticeably more stained.</li>
            <li>You can use any of the Sonicare heads, including the Diamond head that comes with their top of the line model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li>and it is still going, LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Employed for over a year, this toothbrush has reliably cleaned my teeth and gums better than anything else ever has.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love that I can just pop the brush head on it and go.</li>
            <li>I have used a Sonicare for over 10 years and love it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off purchasing the Oral B version instead which does a much better job of cleaning your teeth and in between around the gums.  </li>
            <li>but in reality, the 31,000 strokes/min probably did a much better job cleaning than my manual toothbrushing ever could.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>that my teeth feel better.</li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>This newer design is much better.</li>
            <li>yeah, I am glad I got one.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it, got one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Much better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter because my wife and I already have Sonicares and love them.  </li>
            <li>With Sonicare, I might get away with once a year visits instead of every six months. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re not going to get a better brush in terms of cleaning.</li>
            <li>A more textured surface would be better.</li>
            <li>For some models, you may be able to find a softer brush head on line--but not in any stores.</li>
            <li>Ok, but feels like your teeth are gonna vibrate out of your head?,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Everything I need, and nothing more.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to exhaust the battery (recharged after two weeks of use</li>
            <li>The one with the greater diameter brush connection.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 4 rating is probably more about my dexterity (or lack thereof) in using the product than any issue with the product itself.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to have found this newer model here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I found this Sonicare on Amazon for $50 and it is better than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>If this cost were to drop somewhat, I&#x27;m sure the number of users would increase dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>Light and a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the timer function</li>
            <li>I love my Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good, basic toothbrush with no bells and whistles, at a great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bout many of these as i leave them at vacation homes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely recipient&#x27;s favorite gift from that year.</li>
            <li>Love this electric brush.</li>
            <li>i am sure there is som science to it</li>
            <li>Like a more docile version the Essence 5600</li>
            <li>wish it had more speeds</li>
            <li>Love the hesitation</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare Elite models.</li>
            <li>And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE  it and am getting my husband one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li>toothbrush plus flossing and mouthwash (plus the semi yearly scaling at the dentist) ensures my mouth stays cavity free!</li>
            <li>There are models with more features, but when you read through the marketing hype, it&#x27;s just longer brushing time, or variable power levels.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The top brush does not stay secured to the lower handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the wider ones.</li>
            <li>The Phillps however is so much better.</li>
            <li>Had sonicares for years and love them.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than the oral b I replaced it with.</li>
            <li>I have owned three Phillips Sonicare brushes and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>They price was better than in any store, but the shipping took a while.</li>
            <li>I am glad I switched to this toothbrush years ago.</li>
            <li>This one has a more grippy on/off button that I can brace against while not affecting, while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love my SonicCare.</li>
            <li>I Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I use this product four times a day and love the timed cycle.  </li>
            <li>So he had this one and uses it many times a day</li>
            <li>The results have been better check up&#x27;s for all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite model of my favorite electric toothbrush company.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found it to be a much better design.</li>
            <li>Love the slim handle and more compact recharger.</li>
            <li>Love the quad pacer.  </li>
            <li>My redid my son&#x27;s bathroom and it has a place for most everything, but my son would leave stuff out, but now almost every time I go into the bathroom, ever thing is put away.......How many bathrooms with kids have stuff put away?</li>
            <li>its just a way to make you think your getting a newer more up to date version.</li>
            <li>but I spend more than 30 seconds on each section and it auto shuts off after 2 mins.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was a Braun user for many years.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the Braun, but after my last Braun wore out (it stopped working after a couple of years), my wife suggested we try the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no question it removes more plaque</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Satisfied sonic user for 5 years now.</li>
            <li>Sonicare is simply the best.</li>
            <li>.going to replace it with another top leading brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this buy for everyone, more so for folks like me with RA who have difficulty using their hands.  </li>
            <li>I probably would&#x27;ve been better off getting the cheaper version.</li>
            <li>I love the timed brushing feature.</li>
            <li>they want more words to submit my review.  ???</li>
            <li>love the timer every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years and love them.</li>
            <li>Way better than my e series</li>
            <li>but I would expect more than a year of service.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job cleaning and my teeth feel like I just left the hygienist&#x27;s office when I use it.</li>
            <li>Love the timing feature too, it ensures I don&#x27;t rush and get to all my teeth evenly.</li>
            <li>The Easyclean, the current toothbrush I use, is the best of the three.</li>
            <li>Read reviews for many rechargeable electric toothbrushes before deciding on the HX6511/50.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>glad I made splurge.  </li>
            <li>This one just has a nice smooth plastic handle.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>and now they are so healthy that the hygenist mentions it everytime</li>
            <li>Keeps you buying more</li>
            <li>Anyway, love this brush with the compact heads.  </li>
            <li>i traded in an oral b which i had been pleased with</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>I keep running my tounge over them, and they feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I also went to the dentist recently and he was really impressed by how clean/well kept my mouth/teeth</li>
            <li>This way I know I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every aspect of tooth brushing was better than a manual (except cost of the unit and replacement brush heads).</li>
            <li>After reading a TON of reviews of it and then this more affordable option (thank you everyone) and decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li>You will actually do a better job brushing and save trips to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no point in spending more than what this model costs.</li>
            <li>And it saves me time because in the 2 minutes (it has a timer) that it runs it does better than the 5 minutes of manual brushing</li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare for more than 15 years - this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It fits my hand better.</li>
            <li>and my hygenist swears I will have a better checkup.</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it, love it</li>
            <li>I love the philips sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love that the brush does the work.  </li>
            <li>Caused more gum recession than before I began using it.  </li>
            <li>No one had a better price than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Investing in your health is always a worthwhile venture.</li>
            <li>Li-ion battery promises a longer life with more time between charges.  </li>
            <li>My wife believes it does a better job than our Braun.  </li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with the Sonicare electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This brush solved that problem and more.</li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It helps to make your brushing more thorough.</li>
            <li>This easy clean is better than good.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Sonicare brushes for many years-</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>But after buying this electric toothbrush,,,,,, I now brush twice a day and my teeth and gums feel so much better.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.... :)</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features is the timer that signals every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an glad I invested in this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>if I had proof my teeth are being cleaned better.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for many years</li>
            <li>and I even got a pat on my shoulder by my seriously handsome dentist.  :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because white is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>feel like it&#x27;s doing so much more for my teeth than manually brushing.</li>
            <li>Love this product - my dentist told me to get an electric toothbrush, and he specifically recommended Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>they where able to make the brush head without the magnets.</li>
            <li>Much much better.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love these sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I love ,y toothbrush...</li>
            <li>I Evan better.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>and now I LOVE brushing.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy a 3-pack of the softer heads along with your order.</li>
            <li>Was able to use it on a 10 day vacation without charging it either.</li>
            <li>Be sure to make sure toothpaste doesn&#x27;t accumulate where the head connects to the body of the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these toothbrushes for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I know it will be better because of my experience.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>My new Sonicare works beautifully, and I love the newer style.</li>
            <li>My first use was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Philips are offering a very well thought-out design here which works very effectively.</li>
            <li>types of brushes have unique cleaning advantages of their own design.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>V  ery pleased &amp; would highly recommend as great VFM too.</li>

            <li>Keeps my teeth very clean with no irritation or pain to my gums.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li>Great much better than the old model doesn&#x27;t trap dirt inside !</li>
            <li>I do not want to make this totally about comparing the two products, so I will say that I do love the slim handle on its own and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>My first lasted 5 years before and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The battery can use a long time, so awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides all these, I think the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a pretty good electric tooth brush</li>
            <li>This is good for first time electric toothbrush users.  </li>
            <li>It would spontaneously turn on and not brush for the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>recommend this because of the excellent cleaning power, gentleness on my gums and the long battery life.</li>
            <li>Awesome, wished I would have bought it a long time ago</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>Once I used my first Sonicare, I loved it.</li>
            <li>First the good news.</li>
            <li>And it makes sure I do the full 2 minutes every time!  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is better than the original that lasted many many years.</li>
            <li>and I feel there is no other electric tooth brush that can do a good job on an ex-cigar smoker&#x27;s teeth !</li>
            <li>No matter, I got my new handle, it worked great - for ONE day.</li>
            <li>She is so happy to have this new one.</li>
            <li>The new design, lighter, thinner is great.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;easy clean\\&quot; seams to give the most bang for the buck .</li>
            <li>I was concerned about it fitting to the back of my mouth to clean my wisdom teeth, but it reaches great!  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts more than two weeks on a charge and its motor is as strong as ever.</li>
            <li>I have gingivitis and since using the Sonicare I have been getting perfect reports from my hygienist, gums pink and healthy.</li>
            <li>Pair this with a good foaming toothpaste, and you&#x27;ll love the results just as much.</li>
            <li>Really light, powerful, good battery life, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy and a good rechargeable toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, reliable, practical, and it is quite effective.</li>
            <li>Very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>And it is, in fact, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to operate and clean.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product, motor is very powerful and leaves my teeth feeling like I just left from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>worth it for sure!</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase so far and the 2 year warranty doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li>He has been very happy with it and wanted the same brand because he liked it so much!</li>
            <li>Philips new and smaller but powerful Electric Toothbrush is wonderful - easy to pack and handy to use to keep your teeth healthy and bright</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really, really clean after I use this!  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean after using this!</li>
            <li>my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li>Teeth get really clean!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what you buy a toothbrush for, to clean teeth!</li>
            <li>Easier to clean!</li>
            <li>After using Sonicare Elite for more than 10 years, I find this model just fine.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never been so clean!</li>
            <li>My mouth has continued to feel dentist clean!</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel almost as clean as from dentist!  </li>
            <li>My teeth feels squeaky clean after each brush!</li>
            <li>is that it is clean!</li>
            <li>Teeth are clean!</li>
            <li>This is the best - not that I&#x27;ve used other brands or anything, but sure beats manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I loved my original Sonicare, which I used for years, and I also loved the original brush heads, but I feel cheated by this new model.  </li>
            <li>Does the job, but not as handy or nice as older models.</li>
            <li>The compactness of the toothbrush and its charger are wonderful - much easier to store and travel with than older models</li>
            <li>Awesome clean that lasts until my next brushing.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This is great tooth brush, very easy to use, an internal timer lets you know when to change quadrant.  </li>
            <li>,super clean!!</li>
            <li>Very effective at cleaning but so loud it can be heard 2 rooms away!  </li>
            <li>This thing is light and slim, a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>The product worked great but completely died after just over a year.  </li>
            <li>This led to greatly noticeable reduction in action intensity, sometimes over days time.</li>
            <li>The battery is also working great by far.</li>
            <li>The more signal that&#x27;s applied, the louder the sound.  </li>
            <li>I have used an old style Sonicare brush for about 10 years with great results.  </li>
            <li>Probably best value for money electric toothbrush that comes with the minimal functions that you will need.</li>
            <li>The slender handle is more comfortable for me to hold.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>After combing through the reviews of Sonicare brushes, I decided that the Easy Clean was the best option for my husband and I because it had the following features:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>and it perhaps is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the most important part of a toothbrush is how well it cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li>As others have helpfully pointed out, this is the lowest price point into the most advanced brush heads.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen the light.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, upgraded from the old e series.</li>
            <li>The brushing &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; was greatly diminished and it made a loud noise.  </li>
            <li>Happy to see that both of it is fixed now.</li>
            <li>the two are making a great team so far</li>
            <li>I enjoy the sensation of the brushing much more</li>
            <li>Brushing has never been so effective or fun.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product works really good</li>
            <li>The good check-up probably has something to do with genes, but I really believe this toothbrush helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price; fast service.</li>
            <li>It also earned a rare apology for my loving wife.</li>
            <li>but like it so much I felt a review was a good idea.</li>
            <li>It becomes a good habit fast.</li>
            <li>Really cleans your teeth good.</li>
            <li>Has a good feel to it and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping</li>

            <li>Easy to clean, and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Very good when it worked, but after about a year the motor made a whining sound and no long turned the brush head.</li>
            <li>I called again today, spoke to a very nice young man by the name of Cody.</li>
            <li>It is better than the original Sonicare I had years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my teeth, other than flossing.</li>

            <li>Easy on my gums.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Sonicare Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>How can my wife and I share the unit easily?</li>
            <li>It is as advertised, easy to use, easy on the gums and can reach everywhere</li>
            <li>My Dentist recommended Sonic Care as the way to keep my mouth healthy any my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>were too easy to accidentally push when you were using it.  </li>
            <li>but then I read the product info and saw there&#x27;s an easy start feature that gradually increases power over 14 uses.</li>
            <li>I have healthy gums and clean, tartar-free/plaque-free teeth (according the my dentist, not just myself).</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, is easy to use and well made.</li>
            <li>I bought the Easy Clean after reading many helpful Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>I chose whis item and when I charge it over night, the battery dies out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Sonicare Elite, which died after many years of good service.</li>
            <li>Too strong.. Need something with another setting</li>
            <li>Like lighter handle and strong motor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older Sonicare model for about 3 years and when I saw the good price on this one, bought it.</li>
            <li>Nice, simple electric toothbrush at a good price.</li>
            <li>The wireless charging stand is handy and makes keeping the whole thing clean very easy.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much, would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>I now know I should have been using one a long time ago, and this one seems very good.</li>
            <li>Since switching from a manual toothbrush my teeth feel much cleaner and my gums look very healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I did and see a real difference over the cheaper electric brushes.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a product they developed called Clarisonic and my skin is now amazing!</li>
            <li>All in all, so far it has proven to be a nice electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>: the carrying case is nice in the higher end models, but I can&#x27;t stand the fact that, on the premium models, you have to press the button 3+ times to turn the brush off when you&#x27;re done (or stand there with your finger depressed 2+ seconds waiting for it to shut off.)</li>
            <li>far as a toothbrush goes, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic shell is much better than the original rubber coated version.</li>
            <li>This model is slim and feels good in the hand; the older model felt like a vintage hot rod, great at what it was supposed to do but lacking the tightness that comes with modern engineering.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel very clean after a brushing and the unit itself stays clean too.</li>
            <li>Love it, very powerful and gets your teeth really clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely love the toothbrush, its worked flawlessly for the past year.</li>
            <li>brushes just fine.</li>
            <li>It was rated the best several years ago when I purchased my first one.  </li>
            <li>but once you are used to it, it feels absolutely fine</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to fit on any vanity.</li>
            <li>the plus side, contacting Philips to get a free warranty replacement was easy (it&#x27;s a 2 year warranty).</li>
            <li>I am totally fine with everything about it.  </li>
            <li>The previous reviews were so helpful in choosing the best product for me.</li>
            <li>, I found out the replacemente heads for ProResults also fit the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a fine product and when my daughter told me she was in the market for an electric toothbrush I purchased this for her knowing how well it has worked for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li>For about half a year, it worked great!</li>
            <li>worked fine for a year, and then it just died.</li>
            <li>Slim design makes it easy to fit in toothbrush cup.</li>
            <li>Great product for those who have a tendency to over brush - prevents further receeding gum line while giving a healthy clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to tell by the light on the handle when it&#x27;s charged and when it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li>The one (quick) learning curve was remembering to keep your mouth shut when the brush is on!</li>
            <li>I feel confident that all parts of my mouth are getting adequate attention during my tooth brushing activity.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to be loyal to sonicare!</li>
            <li>it is light weight and cleans good and clean up is easy as the brush head does not get any paste in the brush connection to the main body.</li>
            <li>Nice tidy, small design, with good agitation.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps on the cleanliness of my mouth for sure!</li>
            <li>Almost as good as a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>Heads are easily interchangeable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, handle is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the same features as the e-series, including the quadra - timer thing (hesitates every 30 seconds and stops after 2 minutes) but is easier and more pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean, easy to get replacement brushes, and it holds the charge for days.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth for longer duration and more frequency because it&#x27;s fun and easy.</li>
            <li>My new dentist said Sonicare is best, and so I switched back, and realized how much better</li>
            <li>Super easy and supper clean!  </li>
            <li>This design is far more elegant and easy to maintain and the cleaning is easily as good (likely better!)</li>
            <li>And, the best part: it works well, holds a charge, and requires little maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great upgrade from the older design, which built up a funny odor.  </li>
            <li>Huge step forward for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Sonicare fan.</li>
            <li>This thing is a Huge pain...</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in my oral health.</li>
            <li>been 4 years and still on the same battery and no cavities ... a great investment ...</li>
            <li>Hold lightly to the teeth as advised by my dentist</li>
            <li>I chose this model because I liked how much cleaner this one was.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if these electric toothbrushes were worth it, but now I know they are.</li>
            <li>Replaced my $20 O ral-B with the Easy Clean model.  </li>
            <li>It works great, but takes a while to get used to, the noise level is low as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Sonicare and specifically the Easy Clean model was recommended by our hygienist and seconded by the dentist when I spoke to him about</li>
            <li>Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>When used properly, it is great for plaque removal that is gentler than brushing manually, especially for anyone with gum recession and exposed roots.</li>
            <li>Great standard eletric toothbrush, no bells and whistles</li>
            <li>I use this with Brushing Rinse (sometimes available on Amazon, sometimes on Vitacost),</li>
            <li>It is light and slender.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, just pop the head off and rinse.</li>
            <li>so customer service was great, about 3 months later it happened AGAIN.  </li>
            <li>None was available.</li>
            <li>So happy I got this easy clean model and not the standard.</li>
            <li>With all the brush heads now available</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need the fancy $200 brush unless you just want to shell out that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>Overall happy with purchase, no cons I can think of.  </li>
            <li>Works great, keeps my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist after having my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would seamlessly fit together</li>
            <li>and they work fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Now it makes a buzzing sound and the brush head wobbles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and the 30 second pulse for even brushing is great.  </li>
            <li>With the Easy Clean heads, they eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li>I already like brushing my teeth and this electric toothbrush make it even more fun.  </li>
            <li>They work great  - they do occasionally die</li>
            <li>Some didn&#x27;t even fit and kept coming off and the longest use I got from any of those was probably 1 week before they started to come off in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for the price and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The function that I find most useful is the two minute timer.</li>
            <li>Christmas present for my son who is extremely happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush that gives thorough and deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the more powerful one and would not buy this again.</li>
            <li>Easy clean is an understatement.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Keeping the brush, the replaceable head and the charging station clean is easy.</li>
            <li>The tooth brush is utterly fantastic.</li>
            <li>Almost all of the available brush heads fit this model except Essence of course.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a FANTASTIC product and you will not regret buying it.</li>
            <li>This is great, I like that it has the 30 second intervals to remind me to change positions.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how fabulous this brush is.</li>
            <li>but it is fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is the cheapest model that has all the important features.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>I bought a pack of replacement heads, also, which are readily available.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and it definitely will get all the gook out.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>/&gt;These do a fantastic job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush works well, and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I sound like a shill for the company, but I don&#x27;t think they need any help.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>Great product, like the smaller brush head and the way it attaches!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Easy clean from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So I returned the Easy clean to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This model is simple and great to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for weeks on one charge and has a light to indicate the charge status.  </li>
            <li>It felt fantastic.</li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably whiter and so smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, great buy.</li>
            <li>It does sound a lot like the dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
            <li>But five stars for making an essential improvement--and it was always a great brush.</li>
            <li>The quarter timed signals are great for pacing when to move on to the next step of brushing.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>and I like to travel light.</li>
            <li>It is the basic model and does a great job.</li>
            <li>replacement brushes are readily available.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded from the Sonicare Essence to the Easy Clean model almost a year ago.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush and charger are light and compact.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare toothbrush is cost effective and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate because the unit has a 2 year warranty</li>
            <li>Reliable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Phillips offered to replace it for free but that took a month</li>
            <li>The charger is tiny and is also great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More powerful and thorough brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The EasyClean is great and very simple to use.</li>
            <li>Several of the reviews for this model mentioned a simplified handle-to-brush connection that greatly reduced the opportunities for gunk build-up like they had experienced with various brands/models.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean and keep that way.  </li>
            <li>I does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It cleans my teeth well and the product is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Great improvement on prior models.</li>
            <li>This was a fabulous toothbrush... while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Better dental health which is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>This was a fantastic splurge and I will from here on out buy this toothbrush for myself.</li>
            <li>the Easy Clean — </li>
            <li>You can buy DiamondClean replacement heads and they will fit this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight; easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>you don&amp;#34;t need all the different speeds, this works great.  </li>
            <li>The problem with THIS product--the reason for the review delay--was that the head didn&#x27;t fit quite fit flush to the handle</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>Easy clean heads compared to the e-series.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>all the bells and whistles, so this one filled the bill.</li>
            <li>I like the lightweight handle and easy clean feature..</li>
            <li>Does a great job at cleaning and in the spirit of full-disclosure, this is my second Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013</li>
            <li>I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Good price and offers everything I need in a Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and says her teeth feel super clean after each use. :)</li>
            <li>Love the super clean feeling the ultrasonic waves give you.</li>
            <li>It is more compact and the brush heads are much better, there is not as much gunk that builds up around the brush head.</li>
            <li>Got it for my 8 year old who was not doing a good job with brushing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>It had a Lithium battery which is far superior to the NiCad of the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me this was the deciding factor and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I called Philips directly, and the cheery woman on the phone explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to beep.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I was going to love this toothbrush as much as I loved my other Sonicare, but I love this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my new Sonicare, and am grateful for my hygienist&#x27;s advice.</li>
            <li>The price was right; even Costco couldn&#x27;t beat it :)</li>
            <li>and I love how it automatically times itself for the right amount of recommended brushing time.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the product!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying for the whole family now!!!</li>
            <li>Price, quality and fast service !!!</li>
            <li>is very useful</li>
            <li>It worked very effectively which make my tooth white!</li>
            <li>but I find it very useful and after a while</li>
            <li>We also received the kids one as a gift and find it very fun to get them to brush.</li>
            <li>It is very nice to use because of being slimmer and also having the 30 second timer that tells you to brush the section of your teeth !</li>
            <li>Works great and makes my teeth feel twice as clean as traditional brushing.</li>
            <li>While I think my teeth are equally clean using either brush, I do prefer the Easy Clean for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product gives an excellent clean and yet is not too harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li>At almost 30 years old and now having braces, I knew i needed a good toothbrush to help keep EVERYTHING clean in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great for brushing my teeth and seems to be doing a much better job for tooth brushing than the conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li>After brushing with this thing for the first time, my teeth felt very smooth along the gum line.</li>
            <li>Very light, easy to maneuver, much improved brushes.</li>
            <li>This cleans better than my old electric tooth brush - keeps the charge and the timer is great for remembering to move to a new section</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how clean my teeth feel after using my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stop feeling my teeth with my toungue because they are so clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nice improvement over the older model.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush does an excellent job in breaking up plaque and cleaning in areas that a normal toothbrush simply can&#x27;t get to,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and tremendously beneficial for dental care.  </li>
            <li>The main shaft became wobbly, and it would not brush effectively.</li>
            <li>Easy, quick and thorough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t catch the debris like the older brush &amp; is a nice size.</li>
            <li>The process was quick, easy, and efficient.</li>
            <li>More than a year later of using this product, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t take space, I like this slim design, it looks cool.</li>
            <li>This design with the new head is much better!  </li>
            <li>All I need for gleaming, whiter teeth is the magical sonicare brush itself, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>Well the Easy clean is like a massaging brush rather than full power clean.  </li>
            <li>About a year ago my parents sent me an electric toothbrush (&lt;$20) because they were impressed with new ones that had recently tried.</li>
            <li>happened to have timed the delivery of this new toothbrush perfect, because i got it the same day I got my braces on.</li>
            <li>It charges easily,  handle allows a good grip, cleans well  and is quiet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always heard how Sonicare made great toothbrushes with a loyal customer following but never wanted to spend &amp;#</li>
            <li>The really nice design feature is the easy push-on / pull-off brush head as opposed to the threaded collar connector on the old style.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to brush for the recommended 2 minutes and my teeth are super clean now.</li>
            <li>This new one has an even better design, in that the top just snaps on, so it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>These are so quiet and just make my teeth feel amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes for over 6 years and have never had a problem.  </li>
            <li>Some more expensive models have more bells and whistles, but I feel like this perfectly meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>I love every feature of this toothbrush and it performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It had been two years and one month from my original purchase.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference in my gums (improvement) within a week.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>And when I emailed to get a warranty policy on this product, I was expecting a straightforward answer like &amp;#34;it does not have a warranty&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush since the original model appeared on infomercials in the 1990s.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if your interested in making a wise investment in your oral health!</li>
            <li>Higher models offer more LEDs and fancier bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I love this unit.</li>
            <li>In the case of the original Sonicare Elite, the brush head acted like the speaker cone and the voice coil was contained in the handle.  </li>
            <li>I have been an avid use of Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money !</li>
            <li>This fits the original charger and UV sanitizer, plus the refill heads I had in supply.  </li>
            <li>had I realized the significant improvements they made over the years.</li>
            <li>My old one died and the lure of one not building plaque and gunk very appealing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I had the original sonicare (with the split brush head) for 8 years before it died on me.</li>
            <li>First off, I love the Sonicare and even my hygienist agrees that my teeth are cleaner and my cleanings always go without a hitch.  </li>
            <li>This forces you to focus on exactly where you are brushing, to make sure you don&#x27;t &#x27;run out of time&#x27;.</li>
            <li>So, has anyone found a significant difference?   </li>
            <li>I originally rated this product one star, because when I looked online for replacement heads, I couldn&#x27;t find them.</li>
            <li>I never thought i would get excited about a toothbrush but these sonic toothbrushes are something else.</li>
            <li>used oral B&#x27;s sonic toothbrush in between my original sonciare and</li>
            <li>I had the original Philips Sonicare toothbrush for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have used this version of the SonicCare in the past and it is the best.</li>
            <li>No gimicky features, just a straightforward electric model.  </li>
            <li>As long is lasts, I&#x27;ll be a happy camper.</li>
            <li>This replaces my original Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>You will notice a significantly cleaner feeling than your manual brush.</li>
            <li>This product has brought *significant* improvement.</li>
            <li>Made a significant difference since I switched from manual tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>After the first week of using this, my teeth did feel more clean.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Brush is powerful and easy to operate - but most importantly it cleans up much better than my old brush.</li>
            <li>It did a very good job when it worked, but with a two year warranty, it should not have stopped in less than a year.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean, the battery remains charged for a long time, nice selection of brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product - brushing is easy and effective, it&#x27;s small and light and reasonably easy to keep clean, and never we&#x27;ve had any issues keeping it</li>
            <li>I think the product does a nice job cleaning teeth, but my Sonicare became so noisy over a months period that I&#x27;m returning it for a new one.  </li>
            <li>My new toy arrived in two days nicely packed just like Christmas.  </li>
            <li>My new one is great, and the removeable head doesn&#x27;t gunk up like my older one did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great toothbrush that I see myself continuing to use for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Seems like it should keep the brush head clean.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day to help keep my teeth feeling dentist clean.</li>

            <li>my dental tech recommended a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; one,this was far cheaper than the best brand at a big box store!  </li>
            <li>well of course, but the purpose of this brush is to actually clean your teeth not rub them manually.</li>

            <li>model has a lithium ion battery that is more advanced than NiCad batteries found on Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion; while both brushes are very close in performance, and both are far superior to any manual toothbrush Sonicare, particularly this model is slightly better than the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I had one of these years ago and my oral hygienist used to comment about how clean my teeth were.</li>

            <li>My teeth feel so clean after I use this product.</li>
            <li>One note to make is that I opted to splurge on the diamond clean heads because I like dimension in my brush.</li>
            <li>clean dentist feeling&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth clean anymore after having used this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Teeth never felt so clean...</li>
            <li>The teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean (a good improvement from some previous Sonicares).  </li>
            <li>Liked my first Easy Clean purchase so I going to replace my sons older model that is prone to mold.  </li>
            <li>was a nice adjustment for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>As long as the innards last, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>Works great, can buy replacement heads of various types and firmness right here on amazon.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Easy Clean is very basic but does a perfect job at making your teeth feel clean and look pearly white.</li>
            <li>and I love the new slimmer easy to clean design.</li>
            <li>I had the original Sonicare for several years and loved what it did for my teeth.</li>
            <li>More quiet easy to hold better on gums.</li>
            <li>My teeth certainly feel cleaner and most assuredly are cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I never once used any of the special cleaning modes when I had the Flexcare model, so this one made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- i made the right choice!</li>
            <li>will send the information to the right department to get this resolved!  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, but did not have a detailed battery meter like my first.  </li>
            <li>This seems to clean much quicker to to the much more rapid vibration than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love it, don&#x27;t have to pull it apart to clean which saves so much time.</li>
            <li>A couple of times I have even brushed twice because it just feels so good to have really clean teeth.</li>
            <li>It just works to clean my teeth thoroughly, and really feels refreshing in the way it sort of massages the gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more compact style and much easier to keep clean design</li>
            <li>I hardly take the time to write reviews of things I&#x27;ve purchased but this toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li>This one does a better job, feels better in my mouth (it&#x27;s much slimmer), and is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I liked the Philips Sonicare with more settings to choose from a little better</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because I was happy with what we had been using, but I took a chance bought the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>Having read almost all of the reviews from other users,I concur that this model,the easy clean is the best choice for those that want the most updated version with the new design brush,without spending the extra money for stuff most people would not use.</li>
            <li>Works great, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>If you want Bright White just brush</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about the blinking light during charging.</li>
            <li>Simple but good.  </li>
            <li>; I doubt I was putting in the full two minutes dentists recommend with the Spinbrush.  </li>
            <li>I keep going back to my good ol&#x27; manual hand held toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read many online reviews about maintenance on the brush/body of the toothbrush and am pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;ve remodeled to keep clean and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>One tip I learned from the beginning was not to leave the brush on the charger full time - it won&#x27;t keep its charge as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is slimmer, you don&#x27;t have the cup where the brush attaches which quickly gets slimy where you have to use bleach or peroxide to clean bacteria.</li>
            <li>have owned Sonicare toothbrushes and loved them but this model was a thinner style and didn&#x27;t last over 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush, loved it at first, and it worked really well in the beginning..</li>
            <li>That means once it&#x27;s at full charge, I can put the charger away and not have it cluttering up space.</li>
            <li>Also makes me brush the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I loved it but couldn&#x27;t justify for a toothbrush that only lasts a</li>
            <li>I like that it is simple with one button and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a toothbrush, tho.  :)</li>
            <li>you really need all the fancy modes, of course you can spend more money.</li>
            <li>so charged it a full 24 hours and no difference.  </li>
            <li>Buy the full size version and NOT this one</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene, I have noticed an overall improvement since I started using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Have used sonicare for many years and am very satisified.</li>
            <li>This has a cool feature that works you up to the full power.</li>
            <li>This is a good tooth brush and I must like it because this is the second one I have used.</li>
            <li>There is a good comparison chart in the product description where you can check out the various models.  </li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I was dubious as to whether I really wanted the quad pacer, but I am really glad I went for the model with that feature -</li>
            <li>What I like most of all is the how much fresher my mouth feels after the toothbrush does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>It actually feels really good.</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t have the screw on toothbrush head, cleaning is much easier and there aren&#x27;t as many crevices to get gunked up.</li>
            <li>their recent discontinuing RQ12 shaver head, they are still doing a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I can&#x27;t wait to finish this review and go brush my teeth.    </li>
            <li>It cannot be re-inserted to restore full functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also own a 10 year old Essence Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It used to really bother my husband but after a couple of weeks he didn&#x27;t even think about it any more.</li>
            <li>the one function on the HX6511/50 is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Decided to take the plunge with the HX6511 after reading numerous good reviews regarding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>Also, without seeing this product, i was unsure about the size head (compact or full) to get.</li>
            <li>It is smaller in diameter than the old Sonicare 4300, but BOY does it ever do a great job of brushing... even better than the 4300...</li>
            <li>a verry good product in itsself but Not the total job a sonic can do.</li>
            <li>but I end up with a mouth full of liquid toothpaste, water, saliva mixture with zero bubbles.</li>
            <li>What they say is true: Since I&#x27;ve used Sonicare, I&#x27;ve had A+ checkups from my dentist every time.  </li>
            <li>Now, it should run at full power.</li>
            <li>love it so much</li>
            <li>The head is smaller than one would expect, but for good reason--precision cleaning.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thinner in design, holds a charge for way more than a week before needing recharging and the brush is now just the brush head.</li>
            <li>Good quality works well the second one I owned</li>
            <li>I feel like this feature really helps me make sure I am getting all areas thoroughly.</li>
            <li>At the time, I got a good buy on extra brush heads.</li>
            <li>Such a shame since it was so good for my dental health</li>
            <li>Faithfully cleaning your teeth beautifully (to the point your dentist compliments you on them) and never once letting you down?</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer is a nice touch to evenly distribute the full two minutes among all your teeth!  </li>
            <li>This new model is fabulous, I love it.</li>
            <li>I got a new version, and that was great, but it developed a problem with the motor or something.</li>
            <li>Stays clean; no nasty build up on the brush which was my main concern when looking for an electronic brush.</li>
            <li>The handle is slimmer than the older one, which is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I briefly though about getting the Diamond Clean with the USB charger, which would have been nice, but the case is so huge</li>
            <li>Lasts about 2 weeks on a full charge and charges quick.</li>
            <li>The upscale version has several modes and is a bit of a more elegant design, but costs more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li>This is a good news - bad news - good news story of an excellent brush that conked out on me after only 23 months but was still under warranty and quickly replaced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>My dental appointments are great due to the thorough cleaning I get with this product.</li>
            <li>Sonicare are great toothbrushes and have saved me $$$ in dentist bills due to the thorough cleaning it does.</li>
            <li>I love this new model!  </li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling after use and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>The new brushes may be more ergonomic, easier to care for and lighter weight, but when it comes to cleaning teeth, they&#x27;re no where near as effective</li>
            <li>It cleans well and when you are finished your mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Mouth always feels clean and fresh and tingly after use.</li>
            <li>Makes my teef and mouth reall clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Works better than the older model of SoniCare.</li>
            <li>Super gum stimulation ;+}</li>
            <li>Bought both my son and husband the Healthy White model for Christmas and both love it.</li>
            <li>So much better than the older model.</li>
            <li>I like the Sonicare much better because it feels more like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a couple of years ago at the suggestion of my dentist since I tend to build up plaque quickly on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The brush runs so quickly that I can&#x27;t control it on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Much more slim and streamlined than the older model I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the older and cheaper version (Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush) where gunk and crud accumulates inside the connection of the brush and the body of the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>However, it moves so quick it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li>The smooth plastic of the Sonicare is a bit more slippery, but far easier to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its the best that there is, this is the third one I&#x27;ve owned in 30 years, dropped the last one in the shower and broke it after 7 years.</li>
            <li>The Cybersonic has a plastic interface that wears out quickly if you have a family snapping brushes and flossers in and out</li>
            <li>I would not want to do without this super tool.</li>
            <li>I was careful to charge it fully before its first use, in fact, it worked beautifully until about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I love the sonicare toothbrushes, this one is the more basic model, but it does everything I need it too!</li>
            <li>Most people will not use these extra \\&quot;features.\\&quot; If you need more time, you can turn the brush on again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And this one uses a global charger which makes travel around the world much easier lol.</li>
            <li>Finally, the battery life has been exceptional.</li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular one again.</li>
            <li>The quadrant timer is super helpful.</li>
            <li>The handle on the Easy Clean is slim and oval and feels so much nicer in your hand than the E series.</li>
            <li>product as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>the older models have so many places that hold water that mold would build inside the cavity of the device.  </li>
            <li>There are no impossible to reach nooks and crannies in a cavernous area underneath the brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare, works so much better than regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Easy Clean looks like it should be much simpler to keep in a hygienic condition.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, a quick search on Amazon found one with</li>
            <li>Love the design, love how it performs, and the technical savvy internals.</li>
            <li>My particular favorite, and the one that I continue to use, is the timer feature.</li>
            <li>Phillips required a proof of purchase, luckily I had bought it from Amazon so no problem printing a receipt for them.</li>
            <li>The older one I had before this was better.</li>
            <li>My original Sonicare - how many years old now?!</li>
            <li>Slim line of this toothbrush fits better in your hand than older models plus include a travel case for ease.  </li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush for 2 months I can safely say I love it much more than the previous model (ESeries).</li>
            <li>This is not resolved many, many months later</li>
            <li>It cleans super well.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a beeping noise but a quick break in the vibrations</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this toothbrush that replaced an older version Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>For that reason alone, I highly recommend this simpler model over the more fancy ones.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not purchase anything higher than the Easy Clean, which does just as effective a job.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast durable long lasting toothbrush, I love it, best purchase of my year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much easier to clean than the Sonicare I had before!</li>
            <li>one really makes your teeth and mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li>I have used an older model for many years, have been very pleased with it, but it finally died.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s actually working fine on both 110v and 220v, makes it very easy to use aboard.</li>
            <li>I have only had my Sonicare for about a month but am very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li>You can also put any healthy white or diamond brush head on the easy clean.</li>
            <li>The easy clean, healthy white, diamond series....</li>
            <li>The unique head design, with the magnet attached directly to the bush, produce a longer throw (sweep) of the bristles, resulting in more thorough brushing.  </li>
            <li>The brush works 1,000 times better than a normal toothbrush and tells you when to change sides.</li>
            <li>the meantime, I bought one at Walmart and like it very much!</li>
            <li>The vibrating brush took one or two times to get used too, but I feel like this brush does a better job of cleaning my teeth compared to a normal brush.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare with the &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush head is much better and even my dentist friend prefers this style.</li>
            <li>and I consistently get problem free dental visits.</li>
            <li>Like the heads much better than the standard that comes with the easy clean.</li>
            <li>main reason why I purchased this product is because of the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>Upgraded from older model used for over 5 years, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>it cleans my teeth than the old toothbrush, how much quieter it is, how much more comfortably it fits in the hand, and that the design keeps it free of gunk collecting between the head and the rest of the brush.</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid for a new one because it cleans so well.</li>
            <li>This new one feels like it works better.</li>
            <li>Love the new design.  </li>
            <li>I love the new design.  </li>
            <li>These new head designs are so much better.</li>
            <li>You will get used to using it and you won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li>Since the warranty was for 24 months, I was able to obtain a new replacement from Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>brush but this new one so much better.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a very long time and does a good job of cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>The previous one that I have does, otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li>Considering the cost of dental work, this brush is sure to pay for itself many times over in the long run.  </li>
            <li>I really hope the fix for easy cleaning has been made.  </li>
            <li>Very high-speed vibrations make brushing easy and your mouth feels sort of tingly afterwards.</li>
            <li>It also travels easily as it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li>it is much lighter than the e-series and easy to move in your mouth.</li>
            <li>After much researching, I bought this brush a looong time ago and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>It is easy to work and makes a real difference.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have a strong opinion yet.  </li>
            <li>Battery has a pretty good life on it, as I&#x27;ve only charged it 3 or 4 times - maybe once a month it needs a charge.</li>
            <li>It charges easily and cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li>The head is smaller and  you can really get around tooth and clean it really good.</li>
            <li>Really works well and is easy to use</li>
            <li>My first one lasted probably 6/7 years, and finally started not working so good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost and really makes reloading quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Thanks again AMAZON!!</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 6 years and my dental visits have been a breeze!  </li>
            <li>The first one I had, had bells and whistles I never used!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m typically pretty &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; but after using my wife&#x27;s toothbrush, I ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li>Oh, and the instant $10.00 off coupon at checkout was a cherry on top!</li>
            <li>I am keeping the new Essence and returning the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner, easy to use, and worth every dollar.</li>
            <li>Awesome product at a great price with none of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models that are pointless features.</li>
            <li>This one cleans perfectly with its single power level, and I can just use it twice if I want extra brushing time.</li>
            <li>I have replaced my clunky old Sonicare with this new Slim, light and handy model.</li>
            <li>, teeth feel really clean after the first use, it gives you that &#x27;&#x27;Just came from a dentist appointment feeling&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts a long time, super streamlined, easy to clean unlike my last model, and does a really good job getting my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but a great product.</li>
            <li>A great little brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my little morning joy.</li>
            <li>This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After using Sonicare for years I can not stand using a manual toothbrush, the difference is stunning in how clean your teeth feel and general teeth/gum health.</li>
            <li>Previously I had a fancier Sonicare, but this one is better- simple, easy to clean, only takes an inch of counter space, does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a good toothbrush, it beeps every time to move on to a different spot in the mouth and turns off automatically after a certain amount of time (2 min?).</li>
            <li>I bought him the Easy Clean (Cleans White no longer available)</li>
            <li>Smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in a few years and the size has greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and seem to hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li>lol Now,,,,, it did take me a few days to get use to using it, but now , I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable using it and my teeth feel very well cleaned.</li>
            <li>I think Pro Results standard brush heads fit the Easy Clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s completely worth</li>
            <li>The head feels MUCH more nimble and easier to get into the corners of my mouth than the old SoniCare Elite.  </li>
            <li>The fact that I was not using an effective toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t flossing enough did me in (soda didn&#x27;t help either).  </li>
            <li>I do wish that it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically after the 2 minutes because I often like to go back and hit the important spots one more time.</li>
            <li>I rarely charge the battery.</li>
            <li>Good design - easier to keep clean that previous models I have had.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said this was not as powerful and insisted he did not have the Easy-start feature activated.</li>
            <li>Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I smile a lot.</li>
            <li>When you turn it on it&#x27;s like a nice low hum where the oral B sounds like you have just started up a lawn mower to go to town on your teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare these days to have a product meet the manufacturers claims, and this toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare EasyClean&#x27;s 3 week battery life (brushing 2x daily) is also superior to Oral-B&#x27;s and therefore another reason that Sonicare is better for international travel.</li>
            <li>The cost is worth it.</li>
            <li>Its just not as powerful as the upgraded version.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as powerful as the step-up model, I also have an HX6711.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>electric toothbrush are really fun to use</li>
            <li>Much better than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is more compact than the old style Sonicare toothbrush (the ones that had screw on toothbrush heads) and it works about as well.  </li>
            <li>My husband has a different kind of toothbrush that does go in circular motions</li>
            <li>Cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li>rarely say this about technology purchases</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for one that I had for years and the design changes make it better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush uses the same type of brush heads, ProResults, which is good since I have replacement heads at the ready.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare really delivers a good cleaning and you can tellright away the difference between a standard toothbrush and the Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads are not cheep for soniccare but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the Pro results brush heads as well as the soft feel.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my elite.  </li>
            <li>Would make a better childs toothbrush than adult.</li>
            <li>Far better than the models with a screw-on head.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to have gotten an extra brush with it.</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the price of entry, no joke.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t speak yet to the longevity of this model, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how much better</li>
            <li>chose it because, for me, the sonicating action is better at removing plaque and food debris from my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>Time will tell how this thing lasts but after 2 months it seems to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money to buy again.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;ve been 3 weeks in between charges and that&#x27;s only because I wanted to charge it.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of the Philips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes, one for myself and one for my adult son as a gift.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much better than an old one I was using.  </li>
            <li>Easy clean is the perfect model, top performance without paying for stupid bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Slimmer but powerful like the&lt;br /&gt;larger models.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Nice narrow profile, easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I kinda gave him the 3rd degree about how nice these are and that it is just like Dad&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I like them both in their own different ways, so I rotate using them.  </li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth the hype.</li>
            <li>To protect from further gum erosion, but still effectively fight plaque, I have been using this and like it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t seem to be worth the added expense.  </li>
            <li>When I bought a second brush so my wife and I could each have our own, I got this model — </li>
            <li>The head is much better and doesn&#x27;t collect gunk like the old ones.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this hurt on so many levels.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is more like a mute buzz then a loud beep.</li>
            <li>All that is really added is a quick clean mode (it just turns of at 1 min instead of 2 min</li>
            <li>Wow,,,,,, i just love this brush.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li>So much better than my old fat Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I use a Waterpik brand flosser at night-</li>
            <li>When you get done brushing with this brush, your teeth will be fresh from the dentist</li>
            <li>As far as brushing teeth go still an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Love the slim design not as bulky as the other two and is very light.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok, but I feel like they aren&#x27;t very powerful and the headsize isn&#x27;t very big.  </li>
            <li>got a Sonicare tooth brush in 2001, and it’s still going strong, so we had high expectations.  </li>
            <li>but they were more interested in selling a new unit.</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is simple and effective, just right.</li>
            <li>I had my original Sonicare (the one with the large head that you had to screw on) for probably 5 or 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I love getting great checkups from my dentist (seriously!).</li>
            <li>If you are currently using the Sonicare E series brush, the Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean is definitely worth the upgrade!</li>
            <li>Better change for better brushing and no inflammation due to bacteria.</li>
            <li>The heads on those have a large collar that gets slimy and you have to take it off and clean it all the time.</li>
            <li>It looks smart, and it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>more like low rumble that shakes your teeth out rather than clean them.</li>
            <li>if you want to keep your teeth as clean and healthy as possible, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and white, my gums are healthy.</li>
            <li>so if you want a better clean - just buy different brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are always left feeling clean and my gums are noticeably more healthier.</li>
            <li>Seems to clean as well as the Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>It clean white design also looks better.</li>
            <li>We had an older fancier Sonicare that finally died and we loved it but never used all of the features.  </li>
            <li>I love that this version is so much cleaner than the older models where toothpaste and water slime leaked into the brush head.  </li>
            <li>The replacement Easy Clean they sent was as loud as the first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter and battery last much longer, also looks nice!  </li>
            <li>Very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a \\&quot;high end electric toothbrush\\&quot; seems the two real decisions are - how many bells and whistles do you want to pay for and do you go Philips or OralB.  </li>
            <li>So with the right toothbrush holder you could feasibly use that still if you are used to having your toothbrush there.</li>
            <li>Start the younguns out right.  </li>
            <li>experience may differ because ever since I bought this tooth brush, I brush right after I eat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a right decision.</li>
            <li>Look at it this way, right now you spend $90 on a toothbrush, it will prevent you from spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist</li>
            <li>the price is right.  </li>
            <li>The 2 minute timer makes brushing for the right amount of time a no brainer.</li>
            <li>These pop right into the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.  </li>
            <li>It is a quality product at the right price.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it has the snap on head not the screw on one.</li>
            <li>and a new brush head when the last one looks like its ready to go to the happy brush after life.....</li>
            <li>This is my second Sonicare Tooth brush and I can&#x27;t live without it and the trips to the dentist are a lot more enjoyable too.</li>
            <li>The price I paid on amazing was about $20 cheaper than what I saw the exact same product for at Target</li>
            <li>This bare bones model is all anyone needs to maintain a healthy smile.</li>
            <li>This was much easier to clean, but doesn&#x27;t matter if it won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>I like this stlye, Easy Clean, better than my two previous ones.  </li>
            <li>I am now on day 27 and the indicator light is still on steady, indicating the battery still has over 20 percent of charge remaining.</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean and the Interdental brush heads claim to remove 7X as much plaque as manual brushing</li>
            <li>It does clean really well.</li>
            <li>Really leaves your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to clean than some.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, the brush is of the same high quality, and the brushing is of the same excellent results as the higher end model.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  </li>
            <li>The new brush design seems to work fine - no icky gunk - and the power of the brush seems more intense than I remember</li>
            <li>highly recommend them as a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was easy to clean but such a short life.</li>
            <li>I liked my old soniccare but this new model</li>
            <li>This is really a great electric toothbrush, much improved over previous styles and models.  </li>
            <li>Better than my previous oral b toothbrush and love the interval timer.</li>
            <li>Feels funny when you first use it, but you quickly get used to it and</li>
            <li>super powerful, i notice my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I wasn&#x27;t sure I could finish brushing because it tickled so much with the high vibrations.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that the new one DOES NOT have the rubber handle that the older one has, which has gotten yellow and mildewed.  </li>
            <li>Always used cheap electric brushes or normal brushes until this.</li>
            <li>I will use them as ordinary toothbrush, lol</li>
            <li>The one size apparently fits many of the Sonicare models.</li>
            <li>It is great for me, as I have small hands.</li>
            <li>is no better electric tooth brush on the market and this one is a great price.</li>
            <li>This model is nice because it&#x27;s so slim and has a long charge life.</li>
            <li>Effectively cleans, it&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li>I also own, it goes about twice as long without having to be recharged.  </li>
            <li>With all the different models now available, this model seems just fine.  </li>
            <li>That flosser is a thousand times better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.</li>
            <li>It works just as good as the other one!  </li>
            <li>31K vibrations/sec requires some getting used to after our Braun; it tickles the mouth (in the beginning--you get used to it) and emits a very fine mist from your mouth if its open.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this model, especially because it takes up so little space at my sink.</li>
            <li>model feels very comfortable in the hand and extremely convenient to operate, feels like a fine tuned sports car.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This new design is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new one for free.  </li>
            <li>Cheap replacement brushes (providing you didn&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;free brush&amp;#34; scam where they sent you a new brush each month and charged 6 bucks for shipping) and flosser snap-ins.  </li>
            <li>I went to Walmart and purchased a new Easy Clean and a new Essence.  </li>
            <li>It certainly works!</li>
            <li>latest version has slimmed down the handle significantly, which is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much, bought a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li>Having a 30 second beep Is such a great feature and makes brushing easier.</li>
            <li>to this Sonicare Easy Clean toothbrush, you definitely should!</li>
            <li>Great product, my second one in ten years.</li>
            <li>The Easy Clean is Philips basic toothbrush  </li>
            <li>There are more expensive models but this has all the features I wanted and works great..</li>
            <li>find the vibrating action of the Sonicare to be just as effective as the mechanical action of the Oral B.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s speedy and really feels like it is getting my teeth cleaner, but I will still keep the remaining handle and floss heads of the Cybersonic until they die completely and then look for more on eBay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly a year now, and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I did register my toothbrush on the website to ensure if I have any charging,battery or motor issues in the next 2 1/2 years</li>
            <li>Recently purchased the Phillips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>My Oral-B Sonic Complete died and I wanted a good quality but relatively low cost replacement.  </li>
            <li>We had the previous generation which we loved, but wore out.  </li>
            <li>The Easy Clean is a big improvement.  </li>
            <li>I recently received an upscale version of the Phillips Sonicare so had an opportunity to compare with the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>It easily backs up it&#x27;s claim of being twice as clean as regular brushing.  </li>
            <li>Good buy for less money.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy the newer models like the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>Both brands are far superior to manual tooth brushes and unless civilization comes to an end, I&#x27;m not going back to a manual</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is sleek, the brush removes easily and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk up&#x27; like my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Sonicare brush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth and one charge will easily last 3 weeks (twice a day, everyday, two minutes each brushing).  </li>
            <li>I have only had this brush for about a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I would forego the more expensive one - this one works great.  </li>
            <li>If you want really clean teeth, a highly usable brush, get this one.</li>
            <li>The dental staff is pleased that I am finally getting the right amount of brushing in 2 minutes to improve my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I have not put it back on the charger yet, and it&#x27;s still running fine!  </li>
            <li>Very fast vibration frequency.  </li>
            <li>I like my sonicare very much.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much an improvement--smaller and lighter, with a streamlined design that sheds water.  </li>
            <li>original heads contained a powerful magnet that was affixed directly to the brush.  </li>
            <li>do NOT understand why it is called Easy Clean because it has exactly the same attachment as my Healthy White.</li>
            <li>My raving about this new unit has gotten my kids excited about using one and now I&#x27;m going to order the kids version for them.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this model since it is so much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Buy any other Sonicare but the Easy Clean!</li>
            <li>The brush heads swap out super easily when it&#x27;s time (it also tells you that) and goes forever on the same charge.</li>
            <li>Had it for a few months now and it never fails to give me the feeling of nice clean teeth.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd one with the 1st costing a little more, But this one is just as good...</li>
            <li>I am using the new Diamond clean brushes with this</li>
            <li>but these new Sonicare heads stay clean and sanitary all the time&lt;</li>
            <li>Battery lasts forever and the new Pro Results cleaning head is bigger and seems to clean better.</li>
            <li>but wow what a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement over my old Sonicare (that I stopped using).</li>
            <li>We wanted to make sure it used the same charger and brushes, and it does.  </li>
            <li>rechargable battery lasts a week or two, and our first toothbrush lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li>the standard brush heads that come with it were more compact in size</li>
            <li>I splattered toothpaste all over the place the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I bought this electric toothbrush upon the recommendation of my dentist, and I am not sorry.  </li>
            <li>Purchased my first about 10 years ago, nothing compares to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This is the first brush I had</li>
            <li>I had the first one for about 20 years</li>
            <li>My choppers felt cleaner and polished after the first use.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for after I had a Essence model.</li>
            <li>I used to have a higher end model</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I charged it for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The only problem is there are too many models to choose from.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s a big lighter which is better.</li>
            <li>I also love the 2minute timer, and quadspacer which keeps me on track on brushing each part of my mouth equally.</li>
            <li>My Sonicare Healthy White quit after 3 years, so I downgraded to this model.  </li>
            <li>After using this toothbrush for a couple of years I have not only felt the difference versus using a manual toothbrush, but I ended up having much better checkups during my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li>In spite of the smaller size, the battery life is better.</li>
            <li>I just had to recharge mine for the first time after using for at about 5 or 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li>I love the timer which indicates 30 second increments.</li>
            <li>At the higher end, one trusts the toothbrush itself on the OralB and Philips is a wash.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>She said to just get the most simple model, no whistles and bells.</li>
            <li>A feature i love is the timer that tells you when to move from one area of your mouth to the next, it automatically shuts off when the 2 minutes are up.</li>
            <li>The 15 second pauses are more valuable than you would think, helps keep you focused in one area until it&#x27;s time to move on.  </li>
            <li>Bottom front, bottom back, top front, top back.</li>
            <li>and he says it a big improvement over the screw top</li>
            <li>I noticed after about 3 months of using my first Sonicare brush that my teeth looked whiter and felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My first was recommended by a dentist and cost me over $100 with all the features which I never used.</li>
            <li>In purchasing this I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how it would work out as I prefer to brush my teeth in the shower in the morning, and obviously having any type of electric device in the shower can be risky.  </li>
            <li>type feeling for the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li>Much better than her regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I shopped around and Amazon had the best price of all the big and small box</li>
            <li>Have the 4100 model and the Elite Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>I had no qualms about spending the money on another one, and this one works even better than the last.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a present for my daughter after enjoying my first Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Works as well as the higher end</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>but i think i can buy sensitive brushes to fit on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it felt like I just came from having my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you want to Really take care of your oral health, this toothbrush is great!eat!</li>
            <li>I had the first for over 3 years.</li>
            <li>I am currently using a child-sized battery-operated toothbrush that I paid $3.18 for; it is more my size and speed.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the 30 second timer to allow for a thorough cleaning of all four quadrants.</li>
            <li>I wish Philips / Sonicare would stop this practice and be consistent across all countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our first one of these lasted years.</li>
            <li>but it does exactly what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-A smaller brush head for better gum line brushing.</li>
            <li>My inner teeth are cleaned better</li>
            <li>It is also a low profile device that is easy to clean and does not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li>I have used a Philps Sonicare Cleans White for two years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t seem to go back to manual toothbrushes, but I love this version.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in 15 years, my Sonicare broke after 1 year of use.  </li>
            <li>I will pay more next time.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find the model that used the same brushes.</li>
            <li>Again , that is just me and most likely not the fault of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the first one lasted two months.</li>
            <li>Compared to my 13 year old Phillps this model is a lot lighter and smaller in diameter, but just as powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is his first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>The first I got at the Dentist&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>When I first used it, it felt like there was a battle in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This next generation is lighter and has better heads that don&#x27;t collect unreachable mold.  </li>
            <li>This one is the most simple and that was all I wanted.  </li>
            <li>i love that it lets you know when to swtich to a different section and shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Coupled with proper toothpaste, mouthwash, and flossing, I was able to save my teeth before any of the damage became permanent.  </li>
            <li>Great value, long lasting, and will save your teeth and gums!  </li>
            <li>I pressed the button to restart the brushing and it would stop again, make a funny whining noise and that was it.</li>
            <li>Another person sent me an email, I presume even higher up, offering me another handle or a refund.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li>First one lasted forever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100 times better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I have used one (at 74 years of age</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist where they didn&#x27;t say I had inflamed gums and when I told them I was using a Sonicare</li>
            <li>Just be prepared for the oddest sensation on your gums for the first week.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations tickled my mouth at first</li>
            <li>This is my first one..</li>
            <li>This electric does a better job of doing my back molars and it reaches deeper in between the teeth.</li>
            <li>(I used to have a top end Braun and never used its extra modes or features);&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Battery crapped out almost exactly two years from when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I did replace the standard brush head with the &amp;#34;diamond clean&amp;#34; brush heads, which cost a bit more but have denser bristles.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra for it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li>It makes not only tooth, but also support healthy gum.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that the first didn&#x27;t have the 30-second timer in it</li>
            <li>I have used this more than 1 year and now I decided to give it a review because it suddenly stopped work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>our first one lasted about 5 -6</li>
            <li>If the battery is low,  it vibrates when switching off, and can work for some days more.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush cause it runs so quiet compared to some and</li>
            <li>actually like this one better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I no longer felt ticklish after the first week.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted years.  </li>
            <li>First, mine came with a travel case and two toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was to deactivate the 14 day ramp up system.</li>
            <li>The stopping allows me to add more toothpaste, you can use a dab at a time only with this brush.</li>
            <li>First electric toothbrush, and</li>
            <li>I wish it would last food more.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric</li>
            <li>By the way, the first charge on this thing lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I had been using the healthy white toothbrush for years before giving it to my wife and buying this for myself.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are also definitely cleaner because the brush seems to do a better job of getting into nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>Overall pleased with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, powerful, has a small footprint on the counter, and simply feels like it is doing a great job cleaning my teeth,  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I got a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>This replaced my first one I bought YEARS ago.</li>
            <li>I,ve used Sonicare tooth brushes for the last 10 or more years</li>
            <li>This is my wife,s first one</li>
            <li>This does leave your gums feeling more stimulated and teeth with a cleaner sensation than standard toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I thought these brushes were a joke at first.</li>
            <li>It takes some time to get used to; espically if your a first time electronic toothbrush user.  </li>
            <li>I can safely recommend this brush especially to those switching from a manual brush.</li>
            <li>that at first you dont think they will even work.</li>
            <li>I am still using this toothbrush because I think I am doing better for my teeth than the traditional brush.</li>
            <li>THEY HAVE TOO MANY MODELS THAT REQUIRE DIFFERENT HEADS FOR EACH SERIES</li>
            <li>maybe should bought one of the ones a tier or two higher.</li>
            <li>first one I owned (the Elite version, I believe) lasted about 4 or 5 years until it would not take a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>Being sonic, the toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than regular electric brushes with rotating heads ever did.</li>
            <li>i think the design is sleeker and better looking with a smaller stand.</li>
            <li>third Sonicare over the years; keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job very well!</li>
            <li>I love the ease of operation and the simple design to the brush which lets you know when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now owned this brush for several months, and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Lost my first one and immediately got another.</li>
            <li>More maintenance than a regular toothbrush-</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and thought that it was just another toothbrush albeit higher end.</li>
            <li>I had issues brushing with it the first two days as it tickled my gums</li>
            <li>so keeping in mind this flaw in the instructions and making sure to brush your entire mouth, this could be a five-star product.</li>
            <li>Just hope this one lasts longer then the first one.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>That means the brush increases power gradually over the first 14 uses.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of the one button on and off, without having to cycle through various modes to turn the thing off, I like the automatic shut off after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I could not recommend it higher -- your mouth will thank you for the investment.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok, so didn&#x27;t want to incure the cost to send it back, but just know that what you receive from Amazon might well be what someone else has returned.</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used too as it feels funny at first, but I can see teeth</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These are great toothbrushes that last for a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li>It may cost more than a standard brush, but I am sure I make it back at the dentist visits now.</li>
            <li>This product definitely cleans our teeth much better than manually brushing.</li>
            <li>Still working many months later.  </li>
            <li>The second one is better, but still turns off too soon at times.  </li>
            <li>I had the fancier version of this, the healthy white, for like 6 years</li>
            <li>I LOVE brushing my teeth with this, and I can&#x27;t stand using regular toothbrushes anymore.</li>
            <li>It is shaped such that your hand slides up toward the top of the brush head and your hand turns the switch off.  </li>
            <li>I have the Sonicare healthy white for myself and this model (which is $20.00 cheaper)</li>
            <li>really these things are worth it.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and the handle is slimmer and fits better in my hand.  </li>
            <li>However, it does perform better than any 10 or 20 dollar unit outside of that one  mis-advertising issue.  </li>
            <li>I love the 30 second beeps that remind you to move to another part of your mouth to continue brushing.</li>
            <li>Also, the first time I used it, toothpaste went everywhere.</li>
            <li>Just had my first dental cleaning since using this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare works better than my last electric tooth brush which was an Oral-B.</li>
            <li>and although I NEVER look forward to my dental cleanings, I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic that my mouth will look and feel significantly better at my next appointment!</li>
            <li>May like it even better than my last model!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v used several different styles on Sonicare and it is simply the best toothbrush you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean I get with this toothbrush vs any other.  </li>
            <li>I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, small footprint in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful to teeth, and I like that soft feeling.</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s lighter and more comfortable to hold than previous models.</li>
            <li>older model with the larger brush heads (now sold as the Essence) seemed to be a more solid product, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy to keep clean and</li>
            <li>I share this with my girlfriend and you can easily swap the head much faster than the old design.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier to clean than the older Sonicare I owned.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to clean than the older one I had</li>
            <li>This model is also much easier to keep clean than older models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the earlier Sonicare models with the screw on brush heads, and the new snap on style is much cleaner, the brush itself is slimmer, lighter, and I find more ergonomically friendly.  </li>
            <li>I love Sonicare and this is the third Sonicare we&#x27;ve had thru the years, all the previous models had twist-on heads, which made switching them out very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>so I know I clean each quadrant of my mouth equally and for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>For several years i used the sonic care toothbrush with the large screw on top.</li>
            <li>-B&#x27;s rotating round brush heads seem to clean the surfaces facing inside the mouth better, however overall Sonicare seems to be doing a better job and various research done seems to verify that Sonicare is slightly better than Oral-</li>
            <li>Amazing &amp; just as expected!</li>
            <li>My dentist originally recommended Sonicare nearly 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars if it came with more than one head and the plug was a flat style.</li>
            <li>After a full charge, in use it is noticably weaker than my wife&#x27;s Healthy White 710 Sonicare (which in turn is somewhat weaker than my old Sonicare Elite).  </li>
            <li>Ended up buying this after my 10+ year old original Sonicare stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>Since Ive had a sonicare toothbrush for the last eight years, the new slimmer model is really great especially if you have arthritis or any hand pain.</li>
            <li>Also, I will update this review if good or bad things occur (hopefully all good).</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on your teeth, yet, they are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth still feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>and so far it&#x27;s a breeze to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Had the old style and it was so gunky to clean.  </li>
            <li>The gap between the brush and the handle was half of the flexcare; it&#x27;s a much tighter fit and more secured.  </li>
            <li>It really is far easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The unit is slimmer than previous versions, which makes it easier to grip; the price was reasonable, and it has the most important feature to me---quadrapacer.</li>
            <li>So far it does leave a clean feeling in my mouth, but I really can&#x27;t say it cleans better until I have my next check-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better by far than the old sonic are.</li>
            <li>wife has the basic Sonicare model and this EasyClean is much thinner, lighter, and hold a charge to safely use it for a week of travel and still have power to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better then my old Sonic Care battery operated unit (My was over 10 years old).</li>
            <li>but this is much smaller lighter, easier to use, and all-around more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>I use this Philips brush on a once-daily basis to achieve a thorough cleaning, and combine with a RADIUS toothbrush for manual brushing several times a day after meals for a quick clean.</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the more expensive one I replaced.  </li>
            <li>He initially had a battery one and likes this so much better  that he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it not being ready for him when he needs it. .</li>
            <li>and my wife and I both use it, using our own heads marked with the color rings that come with the extra heads.</li>
            <li>the battery life is excellent, lasting at least two weeks on 2-3 minutes of brushing twice a day</li>
            <li>for a bit more or almost the same you can get the much newer model with the stonger vibrations.</li>
            <li>Not much to say here since this electrical toothbrush has been doing the job perfectly for a few months now.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li>Having already been used to the full power of the HX6950, I felt like the HX6511/50 was extremely weak at first, but I am noticing that it is increasingly getting stronger, so that is good.  </li>
            <li>interesting to note is the fact that the suggested retail price of the replacement heads is nearly identical to that of the older model, although they are not nearly as complex, or costly to manufacture.  </li>
            <li>I have another model for home and after 6 months of use, my dental hygentist was very pleased at how much of an improvement I had made from previous appointments.  </li>
            <li>I find that not only does this brush clean better than a standard brush, but I also use it more regularly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get much gunk like the earlier generation sonicare units with the bigger replacement heads.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to keep clean, since I&#x27;m one of those people who gets a new brush head very six months.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and ask myself every time I use it why it took me so long to get one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though I&#x27;ve only had the device for a short time, I find that I enjoy using it and feel (and see) that I am doing a much better job of enhancing my dental health.  </li>
            <li>I will get more for my money in the long run.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great upgrade from our last Sonicare--having a snap-on head</li>
            <li>Pretty intense if you&#x27;re used to manual brushing.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much all you need</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 4 years so we can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li>Cybersonic batteries kept charging fully for many years, I will let you know eventually how long the Sonicare batteries</li>
            <li>(it gradually rises in intensity over a couple of weeks, but still felt pretty intense)</li>
            <li>I want a brush that really challenges my gums; and that is exactly what Sonicare recommends.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if  you are just looking for an electric toothbrush without the need for extra features such as Sensitive, Refresh, or Massage, this toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried other brands, but I went back to this style and am happy with it.</li>
            <li>After a weeks use I&#x27;m really liking it, seems to do a good job of cleaning, I like the way it stops vibrating for a fraction of a second to tell you when 30seconds is up and to move on to the next section of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Then you just plant it on the stand for a night and you&#x27;re good to go for another few months!</li>
            <li>Downgrade isn&#x27;t really the right term because the one thing I really missed with the Healthy White was the pause function which allowed me to rinse my mouth and resume brushing without having the timer completely re-set like the Healthy White did.  </li>
            <li>Mostly the others claim to clean and do not in everyday practice.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not a big fan of the quad notification  but for the feeling of how clean these things leave your teeth, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Much easier to clean than my old one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s eliminating plaque very well; and a little more comfortably than with the harder brush head</li>
            <li>This particular model is the cheapest of the new Pro Results Line that has the &amp;#34;Quad-Pacer&amp;#34; function wich makes brushing easy and brainless being that the brush signals you to switch to a new quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>Unlike the older models, the new models are much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>This new one is much lighter, smaller and more powerful then my older unit.</li>
            <li>The head detaches in a very clever way that prevents water  buildup and mold developing.</li>
            <li>Nice that it doesn&#x27;t grow mold inside like the previous Phillips I had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and thin, easy to hold and easy to maneuver around in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>On/off button is easy to access, but not where you are likely to keep accidentally switching it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle fits well in the hand, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and it&#x27;s quite simple to remove/attach the heads (when sharing the unit amongst family members).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice improvement over previous design.</li>
            <li>But this does not equate to less effective cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally I use it more than the two minutes to give myself a deep clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been surprised how long the battery charge lasts which is nice.</li>
            <li>Short term quality has been good, long term is to be determined.  </li>
            <li>Much better than older models that were a mess to clean.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts for many brushes on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to rely on a single charge when I went traveling before, but I don&#x27;t have that issue any more.</li>
            <li>switching from manual to electric was smart</li>
            <li>My dentist is always telling me how I have plaque build up at certain areas in my mouth and</li>
            <li>Used an older sonicare and didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>Powerful, small handle, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is not a normal electric toothbrush that just cleans better.  </li>
            <li>After a trip to a new dentist, whom I trust, she definitely recommended an electric brush as it cleans so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush with the new slimmer, lighter design, and smaller charger.</li>
            <li>In my case, the brush head fitting became so loose that it kept falling off.</li>
            <li>My dental habits were less than perfect for a few years</li>
            <li>It may be sleeker looking, easier to clean and lighter weight, but it has nowhere near the cleaning power of the older Elite models.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel nice and clean, and I find that instead of switching every other day between regular brush and sonicare, I want to use my sonicare every day.</li>
            <li>I then compared it to my old Sonicare and noticed the vibrations from my old Sonicare are MUCH greater than this new one.</li>
            <li>Stays much cleaner than the elite series I had before but has good brushing strength and a very long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect this model to last much longer than the previous one, but functionally it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Quiet and TEN times better at removing plaque!</li>
            <li>It cleans better overall than the original design (particularly the back molars).</li>
            <li>Overall it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine although the battery was starting to fade as it would not hold a charge beyond a week which was a problem on trips.  </li>
            <li>The actual brush is fine</li>
            <li>but I think I could use the regular ones just fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a fine job, but we&#x27;ll see what the next checkup says.</li>
            <li>Those particular DiamondClean brush heads are compatible with this EasyClean model and can be purchased separately; therefore, cleaning performance between the two models are exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing was ready to use right out of the box; came with the body, new brush head and a recharger.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting use to, but it has done an amazing cleaning job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice just seems a little over priced.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m thinking many people bought them about the time I did and are now looking for a substitute, since the Cybersonic 3 is almost identical to the original model and reviews say it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>Firstly the inherent &#x27;torque&#x27; in the power cord makes it hard to set it securely on the counter top, it keeps trying to twist away, particularly when the brush is in use.  </li>
            <li>I kept it and use it but wished it had been a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>it says he hardly feels and good for pockets</li>
            <li>I wish I had known this before wasting my good hard earned money on the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit was sealed pretty good from outside, there would be no impossible way to get in and blow dry the inside on a daily basis(you</li>
            <li>I find this to be a great improvement over my prior models for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>Your teeth feel so much cleaner than with a regular or cheap electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I got a whole 10 months out of it.</li>
            <li>Just makes my teeth feel SO much cleaner than hand-brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li>There is also a whole list of types of toothpaste not to use with it.  </li>
            <li>Gets your teeth much cleaner than a rotary brush or manual one.</li>
            <li>The area is sealed so cleaning is much easier.</li>
            <li>two years and still working really well.</li>
            <li>And my teeth are definitely much whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>It is also much quieter.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over them, haha.</li>
            <li>Tried this one as my old sonicare with the rare earth magnets is failing after 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Went from manual brush to this, and I can feel my teeth much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li>how much my teeth would benefit from buying an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It leaves his teeth feeling very well cleaned.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my counter.</li>
            <li>Mine also came with a carry case, which I REALLY like.</li>
            <li>After charging it for a whole day, it still dies after 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>Slimmer handle and really neat.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this much yet.</li>
            <li>I give these as gifts often and people tell me their dentist comments on how much cleaner their teeth are.</li>
            <li>Very please with transaction and with item.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s a light on the power button that blinks when power is getting low</li>
            <li>For a softer mode, a manual brush with extra-soft bristles (like the Nimbus) is more effective and gentler on the gums, (b) for a \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; mode (just more time), press the button twice instead, and (c) the UV system to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the head by killing bacteria is useless, and provides no real health benefit compared to rinsing the brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Prices are reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>THIS DEVICE REALLY REMOVE FOOD FROM TEETH</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare has enabled me to avoid some dental work and works very well.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EasyClean is cheap without the extra frills</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product and after much research I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Much quieter and stronger than the e-series as well.</li>
            <li>I made the purchase after a bit of research and expected better from Philips than what I received.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush make it so much easier.</li>
            <li>The Phillip Sonicare is pricey, but it really works.  </li>
            <li>There are a number of brush heads to fit personal preference and cleaning needs.  </li>
            <li>This one is much nicer and stays charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well</li>
            <li>I really like the slender handle on this model.</li>
            <li>gets my teeth cleaner and fast</li>
            <li>but my gumline looks so much healthier and doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Review edited an hour later: I called Philips at 1-800-682-7664 and they are sending me a free \\&quot;replacement handle\\&quot; to be received in 7 to 10 business days.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It still retains it&#x27;s charge very well.</li>
            <li>However, the real test of a product is how well it is backed by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I asked who would spend this much money for a toothbrush?  </li>
            <li>Reading carefully the manual, it is there, this procedure should not be used... :)</li>
            <li>I do NOT hear any such sound.  </li>
            <li>A real value.</li>
            <li>My checkups improved directly thanks to it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the much slimmer handle.</li>
            <li>and he seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think electric toothbrushes would REALLY make your teeth that much cleaner as I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>Really cleans the teeth.  </li>
            <li>The head is extremely fast in a &amp;#34;back-and-forth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>if the Sonicare brush touches my gums, it is quite gentle once you get used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>charge time isn&#x27;t much of an improvement over what I am used to.</li>
            <li>I have found the battery on almost everything rechargeable does do better in the long run when a full, uninterrupted charge is provided every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charge time no worse than the competition, but</li>
            <li>And it does so without feeling as though it is applying too much pressure or excess scrubbing to teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than what I could get it for at the store and dentist office.  </li>
            <li>When an audio signal is applied to the voice coil (from an audio amplifier), the magnet attached to the cone moves back and forth, generating sound.  </li>
            <li>I had the Oral-B Triumph for a few years and while the Oral-B&#x27;s head is a better shape for your mouth, the action of the Sonicare is far better and gives my mouth a cleaner feel.</li>
            <li>I could not really afford a better model and doing some research</li>
            <li>I really like this..</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare...</li>
            <li>but it works really well</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this.</li>
            <li>My mouth is so much cleaner  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning was a tremendous hassle on the older model and part I least liked about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much quieter than some of the alternatives.</li>
            <li>Brush is VERY noisy and really too tall.  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush was better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>The design and fit are just what I wanted, and the 30 second &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is also just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The built-in reminder to move to another section when brushing is very helpful.</li>
            <li>It worked reasonably well for 3 years</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner after brushing than they ever did with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be much better.</li>
            <li>Really like the way my teeth feel after using it as well as the additional brush head included.</li>
            <li>I really like this electric toothbrush because I can feel the difference from using a manual one.</li>
            <li>The design is much improved.</li>
            <li>Your whole head vibrates to this thing</li>
            <li>but it was a gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet, very convenient to have a signal every 30 seconds to remind me to brush the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li>I really like how it alerts you to when it is time to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li>I had just purchased 14 generic brush heads that fit well with this model</li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>The brushes even hold their charge really well.</li>
            <li>Really cleans and gets plaque between teeth.</li>
            <li>This brush has made my mouth so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like the two minute turn off feature and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want all the extra bells and whistles of the more expensive brushes as I just wanted a great cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(my hand really felt the vibration), but I get a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>i really like the timer on this unit</li>
            <li>I used to brush longer, but now with the stroke speed and the strict timing, my teeth are much cleaner in a guaranteed 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice this change over time, but I guess that is part of the intent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sending it back and moving up to the Healthy White which is only $10 more.</li>
            <li>Will look for a bit smaller head which will fit in all crevices.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I considered giving it 4 stars just to protest the cost of replacement heads, but I guess they are in line with others and it really works well, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a Philips Sonicare Advance 4300 for 10 years, and I really became accustomed to having the quadpacer feature.  </li>
            <li>i really appericite saving myself the work and the heads</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and the recipient, who has picky tastes, seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t describe it in detail, but I have noticed it is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love about this toothbrush aside from it not being as rough on the gums</li>
            <li>so I can gauge how much longer</li>
            <li>Once you start using this you won&#x27;t dislike going to the dentist quite as much and</li>
            <li>Really like and</li>
            <li>but now that I have, I really like it.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so it feels so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so so much cleaner and</li>
            <li>even my dentist has mentioned how much healthier my teeth and gums are.</li>
            <li>but when I just use this toothbrush, I dont have to floss as much.</li>
            <li>It really gets in the nooks and crannies in your mouth and takes out the plaque build</li>
            <li>It cleaned my teeth fantastically twice a day that whole time.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Guess you really do get what you pay for....</li>
            <li>It just leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>and I really like the timer feature</li>
            <li>and I think this toothbrush gets them so much cleaner than a manual brush did.  </li>
            <li>So much for my sonicare fixation.</li>
            <li>After my Flexcare died, I bought this and am even happier -- 1) because I didn&#x27;t pay as much, 2) because the biggest annoyance I had with the Flexcare, hitting one of the mode buttons unintentionally, doesn&#x27;t exist with this one, 3)</li>
            <li>toothbrush is very sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li>It makes sure I spent the rightg time on each section of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll explain: I have a son who is a doctor and is very picky about everything.</li>
            <li>Thia one is MUCH easier.  </li>
            <li>Who needs advanced timer functions or multiple modes?  </li>
            <li>This one works really well.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has kept her teeth white and cavity free through all of the orthodontic work she was been through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a month or two and really like it.</li>
            <li>the Braun and my teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare Easy Clean got rid of all of it within a few days and my gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li>Very displeased with spending $70 for something that will break so fast.</li>
            <li>and I are much happier now.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>After just a couple days  using it my teeth are much whiter and my gums are looking healthier.</li>
            <li>so much happier without settings.</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Really  cleans your teeth well.</li>
            <li>Much improved.  </li>
            <li>This one is much improved.</li>
            <li>Used to have very tender gums</li>
            <li>Worked very well, for almost two years.  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY GETS YOU TEETH</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>I think it is also helping with my tea stains that I get from drinking so much tea.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The timing mechanism to let you know when to change quadrants is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t vibrate as fast as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>Very frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much lighter, there are no areas for water to get into</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li>After hours of research I settle on this model, and I&#x27;m elated (as much as one can be over a toothbrush) at my choice.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into it too much</li>
            <li>I really like the thinner handle.</li>
            <li>Its much easier to hold.</li>
            <li>It has changed me that much.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel sooooo much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>......once I got used to the intense vibrations.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace the cheap Essence model I had, as the mold and such that was growing in between the handle and the brush head was grossing me out.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>user mode (not so fast and rough)&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>very moment</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this brush really made my teeth</li>
            <li>Works well, really like the timer feature</li>
            <li>After a week my brother says he loves the Sonicare and his teeth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Keeps a charge MUCH longer than an oral b.</li>
            <li>I really like this slimmer model .</li>
            <li>Although sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much, and I do two cycles</li>
            <li>Our teeth feel SO much cleaner now.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>it seems like you don&#x27;t have to use as much toothpaste to get lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li>They look so much whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li>It tickles and buzzes so much</li>
            <li>plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfies with the job that my toothbrush does (just like this one) and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, but does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare fan for many years now and this was actually a replacement for an old one.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than my old Oral-B because the Sonicare has:&lt;br /&gt;-Dual voltage for international travel</li>
            <li>This is more like a design flaw, moisture got in and could not get out, tiny wires connect directly to the opening cap....</li>
            <li>Up to 24 hours is normal for a full charge from an almost completely drained battery.</li>
            <li>It also initially works up to full speed the first dozen times or so.  </li>
            <li>My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  </li>
            <li>When it finally died recently, I reluctantly ordered another Sonicare (the Easy Clean model), since many reviews of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes indicate that they are not very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was waiting for this one to arrive, I reverted to my husband&#x27;s old E-series Sonicare and my teeth immediately went more yellow.</li>
            <li>I love how you can purchase extra soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one of this model (my first was lost when American Airlines totally lost my luggage!), and it&#x27;s as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li>The vibration took a few days to get accustomed to but over all  much  more  pleasant than the OralB spin brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>This new version works just as good, if not better, but doesn&#x27;t have the areas that can fill with moisture and funk.</li>
            <li>Small, light, and easy to hold</li>
            <li>You get used to all of the above pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few other electric toothbrushes, but the Sonicare is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>to its larger size, the older Elite model could contain a more powerful amplifier and I suspect larger batteries to support it.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t exactly come up with new, &amp;#34;innovative&amp;#34; ways to come up with vibrations.</li>
            <li>It was easily cleaned off with bleach and did not return as long as I let the area air out after each use.  </li>
            <li>The design is nice and thin and will be so much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I think I have ever had - which I am sure is due to the fact that it has the timer function as much as the sonic technology.  </li>
            <li>I am a convert to electric toothbrushes, mainly because proper-size manual toothbrushes are no longer available ( a proper toothbrush has much longer brush length.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with the other brush head that was provided but the product was still very loud and the vibration was still a lot more intense than when I first received the product.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B and its timer helped, but it was so hard to tell how long you were supposed to spend in each area, that I probably still sped through (though more effectively than the manual brushing).  </li>
            <li>Really gets my teeth clean and the &amp;#34;Quad pacer&amp;#34; feature forces me to brush for the entire dentist-recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li>But in the real world, people don&#x27;t have time or often, the manual dexterity, to dissassemble a toothbrush and clean it with Q-tips (!)</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t collect as much gunk as older sonicare or oral b toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I can get pay back to my molars and clean them really well.</li>
            <li>One time I left the charger unplugged for well over a week and the toothbrush kept doing its job, so the internal battery must be very strong.</li>
            <li>So, now I&#x27;ve upgraded again, to this toothbrush similar to my original Elite.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush isn&#x27;t bulky like many other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>When it happened the third time, they would not honor it because the warranty was two years from the original purchase.  </li>
            <li>This is my 4th Sonicare toothbrush, having tried most every model since introduction due to dadDDS.</li>
            <li>I bought this after the original model I had for years finally stopped holding any sort of a charge (6+ years).</li>
            <li>I love that that I can just put the DiamondClean brushes on this one without having to spend $200+ on the other.</li>
            <li>Definitely a bit of an investment, but considering what dental work costs, well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>If you compare the two, it becomes immediately obvious that Phillips is attempting to capitalize on the reputation of their original Sonicare, while lowering the quality and increasing their profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their description points out that the brush \\&quot;cleans with up to 31,000 movements per minute\\&quot;, the same as the original Elite model.  </li>
            <li>The higher end models are the same hardware, but with a different outer skin and more software programming.</li>
            <li>The little beep is fantastic at encouraging you to brush each quadrant the full 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and after so many years of manually brushing it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>This is not exactly a controlled study, but I feel this works better.</li>
            <li>believe the Sonicare toothbrushes have significantly helped my teeth and especially my gums over the years.</li>
            <li>Has the exact same brushing vibration stuff as the top of the line model, uses the same heads.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of other people&#x27;s (better) reviews.</li>
            <li>This model is better than the other model I used for years.</li>
            <li>My husband prefers the Sonic brush over other toothbrushes because he feels it cleans better.  </li>
            <li>At first seemed to do a good job, but after a few weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean and white as my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you is that each up &amp; down movement (sweep) of the brush is much shorter and as a result, nowhere near as effective.</li>
            <li>Using the original ProResults and black DiamondClean heads together (looks really sweet with those by the way).</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my other Sonicare unit which had to be cleaned out several times a week and still wasn&#x27;t all that clean.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both did blind comparisons with brand new brush heads, and the years old healthy white toothbrush is definitely noticeably more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay the extra $20 for the more powerful \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>I got the diamond head replaceable heads now and its like a dentist clean daily.  </li>
            <li>You actually feel the clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth remained clean for a noticeably longer time as compared to regular brushing.</li>
            <li>Stays clean, big advantage.</li>
            <li>The high-frequency work performed by the brush will keep your teeth and gums clean, especially just below the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Like that this is easier to keep clean than the last ones.</li>
            <li>The Easy Clean comes with the handle, one ProResults brush head, a charger and a small plastic travel cap that goes over the brush head.</li>
            <li>makes your teeth so clean, as if you had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve brought it with me on week long trips with no charge and it lasted just fine.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are really clean &amp; like smaller handle.</li>
            <li>It never stayed clean, and just got really gross after awhile.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feels not only clean but massaged.</li>
            <li>The last time I went to the dentist he complimented me on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li>With a regular brush, my teeth do not feel nearly as clean</li>
            <li>My dental hygenist recommended it - and I cannot believe the difference in how clean my teeth feel in comparison to a regular toothbrush - also recommended for my gums as well as my teeth.</li>
            <li>It can take some getting used to, but to get your teeth as clean as possible, gotta get one.</li>
            <li>I have had a Sonicare for years, and when my last one died, I looked for an easier to clean model.  </li>
            <li>The charging time is much faster than the older models.</li>
            <li>Would clean it and it&#x27;d be back in no time.</li>
            <li>just left the dentis office clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to open it up to clean inside.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not complaining, my teeth feel clean afterwards and it has a 30 second timer</li>
            <li>I feel I would either have to use it for 6 minutes or actually scrub in order to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist when after measuring the pockets in my teeth found that I had several 4&#x27;s; not good as I was told that numbers 1-3 are ideal.  </li>
            <li>No other issues, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean but the metal shaft on the handle came loose only after 5 months of use.</li>
            <li>The Philips rotates so fast that it makes a high pitched hum.  </li>
            <li>I used to not notice the &amp;#34;fuzzy teeth&amp;#34; feeling I would get, but this brush makes my teeth so smooth and clean after every use that I notice when they are not clean!</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for better oral care than conventional toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to using it actually, which is an odd thing to say about a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m a very new user.</li>
            <li>Amazing how small these have become.</li>
            <li>; model still has a lithium battery that gives a light feel and lasts a long time on</li>
            <li>We both wish we would have bought these long ago instead of the cheap ones from the drug store.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I ever brushed for 2 full minutes with a reg brush.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see the need for the Healthy  White since I really didn&#x27;t use the various functions.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised on my first use.</li>
            <li>so I went back to sharing my Wife&#x27;s full size Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>That is only true of the brush head that model comes with.</li>
            <li>(Usually I need to spend an hour to get a replacement for warranty, because they always have some kind of excuse)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love this brush better than the other one I have that is same brand different</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can not do better although the more expensive Sonicare&#x27;s do come with additional features</li>
            <li>These were a replacement for my old electronic toothbrush and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>so you know to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth, for a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In contrast, the Oral B brush glides easily over and around each individual tooth with no mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to clean, and easy to store on the base.  </li>
            <li>With my old toothbrush I used just to clean all over for two minutes in general.  </li>
            <li>The standard bristles are perfectly fine for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>This breaks your mouth down into 4 quad sections for better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning under the head is very easy, as I imagine it would be under the larger heads, but there is simply very little there to clean.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes, this is your machine!</li>
            <li>It has the quadrabeep feature to tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your teeth but lacks some of the more advanced settings found on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Make sure you remove the brush and clean under the area under the bottom of the brush regularly because it can get a little yucky under the plastic that attaches to the motor.</li>
            <li>There is no better and easier way to keep your mouth clean and teeth healthy - no other electric toothbrush comes close to Sonicare technology.</li>
            <li>Does the less powerful motor make a significant difference in how well it performs?</li>
            <li>Bad move, the Intercare costs more, but I like the original head better.</li>
            <li>They replaced it with a whole new handle again.  </li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t send a whole new unit because they don&#x27;t have one in their parts department</li>
            <li>Gives a whole new meaning to the term, brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was not happy I had to buy a new model, but I am happy with the new model.  </li>
            <li>This new model has a smaller diameter connection head and stays clean.  </li>
            <li>My mouth also feels much cleaner with this new one than with older models of Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I had the top of the line model which broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is so much better than the previous model (without the EasyClean heads).</li>
            <li>After Google searching the pros and cons of Oral B vs. Sonicare, I decided more or less on the spur of the moment to try out the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Love this thing durng semi-annual cleanings; much less picking and scraping by the hygenist.</li>
            <li>and she admits it does a better job than her previous brand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it could be better except if the replacement brushes were less costly.</li>
            <li>Cleans better than my previous Braun electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well as the top of the line, just less bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li>The solution for me was to put it in a ziploc since its length prevents me from using it with an older case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every day, twice or more often per day,  we would each switch to our personal brush head and when finished brushing, place it back in the stand.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I see to this brush is that the handle is a bit slippery compared to the matte finish of the Healthy White.  </li>
            <li>I used to have an older model Sonicare that lasted me almost six years.</li>
            <li>I had an older Sonicare that was a gift about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush - no unneeded bells and whistles like the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>and there are a few good key differences.</li>
            <li>As per the manual, I like to brush thirty seconds in the front of my top teeth, thirty in the back, thirty in the front of my bottom teeth, and thirty in the back.</li>
            <li>If prior experience with this brand is any indication, don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend getting this type of sonicare over the older e-series versions.</li>
            <li>so glad I got this instead of the more expensive version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lower end models use the older style brush heads.</li>
            <li>got this as replacement for the worn out  older model.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Sonicare for years before it&#x27;s stopped charging, so I got this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>Replaced an older unit with this one.  </li>
            <li>Only thing it asks for is a quick charge every once in a while</li>
            <li>They do a decent job cleaning teeth and preventing decay and gum disease, but we&#x27;ve gone through 5 handles in about 6 years.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my older one that stopped working.</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Below is a list of the improvements over the older model and why you should switch.&lt;br /&gt;1)  </li>
            <li>I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush that lasted for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is quality.  </li>
            <li>It slender for a smaller hand, which my middle daughter had another one, but this one met her needs BETTER.  </li>
            <li>I applied for a rebate after I bought this particular product in April.</li>
            <li>Unlike battery operated toothbrushes that sounds like a mini jet roaring, this brush has a low soft hum like sound.</li>
            <li>Seems weaker than the older versions Essence 5600..</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for one of our Healthy White 710&#x27;s that finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>I did order a replacement, which was a bit more expensive, but works much better</li>
            <li>I went with this model over the lower end one mainly because of the timer feature, which helps my brushing habits.</li>
            <li>It performs much better than the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>Better than more expensive model of sonicare......</li>
            <li>Main thing---</li>
            <li>This actually makes me want to brush my teeth more often than the regular two times each day.</li>
            <li>I had the fancier version before but found that I never used all the different settings, so this toothbrush is quite adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>My check-ups have improved and it helps with plaque and gums as one gets older.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on the top of the line that had all the different speeds, so I settled for this one.  </li>
            <li>It is very simple to use, although if you read the manual (which I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a quick read)</li>
            <li>, this feature must be disabled after about two weeks of use--it&#x27;s a gentler brushing mode (which is probably why I noticed the very first time that I used it that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel all that clean).</li>
            <li>Lasts longer, but then again I had my original for a long time and it might have gotten shorter and shorter</li>
            <li>One oddity: I&#x27;ve noticed more sensitivity in my teeth after just two brushing (not sure if this has anything to do with holiday eating/drinking or the new toothbrush as that brush moves very fast).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am 60 and my dentist highly recommended a Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>everything was improved at a time I was eating lots of popcorn and sodas (high school).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It vibrates, pulsates and moves at high frequency as the videos you can see online show, Philips calls it Sonic.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to others.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They both highly regard the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend getting one of these.  </li>
            <li>I particularly love this Sonicare because it is simple to clean; just rinse it off, dry it and put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone and in fact have already told all my family members and friends that they should get one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but worth it for the clean feeling it gives you.</li>
            <li>Finally, this is more powerful than my previous models.</li>
            <li>Much better engineering resulting in a much more sanitary and less messy brushing experience.  </li>
            <li>Far better than any other low-speed electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>it is noticeably less powerful than the healthy white model.  </li>
            <li>They do not clean any better..</li>
            <li>NO, I need you to send me a whole new, brand new in the box retail unit.</li>
            <li>I hardly use bristle brushes when I&#x27;m without my Sonicare, preferring to spend 20 minutes with a few peppermint flavored birch toothpicks; the kind that eventually fray flat for good surface scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>But Sonicare heads fall off HX6511/50 model after 6 months use of product-try &#x27;shimming&#x27; motor shaft with plastic film-heads stay on a little longer but why go through this bother-just buy a better brand.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has allot of models which seems overwhelming until you do a little research.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if the unit had a little grip to it.</li>
            <li>Just the charger (a little more weight would be helpful for stability while charging), the vibrating unit, and a toothbrush--bare bones, but all we need.  </li>
            <li>(fits in my hand a little better).  </li>
            <li>Seriously: my dental hygienist said I could come back IN A YEAR because my teeth were so great.</li>
            <li>This has a similar action and is easier to keep clean .</li>
            <li>My other Sonicare was the Advanced with the screw on top head, it would get gunky on the inside and bog down because of that.</li>
            <li>Cleans extremely well, easy to hold, can tell plaque is being removed.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the toothbrush is still going strong</li>
            <li>I was a little perplexed by the number of different versions available.</li>
            <li>This will surely cut down on my dental costs!</li>
            <li>Owned many other electric toothbrushes with limited success.  </li>
            <li>It seems as though the manufacturer intended for each user to have his or her own handle - and the price of a single one is considerably higher than the approximately $30 I paid for the original that served us both.</li>
            <li>I got it for him since he has sensitive teeth and an unusual fear of the dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been drinking far too much coffee</li>
            <li>Unlike our old one that quit working eventually, this one pauses if too much pressure is on the brush while it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li>The real reason I wanted to upgrade was the design of the old brush.  </li>
            <li>Really works well near the gums to remove plaque.</li>
            <li>If you want a Sonicare toothbrush, this is a great one that isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the soft heads for it and have been very</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommends Philips products and didn&#x27;t think all the extra bells and whistles were worth the additional expense.</li>
            <li>I charged it for about 12 hours just in case, then I proceeded to brush my teeth as I normally would.</li>
            <li>But after a few tries it felt much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this after having used a regular toothbrush my whole life it felt like I had just come out of the dentists office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get a few more of these for birthday gifts to my kids</li>
            <li>I have had Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and before I got the fancy one they all lasted a few years.</li>
            <li>Our first one lasted at least 5 or more years.</li>
            <li>She is enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li>When it worked I liked I would give it four stars, but for how expensive this is I expect the battery to last more than two years.</li>
            <li>worth mentioning, I stay in Singapore, Philips only offer shipping to US or Canada.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a timer to make sure you brush your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li>Though the handle is more expensive, the Pro Results replacement brush heads for the Easy Clean are cheaper than the e series heads, saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this one will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Given that my first one did not last much beyond the warantee, I recommend doing so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the fancier models again.</li>
            <li>I like the speed  and cleaning of the Sonicare better than the Oral B, however, the handle gives me trouble.  </li>
            <li>I am using the normal head, though my set came with a diamond head as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a top of the line model I had for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand.</li>
            <li>If you want to have teeth that look, feel and are clean, get this line of Sonicare toothbrush (there are other Sonicare toothbrushes of the same design with more bells and whistles such as the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush).</li>
            <li>you are new to electric toothbrushes I highly recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly doubt there&#x27;s anything new I could add</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and bought a cheaper (non-Sonicare) model and while that brush did seem to reduce the amount of tartar/plaque that built up between cleanings, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as this one.  </li>
            <li>The new unit is much smaller and lighter overall than the old unit making it more convenient to maneuver around your teeth.</li>
            <li>This model is much easier to keep clean (the other one could grow mold on the inside) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to clean than other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers said, this is much easier to clean and maintain without having buildup on the item.  </li>
            <li>After the first few brushes, your teeth feel funny from the strong vibrations that you dont get from a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>The other two were impossible to keep clean, so I gave it one more try with the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li>The switch seems to be more sensitive than the switch on previous Sonicare models I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I often developed tartar rather quickly on the inside of my lower front teeth despite mouth washes and regular brushing.</li>
            <li>I have occasional dry mouth which cause more plague buildup</li>
            <li>This toothbrush takes some getting used to--the action of the sonic bristles tickles the gums but they do a far better job cleaning teeth than other brushes (battery powered or muscle powered) I have used.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same kind of cleaning as I would with a different product.</li>
            <li>It comes with several pre-programmed settings right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Although I like the design of the Easy Clean, the battery power is incredibly weak vs. the Essence.</li>
            <li>I especially like the 30 second timer (for each quadrant) that really helps get my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean very well, but last only 7months of use (2 times/</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Sonicare user for a long time.</li>
            <li>My outside teeth was clean but the top of my teeth was yellow-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this, half of the yellow has come out and my teeth are whiter than before using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, convenient, and its small enough for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>The very small brush head and powerful strokes effortlessly removed every last bit of food and it was very comfortable even as I worked the very corner of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That still worked fine except the battery would only last 2 or 3 brushing</li>
            <li>They clean in exactly the same way as the basic model (same brush, motor, charger), but have options that are largely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No added &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; like other Sonicare brushes but rather, a huge step up from our Oral-B battery operated electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Before spending money on a new model, I called the Sonicare number, which was picked up by Sahim, whom I could not hear.</li>
            <li>Packaging is minimalist, akin to receiving the new Apple products.</li>
            <li>When I needed a new electric toothbrush, I asked my dentist which one I should buy.</li>
            <li>This new model builds with intensity over time, making it easier to get used the vibration.</li>
            <li>You can use the new diamond brush head on this model.</li>
            <li>and then there&#x27;s new style.  </li>
            <li>but this toothbrush has taken it to a new level.  </li>
            <li>So hoping this one will live a looong time.</li>
            <li>I like the slimmer profile and new attachment</li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 5 years and had about 16 new brushes.</li>
            <li>Live the interval timer.</li>
            <li>They do send you a new handle,  </li>
            <li>Six new handles</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim for something new to try out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my new one for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>the new one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I live in Lihue, HI, and couldn&#x27;t find it on the island nor could I get it mailed to Hawaii through Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>is still THE toothbrush to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Retails at approx $80, it uses the new brush socket unlike the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>which though cheaper at $50 cannot use the new brush heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>New head doesn&#x27;t get all gunked up.  </li>
            <li>It was time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>DID A LOT OF RESEARCH TO FIND A NEW MODEL THAT COULD USE THE STOCKPILE OF BRUSH HEADS</li>
            <li>I imagine the markup on the heads is a couple thousand percent as all the tech is in the body and Sonicare tech isn&#x27;t exactly new</li>
            <li>I like the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li>After using mine for a year and going to a new dentist, they could tell I use an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well done Sonicare on this new model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new one also has a lot of brush head choices</li>
            <li>You would think that with a price of almost $84.00, you would get a brand new product.  </li>
            <li>I am still waiting for a shipping label and a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I need to order a new one.</li>
            <li>So, expect to buy a new one every 2 years.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100+ for a new brush either.</li>
            <li>This item broke within a year, while trying to put in a new brush.  </li>
            <li>and she loves this new model.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I like the feel of the new handle</li>
            <li>Had to call  Philips and they sent me a new toothbrush .</li>
            <li>so I keep purchasing new ones.</li>
            <li>My first one had many speeds, but I found I left it on one setting its entire life, so when I went to buy a new one, I bought a single speed model.  </li>
            <li>and he directly asked me an address to replace it with a new one!</li>
            <li>Had the old e-series for many years and the batteries finally wouldnt hold a charge for very long so we replaced them with the new Pro Results brushes with Li-Ion batteries.</li>
            <li>A standard size and a compact size brush head fit the handle; my husband used the standard, and</li>
            <li>Never had such smooth teeth, let alone the back ones.</li>
            <li>You probably don&#x27;t need all the advanced features of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>After some tinkering I was able to open the casing and found that it was soaking wet with water the battery as well as</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend more money on a fancier model with all of the different modes that you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth and this particular model aggravates the condition.  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare toothbrush gave up the ghost after 12 years of steady use without any problems.</li>
            <li>Also, my hygienist remarked how healthy and pink my gums were at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in and let it charge until the green ready light stopped blinking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only do these toothbrushes work great, but Phillips stands behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as loud as my older model either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s curious to see how his next cleaning will be.</li>
            <li>Most of the models I have used have performed to a high enough standard to leave me not wishing to use a regular manual toothbrush anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Philips&#x27;</li>
            <li>Fits the hand comfortably and just the right size to get to all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>This is just fine without all the other stuff!</li>
            <li>Present for my daughter, she loves it and helps her dental health very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since stroke speed is very fast, there apparently is an initial 14 day break in period, whereby the brush moves slower to start, but increases in speed over each of those uses.</li>
            <li>I will miss stripping the high power magnets from the old head.</li>
            <li>So I bought this new model, and the difference is obvious from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was hard to clean and got gross very quickly.</li>
            <li>This particular sonicare is smart enough to tell me when to switch areas of brushing in my mouth -</li>
            <li>It really tickled at first, but this model has a ramp up feature that starts out less intense and builds up to normal intensity over 14 uses.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend both Sonicare generally, and this particular model brush specifically.</li>
            <li>I got this cheaper one, with one button that does exactly the same thing exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>The first two lasted around seven years before starting to lose their brushing vigor.</li>
            <li>so i said, fine, refund half the purchase price and i&#x27;ll buy something else.  </li>
            <li>Apparently Philips wants you to go out and buy another Sonicare every two years instead of designing their products</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints!</li>
            <li>Our second one lasted exactly one year.</li>
            <li>I charged it the first day I got it (around Oct 17th), and I am still to this day (Dec 4th) still brushing on that initial charge!  </li>
            <li>The first one was replaced, but the second one they wouldn&#x27;t replace.</li>
            <li>At nearly $13 / head (MSRP), Phillips could afford to give away the toothbrushes and still make a profit!  </li>
            <li>this one is much better than the e-series we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>The old one allowed water in, which meant mold (ew!)..</li>
            <li>This is my second PS toothbrush, and I had no problems with my first one.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has made them look like I&#x27;ve had professional whitening treatments from the dentist !  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, concise, and gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>This model gradually increases the intensity over the first several uses and lets you get usesd to the vibration.</li>
            <li>My old one lasted almost 15 years before it dies!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a small price to pay for better performance.  </li>
            <li>First time owning a sonicare toothbrush - I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush for the last 23 years of my life.</li>
            <li>However while it worked at first the thing didn&#x27;t last 5 months.</li>
            <li>Recently, my dentist showed me that Philips had redesigned the brush so that the brushhead fits onto a spike (exactly like the cheaper brush I had been using).</li>
            <li>One thing that I was not aware of when I first used this model was that it has an \\&quot;Easy-start\\&quot; feature which increases power over the first 14</li>
            <li>They no longer offered the brush head I had (soft &amp; smaller), and it didn&#x27;t make the same sound.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be the same as the Healthy White model but without the extra functions.</li>
            <li>If this one disappeared tomorrow, I would but the same exact one to replace it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s dual voltage 110/240 so that I can use it while I travel and that the charging stand is extremely small and portable.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want one of the super-high-tech-rocket-scientist models; I just wanted a fairly simple model with the quadpacer feature, and this was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, the first one lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li>So he asked for the exact same one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for several years.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare toothbrushes set the standard that other knock-offs do not seem to be able to meet.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, but then I realized that no matter how often it was charged (or how often I allowed it to deplete a charge), it will still stop vibrating while brushing teeth multiple times.</li>
            <li>I have another model that has a sensitive setting and a massage setting; however, I always just use the normal setting.  </li>
            <li>This is an improvement over my other, more basic Sonicare model.  </li>
            <li>when an oral surgeon first suggested it, however after using it, my teeth feel the same way they do after the dental hygienist cleans them.</li>
            <li>My first unit was the fatter handled style Essence and lasted almost six years, which, I believe, is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to send the first one back because it was not working correctly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re replacing an old one, this is also your machine!</li>
            <li>My first electric toothbrush &amp; I will never go back unless I&#x27;m in the woods!</li>
            <li>The first model I bought was the more expensive Healthy White model, but its extra features are superfluous.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over ten years.  </li>
            <li>a reminder that there is a small gap between the bottom of the toothbrush and the top of the toothbrush body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks on its first charge.</li>
            <li>But the functionality where it slowly reaches full speed over the first 14 brushes really helps.  </li>
            <li>I put my brush head on my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Flexcare base and it was MUCH more powerful and cleaned my teeth more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the very momentary pause/beep to indicate time to start on next &amp;#34;zone&amp;#34; of teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean model is better but the only real advantage is the heads wich work just as well on this model at less than half the price.</li>
            <li>Philips Sonicare HX6063/64 Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads]] which comes with the most expensive Sonicare toothbrush, the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean]]</li>
            <li>At my recent dental hygiene appointment, the hygienist said that my teeth were really clean and she noticed the difference from my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean that the &amp;#34;White+Clean&amp;#34; mode is more powerful than the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In general the product provide much better cleaning and whiting effect on my teeth although it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare, 2 minutes (via the built-in timer) gives really clean feeling teeth in a way that I can not at this time imagine purchasing any other brand of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I assumed this was due to some technology in or the size of the brush making it clean the tops/bottoms of your teeth as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because, if it fails, Philips will replace it and it produces good teeth cleaning</li>
            <li>the case of the new HX series brushes, it&#x27;s clear that form (and profit) won over function.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offered a complete exchange of the defective unit for a new unit.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking the new model.</li>
            <li>I changed to the new model brush because I was now recharging the old sonic toothbrush battery every 4 to 5 days.</li>
            <li>The new brush design clearly fixed this issue.</li>
            <li>Since I have really sensitive gums, this has helped me to adapt to the new brush.  </li>
            <li>I HAD FOR A PREVIOUS MODEL AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD FIT ---</li>
            <li>I previously had just a cheap oral B electric toothbrush I picked up in a supermarket.</li>
            <li>It has a sleaker and less bulky design and leaves my teach feeling smooth and well cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get used to it, I&#x27;m sure, but I liked the thicker base of the older model for this reason.</li>
            <li>So far I have only charged it when I first got it</li>
            <li>The Quadpacer is nice, just a small pause in the vibration every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it took me some getting used to since I am a fan of bigger brushes, and the brush head is small so it can reach all areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li>Nice handle small enough for kids to hold.</li>
            <li>The small size makes it easy to hold and maneuver (as compared to the older models).</li>
            <li>Had it for a few years, still going strong.</li>
            <li>but they were never very good (more noise than cleaning)</li>
            <li>The design allows me to reach anywhere in my mouth, and after a little getting used to it, I am fine with the &#x27;quadrant&#x27; system it uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price for something I use every single day.</li>
            <li>I am one who never feels like I get my teeth good enough, but the small-ish head gets back behind my back teeth better than my larger tooth brush did.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made SUCH a positive change.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positive about these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My first one was a bulkier Essence model and the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t retain much of a charge after several years.  </li>
            <li>Researched other models, this one fell in the mid-range sweet spot for price and features.  </li>
            <li>The built in timer is kind of dumb..</li>
            <li>I finally caved in to my dentists gentle suggestion that I get a new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a better design than the previous version.  </li>
            <li>Shiny teeth, healthy gums, spend less money ( after initial investment)</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Philips Sonicare products over the years and am as satisfied with this toothbrush as the previous ones.</li>
            <li>first, the body doesn&#x27;t seem to have very durable dampeners within so the item begins to vibrate intensively; second, after tacking the brush off the body several times to clean it, the fit of the brush on the metal pin loses its tightness, so the head begins to magnify the vibration - major tooth chipping potential.  </li>
            <li>I certainly will the next time I need one.</li>
            <li>To a large extent, the work is being done by the brush heads, therefore one can get different results depending on which you use.  </li>
            <li>This little gem is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is small, sleek, does not catch runoff from rinsing like the old one - it stays clean, cleans well, and is quite and gentle.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is modified, allowing better access to hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel very clean and I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re slightly less yellow after using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>While strange at first, you learn to open your jaws a little more and it minimizes the occurrences.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has some new design features that are quantum leaps above the older styles.  </li>
            <li>The older ones lasted quite some time and this new one will hopefully do the same.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t collect all that toothpaste gunk that previous models did; it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>Clearly an upgrade from the $15-20 OralB electric toothbrush it is replacing.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare closes their box with a clear tamper proof sticker.  </li>
            <li>The comparison tables don&#x27;t make this clear.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at how gentle it actually was.</li>
            <li>The hygienist said she had never worked less to clean someone&#x27;s teeth/gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit comes with the handle, proresult head with clear cap, and charger</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to and the directions weren&#x27;t really clear on the washer and brush assembly to the power head.  </li>
            <li>Stupidly, I spent more money for brush heads that were the same as this one, just a different color.  </li>
            <li>For several years I was using a $5 Crest Spinbrush, which was an improvement over a manual toothbrush, but not by that much.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a Oral B Sonic Complete brush that would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product, and so far it exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>I keep it plugged into charger in a cabinet near my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>It is easier to cover all of the tooth surfaces, especially far back in the mouth.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;travel case and cap\\&quot; that it comes with is just a cheap plastic cover for the actual brush part, so don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting an actual case for the entire brush.</li>
            <li>Wow I received this brush in the mail about 5 days ago</li>
            <li>I travel frequently</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>goo collecting under the cap like the old model.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my bf and he likes it so far.</li>
            <li>and it looks like it is working well so far.</li>
            <li>Two years ago when i bought the flexcare model it came with a soft brush.</li>
            <li>Now if i want a soft brush, or sensitive as sonicare calls it, i need to purchase them separately.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes are preferred and recommended.</li>
            <li>really well, battery stays charged for a month with daily (2x/day) use!</li>
            <li>But with a soft head (needs to be ordered separately)</li>
            <li>Thus far, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Every time I brush my teeth, they feel like they have been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>The charger works with european or US electrical currents which is very convenient for traveling and living overseas.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare broke after 6 years.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s the old style brush heads</li>
            <li>My old sonicare lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li>by far, I&#x27;ve used it for a month.</li>
            <li>Every brush leaves me feeling as if I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does the job without all the extras which I never used in my old toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that all the Soniccare models except one are sealed batteries.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare EasyClean and similar Sonicare models (the ones with the slim handles) are now better than Oral-B for international travel (including 220V European and Asian countries) for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li>When you brush your teeth it feels like you had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>However the heads for this do seem to wear away frequently.</li>
            <li>I used to have the old Sonicare</li>
            <li>I guess my mouth is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I had an old style Sonicare and also and Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive gums</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Sonicare with this one.  </li>
            <li>The old one had a stronger vibration</li>
            <li>so far, the brush is living up to</li>
            <li>I am an adult over 50 that just had her braces removed after 18 months.</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt cleaner, the battery last for days on end and it has made brushing my teeth a much easier process.</li>
            <li>replaced a 10+ year old Braun that was still working well.</li>
            <li>if you want to be sure you are getting the newer model that doesn&#x27;t accumulate gunk inside it, uses the newest brush heads, and has the feature that lets you know when you&#x27;ve completed each 30 second cycle - without all the extra stuff that I never use and that makes it a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I have had six of them so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electronic toothbrushes for nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li>I use it at bedtime but still can&#x27;t get away from my old type brush which I also use after lunch each day.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many months without complaint.  </li>
            <li>The battery seems to hold a charge longer than my old electric brush.  </li>
            <li>This was an upgrade for my old Phillips.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any really breath problems like with traditional brushes</li>
            <li>I chipped my front tooth when I was young and have a cap over it (baseline for tooth color).  </li>
            <li>The old one lasted about five years.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it cleans and feels as well as the old one.</li>
            <li>the old style heads and those of the Braun catch all kinds of crud and gunk</li>
            <li>and you get a soft beep/stop reminder to switch quadrants.  </li>
            <li>Sleeker, thinner, and doesn&#x27;t collect spit like the old ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 years old</li>
            <li>that really surprised me a lot.</li>
            <li>It was the Flexcare model, which has four cleaning modes (sensitive, massage, \\&quot;on-the-go\\&quot; and cleaning).</li>
            <li>Love the 2 minute timer unless I am running late for work.  </li>
            <li>I owned the old sonicare model and it stopped working after about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It fixed everything that I disliked about my old Sonicare, which was primarily the gunk build up under the brush head unit.</li>
            <li>Charger is very compact and simple.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is the frequent interruptions.  </li>
            <li>I had 2 of the old types that the brush head screwed onto.  </li>
            <li>After 2 years of use, the on/off button is completely gone and we can no longer turn the toothbrush on/off</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Cannot be fixed.</li>
            <li>I never used any of the fancy functions on my old brush.</li>
            <li>I was always cleaning moldy gunk out of my old one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to switch out the brush heads on this if you&#x27;re sharing the handle, and the charger is smaller than the E series charger also.</li>
            <li>frequently (or ever).</li>
            <li>If you keep the brush head on, over time old toothpaste begins to build up</li>
            <li>and I noticed on my old HX6950 that mold had started to grow on the rubber that is attached to the metal tip.  </li>
            <li>Since I can&#x27;t find the soft bristle brush anymore, I will have to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade because my boyfriend wanted my old one.</li>
            <li>Wow, is all I can say.  </li>
            <li>That was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added sensitive paste to my regimen.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my 2-years old Flexcare with ultrasonic cleaning module.  </li>
            <li>It is so much sleeker than the last electric tooothbrush I owned and takes up virtually no space on my sink counter.  </li>
            <li>I balked at the nearly $90 price tag...but decided to get it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush gets my teeth way cleaner than my old Oral B manual.</li>
            <li>Overall, it performed very well.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit to get used to after using an Oral-B brush as the pulsating brush is much faster and smaller than what we were used to.  </li>
            <li>far it is favorable because: It is slimmer and lighter than my old unit.</li>
            <li>The medium bristle that I got with this is an order of magnitude softer than the sensitive Oral B that I have</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than my last few Sonicare models &amp; it still has the quadpacer, I still feel it keeps my teeth in top condition &amp; white.</li>
            <li>recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces especially because of how much it&#x27;s helped me.</li>
            <li>Had an old electronic toothbrush that stopped working on me after 4+ years of use.  </li>
            <li>but they also provide lots of space for crud to build up that requires regular cleaning or it gets really nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see my teeth got whiter after a month without changing anything besides the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The old ones were pain because you had to screw them off</li>
            <li>I chose this unit because it was the least cost that still included the 30 second interval timer (beep tone), a feature that I liked with the old brush.</li>
            <li>After getting this replacement, I realize that the old one had lost its punch way before it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Sonicare was still working (after more than ten years!), but it was an older model that collected water (and thus mildew), even though I was careful to dry it off after each use.  </li>
            <li>i have been using for nearly a year</li>
            <li>The brush on my old one rotates, this one vibrates.</li>
            <li>My old one gave out after years of use.</li>
            <li>We have had the old style</li>
            <li>Purchased it when my old Sonicare croaked.</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased this model was that the last one I had would get nasty/funky where the brushhead attached and it really creeped me out.</li>
            <li>It really makes difference in terms of the overall state of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>and I had to have soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I bought a pack of soft brush heads</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested replacing my old OralB with this for its ability to scour away deposits.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a 10 year old model&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I had given up on our old brushes (the dome-style design) as they required frequent cleaning that was meant disassembling them or replacing them at substantial cost.  </li>
            <li>It does build up debris between the head and the part of the brush you hold in your hand, so that needs to be cleaned frequently or it will buzz loudly.</li>
            <li>Have used it about a month so far.  </li>
            <li>This model only has one setting, but that is really all you need.  </li>
            <li>I have had a problem with Gingivitis almost all my adult life.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself to replace the old one I lost while on vacation, then also one for my husband, my son, and my daughter in law.</li>
            <li>So far, this works well.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li>The sonicare brush has been working well so far.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have that rubberized handle piece like our old model.  </li>
            <li>The old model would start to peel off.  </li>
            <li>and wow, have I noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums &amp; teeth</li>
            <li>is much much quieter and still does the same job.</li>
            <li>Wow how technology has changed.</li>
            <li>My son requested this for Christmas to replace his old worn out Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>The people who complain about the soft brushing and immediately switch probably don&#x27;t know about this feature.</li>
            <li>I returned it and spent $10 extra for Healthy White.</li>
            <li>With such a simple design, you would think someone could make a cheap, generic brush replacement????</li>
            <li>I would definitely not recommend going for the higher-end models unless you&#x27;re convinced the added features will be of real value to you over time.  </li>
            <li>I had the old Phillips Sonicare brush (that I&#x27;ve used for almost 10 years).  </li>
            <li>It does have the extra feature of the Quadpacer that I really like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to my old Sonicare, this is a sIight improvement.</li>
            <li>It was more expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, Sonicare models that are more expensive than this one do not offer features that make them worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying this because I was doing a good job with my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and good heavens, tooth brush heads are expensive as hell.</li>
            <li>Yes, I realize it is very unscientific of me to blame it on the Oral B, but you can&#x27;t deny the fact the other brushes (even the manual ones) were doing something a little better than the Oral B was doing.    </li>
            <li>This version came with no such stand, and while the system makes cleaning easy, it clearly is not designed in contemplation of several-times daily switching of heads</li>
            <li>Smaller brush head fits easily in gaps where teeth are missing and gets deeper between normal teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vibration takes some getting used to, lips and gums feel a little weird the first few brushings,but later feels great - more alive.  </li>
            <li>I love the little pause it gives me to let me know that I have spent 30 seconds on a particular area and</li>
            <li>They sell a new model that has an almost identical brush head that is slightly modified so they don&#x27;t fit old sonicare models (Hooray for you big business!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the last year,  the flexcare was producing a loud sound, probably due to the interface between the brush and the handle.  </li>
            <li>My only beef was the cost compared to the other entry-level model - but that ~$30 premium is worth it for the much improved head design.</li>
            <li>The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>problem: the case is sealed, so apparently when it stops, there is no alternative to buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>Teeth were very clean and did not require hardly any scraping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this model - more expensive models just have different timing options which I guarantee you&#x27;ll never (or rarely) use.</li>
            <li>Small charger makes charging easy.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonic Care brushes before and this is considerably small and yet easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I love that toothbrush, finally back to Sonicare after a few years of OralB. The round head doesn&#x27;t work for me, Sonicare&#x27;s long bent brush head is so much better.</li>
            <li>Our kids like the professionally clean feeling they now get with little effort.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush works same as older model as far as brushing goes.  </li>
            <li>It feels solid and no extraneous sound; hopefully this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The heads that come with this are small enough to get in between teeth and vibrate enough on their own to make brushing effortless.</li>
            <li>Why make such a big deal about the travel charger (nice and small) and then not provide a travel case?  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s why some reviews say it&#x27;s not as powerful as their other brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush and replacement brush heads are a bit expensive, but they&#x27;re certainly cheaper than fillings, or more significant dental issues down the road.</li>
            <li>This is my third one, as I obviously can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare!  </li>
            <li>I Can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush and will divorce my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous toothbrush for a busy busy individual .</li>
            <li>The new series brushes aren&#x27;t much more complex than a standard manual toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads are more expensive than a new toothbrush but teeth are much cleaner using this.</li>
            <li>it is just a subtle beep every thirty seconds so that you can make sure you evenly brush all quadrants of your mouth, instead of jumping around.  </li>
            <li>I always had to be careful starting that brush up because it would easily slip into some different setting and I would have no idea when to change sectors in my mouth, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have had it a few months now, and it gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>We bought this to replace an older model who&#x27;s battery finally died after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Essence mainly because of its larger brush head.</li>
            <li>This one takes the same brush heads but has only one setting and its exactly like the one I was used to using.  </li>
            <li>After owning an older model sonicare for a number of years I could not handle the gross stuff that grew inside the toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li>And the brushhead attachment stays cleaner since there is no big cone to buildup crud as in the older model.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the timing mechanism that beeps when it is time to move to a different section of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The key reason we chose this particular model was because the Amazon, on-line information indicated that a travel case and travel charger were included in the package.</li>
            <li>I upgraded from an older model which accumulated gunk but the handle last over three</li>
            <li>This was replacing an older model that finally gave up.  </li>
            <li>It did make my gums ache slightly as they got used to being super sonic cleaned</li>
            <li>I particularly like the built-in timer, which causes the brush to pause briefly every thirty seconds and to shut off after two minutes.</li>
            <li>I am going back to the older Sonicare</li>
            <li>Edit: Since I wrote this lazy \\&quot;review\\&quot; I got the Flexcare &amp; Healthy White Plastic Travel Handle Case.</li>
            <li>I had an older model that finally died after 5 years.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I really have about it now is that it doesn&#x27;t display how much charge it has, it only flashes a light when battery is getting low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the 3-pack of sensitive heads at the same time and she&#x27;s used those in place of the normal head.</li>
            <li>Each of us has an older model with a big screw-on brush head assembly.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush replaced an older Sonicare that finally died after years of use.</li>
            <li>I always thought the vibration would be bothersome but exactly the opposite - I like the back and forth.</li>
            <li>This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, The first was the Essence, the second was the Flexcare.</li>
            <li>Dentist seemed to notice the difference in using a sonicare toothbrush - particularly on the gums, and especially if you are a &amp;#34;hard brusher.&amp;#34;  This toothbrush prevents you from brushing your gums away.  </li>
            <li>So far after two uses, I can tell quite a difference over my normal brushing and feels like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, because you can simply push the button again, but I am not sure who is cleaning all their teeth and mouth in two minutes.</li>
            <li>I had an Oral B and loved the small, round brush head design.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to charge it (it was still working, but the light was flashing indicating it was down to 20% charge)  </li>
            <li>I have not used any other electric toothbrushes, but I have used a regular toothbrush when I was out of town and forgot my Sonicare, and I did not feel clean at all after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting the next model up, which is the HealthyWhite model even if you don&#x27;t use that function.  </li>
            <li>but overall, i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and you can use the diamondClean brushes that are highly rated.</li>
            <li>.after waiting over 3 months I finally got a return label to send back the broken Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>I usually take a traditional toothbrush when I travel and really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my teeth as clean as they should be, but I&#x27;m going to take it on an upcoming 5-day trip and test out the guaranty of a 2-week charge.  </li>
            <li>My old brush finally gave out so had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one, no questions asked and a postage-included padded envelope to send back my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist recommends Sonicare and no other brands... and, after using it for a year, I can see why!</li>
            <li>Owning a Philips medical device is very exciting, especially when their next up apparatus likely costs over 10x is sold through the buy-you-lunch sales reps types.</li>
            <li>It is also far less powerful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet powerful, and goes for months on a single charge.</li>
            <li>so you spend the right amount of time on the 4 main surfaces (upper outside, lower outside, upper inside,</li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth well and holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li>It holds a long charge and leaves moth very refreshed.</li>
            <li>It hums and vibrates so much that I don&#x27;t think I can stand to use it long term.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy to take it apart and clean it regularly, so I had to throw out an expensive piece of equipment</li>
            <li>I knew it would be better than a regular toothbrush, but I was shocked at how much better it was.  </li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing and regular professional care but the teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>chose this brush as I did not feel any real need for the bells &amp; whistles on the far more expensive models</li>
            <li>I apparently brush longer than 2 minute naturally.  </li>
            <li>Have to drive to gas station in the middle of the night and get a normal overpriced cheap-quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I must say, I will never go back to a normal tooth brush again.</li>
            <li>I can never go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I could back off when using a normal toothbrush (baseline for my brushing habits).</li>
            <li>I thought the timing for the different quadrant was a cool feature but after purchasing it was pointless and didn&#x27;t care too much for it.</li>
            <li>I believe it is well worth the extra price to get the &amp;#34;Quadpacer&amp;#34; setting that goes in 30 second intervals and stops for a second and continues telling you to change pattern and direction.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I was unable to use it due to an intense tickling feeling on my gums, but I found out that you can set the toothbrush to get progressively more intense over the course of several brushings to allow your teeth to adjust.</li>
            <li>The only other comment I would make is that the toothbrush only comes with one head so if you&#x27;re sharing you&#x27;re going to have to come up with some more dough to get a second one.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the SoniCare not long after I purchased the Oral B, because I really missed the way the Sonicare felt and cleaned my gums</li>
            <li>last tip - if you are a first time user and adjusting to this like I did, make sure you are opening your mouth a little wider, so that the back of the buzzing brush head doesn&#x27;t hit your other teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a helpful feature for people who maybe brush a little too quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe i was unconciously looking for an excuse to buy a new one because my old one was so LOUD, and I felt like it took forever to brush my teeth with the litle brush</li>
            <li>We have two of these, and prefer them over the higher priced model that has variable speeds, because we only use the high speed, and the button on the other one gets hit by mistake, cause a change in speed while brushing.</li>
            <li>The slim handle is great and the small base is nice and simple.</li>
            <li>I have gingivitis due to dry mouth from illness and medications and using the Sonicare has made a HUGE difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the handle is slimmer and more lightweight and seems to need to charge less often.</li>
            <li>I contacted the support center through a live chat and they are sending me a new brush handle!</li>
            <li>This is a much cleaner version, and I plan to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had that thing for years, so I figured rather than buying new heads for the toothbrush, I would upgrade the entire thing.</li>
            <li>My teenage granddaughter likes this new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush...</li>
            <li>I told them I am buying a new charger anyway as an extra for my children</li>
            <li>At my last cleaning the dental hygienist, a new girl, convinced me into buying a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is having to buy new replacement units that include another recharger - not needed, and extra brushes - not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my earlier model of the sonic tooth brush I had to recharge the battery every 8 to 9 days, i.e. when it was new.</li>
            <li>I would bet that all new models have the same problem because of the slender body that keeps side to side vibration in check.  </li>
            <li>The new heads just pop off, but also don&#x27;t seem to get mildewy if left on.</li>
            <li>I wore out the last Philips Sonicare I had, so that&#x27;s why I got this new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;8-28-12 -UPDATE - as another reviewer suggested to me, I did follow up with Phillips &amp; they are sending me a new toothbrush handle today &amp; a prepaid shipping label to send the defective one back.</li>
            <li>Now that I finally upgraded to a new model</li>
            <li>in other Sonicare items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 14 day ramp up feature for those who are nervous about switching from a manual - the intensity starts out very gently and gradually</li>
            <li>Also, no crevices that can catch waste like the old unit use to do (and required disassembly quite often to clean it out properly).</li>
            <li>The Oral B was much louder and even the soft bristles were rigid and rough on the gums.</li>
            <li>Works better than ever and such a design improvement with no space to collect liquids that turn icky.  </li>
            <li>Until then I had only really used a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally brush that way, but I find the thirty second reminders encouraging to help me brush for the whole 2 minutes as recommended.</li>
            <li>Not many bells and whistles are on board (quite normal at it&#x27;s price point), but it has everything to get your mouth feeling fresh within two minutes.</li>
            <li>It has fewer bells and whistles (almost none) but has the same motor/force/brushes per second and the Quadpacer - which is all I really used anyway.</li>
            <li>really well - no film is left, resulting in the just back from dentist feeling</li>
            <li>- It comes with two heads and the only description of them appears on the box and are very similar, i.e. gentle, gum lines, etc.  </li>
            <li>I really like the timer &#x27;reminder&#x27;, which is a brief pause in the vibration that reminds you to move on to a different quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li>The old one had a rubbery coating which was comfortable but sometimes got icky and smelly</li>
            <li>The timer works very well ensuring every quadrant is brushed equally</li>
            <li>I charged and set both to full power (not easy start of ramp-up).  </li>
            <li>It felt pretty weird at first and the zone alarm was pretty useless since everyone has certain spots on their mouth that require much more attention than others.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to feel good about your toothbrush when it&#x27;s smelly and full of creepy mold.</li>
            <li>This was purchased as a replacement for a ten year old Sonicare with the large head,  The smaller head is a great improvement and the replacements are so much less expensive.</li>
            <li>This is the first toothbrush of theirs that solves my problems with the other designs.</li>
            <li>The bases last for YEARS and the heads are a little spendy but worth it!</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are pretty expensive, they should cost the same as a toothbrush, they are more like three times that.</li>
            <li>No other electric tooth brush even comes close to what the Sonic does in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I also love how small the brush head is because it reaches all the way back to my back molars.</li>
            <li>They have all worked great with some lasting as long as 4 years before the seal where the brush head plugs into the handle fails and allows water to get in.</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I bought my first sonicare after a dentist basically mandated it after I had to have my teeth scraped due to gingivitis.</li>
            <li>Customer service gives you a reference number but the call takers only add half of the information you give them, full address, phone number etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same as the &#x27;white&#x27; function on my other which they say is used to polish/whiten rather than clean...</li>
            <li>I still need to clean the inside of my lower gums with a rubber tool, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s MUCH better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare Died Exactly After 1 Year, Not sure to buy another one after being so careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush stops charging or water must have gotten in\\&quot; Starts for a second makes a beep with light and turns off immediately\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t think the extra features are worth it of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>My older model (that cost $20 more) only took a few hours to a half day.</li>
            <li>It feels like my teeth are really clean when I use this and in the last month I&#x27;ve already noticed that my teeth are a little whiter.</li>
            <li>HX5610/01 Essence and find that a little bit gross to clean the head part.</li>
            <li>It was not able to hold a charge for more than a single brushing.  </li>
            <li>It is very slender and keeps a charge far longer than any of the other two.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some getting used to with how fast it is and how odd it really feels.  </li>
            <li>Took a few tries to get used to, but it really does feel like an adequate teeth cleaning</li>
            <li>My teeth were becoming loose and after a few weeks of using this toothbrush, almost all mobility is gone.</li>
            <li>In addition, due to the powerful magnet attached to the head and the more powerful amplifier, it was nearly impossible to stall the original Elite models, no matter how hard</li>
            <li>Sort of expensive for a toothbrush, but well worth it if you like that shiny clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The design improvement I mentioned above is part of an overall improvement in quality over older models.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and keeps the charge for a long time</li>
            <li>charging stand makes it easy to keep on my very small sink</li>
            <li>so much I could hardly brush at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people like me who have a bad gag reflex.</li>
            <li>Price is a amazing for how it is compare to the expensive sonic</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t bother with a general review as there&#x27;s over 2,000 reviews.  </li>
            <li>couple of years ago my dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product.</li>
            <li>but generally it should be cleaned after every use to prevent any buildup.</li>
            <li>/whitening generally just increases the duration the toothbrush is kept running by 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>a generally &amp;#34;feels cleaner&amp;#34; after using the device.</li>
            <li>The box, the manual, and even the product description here all clearly state that this model has a feature called Quadpacer that beeps and pauses in 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the softer bristled brushes, having sensitive gums, and following the general advice of dentists and hygenists.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to the old way since I started using this electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li>Only been using it for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>so I barely have access to the faucet)</li>
            <li>I still use the regular old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much anyone else spent on this toothbrush</li>
            <li>With this and flossing they barely do anything when I go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li>It is far and away beyond the toothbrushes found in drugstores and big box items.  </li>
            <li>I used the sensitive mode while my gums were getting used to it and have worked up to the regular setting.</li>
            <li>I like the force and frequency of the vibration and apparently it works for my teeth.</li>
            <li>Finally I had one young lady</li>
            <li>In a speaker, the permanent magnet is attached to the speaker cone and moves back and forth in proximityto a fixed voice coil.</li>
            <li>I had one of these several years ago when I was young and lost it.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare Elite finally died.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My last one was 5 years old, and it still works, I just prefered this model because of easier cleaning.</li>
            <li>and we are still on the initial charge; the old one needed a charge every 5-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This last one lasted 6 months before it stopped vibrating and made a loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li>My initial reaction was &amp;#34;So we need to drop $80 on an electric tooth brush because you never learned to brush your teeth?&amp;#34;  I then came to the conclusion that we needed to focus on solutions and realized that this might allow her to keep her teeth in old age.  </li>
            <li>I like the way my teeth feel - as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>However, I personally don’t favor the soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li>Works well so far, but haven&#x27;t been back to dentist yet to see just how well</li>
            <li>My ten year old Sonicare just stopped working one day but my dentist still insists on this brand of electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve yet to open the package of soft bristles for the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days without charging, brushing three times/day (9 sessions in total) and the battery lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW, not only do my teeth feel cleaner, I never have any gum sensitivity anymore, AND my receding gum have improved greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this model rather than replacing my old e-series toothbrush when it finally died.</li>
            <li>Further, these toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li>So I bought this one for my adult son who just finished extensive dental work.</li>
            <li>I barely used it.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a second one for my 10 year old son.</li>
            <li>The power of the sonic action obliterates any gunk between your teeth especially calcium buildup.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is sleek and the charging stand is much smaller than my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The battery on teh old one died so this was simply a relacement.</li>
            <li>MY OLD SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH LASTED OVER TEN YEARS AND IS A DURABLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Our 5 year old e-series brush recently died and we were looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare didn&#x27;t have the 30-second beep as a cue to move to the next area to brush.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate harder) and a pulse mode, which I don&#x27;t really get the point of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Btw it works completely through vibrations, so there is no rotation of the bristles or head of toothbrush, but it is detachable and they have different styles you can use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not buy another Sonicare and will switch to the Braun brand--which my wife has had for nearly 10 years with the same battery and no problems!</li>
            <li>It only has one working mode, but to be frankly, my last Panasonic one has lots of functions and among the 4 yrs I owned it, 99.9% of the time I just used normal tooth cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>It also means that when traveling I can leave the charger behind for most trips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s skinnier, a better charging base, overall better design.  </li>
            <li>I use to unscrew the old head all the time in order to let it dry out a little, but it was always full of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>Might be a year, might be a little more or less.</li>
            <li>It is also very gentle on my gums (I have previously had a problem of receding gums that has since halted now that I&#x27;ve switched from a manual brush).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish the new heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but still, what price would you put on healthy teeth and gums?</li>
            <li>Doesnt get dirty like the other models.thisbis the most important feature and</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it does still does its job - just not nearly as well as my old one which makes me want to just go back to using my old one!</li>
            <li>always gave his hygienist extra work, until a few months later after using the bulky original non-pacer Sonicare</li>
            <li>I asked why shipping time was so long when Amazon could have a new one to me in two days, and was told that was how Philips worked.</li>
            <li>I used to have a Sonicare a few years back but had the problem of gunk getting stuck in the middle chamber (where the brush attaches) and I&#x27;d have to clean my toothbrush with every use.</li>
            <li>I try to clean it after use and it only takes a few extra seconds.</li>
            <li>A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li>thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that due to the (wild guess here) way sonic vibrations work, it seems to collapse all the bubbles and foam that you normally get with brushing.</li>
            <li>Reason for this purchase / replacement - dropped prior one too many times on the hard floor; after last drop, no longer worked properly.</li>
            <li>Have been using original Model FC but replacement heads are hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I personally think the timer is set a little too short for my liking, as I go two full cycles</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t know if they have a different speed, or other difference, but I just plain like the ones with the snap on top.  </li>
            <li>To quote an old commercial of a different product &amp;#34;oh what a relief it is&amp;#34;, not to have to recharge the battery on such a frequent basis.</li>
            <li>Nice toothbrush, but very pricey, and the starter head bristles are a little too hard and sharp for my liking.</li>
            <li>Solid product, though it tickles in some areas of my gums like no other!</li>
            <li>At first I liked the circular brush, but the thing felt heavy and clunky and somewhat sloppy compared to the Sonicare (yes, I know there is a difference between the battery powdered models and the more expensive offerings).</li>
            <li>Thanks to other customers who replied to my post</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable compared to the other models.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very slim but it continues to perform well like other soni care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $59 to avoid extra dental work and cost later on down the road.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have 2 types to choose from if you step up in quality: Oral-B (with the round spinning heads) and Philips (with the more traditional up and down stroke head).</li>
            <li>Mre expensive models largely just add more time to the cycle to do things like &amp;#34;focus on vanity surfaces&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;focus on gums&amp;#34; which this one can totally do if you simply turn it back on .</li>
            <li>Seriously, it could cause real harm if you do other then put it lightly against your teeth.</li>
            <li>the new one feels better and and doesn&#x27;t get all dirty like the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth honestly never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint that we&#x27;ve had is the sound.</li>
            <li>Seeds were stuck, including one far back between my last two lower teeth.  </li>
            <li>It lasted much longer than expected and it finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because I didn&#x27;t feel the extra bells and whistles were necessary for me, although I did want a brush with the quad feature like my old one, which this one has.</li>
            <li>I have been using an cordless toothbrush for the past ten years but more recently it has not recharged properly (ten years is a long time).  </li>
            <li>Brush is not too small nor too big (I guess this won&#x27;t stand true for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so far the most expensive toothbrush I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>The secret here is that the newer design brush attachments allow for ease of replacement brush&#x27;s suited for your individual concerns as there are many styles to choose from.</li>
            <li>The older toothbrushes had a lot of empty space in the inside and seams that would fill with water and goo and get moldy.</li>
            <li>I notice my teeth are smoother and after about a month I&#x27;m noticing that they are whiter because the false cap part is more yellow !!!  </li>
            <li>I have owned a Sonicare rechargeable in the past that was much more expensive, and this certainly performs as well at much lower cost.</li>
            <li>I kissed soda goodbye, bought this new Sonicare toothbrush and committed to flossing every single day - no matter what.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted a little over 10 years</li>
            <li>You might think that 60 bucks is a lot to spend on a toothbrush, but the condition of your teeth can have a major effect on your overall health.</li>
            <li>It usually stops right when I&#x27;ve had time to thoroughly clean my teeth, gums, and tongue, but sometimes I just have to get an extra few seconds in!</li>
            <li>I have an old cap and my natural teeth are actually trending back towards my cap color which was the color of my teeth a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>Charge lasts long enough that it doesn&#x27;t have to live on its charger.</li>
            <li>2 days later i had my new tooth brush with a free extra head and a package to return the broken one.  </li>
            <li>One needs to try it to understand what they mean when they say you can feel the sonic care clean.</li>
            <li>not sure what the warrenty is - by the time I find it in my mess of papers - it will probably have just expired. :)</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was apparently the same things everyone else didn&#x27;t like: the size, the so-so battery life and the filth that would form inside the handle and brush heads.</li>
            <li>Apparently the warranty is for 2 years only.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t have the different settings like the higher end models, but those features are not worth the extra $40, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>However, just remember the first few times it will feel \\&quot;weird\\&quot; my wife said it tickled.</li>
            <li>I ordered it in June 14 and by october it was making a funny noise, and before the end of october it was dead.</li>
            <li>I was becoming concerned about and tired</li>
            <li>It lasted a good 8 years before the battery would no longer charge, and due to the nature of it, the battery was unable to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>This way, you brush upper  or bottom, left or right teeth for 30 seconds, then the toothbrush gives a slight beep, encouraging you to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>Recommend cleaning base and taking top apart each time to keep clean.</li>
            <li>yea much better than my old essentials which i had for more than 10 years, that one finally died, and decided i wanted one without the cavity to hold all that nasty gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this reason I chose the least expensive of the smaller head toothbrushes, the Easy Clean, which had reviews as high as their most expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would highly this Sonicare toothbrush or any other Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, while using the Oral B, I have always received high praise from my dental hygienist (no plaque buildup or cavities), even when I went a couple of years between cleanings due to health reasons.</li>
            <li>I was immediately disappointed in the Easy clean output.  </li>
            <li>Philips must not be doing well and to compensate is saving money by making these VERY skinny and removing about half the bristles they had before.  </li>
            <li>A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It works well and is much lighter that the previous versions.   </li>
            <li>Since I began using it, my gums are much healthier and my teeth have less plaque when I go for a cleaning...as an added bonus, they seem to stay whiter, too.  </li>
            <li>I actually have become fanatic about keeping my teeth clean and white because this tooth brush gives me a reason.</li>
            <li>This is very valuable, I found previously, with just a 2-minute shut off, I would often turn the brush off before the 2 mins was up.</li>
            <li>bought this specific model because the higher priced models from Sonicare are a waste of money.</li>
            <li>The higher end/more expensive models have features that I just wouldn&#x27;t use, but this one is worth it for the Lion battery.</li>
            <li>It was good while it lasted, but since this low quality product is now broken and Philips won&#x27;t replace it until some unknown date in the distant future, I&#x27;m giving it 2/5.</li>
            <li>I must admit my mouth needed to get used to the sonic vibrations and this brush actually starts off slow and increases over a two week period to full strength to help with this.</li>
            <li>I would swear that the unit also slowed down at the same time, now giving a gentle massage instead of a brisk cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I let the battery run down before I recharge even though the manual says overcharging isn&#x27;t possible, I really would prefer not to have to replace them in a year.  </li>
            <li>When you finally catch it, it tells you the gentle action of the last few days was not battery or your stronger gums, but layers of dried bacteria (even with the Philips Sonicare UV Station) non-noticeably rattling the whole mouthpiece.  </li>
            <li>Is it really that hard just to answer a simple question?&lt;br /&gt;People, don&#x27;t get fooled by the 5 star reviews, the only reason they rate it high is because they have not reached the &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; point yet.</li>
            <li>This is nice and thin, feels good in the hand, doesn&#x27;t get all goopy and nasty under the brush stem like the older model.  </li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding new brush heads for my old Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>standard brush head - unless I want to use the one designed for gums, which is small but not the right head for tooth brushing... Philips does make a compact head but not for this handle..</li>
            <li>The metal shaft becomes loose inside the body, it gets gradually louder as the vibrating action decreases.</li>
            <li>I can see right away that the small, light charging base will fall over easily and possibly drop the unit off the countertop.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older model that was difficult to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I let it run down at least once after i chage it and occasionally to make sure im not trashing the battery.</li>
            <li>thought I had simply not taken care of the item the first time I had this issue, but the same breakage occurred even when I was very careful to keep my second purchase dry and corrosion-free.</li>
            <li>But, I also didn&#x27;t want to go with the entry-level model, particularly not those that used the old &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; style heads.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the new Sonicare was not NEARLY as strong as my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li>they vibrate so fast and so little</li>
            <li>and while I did like the performance of the Sonicare I refuse to purchase from a company that forces its consumers to purchase new products due to planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The thought of using a hand held toothbrush again was so foreign to me that I promptly ordered a new charger and it arrived before my toothbrush needed to be charged.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I needed a new electric toothbrush--our Braun was losing usable charge every other day.  </li>
            <li>Much more subtle in the dark at night.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you are new to Sonicare and if you are sick of cleaning your E-series then it&#x27;s worth the purchase of a new one.</li>
            <li>It seems that the size trades off for being slightly less powerful than other models.</li>
            <li>The batteries don&#x27;t last forever (second one lasted 7 years) but having the dental hygienist hardly touch me is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a key point because other ones are very loud.</li>

            <li> It did a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth but after a while the area where the brush head attached to the handle became all gunked up</li>

            <li> and it was a wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best product in the marketplace.  </li>

            <li> Very happy though.</li>
            <li> I was favorably impressed with the cleaning, but found that replacing the batteries always resulted in the waterproof seal being damaged and the batteries would flood.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> and I believe they do the best job.</li>

            <li> It died after 3 years it was good before that.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this model, and it is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good investment.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job of cleaning which I can tell just by running my tongue across my teeth</li>
            <li> downhill - engineers are prodded by marketers to screw up a good thing - someone tell these people they&#x27;re going backward.</li>

            <li> The quad timer is a good touch.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush was good, the longevity was not.</li>
            <li> As good as I have encountered over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The good news is, I went three weeks before I needed to recharge</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>

            <li> I like it and it feels good in the mouth</li>
            <li> and I have always taken good care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Function wise -</li>
            <li> However the stand has also been minimized and that&#x27;s not so good.  </li>

            <li> I received my order on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt just as good as when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> When my dentist suggested it was a good idea, I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just wish they&#x27;d stick a micro USB input in the bottom and call it good, it would probably charge faster too.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to brush my teeth and have the toothbrush do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush does a good job.  </li>
            <li> the stages timer to promote good brushing is helpful too.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning the grill too and it ramps up gradually</li>
            <li> This is a good medium range brush, nothing too fancy, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is nice and teeth feel great afterwards.</li>

            <li> Good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It lasts a good two weeks before I recharge it.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for travel but it is so superior that I now use it exclusively.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> but I have good hopes.</li>
            <li> Wisely.</li>
            <li> it was a good performer.  </li>
            <li> This may not be a fair ratting</li>
            <li> It seem to do a good job of brushing</li>
            <li> It was a really good choice of mine to try out this line of product, featuring easy-clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good when it works.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good vibration scrubbing brush.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be good quality, but I can&#x27;t seem to get used to the vibration against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I think my problem is that I don&#x27;t like electric toothbrushes, however I am persisting because I think it does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleanest my teeth have ever been, and I&#x27;ve used good quality electric toothbrushes before.</li>
            <li> Good while it lasted, but do keep your receipt even after eight months or so because these are prone to stop working and they won&#x27;t give you anything without a receipt.</li>
            <li> Snaps on and you&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> You might want to check around for good buys on this.</li>
            <li> They are superior.</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m finished.</li>

            <li> Great product, clean teeth and great service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and has very good &#x27;reach&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Better than Oral-B.  Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We have used Soniccare brushes in our home for well over 15 years and just had to purchase a replacement motor, great brush and much more compact than the one we have used all these years.</li>
            <li> Also, very healthy for your gums.</li>
            <li> Great price I have to say as in the pharmacy stores they are about $100 or more.</li>
            <li> Always great and much better than a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li> He uses it faithfully every day and is very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I found that this model is a great happy medium of not too cheap, very light and efficient for the money.</li>

            <li> Still loving this brush.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Hx6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is an excellent value at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have a case for it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this model and felt the design was an improvement.</li>
            <li> Looks exceptionally nice.</li>
            <li> Its good but def not the top of the line.</li>
            <li> works nicely.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize all the hype about electric toothbrushes but after trying a battery operated brush from CVS, I wanted the real thing and am very happy with this.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare products for a number of years and wanted to get our daughter one of her own.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the brush itself seems to be working quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> own both and prefer the Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself, and liked it so well</li>
            <li> I own a three speed version of one of these and bought this one as a gift.</li>
            <li> feels really nice and its convenient that its rechargeable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to find out what kind of warranty replacement coverage there might be on this unit.</li>
            <li> I called Customer service and, after a rather lengthy wait time (being honest here)</li>
            <li> I have always liked the quad pacer feature.  </li>
            <li> The timer is a good reminder to get my 2 minutes in and the box says to switch out the brush heads every 3 months, but they can go for more.</li>
            <li> The difference was literally astounding.  </li>
            <li> Works well, is compact, lightweight and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really handy for getting in those hard-to-reach places like wisdom teeth and at the gumline, plus it&#x27;s been about a month since I bought it</li>
            <li> this is my third sonicare and my dentist is very happy with the results.recommended to anyone great purchased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more efficient than manual brushing and is good for the gums.</li>
            <li> It is a nice sleek design and</li>
            <li> The seller was from the UK and if he were honest, would have brought this to my attention.  </li>
            <li> Would have also been nice to include a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW don&#x27;t get the rotary kind.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth, making for great dental checkups!</li>
            <li> I don’t find Sonic seals for this model; it would be nice to have those.</li>
            <li> That alone makes me thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I also liked the improved design brushes and the attachment that doesn&#x27;t allow water and tooth paste to leak into the case.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted one of her own but preferred a rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> Battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Recharge nice and this unit has served me well.</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> And I really take good care of it!!!</li>
            <li> timer is nice</li>
            <li> But I do much prefer this brush, this I think is the best electric toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li> There is some kind of faulty glitche in this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I own both brands, Oral-B 4000 series and this Sonicare.</li>
            <li> them have  been very understanding, delightful and apologetic for my inconvenience .. .</li>
            <li> The brush does a great job, much better than I was able to do with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare products for many years with good performance.</li>
            <li> No hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I am appreciative of the reviewer that suggested that I follow up.</li>
            <li> Good product, but WaterPik is better for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush I liked as welll as this  </li>
            <li> Nice, efficient rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an automatic stop, so I can kind of just brush and forget about it until it stops itself.</li>
            <li> and it was good, but this Sonicare is better.</li>
            <li> Nothing but nice things to say about this brush...</li>
            <li> I am a &amp;#34;thrifty&amp;#34; person and not prone to spending this kind of money on myself.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The brush also is contoured to get in between teeth as well, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I did not tell them I was using this, they just must think I am going nuts on my own and attacking those cavity creeps on my own.</li>
            <li> Timer to help keep you honest.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Buy nice or buy twice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sanitary cap is a nice addition</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that it pings after 30 seconds</li>
            <li> It has the nice 2 min timer letting you know</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this toothbrush is great for your teeth and gums, I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than twenty seconds.  </li>
            <li> This is a very handy toothbrush with essential functions, perfect for what I need.</li>
            <li> The very nice smooth feeling is replicated with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who bought the original Sonicare and was happy with it - needed to be charged once a week,</li>
            <li> is a great toothbrush and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied my teeth feel very very smooth</li>
            <li> First off, I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am very happy (as is my dental hygienist)  with the cleaning results.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did a great job of keeping my teeth clean but died after 2.5 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of the older e Series and was very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered another (at great expense) because it keeps my teeth clean, but if I have to order one a year, it will get pricey.</li>
            <li> this model is very good value, and I do not see benefits of getting the higher end ones</li>
            <li> Manufacturer said the Easy Clean model is the quietest (!!!).  </li>
            <li> This new updated style has resolved that problem perfectly.  </li>
            <li> My new dentist encouraged me to get one, and I&#x27;m so happy I did!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s good at holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Great purchase from Amazon with quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really good service from Philips, I have been a customer of them many years for many products.&lt;br /&gt;Despite</li>
            <li> The timer is a great way to insure you are getting and adequate cleaning.</li>
            <li> I feel the vibrate is very strong</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and I find it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to return it and purchase this one!</li>
            <li> I love this thing, LOVE IT !  </li>
            <li> Easy Clean is my favorite, it is the best one of the many I have owned.</li>
            <li> Best of all teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean.  </li>
            <li> There are many excellent reviews for this toothbrush on here, hundreds in fact, so I just want to highlight some of my main observations:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Just a really good, effective clean for your teeth.</li>
            <li> The rep I spoke with convinced me to buy their deluxe brush heads, claiming they were much better.  </li>
            <li> This brush is clearly the best design.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> This model for the price offers the best value.</li>
            <li> It works great and is actually fun to use.  </li>
            <li> but i definitely loved the smooth after the dentist feel it gave to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I feel my teeth and gums are in the best condition they&#x27;ve ever been after using this brush for about a month so far.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he is very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing after brushing and love the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> so hopefully it&#x27;s as effective, which I&#x27;m sure it is.</li>
            <li> So far they are impressed with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothbrush I ever had so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips should put every effort into making the unit complete and perfect and drop the effort to nickel and dime the consumer.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as healthy</li>
            <li> This is a great product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric brush I have had in 20 years.  </li>
            <li> love it ... easy to use and good to travel with.</li>
            <li> Recommended strongly!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I researched many of the available models and the Easy Clean seemed like the best option.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED my original Sonicare, but I consider this one trash.  </li>
            <li> Great clean feel and easy on the gums!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They absolutely are the best available for oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> This would make a great wedding gift for a couple, or a great graduation present.</li>
            <li> It;s a good tool and gets my teeth clean</li>
            <li> The materials of this toothbrush are superior to the Oral-B and the heads fit much better.</li>
            <li> It seems trivial, but it really is a great product for helping you keep up your smile :)</li>
            <li> I searched and compared prices at all the major stores and this was the best buy.</li>
            <li> It produces great results and it is very convenient to use!  SS</li>
            <li> Also, the Easy-Start ramping up period over the first 2 weeks is a great way to get used to the brush without your gums being aggravated.</li>
            <li> First, the size is great.</li>
            <li> I was pretty happy with that.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with how my teeth feel after using it, and love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> This one is much easier to clean and it does a great job!  </li>
            <li> and it is very light weight.</li>
            <li> Teeth are very important to maintain.  </li>
            <li> stock bristles are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean and brush very easy to use and stays charged</li>
            <li> Good fit in the palm and easy to guide.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> The product is aptly named as it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> You are making a huge mistake if you don&#x27;t use sonicare!  </li>
            <li> LOVE this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> but if they did im sure it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> the money you pay for (if not on the more inexpensive side)</li>
            <li> and I feel like my teeth are still much better off than with manual brushing / flossing alone.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare brush is so much better</li>
            <li> Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare Elite back in 2003, and it was the BEST toothbrush I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Our dentist is pleased too.......  : )</li>
            <li> am enjoying and</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I exceed the 2 minutes every time now, just making sure I am thorough.  </li>
            <li> After research I found that this one has all the necessary features at the best price.  </li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel wonderful, I&#x27;d never go back to old-fashioned toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I love the slender, sleek style.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> He was impressed enough that everyone in the family now has one.</li>
            <li> We like the timing modes that can be used to make sure you&#x27;re giving all your teeth ample cleaning time.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush will buy another when the time comes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my experience \\&quot;Can you hear me better now?\\&quot; volume will not be maintained throughout the call</li>
            <li> Not all of us have a bathroom with more than two outlets.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has it all: the brushing cycle is not like most electric toothbrush options.</li>
            <li> They love these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll update this review for sure when I try it out.</li>
            <li> I wonder how the handle and the heads will stand up to three months of  repeated pulling off and pushing on, 4 or more times a day.</li>
            <li> Charger and handle and top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all posted :)</li>
            <li> The manufacturer, Phillips, needs to practice better quality control of the packaging of their product.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> (then I&#x27;ll erase all this and complain about the battery :)</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (it used the e-series screw-on toothbrush heads), and I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded to this one.</li>
            <li> After not having been able to visit a dentist for a couple years, I was told by my dentist to try out the Sonicare</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I took her advice.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and you get a better price buying it on here than Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  </li>
            <li> I have used an electric toothbrush for many years.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking to get White 710, but this works perfect.</li>
            <li> If I want to brush more for whiting purpose, just push the button one more time.</li>
            <li> I feel I saved $15:)</li>
            <li> Hopefully my teeth will be in better shape in 6 months :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine a Sonicare with more power.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is the built in quad-timer than beeps every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> The basic Sonicare is excellent.</li>
            <li> would not pay more (let alone twice) for any of the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; versions.</li>
            <li> Philips seemed to me to have more experience and more research into the mechanics at this price point and that tilted me toward the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> From having to replace so many toothbrushes?</li>
            <li> No cavities on my latest check-up.  </li>
            <li> There are so many options.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT TELLS ME</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this.</li>
            <li> I also have one and love it.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying Sonicare toothbrushes for years and am always satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful and it makes brushing fly by without having to watch the time.</li>
            <li> Just stopped being able to charge at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the feeling I experience when I have finished brushing.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (and I love that it beeps after every 30 seconds so that you know to switch up your brushing area).</li>
            <li> Dental check-ups are now much better.</li>
            <li> Glad the kids have already moved out or I&#x27;d be buying them one too.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush tips can be pricey but you should be able to find \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; package deals every now and then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I went to another dentist for cleaning recently and he just told me that my oral health was excellent.</li>
            <li> How they&#x27;re able to charge using plastic on plastic</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer helps keep you on pace and the fact that it runs for 2 minutes is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that my dental hygienist will be impressed at my next visit!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> After three months with this toothbrush, my teeth feel better than ever.  </li>
            <li> and they all love it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE it</li>
            <li> always so satisfied I&#x27;ve never been tempted to try another brand.  </li>
            <li> Love Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> After brushing I feel like my mouth is much more cleaner, and there is no holes in the toothbrush part where residual toothpaste gets stuck and has to be washed out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the e-series</li>
            <li> Much better than my e-series.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> This one also has a much better battery life.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed my unit and it has improved the cleaning of my teeth according to my Dentist.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare myself and love it</li>
            <li> I love Amazon</li>
            <li> and I love their Prime service, but they dropped the ball on this one.  </li>
            <li> Third Sonicare this is the best.</li>
            <li> Everything works perfectly well and it&#x27;s much more efficient in terms of cleaning than my last one.</li>
            <li> I probably get only 8 weeks use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement.</li>
            <li> The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all that the description claimed it would be, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> But this one is very simple, one speed, but perfect!</li>
            <li> My gums feel much better and are no longer bleeding.  </li>
            <li> THE PHILIPS SONICARE EASYCLEAN HAS A PHENOMENAL 3 WEEK BATTERY LIFE, WHILE</li>
            <li> but now i love brushing my teeth and</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my teeth love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> minutes flies by and is almost slightly enjoyable to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> Some better than others.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> They make another model where the brush screws onto the top.  </li>
            <li> Love how it makes my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> Totally enjoyable and beneficial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the device is as it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding toothbrush for the money.</li>
            <li> This model is much better than the higher-end models.</li>
            <li> so it is better.  </li>
            <li> I also really love how it buzzes to signal that I need to switch to another part of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush is like most Phillips Sonicare type.  </li>
            <li> It was probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in recent years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> just got done having a bridge put in top</li>
            <li> A rinse of the head and motor body after every use is worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> started getting more &amp;#34;4s&amp;#34; for gum gaps a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;went to the dentist yesterday and 75% of the gum shrinkage improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, an ingenious design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but not as powerful as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> More of a tickle than anything.</li>
            <li> just buy the better brush heads.  </li>
            <li> we love them.</li>
            <li> glad to not have to screw on brush heads but rather</li>
            <li> I also love that it make a noise every 30 seconds so you can rotate every section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Faster motion means more scrubs per minute</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the improvements.</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrushes have mostly solved my gum disease</li>
            <li> it was OK.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for in this case and this toothbrush is fantastic !  </li>
            <li> and I still love it.</li>
            <li> Love sonicare</li>
            <li> I had this for more than one year</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My dad love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely one of the best consumer products I&#x27;ve purchased in a while.</li>
            <li> From my research it seems like you can pay more for a sonicare toothbrush, but you don&#x27;t get much more.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We love Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I like them better because they rotate at a faster RPM.  </li>
            <li> dentist (without knowing I was using this brush) said in my last visit that my teeth and gums looked great, and that she couldn&#x27;t find any plaque to scrape off during the cleaning!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had one for many years....</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> no need for more buttons, more accessories (except for the case),  more lights, more programs etc.</li>
            <li> If I need to brush some more, I turn it on again.</li>
            <li> My teeth got noticeably more stained.</li>
            <li> You can use any of the Sonicare heads, including the Diamond head that comes with their top of the line model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> and it is still going, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Employed for over a year, this toothbrush has reliably cleaned my teeth and gums better than anything else ever has.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love that I can just pop the brush head on it and go.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare for over 10 years and love it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off purchasing the Oral B version instead which does a much better job of cleaning your teeth and in between around the gums.  </li>
            <li> but in reality, the 31,000 strokes/min probably did a much better job cleaning than my manual toothbrushing ever could.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> that my teeth feel better.</li>
            <li> Glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This newer design is much better.</li>
            <li> yeah, I am glad I got one.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it, got one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Much better than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because my wife and I already have Sonicares and love them.  </li>
            <li> With Sonicare, I might get away with once a year visits instead of every six months. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to get a better brush in terms of cleaning.</li>
            <li> A more textured surface would be better.</li>
            <li> For some models, you may be able to find a softer brush head on line--but not in any stores.</li>
            <li> Ok, but feels like your teeth are gonna vibrate out of your head?,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Everything I need, and nothing more.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to exhaust the battery (recharged after two weeks of use</li>
            <li> The one with the greater diameter brush connection.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 4 rating is probably more about my dexterity (or lack thereof) in using the product than any issue with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to have found this newer model here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I found this Sonicare on Amazon for $50 and it is better than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> If this cost were to drop somewhat, I&#x27;m sure the number of users would increase dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Light and a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the timer function</li>
            <li> I love my Sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good, basic toothbrush with no bells and whistles, at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bout many of these as i leave them at vacation homes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recipient&#x27;s favorite gift from that year.</li>
            <li> Love this electric brush.</li>
            <li> i am sure there is som science to it</li>
            <li> Like a more docile version the Essence 5600</li>
            <li> wish it had more speeds</li>
            <li> Love the hesitation</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare Elite models.</li>
            <li> And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE  it and am getting my husband one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love the 2 minute timer.</li>
            <li> toothbrush plus flossing and mouthwash (plus the semi yearly scaling at the dentist) ensures my mouth stays cavity free!</li>
            <li> There are models with more features, but when you read through the marketing hype, it&#x27;s just longer brushing time, or variable power levels.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The top brush does not stay secured to the lower handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the wider ones.</li>
            <li> The Phillps however is so much better.</li>
            <li> Had sonicares for years and love them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than the oral b I replaced it with.</li>
            <li> I have owned three Phillips Sonicare brushes and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> They price was better than in any store, but the shipping took a while.</li>
            <li> I am glad I switched to this toothbrush years ago.</li>
            <li> This one has a more grippy on/off button that I can brace against while not affecting, while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love my SonicCare.</li>
            <li> I Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use this product four times a day and love the timed cycle.  </li>
            <li> So he had this one and uses it many times a day</li>
            <li> The results have been better check up&#x27;s for all.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite model of my favorite electric toothbrush company.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it to be a much better design.</li>
            <li> Love the slim handle and more compact recharger.</li>
            <li> Love the quad pacer.  </li>
            <li> My redid my son&#x27;s bathroom and it has a place for most everything, but my son would leave stuff out, but now almost every time I go into the bathroom, ever thing is put away.......How many bathrooms with kids have stuff put away?</li>
            <li> its just a way to make you think your getting a newer more up to date version.</li>
            <li> but I spend more than 30 seconds on each section and it auto shuts off after 2 mins.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was a Braun user for many years.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the Braun, but after my last Braun wore out (it stopped working after a couple of years), my wife suggested we try the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no question it removes more plaque</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied sonic user for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is simply the best.</li>
            <li> .going to replace it with another top leading brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend this buy for everyone, more so for folks like me with RA who have difficulty using their hands.  </li>
            <li> I probably would&#x27;ve been better off getting the cheaper version.</li>
            <li> I love the timed brushing feature.</li>
            <li> they want more words to submit my review.  ???</li>
            <li> love the timer every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and love them.</li>
            <li> Way better than my e series</li>
            <li> but I would expect more than a year of service.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job cleaning and my teeth feel like I just left the hygienist&#x27;s office when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love the timing feature too, it ensures I don&#x27;t rush and get to all my teeth evenly.</li>
            <li> The Easyclean, the current toothbrush I use, is the best of the three.</li>
            <li> Read reviews for many rechargeable electric toothbrushes before deciding on the HX6511/50.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> glad I made splurge.  </li>
            <li> This one just has a nice smooth plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> and now they are so healthy that the hygenist mentions it everytime</li>
            <li> Keeps you buying more</li>
            <li> Anyway, love this brush with the compact heads.  </li>
            <li> i traded in an oral b which i had been pleased with</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> I keep running my tounge over them, and they feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I also went to the dentist recently and he was really impressed by how clean/well kept my mouth/teeth</li>
            <li> This way I know I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every aspect of tooth brushing was better than a manual (except cost of the unit and replacement brush heads).</li>
            <li> After reading a TON of reviews of it and then this more affordable option (thank you everyone) and decided to go for this one.</li>
            <li> You will actually do a better job brushing and save trips to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no point in spending more than what this model costs.</li>
            <li> And it saves me time because in the 2 minutes (it has a timer) that it runs it does better than the 5 minutes of manual brushing</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for more than 15 years - this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It fits my hand better.</li>
            <li> and my hygenist swears I will have a better checkup.</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it, love it</li>
            <li> I love the philips sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love that the brush does the work.  </li>
            <li> Caused more gum recession than before I began using it.  </li>
            <li> No one had a better price than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Investing in your health is always a worthwhile venture.</li>
            <li> Li-ion battery promises a longer life with more time between charges.  </li>
            <li> My wife believes it does a better job than our Braun.  </li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the Sonicare electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This brush solved that problem and more.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It helps to make your brushing more thorough.</li>
            <li> This easy clean is better than good.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Sonicare brushes for many years-</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> But after buying this electric toothbrush,,,,,, I now brush twice a day and my teeth and gums feel so much better.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.... :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features is the timer that signals every 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an glad I invested in this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> if I had proof my teeth are being cleaned better.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for many years</li>
            <li> and I even got a pat on my shoulder by my seriously handsome dentist.  :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because white is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s doing so much more for my teeth than manually brushing.</li>
            <li> Love this product - my dentist told me to get an electric toothbrush, and he specifically recommended Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> they where able to make the brush head without the magnets.</li>
            <li> Much much better.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love these sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I love ,y toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I Evan better.</li>
            <li> Hand brush is better.</li>
            <li> makes it more of a pleasure than chore to do my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> and now I LOVE brushing.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy a 3-pack of the softer heads along with your order.</li>
            <li> Was able to use it on a 10 day vacation without charging it either.</li>
            <li> Be sure to make sure toothpaste doesn&#x27;t accumulate where the head connects to the body of the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these toothbrushes for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I know it will be better because of my experience.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> My new Sonicare works beautifully, and I love the newer style.</li>
            <li> My first use was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Philips are offering a very well thought-out design here which works very effectively.</li>
            <li> types of brushes have unique cleaning advantages of their own design.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> V  ery pleased &amp; would highly recommend as great VFM too.</li>
            <li> Great, would highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I are extremely happy with our new brushes!</li>

            <li> My wife is happy with the reduced size and weight compared to our older brushes.  </li>

            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after using this!</li>
            <li> my mouth feels very clean after using.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after brushing with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After I brush my teeth with this they feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;easy, and teeth feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth very clean with no irritation or pain to my gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean after using this brush.</li>
            <li> Great much better than the old model doesn&#x27;t trap dirt inside !</li>
            <li> I do not want to make this totally about comparing the two products, so I will say that I do love the slim handle on its own and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> My first lasted 5 years before and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> The battery can use a long time, so awesome!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides all these, I think the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a pretty good electric tooth brush</li>
            <li> This is good for first time electric toothbrush users.  </li>
            <li> It would spontaneously turn on and not brush for the full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> recommend this because of the excellent cleaning power, gentleness on my gums and the long battery life.</li>
            <li> Awesome, wished I would have bought it a long time ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> Once I used my first Sonicare, I loved it.</li>
            <li> First the good news.</li>
            <li> And it makes sure I do the full 2 minutes every time!  </li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is better than the original that lasted many many years.</li>
            <li> and I feel there is no other electric tooth brush that can do a good job on an ex-cigar smoker&#x27;s teeth !</li>
            <li> No matter, I got my new handle, it worked great - for ONE day.</li>
            <li> She is so happy to have this new one.</li>
            <li> The new design, lighter, thinner is great.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;easy clean\\&quot; seams to give the most bang for the buck .</li>
            <li> I was concerned about it fitting to the back of my mouth to clean my wisdom teeth, but it reaches great!  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts more than two weeks on a charge and its motor is as strong as ever.</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and since using the Sonicare I have been getting perfect reports from my hygienist, gums pink and healthy.</li>
            <li> Pair this with a good foaming toothpaste, and you&#x27;ll love the results just as much.</li>
            <li> Really light, powerful, good battery life, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy and a good rechargeable toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, reliable, practical, and it is quite effective.</li>
            <li> Very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> And it is, in fact, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and clean.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product, motor is very powerful and leaves my teeth feeling like I just left from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase so far and the 2 year warranty doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> He has been very happy with it and wanted the same brand because he liked it so much!</li>
            <li> Philips new and smaller but powerful Electric Toothbrush is wonderful - easy to pack and handy to use to keep your teeth healthy and bright</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really, really clean after I use this!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using this!</li>
            <li> my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li> Teeth get really clean!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what you buy a toothbrush for, to clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Easier to clean!</li>
            <li> After using Sonicare Elite for more than 10 years, I find this model just fine.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so clean!</li>
            <li> My mouth has continued to feel dentist clean!</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel almost as clean as from dentist!  </li>
            <li> My teeth feels squeaky clean after each brush!</li>
            <li> is that it is clean!</li>
            <li> Teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> This is the best - not that I&#x27;ve used other brands or anything, but sure beats manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I loved my original Sonicare, which I used for years, and I also loved the original brush heads, but I feel cheated by this new model.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, but not as handy or nice as older models.</li>
            <li> The compactness of the toothbrush and its charger are wonderful - much easier to store and travel with than older models</li>
            <li> Awesome clean that lasts until my next brushing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is great tooth brush, very easy to use, an internal timer lets you know when to change quadrant.  </li>
            <li> ,super clean!!</li>
            <li> Very effective at cleaning but so loud it can be heard 2 rooms away!  </li>
            <li> This thing is light and slim, a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> The product worked great but completely died after just over a year.  </li>
            <li> This led to greatly noticeable reduction in action intensity, sometimes over days time.</li>
            <li> The battery is also working great by far.</li>
            <li> The more signal that&#x27;s applied, the louder the sound.  </li>
            <li> I have used an old style Sonicare brush for about 10 years with great results.  </li>
            <li> Probably best value for money electric toothbrush that comes with the minimal functions that you will need.</li>
            <li> The slender handle is more comfortable for me to hold.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> After combing through the reviews of Sonicare brushes, I decided that the Easy Clean was the best option for my husband and I because it had the following features:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> and it perhaps is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the most important part of a toothbrush is how well it cleans teeth.  </li>
            <li> As others have helpfully pointed out, this is the lowest price point into the most advanced brush heads.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen the light.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, upgraded from the old e series.</li>
            <li> The brushing &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; was greatly diminished and it made a loud noise.  </li>
            <li> Happy to see that both of it is fixed now.</li>
            <li> the two are making a great team so far</li>
            <li> I enjoy the sensation of the brushing much more</li>
            <li> Brushing has never been so effective or fun.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product works really good</li>
            <li> The good check-up probably has something to do with genes, but I really believe this toothbrush helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price; fast service.</li>
            <li> It also earned a rare apology for my loving wife.</li>
            <li> but like it so much I felt a review was a good idea.</li>
            <li> It becomes a good habit fast.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth good.</li>
            <li> Has a good feel to it and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare HX6511 Easy Clean Toothbrush as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves it!  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Very good when it worked, but after about a year the motor made a whining sound and no long turned the brush head.</li>
            <li> I called again today, spoke to a very nice young man by the name of Cody.</li>
            <li> It is better than the original Sonicare I had years ago.  </li>

            <li> Solid construction and a good buy!</li>

            <li> Easy Clean.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This brush is easy to use.  </li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lighter, faster charging and most of all, the toothbrush heads stay CLEAN because&lt;</li>

            <li> The brush head is easy to remove for cleaning.</li>
            <li> it almost felt like I was cheating because it was so easy</li>
            <li> and I just love the slim handle and the easy to install and clean attachment that doesn&#x27;t let toothpaste, saliva, water, etc.</li>

            <li> It is reliable and it is easy to take the brush off the unit for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth look and feel.  </li>

            <li> Anyways easy to use and</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel, and since I&#x27;m genetically predisposed to lots of dental problems I like to do everything I can for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy to understand instructions.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling this brush gives me.</li>
            <li> but....it tip over on its side too easily.</li>

            <li> I got it because 1) I wanted to make sure my teeth were as clean as they could be 2)</li>
            <li> Easy to assembly, easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time I&#x27;m finished with the toothbrush, I wipe the brush head with my towel and pull the brush head off and wipe the top of the toothbrush body to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> Easy on my gums.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Sonicare Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> How can my wife and I share the unit easily?</li>
            <li> It is as advertised, easy to use, easy on the gums and can reach everywhere</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended Sonic Care as the way to keep my mouth healthy any my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> were too easy to accidentally push when you were using it.  </li>
            <li> but then I read the product info and saw there&#x27;s an easy start feature that gradually increases power over 14 uses.</li>
            <li> I have healthy gums and clean, tartar-free/plaque-free teeth (according the my dentist, not just myself).</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, is easy to use and well made.</li>
            <li> I bought the Easy Clean after reading many helpful Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I chose whis item and when I charge it over night, the battery dies out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare Elite, which died after many years of good service.</li>
            <li> Too strong.. Need something with another setting</li>
            <li> Like lighter handle and strong motor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older Sonicare model for about 3 years and when I saw the good price on this one, bought it.</li>
            <li> Nice, simple electric toothbrush at a good price.</li>
            <li> The wireless charging stand is handy and makes keeping the whole thing clean very easy.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I now know I should have been using one a long time ago, and this one seems very good.</li>
            <li> Since switching from a manual toothbrush my teeth feel much cleaner and my gums look very healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I did and see a real difference over the cheaper electric brushes.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a product they developed called Clarisonic and my skin is now amazing!</li>
            <li> All in all, so far it has proven to be a nice electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> : the carrying case is nice in the higher end models, but I can&#x27;t stand the fact that, on the premium models, you have to press the button 3+ times to turn the brush off when you&#x27;re done (or stand there with your finger depressed 2+ seconds waiting for it to shut off.)</li>
            <li> far as a toothbrush goes, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic shell is much better than the original rubber coated version.</li>
            <li> This model is slim and feels good in the hand; the older model felt like a vintage hot rod, great at what it was supposed to do but lacking the tightness that comes with modern engineering.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel very clean after a brushing and the unit itself stays clean too.</li>
            <li> Love it, very powerful and gets your teeth really clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely love the toothbrush, its worked flawlessly for the past year.</li>
            <li> brushes just fine.</li>
            <li> It was rated the best several years ago when I purchased my first one.  </li>
            <li> but once you are used to it, it feels absolutely fine</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to fit on any vanity.</li>
            <li> the plus side, contacting Philips to get a free warranty replacement was easy (it&#x27;s a 2 year warranty).</li>
            <li> I am totally fine with everything about it.  </li>
            <li> The previous reviews were so helpful in choosing the best product for me.</li>
            <li> , I found out the replacemente heads for ProResults also fit the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a fine product and when my daughter told me she was in the market for an electric toothbrush I purchased this for her knowing how well it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li> For about half a year, it worked great!</li>
            <li> worked fine for a year, and then it just died.</li>
            <li> Slim design makes it easy to fit in toothbrush cup.</li>
            <li> Great product for those who have a tendency to over brush - prevents further receeding gum line while giving a healthy clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to tell by the light on the handle when it&#x27;s charged and when it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> The one (quick) learning curve was remembering to keep your mouth shut when the brush is on!</li>
            <li> I feel confident that all parts of my mouth are getting adequate attention during my tooth brushing activity.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to be loyal to sonicare!</li>
            <li> it is light weight and cleans good and clean up is easy as the brush head does not get any paste in the brush connection to the main body.</li>
            <li> Nice tidy, small design, with good agitation.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps on the cleanliness of my mouth for sure!</li>
            <li> Almost as good as a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> Heads are easily interchangeable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, handle is easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the same features as the e-series, including the quadra - timer thing (hesitates every 30 seconds and stops after 2 minutes) but is easier and more pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean, easy to get replacement brushes, and it holds the charge for days.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth for longer duration and more frequency because it&#x27;s fun and easy.</li>
            <li> My new dentist said Sonicare is best, and so I switched back, and realized how much better</li>
            <li> Super easy and supper clean!  </li>
            <li> This design is far more elegant and easy to maintain and the cleaning is easily as good (likely better!)</li>
            <li> And, the best part: it works well, holds a charge, and requires little maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from the older design, which built up a funny odor.  </li>
            <li> Huge step forward for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Sonicare fan.</li>
            <li> This thing is a Huge pain...</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in my oral health.</li>
            <li> been 4 years and still on the same battery and no cavities ... a great investment ...</li>
            <li> Hold lightly to the teeth as advised by my dentist</li>
            <li> I chose this model because I liked how much cleaner this one was.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these electric toothbrushes were worth it, but now I know they are.</li>
            <li> Replaced my $20 O ral-B with the Easy Clean model.  </li>
            <li> It works great, but takes a while to get used to, the noise level is low as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Sonicare and specifically the Easy Clean model was recommended by our hygienist and seconded by the dentist when I spoke to him about</li>
            <li> Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> When used properly, it is great for plaque removal that is gentler than brushing manually, especially for anyone with gum recession and exposed roots.</li>
            <li> Great standard eletric toothbrush, no bells and whistles</li>
            <li> I use this with Brushing Rinse (sometimes available on Amazon, sometimes on Vitacost),</li>
            <li> It is light and slender.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, just pop the head off and rinse.</li>
            <li> so customer service was great, about 3 months later it happened AGAIN.  </li>
            <li> None was available.</li>
            <li> So happy I got this easy clean model and not the standard.</li>
            <li> With all the brush heads now available</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need the fancy $200 brush unless you just want to shell out that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> Overall happy with purchase, no cons I can think of.  </li>
            <li> Works great, keeps my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist after having my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would seamlessly fit together</li>
            <li> and they work fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Now it makes a buzzing sound and the brush head wobbles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and the 30 second pulse for even brushing is great.  </li>
            <li> With the Easy Clean heads, they eliminated that problem.</li>
            <li> I already like brushing my teeth and this electric toothbrush make it even more fun.  </li>
            <li> They work great  - they do occasionally die</li>
            <li> Some didn&#x27;t even fit and kept coming off and the longest use I got from any of those was probably 1 week before they started to come off in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for the price and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The function that I find most useful is the two minute timer.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my son who is extremely happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that gives thorough and deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the more powerful one and would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Easy clean is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> Keeping the brush, the replaceable head and the charging station clean is easy.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is utterly fantastic.</li>
            <li> Almost all of the available brush heads fit this model except Essence of course.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a FANTASTIC product and you will not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> This is great, I like that it has the 30 second intervals to remind me to change positions.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how fabulous this brush is.</li>
            <li> but it is fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is the cheapest model that has all the important features.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of replacement heads, also, which are readily available.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it and it definitely will get all the gook out.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> /&gt;These do a fantastic job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well, and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I sound like a shill for the company, but I don&#x27;t think they need any help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> Great product, like the smaller brush head and the way it attaches!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Easy clean from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So I returned the Easy clean to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This model is simple and great to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for weeks on one charge and has a light to indicate the charge status.  </li>
            <li> It felt fantastic.</li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter and so smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, great buy.</li>
            <li> It does sound a lot like the dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
            <li> But five stars for making an essential improvement--and it was always a great brush.</li>
            <li> The quarter timed signals are great for pacing when to move on to the next step of brushing.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> and I like to travel light.</li>
            <li> It is the basic model and does a great job.</li>
            <li> replacement brushes are readily available.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded from the Sonicare Essence to the Easy Clean model almost a year ago.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush and charger are light and compact.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is cost effective and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate because the unit has a 2 year warranty</li>
            <li> Reliable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Phillips offered to replace it for free but that took a month</li>
            <li> The charger is tiny and is also great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More powerful and thorough brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The EasyClean is great and very simple to use.</li>
            <li> Several of the reviews for this model mentioned a simplified handle-to-brush connection that greatly reduced the opportunities for gunk build-up like they had experienced with various brands/models.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean and keep that way.  </li>
            <li> I does a fantastic job.</li>

            <li> This was a fantastic splurge and I will from here on out buy this toothbrush for myself.</li>
            <li> the Easy Clean — </li>
            <li> You can buy DiamondClean replacement heads and they will fit this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight; easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> you don&amp;#34;t need all the different speeds, this works great.  </li>
            <li> The problem with THIS product--the reason for the review delay--was that the head didn&#x27;t fit quite fit flush to the handle</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> Easy clean heads compared to the e-series.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> all the bells and whistles, so this one filled the bill.</li>
            <li> I like the lightweight handle and easy clean feature..</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cleaning and in the spirit of full-disclosure, this is my second Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013</li>
            <li> I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here</li>
            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Good price and offers everything I need in a Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and says her teeth feel super clean after each use. :)</li>
            <li> Love the super clean feeling the ultrasonic waves give you.</li>
            <li> It is more compact and the brush heads are much better, there is not as much gunk that builds up around the brush head.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 8 year old who was not doing a good job with brushing.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> It had a Lithium battery which is far superior to the NiCad of the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me this was the deciding factor and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I called Philips directly, and the cheery woman on the phone explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to beep.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to love this toothbrush as much as I loved my other Sonicare, but I love this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my new Sonicare, and am grateful for my hygienist&#x27;s advice.</li>
            <li> The price was right; even Costco couldn&#x27;t beat it :)</li>
            <li> and I love how it automatically times itself for the right amount of recommended brushing time.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying for the whole family now!!!</li>
            <li> Price, quality and fast service !!!</li>
            <li> is very useful</li>
            <li> It worked very effectively which make my tooth white!</li>
            <li> but I find it very useful and after a while</li>
            <li> We also received the kids one as a gift and find it very fun to get them to brush.</li>
            <li> It is very nice to use because of being slimmer and also having the 30 second timer that tells you to brush the section of your teeth !</li>
            <li> Works great and makes my teeth feel twice as clean as traditional brushing.</li>
            <li> While I think my teeth are equally clean using either brush, I do prefer the Easy Clean for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product gives an excellent clean and yet is not too harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> At almost 30 years old and now having braces, I knew i needed a good toothbrush to help keep EVERYTHING clean in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great for brushing my teeth and seems to be doing a much better job for tooth brushing than the conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> After brushing with this thing for the first time, my teeth felt very smooth along the gum line.</li>
            <li> Very light, easy to maneuver, much improved brushes.</li>
            <li> This cleans better than my old electric tooth brush - keeps the charge and the timer is great for remembering to move to a new section</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how clean my teeth feel after using my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stop feeling my teeth with my toungue because they are so clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nice improvement over the older model.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does an excellent job in breaking up plaque and cleaning in areas that a normal toothbrush simply can&#x27;t get to,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and tremendously beneficial for dental care.  </li>
            <li> The main shaft became wobbly, and it would not brush effectively.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick and thorough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch the debris like the older brush &amp; is a nice size.</li>
            <li> The process was quick, easy, and efficient.</li>
            <li> More than a year later of using this product, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t take space, I like this slim design, it looks cool.</li>
            <li> This design with the new head is much better!  </li>
            <li> All I need for gleaming, whiter teeth is the magical sonicare brush itself, thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> Well the Easy clean is like a massaging brush rather than full power clean.  </li>
            <li> About a year ago my parents sent me an electric toothbrush (&lt;$20) because they were impressed with new ones that had recently tried.</li>
            <li> happened to have timed the delivery of this new toothbrush perfect, because i got it the same day I got my braces on.</li>
            <li> It charges easily,  handle allows a good grip, cleans well  and is quiet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always heard how Sonicare made great toothbrushes with a loyal customer following but never wanted to spend &amp;#</li>
            <li> The really nice design feature is the easy push-on / pull-off brush head as opposed to the threaded collar connector on the old style.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to brush for the recommended 2 minutes and my teeth are super clean now.</li>
            <li> This new one has an even better design, in that the top just snaps on, so it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> These are so quiet and just make my teeth feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes for over 6 years and have never had a problem.  </li>
            <li> Some more expensive models have more bells and whistles, but I feel like this perfectly meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> I love every feature of this toothbrush and it performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It had been two years and one month from my original purchase.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference in my gums (improvement) within a week.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> And when I emailed to get a warranty policy on this product, I was expecting a straightforward answer like &amp;#34;it does not have a warranty&amp;#34; or &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush since the original model appeared on infomercials in the 1990s.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if your interested in making a wise investment in your oral health!</li>
            <li> Higher models offer more LEDs and fancier bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I love this unit.</li>
            <li> In the case of the original Sonicare Elite, the brush head acted like the speaker cone and the voice coil was contained in the handle.  </li>
            <li> I have been an avid use of Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money !</li>
            <li> This fits the original charger and UV sanitizer, plus the refill heads I had in supply.  </li>
            <li> had I realized the significant improvements they made over the years.</li>
            <li> My old one died and the lure of one not building plaque and gunk very appealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I had the original sonicare (with the split brush head) for 8 years before it died on me.</li>
            <li> First off, I love the Sonicare and even my hygienist agrees that my teeth are cleaner and my cleanings always go without a hitch.  </li>
            <li> This forces you to focus on exactly where you are brushing, to make sure you don&#x27;t &#x27;run out of time&#x27;.</li>
            <li> So, has anyone found a significant difference?   </li>
            <li> I originally rated this product one star, because when I looked online for replacement heads, I couldn&#x27;t find them.</li>
            <li> I never thought i would get excited about a toothbrush but these sonic toothbrushes are something else.</li>
            <li> used oral B&#x27;s sonic toothbrush in between my original sonciare and</li>
            <li> I had the original Philips Sonicare toothbrush for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this version of the SonicCare in the past and it is the best.</li>
            <li> No gimicky features, just a straightforward electric model.  </li>
            <li> As long is lasts, I&#x27;ll be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This replaces my original Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> You will notice a significantly cleaner feeling than your manual brush.</li>
            <li> This product has brought *significant* improvement.</li>
            <li> Made a significant difference since I switched from manual tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> After the first week of using this, my teeth did feel more clean.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Brush is powerful and easy to operate - but most importantly it cleans up much better than my old brush.</li>
            <li> It did a very good job when it worked, but with a two year warranty, it should not have stopped in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean, the battery remains charged for a long time, nice selection of brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product - brushing is easy and effective, it&#x27;s small and light and reasonably easy to keep clean, and never we&#x27;ve had any issues keeping it</li>
            <li> I think the product does a nice job cleaning teeth, but my Sonicare became so noisy over a months period that I&#x27;m returning it for a new one.  </li>
            <li> My new toy arrived in two days nicely packed just like Christmas.  </li>
            <li> My new one is great, and the removeable head doesn&#x27;t gunk up like my older one did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great toothbrush that I see myself continuing to use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Seems like it should keep the brush head clean.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day to help keep my teeth feeling dentist clean.</li>
            <li> We bought 4 to give as gifts because we like how they clean our teeth.</li>

            <li> This toothbrush delivers on its promise to clean teeth at home like never before.  </li>

            <li> My teeth feel dentist clean after use.</li>
            <li> My teeth haven&#x27;t been this clean since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I think it is worth getting the Easy Clean because it has the beeps to mark 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> my dental tech recommended a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; one,this was far cheaper than the best brand at a big box store!  </li>
            <li> well of course, but the purpose of this brush is to actually clean your teeth not rub them manually.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say that the Phillips Sonicare HX6511/50 made me a better human being.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the 2 minute timer, my teeth were clean.  </li>

            <li> model has a lithium ion battery that is more advanced than NiCad batteries found on Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion; while both brushes are very close in performance, and both are far superior to any manual toothbrush Sonicare, particularly this model is slightly better than the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and my oral hygienist used to comment about how clean my teeth were.</li>

            <li> My teeth feel so clean after I use this product.</li>
            <li> One note to make is that I opted to splurge on the diamond clean heads because I like dimension in my brush.</li>
            <li> clean dentist feeling&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth clean anymore after having used this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Teeth never felt so clean...</li>
            <li> The teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean (a good improvement from some previous Sonicares).  </li>
            <li> Liked my first Easy Clean purchase so I going to replace my sons older model that is prone to mold.  </li>
            <li> was a nice adjustment for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> As long as the innards last, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great, can buy replacement heads of various types and firmness right here on amazon.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Easy Clean is very basic but does a perfect job at making your teeth feel clean and look pearly white.</li>
            <li> and I love the new slimmer easy to clean design.</li>
            <li> I had the original Sonicare for several years and loved what it did for my teeth.</li>
            <li> More quiet easy to hold better on gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth certainly feel cleaner and most assuredly are cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I never once used any of the special cleaning modes when I had the Flexcare model, so this one made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - i made the right choice!</li>
            <li> will send the information to the right department to get this resolved!  </li>
            <li> It worked fine, but did not have a detailed battery meter like my first.  </li>
            <li> This seems to clean much quicker to to the much more rapid vibration than the Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love it, don&#x27;t have to pull it apart to clean which saves so much time.</li>
            <li> A couple of times I have even brushed twice because it just feels so good to have really clean teeth.</li>
            <li> It just works to clean my teeth thoroughly, and really feels refreshing in the way it sort of massages the gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more compact style and much easier to keep clean design</li>
            <li> I hardly take the time to write reviews of things I&#x27;ve purchased but this toothbrush is awesome.</li>
            <li> This one does a better job, feels better in my mouth (it&#x27;s much slimmer), and is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the Philips Sonicare with more settings to choose from a little better</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because I was happy with what we had been using, but I took a chance bought the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> Having read almost all of the reviews from other users,I concur that this model,the easy clean is the best choice for those that want the most updated version with the new design brush,without spending the extra money for stuff most people would not use.</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> If you want Bright White just brush</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about the blinking light during charging.</li>
            <li> Simple but good.  </li>
            <li> ; I doubt I was putting in the full two minutes dentists recommend with the Spinbrush.  </li>
            <li> I keep going back to my good ol&#x27; manual hand held toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read many online reviews about maintenance on the brush/body of the toothbrush and am pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;ve remodeled to keep clean and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> One tip I learned from the beginning was not to leave the brush on the charger full time - it won&#x27;t keep its charge as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is slimmer, you don&#x27;t have the cup where the brush attaches which quickly gets slimy where you have to use bleach or peroxide to clean bacteria.</li>
            <li> have owned Sonicare toothbrushes and loved them but this model was a thinner style and didn&#x27;t last over 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush, loved it at first, and it worked really well in the beginning..</li>
            <li> That means once it&#x27;s at full charge, I can put the charger away and not have it cluttering up space.</li>
            <li> Also makes me brush the full 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I loved it but couldn&#x27;t justify for a toothbrush that only lasts a</li>
            <li> I like that it is simple with one button and feels good in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a toothbrush, tho.  :)</li>
            <li> you really need all the fancy modes, of course you can spend more money.</li>
            <li> so charged it a full 24 hours and no difference.  </li>
            <li> Buy the full size version and NOT this one</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene, I have noticed an overall improvement since I started using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have used sonicare for many years and am very satisified.</li>
            <li> This has a cool feature that works you up to the full power.</li>
            <li> This is a good tooth brush and I must like it because this is the second one I have used.</li>
            <li> There is a good comparison chart in the product description where you can check out the various models.  </li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I was dubious as to whether I really wanted the quad pacer, but I am really glad I went for the model with that feature -</li>
            <li> What I like most of all is the how much fresher my mouth feels after the toothbrush does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> It actually feels really good.</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t have the screw on toothbrush head, cleaning is much easier and there aren&#x27;t as many crevices to get gunked up.</li>
            <li> their recent discontinuing RQ12 shaver head, they are still doing a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it so much that I can&#x27;t wait to finish this review and go brush my teeth.    </li>
            <li> It cannot be re-inserted to restore full functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also own a 10 year old Essence Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It used to really bother my husband but after a couple of weeks he didn&#x27;t even think about it any more.</li>
            <li> the one function on the HX6511/50 is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Decided to take the plunge with the HX6511 after reading numerous good reviews regarding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> Also, without seeing this product, i was unsure about the size head (compact or full) to get.</li>
            <li> It is smaller in diameter than the old Sonicare 4300, but BOY does it ever do a great job of brushing... even better than the 4300...</li>
            <li> a verry good product in itsself but Not the total job a sonic can do.</li>
            <li> but I end up with a mouth full of liquid toothpaste, water, saliva mixture with zero bubbles.</li>
            <li> What they say is true: Since I&#x27;ve used Sonicare, I&#x27;ve had A+ checkups from my dentist every time.  </li>
            <li> Now, it should run at full power.</li>
            <li> love it so much</li>
            <li> The head is smaller than one would expect, but for good reason--precision cleaning.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thinner in design, holds a charge for way more than a week before needing recharging and the brush is now just the brush head.</li>
            <li> Good quality works well the second one I owned</li>
            <li> I feel like this feature really helps me make sure I am getting all areas thoroughly.</li>
            <li> At the time, I got a good buy on extra brush heads.</li>
            <li> Such a shame since it was so good for my dental health</li>
            <li> Faithfully cleaning your teeth beautifully (to the point your dentist compliments you on them) and never once letting you down?</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer is a nice touch to evenly distribute the full two minutes among all your teeth!  </li>
            <li> This new model is fabulous, I love it.</li>
            <li> I got a new version, and that was great, but it developed a problem with the motor or something.</li>
            <li> Stays clean; no nasty build up on the brush which was my main concern when looking for an electronic brush.</li>
            <li> The handle is slimmer than the older one, which is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I briefly though about getting the Diamond Clean with the USB charger, which would have been nice, but the case is so huge</li>
            <li> Lasts about 2 weeks on a full charge and charges quick.</li>
            <li> The upscale version has several modes and is a bit of a more elegant design, but costs more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li> This is a good news - bad news - good news story of an excellent brush that conked out on me after only 23 months but was still under warranty and quickly replaced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> My dental appointments are great due to the thorough cleaning I get with this product.</li>
            <li> Sonicare are great toothbrushes and have saved me $$$ in dentist bills due to the thorough cleaning it does.</li>
            <li> I love this new model!  </li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling after use and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> The new brushes may be more ergonomic, easier to care for and lighter weight, but when it comes to cleaning teeth, they&#x27;re no where near as effective</li>
            <li> It cleans well and when you are finished your mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Mouth always feels clean and fresh and tingly after use.</li>
            <li> Makes my teef and mouth reall clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Works better than the older model of SoniCare.</li>
            <li> Super gum stimulation ;+}</li>
            <li> Bought both my son and husband the Healthy White model for Christmas and both love it.</li>
            <li> So much better than the older model.</li>
            <li> I like the Sonicare much better because it feels more like a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a couple of years ago at the suggestion of my dentist since I tend to build up plaque quickly on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The brush runs so quickly that I can&#x27;t control it on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Much more slim and streamlined than the older model I had been using for years.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the older and cheaper version (Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush) where gunk and crud accumulates inside the connection of the brush and the body of the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> However, it moves so quick it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> The smooth plastic of the Sonicare is a bit more slippery, but far easier to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its the best that there is, this is the third one I&#x27;ve owned in 30 years, dropped the last one in the shower and broke it after 7 years.</li>
            <li> The Cybersonic has a plastic interface that wears out quickly if you have a family snapping brushes and flossers in and out</li>
            <li> I would not want to do without this super tool.</li>
            <li> I was careful to charge it fully before its first use, in fact, it worked beautifully until about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I love the sonicare toothbrushes, this one is the more basic model, but it does everything I need it too!</li>
            <li> Most people will not use these extra \\&quot;features.\\&quot; If you need more time, you can turn the brush on again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And this one uses a global charger which makes travel around the world much easier lol.</li>
            <li> Finally, the battery life has been exceptional.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular one again.</li>
            <li> The quadrant timer is super helpful.</li>
            <li> The handle on the Easy Clean is slim and oval and feels so much nicer in your hand than the E series.</li>
            <li> product as described and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> the older models have so many places that hold water that mold would build inside the cavity of the device.  </li>
            <li> There are no impossible to reach nooks and crannies in a cavernous area underneath the brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare, works so much better than regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Easy Clean looks like it should be much simpler to keep in a hygienic condition.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, a quick search on Amazon found one with</li>
            <li> Love the design, love how it performs, and the technical savvy internals.</li>
            <li> My particular favorite, and the one that I continue to use, is the timer feature.</li>
            <li> Phillips required a proof of purchase, luckily I had bought it from Amazon so no problem printing a receipt for them.</li>
            <li> The older one I had before this was better.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare - how many years old now?!</li>
            <li> Slim line of this toothbrush fits better in your hand than older models plus include a travel case for ease.  </li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for 2 months I can safely say I love it much more than the previous model (ESeries).</li>
            <li> This is not resolved many, many months later</li>
            <li> It cleans super well.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a beeping noise but a quick break in the vibrations</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toothbrush that replaced an older version Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> For that reason alone, I highly recommend this simpler model over the more fancy ones.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not purchase anything higher than the Easy Clean, which does just as effective a job.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast durable long lasting toothbrush, I love it, best purchase of my year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much easier to clean than the Sonicare I had before!</li>
            <li> one really makes your teeth and mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I have used an older model for many years, have been very pleased with it, but it finally died.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s actually working fine on both 110v and 220v, makes it very easy to use aboard.</li>
            <li> I have only had my Sonicare for about a month but am very pleased with its performance.  </li>
            <li> You can also put any healthy white or diamond brush head on the easy clean.</li>
            <li> The easy clean, healthy white, diamond series....</li>
            <li> The unique head design, with the magnet attached directly to the bush, produce a longer throw (sweep) of the bristles, resulting in more thorough brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush works 1,000 times better than a normal toothbrush and tells you when to change sides.</li>
            <li> the meantime, I bought one at Walmart and like it very much!</li>
            <li> The vibrating brush took one or two times to get used too, but I feel like this brush does a better job of cleaning my teeth compared to a normal brush.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare with the &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush head is much better and even my dentist friend prefers this style.</li>
            <li> and I consistently get problem free dental visits.</li>
            <li> Like the heads much better than the standard that comes with the easy clean.</li>
            <li> main reason why I purchased this product is because of the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> Upgraded from older model used for over 5 years, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> it cleans my teeth than the old toothbrush, how much quieter it is, how much more comfortably it fits in the hand, and that the design keeps it free of gunk collecting between the head and the rest of the brush.</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid for a new one because it cleans so well.</li>
            <li> This new one feels like it works better.</li>
            <li> Love the new design.  </li>
            <li> I love the new design.  </li>
            <li> These new head designs are so much better.</li>
            <li> You will get used to using it and you won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> Since the warranty was for 24 months, I was able to obtain a new replacement from Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> brush but this new one so much better.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time and does a good job of cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> The previous one that I have does, otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of dental work, this brush is sure to pay for itself many times over in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I really hope the fix for easy cleaning has been made.  </li>
            <li> Very high-speed vibrations make brushing easy and your mouth feels sort of tingly afterwards.</li>
            <li> It also travels easily as it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li> it is much lighter than the e-series and easy to move in your mouth.</li>
            <li> After much researching, I bought this brush a looong time ago and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> It is easy to work and makes a real difference.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have a strong opinion yet.  </li>
            <li> Battery has a pretty good life on it, as I&#x27;ve only charged it 3 or 4 times - maybe once a month it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> It charges easily and cleans my teeth really well.</li>
            <li> The head is smaller and  you can really get around tooth and clean it really good.</li>
            <li> Really works well and is easy to use</li>
            <li> My first one lasted probably 6/7 years, and finally started not working so good.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost and really makes reloading quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Thanks again AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 6 years and my dental visits have been a breeze!  </li>
            <li> The first one I had, had bells and whistles I never used!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m typically pretty &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; but after using my wife&#x27;s toothbrush, I ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li> Oh, and the instant $10.00 off coupon at checkout was a cherry on top!</li>
            <li> I am keeping the new Essence and returning the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner, easy to use, and worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price with none of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models that are pointless features.</li>
            <li> This one cleans perfectly with its single power level, and I can just use it twice if I want extra brushing time.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my clunky old Sonicare with this new Slim, light and handy model.</li>
            <li> , teeth feel really clean after the first use, it gives you that &#x27;&#x27;Just came from a dentist appointment feeling&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time, super streamlined, easy to clean unlike my last model, and does a really good job getting my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a great product.</li>
            <li> A great little brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my little morning joy.</li>
            <li> This is a great little toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After using Sonicare for years I can not stand using a manual toothbrush, the difference is stunning in how clean your teeth feel and general teeth/gum health.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a fancier Sonicare, but this one is better- simple, easy to clean, only takes an inch of counter space, does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush, it beeps every time to move on to a different spot in the mouth and turns off automatically after a certain amount of time (2 min?).</li>
            <li> I bought him the Easy Clean (Cleans White no longer available)</li>
            <li> Smooth and fast.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in a few years and the size has greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and seem to hold a charge very well.</li>
            <li> lol Now,,,,, it did take me a few days to get use to using it, but now , I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using it and my teeth feel very well cleaned.</li>
            <li> I think Pro Results standard brush heads fit the Easy Clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s completely worth</li>
            <li> The head feels MUCH more nimble and easier to get into the corners of my mouth than the old SoniCare Elite.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I was not using an effective toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t flossing enough did me in (soda didn&#x27;t help either).  </li>
            <li> I do wish that it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically after the 2 minutes because I often like to go back and hit the important spots one more time.</li>
            <li> I rarely charge the battery.</li>
            <li> Good design - easier to keep clean that previous models I have had.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said this was not as powerful and insisted he did not have the Easy-start feature activated.</li>
            <li> Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I smile a lot.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on it&#x27;s like a nice low hum where the oral B sounds like you have just started up a lawn mower to go to town on your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare these days to have a product meet the manufacturers claims, and this toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare EasyClean&#x27;s 3 week battery life (brushing 2x daily) is also superior to Oral-B&#x27;s and therefore another reason that Sonicare is better for international travel.</li>
            <li> The cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> Its just not as powerful as the upgraded version.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as powerful as the step-up model, I also have an HX6711.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> electric toothbrush are really fun to use</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is more compact than the old style Sonicare toothbrush (the ones that had screw on toothbrush heads) and it works about as well.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a different kind of toothbrush that does go in circular motions</li>
            <li> Cleaner and fresh.</li>
            <li> rarely say this about technology purchases</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one that I had for years and the design changes make it better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush uses the same type of brush heads, ProResults, which is good since I have replacement heads at the ready.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare really delivers a good cleaning and you can tellright away the difference between a standard toothbrush and the Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads are not cheep for soniccare but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the Pro results brush heads as well as the soft feel.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my elite.  </li>
            <li> Would make a better childs toothbrush than adult.</li>
            <li> Far better than the models with a screw-on head.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to have gotten an extra brush with it.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth the price of entry, no joke.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t speak yet to the longevity of this model, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how much better</li>
            <li> chose it because, for me, the sonicating action is better at removing plaque and food debris from my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money</li>
            <li> Time will tell how this thing lasts but after 2 months it seems to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money to buy again.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve been 3 weeks in between charges and that&#x27;s only because I wanted to charge it.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Philips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes, one for myself and one for my adult son as a gift.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than an old one I was using.  </li>
            <li> Easy clean is the perfect model, top performance without paying for stupid bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Slimmer but powerful like the&lt;br /&gt;larger models.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice narrow profile, easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I kinda gave him the 3rd degree about how nice these are and that it is just like Dad&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I like them both in their own different ways, so I rotate using them.  </li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the hype.</li>
            <li> To protect from further gum erosion, but still effectively fight plaque, I have been using this and like it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem to be worth the added expense.  </li>
            <li> When I bought a second brush so my wife and I could each have our own, I got this model — </li>
            <li> The head is much better and doesn&#x27;t collect gunk like the old ones.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this hurt on so many levels.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is more like a mute buzz then a loud beep.</li>
            <li> All that is really added is a quick clean mode (it just turns of at 1 min instead of 2 min</li>
            <li> Wow,,,,,, i just love this brush.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> So much better than my old fat Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I use a Waterpik brand flosser at night-</li>
            <li> When you get done brushing with this brush, your teeth will be fresh from the dentist</li>
            <li> As far as brushing teeth go still an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Love the slim design not as bulky as the other two and is very light.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, but I feel like they aren&#x27;t very powerful and the headsize isn&#x27;t very big.  </li>
            <li> got a Sonicare tooth brush in 2001, and it’s still going strong, so we had high expectations.  </li>
            <li> but they were more interested in selling a new unit.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is simple and effective, just right.</li>
            <li> I had my original Sonicare (the one with the large head that you had to screw on) for probably 5 or 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I love getting great checkups from my dentist (seriously!).</li>
            <li> If you are currently using the Sonicare E series brush, the Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean is definitely worth the upgrade!</li>
            <li> Better change for better brushing and no inflammation due to bacteria.</li>
            <li> The heads on those have a large collar that gets slimy and you have to take it off and clean it all the time.</li>
            <li> It looks smart, and it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> more like low rumble that shakes your teeth out rather than clean them.</li>
            <li> if you want to keep your teeth as clean and healthy as possible, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and white, my gums are healthy.</li>
            <li> so if you want a better clean - just buy different brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are always left feeling clean and my gums are noticeably more healthier.</li>
            <li> Seems to clean as well as the Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> It clean white design also looks better.</li>
            <li> We had an older fancier Sonicare that finally died and we loved it but never used all of the features.  </li>
            <li> I love that this version is so much cleaner than the older models where toothpaste and water slime leaked into the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The replacement Easy Clean they sent was as loud as the first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter and battery last much longer, also looks nice!  </li>
            <li> Very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a \\&quot;high end electric toothbrush\\&quot; seems the two real decisions are - how many bells and whistles do you want to pay for and do you go Philips or OralB.  </li>
            <li> So with the right toothbrush holder you could feasibly use that still if you are used to having your toothbrush there.</li>
            <li> Start the younguns out right.  </li>
            <li> experience may differ because ever since I bought this tooth brush, I brush right after I eat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a right decision.</li>
            <li> Look at it this way, right now you spend $90 on a toothbrush, it will prevent you from spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist</li>
            <li> the price is right.  </li>
            <li> The 2 minute timer makes brushing for the right amount of time a no brainer.</li>
            <li> These pop right into the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.  </li>
            <li> It is a quality product at the right price.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it has the snap on head not the screw on one.</li>
            <li> and a new brush head when the last one looks like its ready to go to the happy brush after life.....</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare Tooth brush and I can&#x27;t live without it and the trips to the dentist are a lot more enjoyable too.</li>
            <li> The price I paid on amazing was about $20 cheaper than what I saw the exact same product for at Target</li>
            <li> This bare bones model is all anyone needs to maintain a healthy smile.</li>
            <li> This was much easier to clean, but doesn&#x27;t matter if it won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> I like this stlye, Easy Clean, better than my two previous ones.  </li>
            <li> I am now on day 27 and the indicator light is still on steady, indicating the battery still has over 20 percent of charge remaining.</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean and the Interdental brush heads claim to remove 7X as much plaque as manual brushing</li>
            <li> It does clean really well.</li>
            <li> Really leaves your teeth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to clean than some.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the brush is of the same high quality, and the brushing is of the same excellent results as the higher end model.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  </li>
            <li> The new brush design seems to work fine - no icky gunk - and the power of the brush seems more intense than I remember</li>
            <li> highly recommend them as a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was easy to clean but such a short life.</li>
            <li> I liked my old soniccare but this new model</li>
            <li> This is really a great electric toothbrush, much improved over previous styles and models.  </li>
            <li> Better than my previous oral b toothbrush and love the interval timer.</li>
            <li> Feels funny when you first use it, but you quickly get used to it and</li>
            <li> super powerful, i notice my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I wasn&#x27;t sure I could finish brushing because it tickled so much with the high vibrations.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that the new one DOES NOT have the rubber handle that the older one has, which has gotten yellow and mildewed.  </li>
            <li> Always used cheap electric brushes or normal brushes until this.</li>
            <li> I will use them as ordinary toothbrush, lol</li>
            <li> The one size apparently fits many of the Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> It is great for me, as I have small hands.</li>
            <li> is no better electric tooth brush on the market and this one is a great price.</li>
            <li> This model is nice because it&#x27;s so slim and has a long charge life.</li>
            <li> Effectively cleans, it&#x27;s not loud.</li>
            <li> I also own, it goes about twice as long without having to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> With all the different models now available, this model seems just fine.  </li>
            <li> That flosser is a thousand times better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as the other one!  </li>
            <li> 31K vibrations/sec requires some getting used to after our Braun; it tickles the mouth (in the beginning--you get used to it) and emits a very fine mist from your mouth if its open.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this model, especially because it takes up so little space at my sink.</li>
            <li> model feels very comfortable in the hand and extremely convenient to operate, feels like a fine tuned sports car.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This new design is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> and they sent me a new one for free.  </li>
            <li> Cheap replacement brushes (providing you didn&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;free brush&amp;#34; scam where they sent you a new brush each month and charged 6 bucks for shipping) and flosser snap-ins.  </li>
            <li> I went to Walmart and purchased a new Easy Clean and a new Essence.  </li>
            <li> It certainly works!</li>
            <li> latest version has slimmed down the handle significantly, which is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much, bought a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Having a 30 second beep Is such a great feature and makes brushing easier.</li>
            <li> to this Sonicare Easy Clean toothbrush, you definitely should!</li>
            <li> Great product, my second one in ten years.</li>
            <li> The Easy Clean is Philips basic toothbrush  </li>
            <li> There are more expensive models but this has all the features I wanted and works great..</li>
            <li> find the vibrating action of the Sonicare to be just as effective as the mechanical action of the Oral B.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s speedy and really feels like it is getting my teeth cleaner, but I will still keep the remaining handle and floss heads of the Cybersonic until they die completely and then look for more on eBay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly a year now, and cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I did register my toothbrush on the website to ensure if I have any charging,battery or motor issues in the next 2 1/2 years</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Phillips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Sonic Complete died and I wanted a good quality but relatively low cost replacement.  </li>
            <li> We had the previous generation which we loved, but wore out.  </li>
            <li> The Easy Clean is a big improvement.  </li>
            <li> I recently received an upscale version of the Phillips Sonicare so had an opportunity to compare with the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> It easily backs up it&#x27;s claim of being twice as clean as regular brushing.  </li>
            <li> Good buy for less money.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy the newer models like the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> Both brands are far superior to manual tooth brushes and unless civilization comes to an end, I&#x27;m not going back to a manual</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is sleek, the brush removes easily and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk up&#x27; like my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Sonicare brush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth and one charge will easily last 3 weeks (twice a day, everyday, two minutes each brushing).  </li>
            <li> I have only had this brush for about a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I would forego the more expensive one - this one works great.  </li>
            <li> If you want really clean teeth, a highly usable brush, get this one.</li>
            <li> The dental staff is pleased that I am finally getting the right amount of brushing in 2 minutes to improve my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I have not put it back on the charger yet, and it&#x27;s still running fine!  </li>
            <li> Very fast vibration frequency.  </li>
            <li> I like my sonicare very much.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much an improvement--smaller and lighter, with a streamlined design that sheds water.  </li>
            <li> original heads contained a powerful magnet that was affixed directly to the brush.  </li>
            <li> do NOT understand why it is called Easy Clean because it has exactly the same attachment as my Healthy White.</li>
            <li> My raving about this new unit has gotten my kids excited about using one and now I&#x27;m going to order the kids version for them.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this model since it is so much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Buy any other Sonicare but the Easy Clean!</li>
            <li> The brush heads swap out super easily when it&#x27;s time (it also tells you that) and goes forever on the same charge.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months now and it never fails to give me the feeling of nice clean teeth.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one with the 1st costing a little more, But this one is just as good...</li>
            <li> I am using the new Diamond clean brushes with this</li>
            <li> but these new Sonicare heads stay clean and sanitary all the time&lt;</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever and the new Pro Results cleaning head is bigger and seems to clean better.</li>
            <li> but wow what a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement over my old Sonicare (that I stopped using).</li>
            <li> We wanted to make sure it used the same charger and brushes, and it does.  </li>
            <li> rechargable battery lasts a week or two, and our first toothbrush lasted about 5 years.  </li>
            <li> the standard brush heads that come with it were more compact in size</li>
            <li> I splattered toothpaste all over the place the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush upon the recommendation of my dentist, and I am not sorry.  </li>
            <li> Purchased my first about 10 years ago, nothing compares to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is the first brush I had</li>
            <li> I had the first one for about 20 years</li>
            <li> My choppers felt cleaner and polished after the first use.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for after I had a Essence model.</li>
            <li> I used to have a higher end model</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I charged it for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The only problem is there are too many models to choose from.</li>
            <li> In fact it&#x27;s a big lighter which is better.</li>
            <li> I also love the 2minute timer, and quadspacer which keeps me on track on brushing each part of my mouth equally.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare Healthy White quit after 3 years, so I downgraded to this model.  </li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for a couple of years I have not only felt the difference versus using a manual toothbrush, but I ended up having much better checkups during my dentist visits.  </li>
            <li> In spite of the smaller size, the battery life is better.</li>
            <li> I just had to recharge mine for the first time after using for at about 5 or 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> I love the timer which indicates 30 second increments.</li>
            <li> At the higher end, one trusts the toothbrush itself on the OralB and Philips is a wash.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> She said to just get the most simple model, no whistles and bells.</li>
            <li> A feature i love is the timer that tells you when to move from one area of your mouth to the next, it automatically shuts off when the 2 minutes are up.</li>
            <li> The 15 second pauses are more valuable than you would think, helps keep you focused in one area until it&#x27;s time to move on.  </li>
            <li> Bottom front, bottom back, top front, top back.</li>
            <li> and he says it a big improvement over the screw top</li>
            <li> I noticed after about 3 months of using my first Sonicare brush that my teeth looked whiter and felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My first was recommended by a dentist and cost me over $100 with all the features which I never used.</li>
            <li> In purchasing this I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how it would work out as I prefer to brush my teeth in the shower in the morning, and obviously having any type of electric device in the shower can be risky.  </li>
            <li> type feeling for the first couple uses.  </li>
            <li> Much better than her regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I shopped around and Amazon had the best price of all the big and small box</li>
            <li> Have the 4100 model and the Elite Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> I had no qualms about spending the money on another one, and this one works even better than the last.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a present for my daughter after enjoying my first Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as the higher end</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> but i think i can buy sensitive brushes to fit on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it felt like I just came from having my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, if you want to Really take care of your oral health, this toothbrush is great!eat!</li>
            <li> I had the first for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> I am currently using a child-sized battery-operated toothbrush that I paid $3.18 for; it is more my size and speed.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I love the 30 second timer to allow for a thorough cleaning of all four quadrants.</li>
            <li> I wish Philips / Sonicare would stop this practice and be consistent across all countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our first one of these lasted years.</li>
            <li> but it does exactly what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-A smaller brush head for better gum line brushing.</li>
            <li> My inner teeth are cleaned better</li>
            <li> It is also a low profile device that is easy to clean and does not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> I have used a Philps Sonicare Cleans White for two years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t seem to go back to manual toothbrushes, but I love this version.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in 15 years, my Sonicare broke after 1 year of use.  </li>
            <li> I will pay more next time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came on the market.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find the model that used the same brushes.</li>
            <li> Again , that is just me and most likely not the fault of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the first one lasted two months.</li>
            <li> Compared to my 13 year old Phillps this model is a lot lighter and smaller in diameter, but just as powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is his first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> The first I got at the Dentist&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it felt like there was a battle in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This next generation is lighter and has better heads that don&#x27;t collect unreachable mold.  </li>
            <li> This one is the most simple and that was all I wanted.  </li>
            <li> i love that it lets you know when to swtich to a different section and shuts off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Coupled with proper toothpaste, mouthwash, and flossing, I was able to save my teeth before any of the damage became permanent.  </li>
            <li> Great value, long lasting, and will save your teeth and gums!  </li>
            <li> I pressed the button to restart the brushing and it would stop again, make a funny whining noise and that was it.</li>
            <li> Another person sent me an email, I presume even higher up, offering me another handle or a refund.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it</li>
            <li> First one lasted forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100 times better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I have used one (at 74 years of age</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist where they didn&#x27;t say I had inflamed gums and when I told them I was using a Sonicare</li>
            <li> Just be prepared for the oddest sensation on your gums for the first week.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations tickled my mouth at first</li>
            <li> This is my first one..</li>
            <li> This electric does a better job of doing my back molars and it reaches deeper in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> (I used to have a top end Braun and never used its extra modes or features);&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Battery crapped out almost exactly two years from when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I did replace the standard brush head with the &amp;#34;diamond clean&amp;#34; brush heads, which cost a bit more but have denser bristles.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for more than ten years.  </li>
            <li> It makes not only tooth, but also support healthy gum.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that the first didn&#x27;t have the 30-second timer in it</li>
            <li> I have used this more than 1 year and now I decided to give it a review because it suddenly stopped work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> our first one lasted about 5 -6</li>
            <li> If the battery is low,  it vibrates when switching off, and can work for some days more.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush cause it runs so quiet compared to some and</li>
            <li> actually like this one better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I no longer felt ticklish after the first week.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted years.  </li>
            <li> First, mine came with a travel case and two toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was to deactivate the 14 day ramp up system.</li>
            <li> The stopping allows me to add more toothpaste, you can use a dab at a time only with this brush.</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush, and</li>
            <li> I wish it would last food more.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric</li>
            <li> By the way, the first charge on this thing lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I had been using the healthy white toothbrush for years before giving it to my wife and buying this for myself.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are also definitely cleaner because the brush seems to do a better job of getting into nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> Overall pleased with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, powerful, has a small footprint on the counter, and simply feels like it is doing a great job cleaning my teeth,  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I got a Sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> This replaced my first one I bought YEARS ago.</li>
            <li> I,ve used Sonicare tooth brushes for the last 10 or more years</li>
            <li> This is my wife,s first one</li>
            <li> This does leave your gums feeling more stimulated and teeth with a cleaner sensation than standard toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were a joke at first.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get used to; espically if your a first time electronic toothbrush user.  </li>
            <li> I can safely recommend this brush especially to those switching from a manual brush.</li>
            <li> that at first you dont think they will even work.</li>
            <li> I am still using this toothbrush because I think I am doing better for my teeth than the traditional brush.</li>
            <li> THEY HAVE TOO MANY MODELS THAT REQUIRE DIFFERENT HEADS FOR EACH SERIES</li>
            <li> maybe should bought one of the ones a tier or two higher.</li>
            <li> first one I owned (the Elite version, I believe) lasted about 4 or 5 years until it would not take a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> Being sonic, the toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than regular electric brushes with rotating heads ever did.</li>
            <li> i think the design is sleeker and better looking with a smaller stand.</li>
            <li> third Sonicare over the years; keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job very well!</li>
            <li> I love the ease of operation and the simple design to the brush which lets you know when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now owned this brush for several months, and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Lost my first one and immediately got another.</li>
            <li> More maintenance than a regular toothbrush-</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and thought that it was just another toothbrush albeit higher end.</li>
            <li> I had issues brushing with it the first two days as it tickled my gums</li>
            <li> so keeping in mind this flaw in the instructions and making sure to brush your entire mouth, this could be a five-star product.</li>
            <li> Just hope this one lasts longer then the first one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> That means the brush increases power gradually over the first 14 uses.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of the one button on and off, without having to cycle through various modes to turn the thing off, I like the automatic shut off after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I could not recommend it higher -- your mouth will thank you for the investment.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok, so didn&#x27;t want to incure the cost to send it back, but just know that what you receive from Amazon might well be what someone else has returned.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used too as it feels funny at first, but I can see teeth</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes that last for a fairly long time.  </li>
            <li> It may cost more than a standard brush, but I am sure I make it back at the dentist visits now.</li>
            <li> This product definitely cleans our teeth much better than manually brushing.</li>
            <li> Still working many months later.  </li>
            <li> The second one is better, but still turns off too soon at times.  </li>
            <li> I had the fancier version of this, the healthy white, for like 6 years</li>
            <li> I LOVE brushing my teeth with this, and I can&#x27;t stand using regular toothbrushes anymore.</li>
            <li> It is shaped such that your hand slides up toward the top of the brush head and your hand turns the switch off.  </li>
            <li> I have the Sonicare healthy white for myself and this model (which is $20.00 cheaper)</li>
            <li> really these things are worth it.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and the handle is slimmer and fits better in my hand.  </li>
            <li> However, it does perform better than any 10 or 20 dollar unit outside of that one  mis-advertising issue.  </li>
            <li> I love the 30 second beeps that remind you to move to another part of your mouth to continue brushing.</li>
            <li> Also, the first time I used it, toothpaste went everywhere.</li>
            <li> Just had my first dental cleaning since using this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works better than my last electric tooth brush which was an Oral-B.</li>
            <li> and although I NEVER look forward to my dental cleanings, I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic that my mouth will look and feel significantly better at my next appointment!</li>
            <li> May like it even better than my last model!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v used several different styles on Sonicare and it is simply the best toothbrush you can buy.  </li>
            <li> I love the clean I get with this toothbrush vs any other.  </li>
            <li> I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, small footprint in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful to teeth, and I like that soft feeling.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s lighter and more comfortable to hold than previous models.</li>
            <li> older model with the larger brush heads (now sold as the Essence) seemed to be a more solid product, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy to keep clean and</li>
            <li> I share this with my girlfriend and you can easily swap the head much faster than the old design.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier to clean than the older Sonicare I owned.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to clean than the older one I had</li>
            <li> This model is also much easier to keep clean than older models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the earlier Sonicare models with the screw on brush heads, and the new snap on style is much cleaner, the brush itself is slimmer, lighter, and I find more ergonomically friendly.  </li>
            <li> I love Sonicare and this is the third Sonicare we&#x27;ve had thru the years, all the previous models had twist-on heads, which made switching them out very quick and easy.</li>
            <li> so I know I clean each quadrant of my mouth equally and for a full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> For several years i used the sonic care toothbrush with the large screw on top.</li>
            <li> -B&#x27;s rotating round brush heads seem to clean the surfaces facing inside the mouth better, however overall Sonicare seems to be doing a better job and various research done seems to verify that Sonicare is slightly better than Oral-</li>
            <li> Amazing &amp; just as expected!</li>
            <li> My dentist originally recommended Sonicare nearly 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars if it came with more than one head and the plug was a flat style.</li>
            <li> After a full charge, in use it is noticably weaker than my wife&#x27;s Healthy White 710 Sonicare (which in turn is somewhat weaker than my old Sonicare Elite).  </li>
            <li> Ended up buying this after my 10+ year old original Sonicare stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> Since Ive had a sonicare toothbrush for the last eight years, the new slimmer model is really great especially if you have arthritis or any hand pain.</li>
            <li> Also, I will update this review if good or bad things occur (hopefully all good).</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on your teeth, yet, they are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth still feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and so far it&#x27;s a breeze to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Had the old style and it was so gunky to clean.  </li>
            <li> The gap between the brush and the handle was half of the flexcare; it&#x27;s a much tighter fit and more secured.  </li>
            <li> It really is far easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The unit is slimmer than previous versions, which makes it easier to grip; the price was reasonable, and it has the most important feature to me---quadrapacer.</li>
            <li> So far it does leave a clean feeling in my mouth, but I really can&#x27;t say it cleans better until I have my next check-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better by far than the old sonic are.</li>
            <li> wife has the basic Sonicare model and this EasyClean is much thinner, lighter, and hold a charge to safely use it for a week of travel and still have power to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better then my old Sonic Care battery operated unit (My was over 10 years old).</li>
            <li> but this is much smaller lighter, easier to use, and all-around more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> I use this Philips brush on a once-daily basis to achieve a thorough cleaning, and combine with a RADIUS toothbrush for manual brushing several times a day after meals for a quick clean.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the more expensive one I replaced.  </li>
            <li> He initially had a battery one and likes this so much better  that he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it not being ready for him when he needs it. .</li>
            <li> and my wife and I both use it, using our own heads marked with the color rings that come with the extra heads.</li>
            <li> the battery life is excellent, lasting at least two weeks on 2-3 minutes of brushing twice a day</li>
            <li> for a bit more or almost the same you can get the much newer model with the stonger vibrations.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here since this electrical toothbrush has been doing the job perfectly for a few months now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Having already been used to the full power of the HX6950, I felt like the HX6511/50 was extremely weak at first, but I am noticing that it is increasingly getting stronger, so that is good.  </li>
            <li> interesting to note is the fact that the suggested retail price of the replacement heads is nearly identical to that of the older model, although they are not nearly as complex, or costly to manufacture.  </li>
            <li> I have another model for home and after 6 months of use, my dental hygentist was very pleased at how much of an improvement I had made from previous appointments.  </li>
            <li> I find that not only does this brush clean better than a standard brush, but I also use it more regularly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get much gunk like the earlier generation sonicare units with the bigger replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to keep clean, since I&#x27;m one of those people who gets a new brush head very six months.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and ask myself every time I use it why it took me so long to get one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I&#x27;ve only had the device for a short time, I find that I enjoy using it and feel (and see) that I am doing a much better job of enhancing my dental health.  </li>
            <li> I will get more for my money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great upgrade from our last Sonicare--having a snap-on head</li>
            <li> Pretty intense if you&#x27;re used to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s pretty much all you need</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 4 years so we can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li> Cybersonic batteries kept charging fully for many years, I will let you know eventually how long the Sonicare batteries</li>
            <li> (it gradually rises in intensity over a couple of weeks, but still felt pretty intense)</li>
            <li> I want a brush that really challenges my gums; and that is exactly what Sonicare recommends.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if  you are just looking for an electric toothbrush without the need for extra features such as Sensitive, Refresh, or Massage, this toothbrush works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other brands, but I went back to this style and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> After a weeks use I&#x27;m really liking it, seems to do a good job of cleaning, I like the way it stops vibrating for a fraction of a second to tell you when 30seconds is up and to move on to the next section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Then you just plant it on the stand for a night and you&#x27;re good to go for another few months!</li>
            <li> Downgrade isn&#x27;t really the right term because the one thing I really missed with the Healthy White was the pause function which allowed me to rinse my mouth and resume brushing without having the timer completely re-set like the Healthy White did.  </li>
            <li> Mostly the others claim to clean and do not in everyday practice.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a big fan of the quad notification  but for the feeling of how clean these things leave your teeth, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean than my old one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s eliminating plaque very well; and a little more comfortably than with the harder brush head</li>
            <li> This particular model is the cheapest of the new Pro Results Line that has the &amp;#34;Quad-Pacer&amp;#34; function wich makes brushing easy and brainless being that the brush signals you to switch to a new quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Unlike the older models, the new models are much easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> This new one is much lighter, smaller and more powerful then my older unit.</li>
            <li> The head detaches in a very clever way that prevents water  buildup and mold developing.</li>
            <li> Nice that it doesn&#x27;t grow mold inside like the previous Phillips I had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and thin, easy to hold and easy to maneuver around in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> On/off button is easy to access, but not where you are likely to keep accidentally switching it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle fits well in the hand, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and it&#x27;s quite simple to remove/attach the heads (when sharing the unit amongst family members).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice improvement over previous design.</li>
            <li> But this does not equate to less effective cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally I use it more than the two minutes to give myself a deep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been surprised how long the battery charge lasts which is nice.</li>
            <li> Short term quality has been good, long term is to be determined.  </li>
            <li> Much better than older models that were a mess to clean.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts for many brushes on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to rely on a single charge when I went traveling before, but I don&#x27;t have that issue any more.</li>
            <li> switching from manual to electric was smart</li>
            <li> My dentist is always telling me how I have plaque build up at certain areas in my mouth and</li>
            <li> Used an older sonicare and didn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li> Powerful, small handle, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is not a normal electric toothbrush that just cleans better.  </li>
            <li> After a trip to a new dentist, whom I trust, she definitely recommended an electric brush as it cleans so much better.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush with the new slimmer, lighter design, and smaller charger.</li>
            <li> In my case, the brush head fitting became so loose that it kept falling off.</li>
            <li> My dental habits were less than perfect for a few years</li>
            <li> It may be sleeker looking, easier to clean and lighter weight, but it has nowhere near the cleaning power of the older Elite models.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel nice and clean, and I find that instead of switching every other day between regular brush and sonicare, I want to use my sonicare every day.</li>
            <li> I then compared it to my old Sonicare and noticed the vibrations from my old Sonicare are MUCH greater than this new one.</li>
            <li> Stays much cleaner than the elite series I had before but has good brushing strength and a very long lasting battery.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this model to last much longer than the previous one, but functionally it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Quiet and TEN times better at removing plaque!</li>
            <li> It cleans better overall than the original design (particularly the back molars).</li>
            <li> Overall it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine although the battery was starting to fade as it would not hold a charge beyond a week which was a problem on trips.  </li>
            <li> The actual brush is fine</li>
            <li> but I think I could use the regular ones just fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a fine job, but we&#x27;ll see what the next checkup says.</li>
            <li> Those particular DiamondClean brush heads are compatible with this EasyClean model and can be purchased separately; therefore, cleaning performance between the two models are exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing was ready to use right out of the box; came with the body, new brush head and a recharger.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting use to, but it has done an amazing cleaning job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice just seems a little over priced.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m thinking many people bought them about the time I did and are now looking for a substitute, since the Cybersonic 3 is almost identical to the original model and reviews say it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Firstly the inherent &#x27;torque&#x27; in the power cord makes it hard to set it securely on the counter top, it keeps trying to twist away, particularly when the brush is in use.  </li>
            <li> I kept it and use it but wished it had been a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> it says he hardly feels and good for pockets</li>
            <li> I wish I had known this before wasting my good hard earned money on the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit was sealed pretty good from outside, there would be no impossible way to get in and blow dry the inside on a daily basis(you</li>
            <li> I find this to be a great improvement over my prior models for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> Your teeth feel so much cleaner than with a regular or cheap electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I got a whole 10 months out of it.</li>
            <li> Just makes my teeth feel SO much cleaner than hand-brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always ready</li>
            <li> There is also a whole list of types of toothpaste not to use with it.  </li>
            <li> Gets your teeth much cleaner than a rotary brush or manual one.</li>
            <li> The area is sealed so cleaning is much easier.</li>
            <li> two years and still working really well.</li>
            <li> And my teeth are definitely much whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is also much quieter.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over them, haha.</li>
            <li> Tried this one as my old sonicare with the rare earth magnets is failing after 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Went from manual brush to this, and I can feel my teeth much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li> how much my teeth would benefit from buying an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It leaves his teeth feeling very well cleaned.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my counter.</li>
            <li> Mine also came with a carry case, which I REALLY like.</li>
            <li> After charging it for a whole day, it still dies after 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Slimmer handle and really neat.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much yet.</li>
            <li> I give these as gifts often and people tell me their dentist comments on how much cleaner their teeth are.</li>
            <li> Very please with transaction and with item.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a light on the power button that blinks when power is getting low</li>
            <li> For a softer mode, a manual brush with extra-soft bristles (like the Nimbus) is more effective and gentler on the gums, (b) for a \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; mode (just more time), press the button twice instead, and (c) the UV system to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the head by killing bacteria is useless, and provides no real health benefit compared to rinsing the brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Prices are reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> THIS DEVICE REALLY REMOVE FOOD FROM TEETH</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare has enabled me to avoid some dental work and works very well.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EasyClean is cheap without the extra frills</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and after much research I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Much quieter and stronger than the e-series as well.</li>
            <li> I made the purchase after a bit of research and expected better from Philips than what I received.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> The Phillip Sonicare is pricey, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> There are a number of brush heads to fit personal preference and cleaning needs.  </li>
            <li> This one is much nicer and stays charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well</li>
            <li> I really like the slender handle on this model.</li>
            <li> gets my teeth cleaner and fast</li>
            <li> but my gumline looks so much healthier and doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Review edited an hour later: I called Philips at 1-800-682-7664 and they are sending me a free \\&quot;replacement handle\\&quot; to be received in 7 to 10 business days.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It still retains it&#x27;s charge very well.</li>
            <li> However, the real test of a product is how well it is backed by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I asked who would spend this much money for a toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> Reading carefully the manual, it is there, this procedure should not be used... :)</li>
            <li> I do NOT hear any such sound.  </li>
            <li> A real value.</li>
            <li> My checkups improved directly thanks to it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the much slimmer handle.</li>
            <li> and he seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think electric toothbrushes would REALLY make your teeth that much cleaner as I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Really cleans the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The head is extremely fast in a &amp;#34;back-and-forth&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> if the Sonicare brush touches my gums, it is quite gentle once you get used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> charge time isn&#x27;t much of an improvement over what I am used to.</li>
            <li> I have found the battery on almost everything rechargeable does do better in the long run when a full, uninterrupted charge is provided every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charge time no worse than the competition, but</li>
            <li> And it does so without feeling as though it is applying too much pressure or excess scrubbing to teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than what I could get it for at the store and dentist office.  </li>
            <li> When an audio signal is applied to the voice coil (from an audio amplifier), the magnet attached to the cone moves back and forth, generating sound.  </li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B Triumph for a few years and while the Oral-B&#x27;s head is a better shape for your mouth, the action of the Sonicare is far better and gives my mouth a cleaner feel.</li>
            <li> I could not really afford a better model and doing some research</li>
            <li> I really like this..</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare...</li>
            <li> but it works really well</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this.</li>
            <li> My mouth is so much cleaner  </li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS Phillips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning was a tremendous hassle on the older model and part I least liked about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much quieter than some of the alternatives.</li>
            <li> Brush is VERY noisy and really too tall.  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush was better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The design and fit are just what I wanted, and the 30 second &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is also just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The built-in reminder to move to another section when brushing is very helpful.</li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well for 3 years</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner after brushing than they ever did with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be much better.</li>
            <li> Really like the way my teeth feel after using it as well as the additional brush head included.</li>
            <li> I really like this electric toothbrush because I can feel the difference from using a manual one.</li>
            <li> The design is much improved.</li>
            <li> Your whole head vibrates to this thing</li>
            <li> but it was a gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, very convenient to have a signal every 30 seconds to remind me to brush the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this.</li>
            <li> I really like how it alerts you to when it is time to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I had just purchased 14 generic brush heads that fit well with this model</li>
            <li> Really like this.  </li>
            <li> The brushes even hold their charge really well.</li>
            <li> Really cleans and gets plaque between teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush has made my mouth so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like the two minute turn off feature and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want all the extra bells and whistles of the more expensive brushes as I just wanted a great cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (my hand really felt the vibration), but I get a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> i really like the timer on this unit</li>
            <li> I used to brush longer, but now with the stroke speed and the strict timing, my teeth are much cleaner in a guaranteed 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice this change over time, but I guess that is part of the intent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sending it back and moving up to the Healthy White which is only $10 more.</li>
            <li> Will look for a bit smaller head which will fit in all crevices.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I considered giving it 4 stars just to protest the cost of replacement heads, but I guess they are in line with others and it really works well, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a Philips Sonicare Advance 4300 for 10 years, and I really became accustomed to having the quadpacer feature.  </li>
            <li> i really appericite saving myself the work and the heads</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient, who has picky tastes, seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t describe it in detail, but I have noticed it is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I love about this toothbrush aside from it not being as rough on the gums</li>
            <li> so I can gauge how much longer</li>
            <li> Once you start using this you won&#x27;t dislike going to the dentist quite as much and</li>
            <li> Really like and</li>
            <li> but now that I have, I really like it.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so it feels so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so so much cleaner and</li>
            <li> even my dentist has mentioned how much healthier my teeth and gums are.</li>
            <li> but when I just use this toothbrush, I dont have to floss as much.</li>
            <li> It really gets in the nooks and crannies in your mouth and takes out the plaque build</li>
            <li> It cleaned my teeth fantastically twice a day that whole time.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Guess you really do get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> It just leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> and I really like the timer feature</li>
            <li> and I think this toothbrush gets them so much cleaner than a manual brush did.  </li>
            <li> So much for my sonicare fixation.</li>
            <li> After my Flexcare died, I bought this and am even happier -- 1) because I didn&#x27;t pay as much, 2) because the biggest annoyance I had with the Flexcare, hitting one of the mode buttons unintentionally, doesn&#x27;t exist with this one, 3)</li>
            <li> toothbrush is very sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> It makes sure I spent the rightg time on each section of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll explain: I have a son who is a doctor and is very picky about everything.</li>
            <li> Thia one is MUCH easier.  </li>
            <li> Who needs advanced timer functions or multiple modes?  </li>
            <li> This one works really well.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has kept her teeth white and cavity free through all of the orthodontic work she was been through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month or two and really like it.</li>
            <li> the Braun and my teeth are much cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Easy Clean got rid of all of it within a few days and my gums are much healthier.</li>
            <li> Very displeased with spending $70 for something that will break so fast.</li>
            <li> and I are much happier now.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like I just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> After just a couple days  using it my teeth are much whiter and my gums are looking healthier.</li>
            <li> so much happier without settings.</li>
            <li> I am very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Really  cleans your teeth well.</li>
            <li> Much improved.  </li>
            <li> This one is much improved.</li>
            <li> Used to have very tender gums</li>
            <li> Worked very well, for almost two years.  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY GETS YOU TEETH</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> I think it is also helping with my tea stains that I get from drinking so much tea.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The timing mechanism to let you know when to change quadrants is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t vibrate as fast as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is much lighter, there are no areas for water to get into</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li> After hours of research I settle on this model, and I&#x27;m elated (as much as one can be over a toothbrush) at my choice.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into it too much</li>
            <li> I really like the thinner handle.</li>
            <li> Its much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> It has changed me that much.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel sooooo much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> ......once I got used to the intense vibrations.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace the cheap Essence model I had, as the mold and such that was growing in between the handle and the brush head was grossing me out.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> user mode (not so fast and rough)&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> very moment</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this brush really made my teeth</li>
            <li> Works well, really like the timer feature</li>
            <li> After a week my brother says he loves the Sonicare and his teeth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge MUCH longer than an oral b.</li>
            <li> I really like this slimmer model .</li>
            <li> Although sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much, and I do two cycles</li>
            <li> Our teeth feel SO much cleaner now.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> it seems like you don&#x27;t have to use as much toothpaste to get lots of bubbles.</li>
            <li> They look so much whiter and brighter.</li>
            <li> It tickles and buzzes so much</li>
            <li> plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfies with the job that my toothbrush does (just like this one) and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare fan for many years now and this was actually a replacement for an old one.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than my old Oral-B because the Sonicare has:&lt;br /&gt;-Dual voltage for international travel</li>
            <li> This is more like a design flaw, moisture got in and could not get out, tiny wires connect directly to the opening cap....</li>
            <li> Up to 24 hours is normal for a full charge from an almost completely drained battery.</li>
            <li> It also initially works up to full speed the first dozen times or so.  </li>
            <li> My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  </li>
            <li> When it finally died recently, I reluctantly ordered another Sonicare (the Easy Clean model), since many reviews of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes indicate that they are not very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was waiting for this one to arrive, I reverted to my husband&#x27;s old E-series Sonicare and my teeth immediately went more yellow.</li>
            <li> I love how you can purchase extra soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one of this model (my first was lost when American Airlines totally lost my luggage!), and it&#x27;s as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li> The vibration took a few days to get accustomed to but over all  much  more  pleasant than the OralB spin brushes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This new version works just as good, if not better, but doesn&#x27;t have the areas that can fill with moisture and funk.</li>
            <li> Small, light, and easy to hold</li>
            <li> You get used to all of the above pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few other electric toothbrushes, but the Sonicare is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> to its larger size, the older Elite model could contain a more powerful amplifier and I suspect larger batteries to support it.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t exactly come up with new, &amp;#34;innovative&amp;#34; ways to come up with vibrations.</li>
            <li> It was easily cleaned off with bleach and did not return as long as I let the area air out after each use.  </li>
            <li> The design is nice and thin and will be so much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I think I have ever had - which I am sure is due to the fact that it has the timer function as much as the sonic technology.  </li>
            <li> I am a convert to electric toothbrushes, mainly because proper-size manual toothbrushes are no longer available ( a proper toothbrush has much longer brush length.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with the other brush head that was provided but the product was still very loud and the vibration was still a lot more intense than when I first received the product.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B and its timer helped, but it was so hard to tell how long you were supposed to spend in each area, that I probably still sped through (though more effectively than the manual brushing).  </li>
            <li> Really gets my teeth clean and the &amp;#34;Quad pacer&amp;#34; feature forces me to brush for the entire dentist-recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> But in the real world, people don&#x27;t have time or often, the manual dexterity, to dissassemble a toothbrush and clean it with Q-tips (!)</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t collect as much gunk as older sonicare or oral b toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I can get pay back to my molars and clean them really well.</li>
            <li> One time I left the charger unplugged for well over a week and the toothbrush kept doing its job, so the internal battery must be very strong.</li>
            <li> So, now I&#x27;ve upgraded again, to this toothbrush similar to my original Elite.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t bulky like many other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> When it happened the third time, they would not honor it because the warranty was two years from the original purchase.  </li>
            <li> This is my 4th Sonicare toothbrush, having tried most every model since introduction due to dadDDS.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the original model I had for years finally stopped holding any sort of a charge (6+ years).</li>
            <li> I love that that I can just put the DiamondClean brushes on this one without having to spend $200+ on the other.</li>
            <li> Definitely a bit of an investment, but considering what dental work costs, well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> If you compare the two, it becomes immediately obvious that Phillips is attempting to capitalize on the reputation of their original Sonicare, while lowering the quality and increasing their profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their description points out that the brush \\&quot;cleans with up to 31,000 movements per minute\\&quot;, the same as the original Elite model.  </li>
            <li> The higher end models are the same hardware, but with a different outer skin and more software programming.</li>
            <li> The little beep is fantastic at encouraging you to brush each quadrant the full 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after so many years of manually brushing it takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> This is not exactly a controlled study, but I feel this works better.</li>
            <li> believe the Sonicare toothbrushes have significantly helped my teeth and especially my gums over the years.</li>
            <li> Has the exact same brushing vibration stuff as the top of the line model, uses the same heads.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of other people&#x27;s (better) reviews.</li>
            <li> This model is better than the other model I used for years.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers the Sonic brush over other toothbrushes because he feels it cleans better.  </li>
            <li> At first seemed to do a good job, but after a few weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean and white as my regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you is that each up &amp; down movement (sweep) of the brush is much shorter and as a result, nowhere near as effective.</li>
            <li> Using the original ProResults and black DiamondClean heads together (looks really sweet with those by the way).</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my other Sonicare unit which had to be cleaned out several times a week and still wasn&#x27;t all that clean.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both did blind comparisons with brand new brush heads, and the years old healthy white toothbrush is definitely noticeably more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay the extra $20 for the more powerful \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> I got the diamond head replaceable heads now and its like a dentist clean daily.  </li>
            <li> You actually feel the clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth remained clean for a noticeably longer time as compared to regular brushing.</li>
            <li> Stays clean, big advantage.</li>
            <li> The high-frequency work performed by the brush will keep your teeth and gums clean, especially just below the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Like that this is easier to keep clean than the last ones.</li>
            <li> The Easy Clean comes with the handle, one ProResults brush head, a charger and a small plastic travel cap that goes over the brush head.</li>
            <li> makes your teeth so clean, as if you had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve brought it with me on week long trips with no charge and it lasted just fine.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are really clean &amp; like smaller handle.</li>
            <li> It never stayed clean, and just got really gross after awhile.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feels not only clean but massaged.</li>
            <li> The last time I went to the dentist he complimented me on how clean my teeth were.</li>
            <li> With a regular brush, my teeth do not feel nearly as clean</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended it - and I cannot believe the difference in how clean my teeth feel in comparison to a regular toothbrush - also recommended for my gums as well as my teeth.</li>
            <li> It can take some getting used to, but to get your teeth as clean as possible, gotta get one.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years, and when my last one died, I looked for an easier to clean model.  </li>
            <li> The charging time is much faster than the older models.</li>
            <li> Would clean it and it&#x27;d be back in no time.</li>
            <li> just left the dentis office clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to open it up to clean inside.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not complaining, my teeth feel clean afterwards and it has a 30 second timer</li>
            <li> I feel I would either have to use it for 6 minutes or actually scrub in order to get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist when after measuring the pockets in my teeth found that I had several 4&#x27;s; not good as I was told that numbers 1-3 are ideal.  </li>
            <li> No other issues, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean but the metal shaft on the handle came loose only after 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> The Philips rotates so fast that it makes a high pitched hum.  </li>
            <li> I used to not notice the &amp;#34;fuzzy teeth&amp;#34; feeling I would get, but this brush makes my teeth so smooth and clean after every use that I notice when they are not clean!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for better oral care than conventional toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to using it actually, which is an odd thing to say about a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a very new user.</li>
            <li> Amazing how small these have become.</li>
            <li> ; model still has a lithium battery that gives a light feel and lasts a long time on</li>
            <li> We both wish we would have bought these long ago instead of the cheap ones from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I ever brushed for 2 full minutes with a reg brush.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see the need for the Healthy  White since I really didn&#x27;t use the various functions.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised on my first use.</li>
            <li> so I went back to sharing my Wife&#x27;s full size Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> That is only true of the brush head that model comes with.</li>
            <li> (Usually I need to spend an hour to get a replacement for warranty, because they always have some kind of excuse)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love this brush better than the other one I have that is same brand different</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can not do better although the more expensive Sonicare&#x27;s do come with additional features</li>
            <li> These were a replacement for my old electronic toothbrush and they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> so you know to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth, for a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In contrast, the Oral B brush glides easily over and around each individual tooth with no mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to clean, and easy to store on the base.  </li>
            <li> With my old toothbrush I used just to clean all over for two minutes in general.  </li>
            <li> The standard bristles are perfectly fine for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> This breaks your mouth down into 4 quad sections for better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning under the head is very easy, as I imagine it would be under the larger heads, but there is simply very little there to clean.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes, this is your machine!</li>
            <li> It has the quadrabeep feature to tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your teeth but lacks some of the more advanced settings found on the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Make sure you remove the brush and clean under the area under the bottom of the brush regularly because it can get a little yucky under the plastic that attaches to the motor.</li>
            <li> There is no better and easier way to keep your mouth clean and teeth healthy - no other electric toothbrush comes close to Sonicare technology.</li>
            <li> Does the less powerful motor make a significant difference in how well it performs?</li>
            <li> Bad move, the Intercare costs more, but I like the original head better.</li>
            <li> They replaced it with a whole new handle again.  </li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t send a whole new unit because they don&#x27;t have one in their parts department</li>
            <li> Gives a whole new meaning to the term, brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not happy I had to buy a new model, but I am happy with the new model.  </li>
            <li> This new model has a smaller diameter connection head and stays clean.  </li>
            <li> My mouth also feels much cleaner with this new one than with older models of Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I had the top of the line model which broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so much better than the previous model (without the EasyClean heads).</li>
            <li> After Google searching the pros and cons of Oral B vs. Sonicare, I decided more or less on the spur of the moment to try out the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Love this thing durng semi-annual cleanings; much less picking and scraping by the hygenist.</li>
            <li> and she admits it does a better job than her previous brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it could be better except if the replacement brushes were less costly.</li>
            <li> Cleans better than my previous Braun electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It works just as well as the top of the line, just less bells and whistles.  </li>
            <li> The solution for me was to put it in a ziploc since its length prevents me from using it with an older case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every day, twice or more often per day,  we would each switch to our personal brush head and when finished brushing, place it back in the stand.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I see to this brush is that the handle is a bit slippery compared to the matte finish of the Healthy White.  </li>
            <li> I used to have an older model Sonicare that lasted me almost six years.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare that was a gift about 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush - no unneeded bells and whistles like the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> and there are a few good key differences.</li>
            <li> As per the manual, I like to brush thirty seconds in the front of my top teeth, thirty in the back, thirty in the front of my bottom teeth, and thirty in the back.</li>
            <li> If prior experience with this brand is any indication, don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend getting this type of sonicare over the older e-series versions.</li>
            <li> so glad I got this instead of the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lower end models use the older style brush heads.</li>
            <li> got this as replacement for the worn out  older model.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare for years before it&#x27;s stopped charging, so I got this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older unit with this one.  </li>
            <li> Only thing it asks for is a quick charge every once in a while</li>
            <li> They do a decent job cleaning teeth and preventing decay and gum disease, but we&#x27;ve gone through 5 handles in about 6 years.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my older one that stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare and will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Below is a list of the improvements over the older model and why you should switch.&lt;br /&gt;1)  </li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush that lasted for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is quality.  </li>
            <li> It slender for a smaller hand, which my middle daughter had another one, but this one met her needs BETTER.  </li>
            <li> I applied for a rebate after I bought this particular product in April.</li>
            <li> Unlike battery operated toothbrushes that sounds like a mini jet roaring, this brush has a low soft hum like sound.</li>
            <li> Seems weaker than the older versions Essence 5600..</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one of our Healthy White 710&#x27;s that finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> I did order a replacement, which was a bit more expensive, but works much better</li>
            <li> I went with this model over the lower end one mainly because of the timer feature, which helps my brushing habits.</li>
            <li> It performs much better than the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Better than more expensive model of sonicare......</li>
            <li> Main thing---</li>
            <li> This actually makes me want to brush my teeth more often than the regular two times each day.</li>
            <li> I had the fancier version before but found that I never used all the different settings, so this toothbrush is quite adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> My check-ups have improved and it helps with plaque and gums as one gets older.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on the top of the line that had all the different speeds, so I settled for this one.  </li>
            <li> It is very simple to use, although if you read the manual (which I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a quick read)</li>
            <li> , this feature must be disabled after about two weeks of use--it&#x27;s a gentler brushing mode (which is probably why I noticed the very first time that I used it that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel all that clean).</li>
            <li> Lasts longer, but then again I had my original for a long time and it might have gotten shorter and shorter</li>
            <li> One oddity: I&#x27;ve noticed more sensitivity in my teeth after just two brushing (not sure if this has anything to do with holiday eating/drinking or the new toothbrush as that brush moves very fast).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and my dentist highly recommended a Sonicare product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> everything was improved at a time I was eating lots of popcorn and sodas (high school).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It vibrates, pulsates and moves at high frequency as the videos you can see online show, Philips calls it Sonic.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to others.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, I bought one for myself and my son.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They both highly regard the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend getting one of these.  </li>
            <li> I particularly love this Sonicare because it is simple to clean; just rinse it off, dry it and put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone and in fact have already told all my family members and friends that they should get one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but worth it for the clean feeling it gives you.</li>
            <li> Finally, this is more powerful than my previous models.</li>
            <li> Much better engineering resulting in a much more sanitary and less messy brushing experience.  </li>
            <li> Far better than any other low-speed electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> it is noticeably less powerful than the healthy white model.  </li>
            <li> They do not clean any better..</li>
            <li> NO, I need you to send me a whole new, brand new in the box retail unit.</li>
            <li> I hardly use bristle brushes when I&#x27;m without my Sonicare, preferring to spend 20 minutes with a few peppermint flavored birch toothpicks; the kind that eventually fray flat for good surface scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> But Sonicare heads fall off HX6511/50 model after 6 months use of product-try &#x27;shimming&#x27; motor shaft with plastic film-heads stay on a little longer but why go through this bother-just buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has allot of models which seems overwhelming until you do a little research.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if the unit had a little grip to it.</li>
            <li> Just the charger (a little more weight would be helpful for stability while charging), the vibrating unit, and a toothbrush--bare bones, but all we need.  </li>
            <li> (fits in my hand a little better).  </li>
            <li> Seriously: my dental hygienist said I could come back IN A YEAR because my teeth were so great.</li>
            <li> This has a similar action and is easier to keep clean .</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare was the Advanced with the screw on top head, it would get gunky on the inside and bog down because of that.</li>
            <li> Cleans extremely well, easy to hold, can tell plaque is being removed.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the toothbrush is still going strong</li>
            <li> I was a little perplexed by the number of different versions available.</li>
            <li> This will surely cut down on my dental costs!</li>
            <li> Owned many other electric toothbrushes with limited success.  </li>
            <li> It seems as though the manufacturer intended for each user to have his or her own handle - and the price of a single one is considerably higher than the approximately $30 I paid for the original that served us both.</li>
            <li> I got it for him since he has sensitive teeth and an unusual fear of the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been drinking far too much coffee</li>
            <li> Unlike our old one that quit working eventually, this one pauses if too much pressure is on the brush while it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> The real reason I wanted to upgrade was the design of the old brush.  </li>
            <li> Really works well near the gums to remove plaque.</li>
            <li> If you want a Sonicare toothbrush, this is a great one that isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the soft heads for it and have been very</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommends Philips products and didn&#x27;t think all the extra bells and whistles were worth the additional expense.</li>
            <li> I charged it for about 12 hours just in case, then I proceeded to brush my teeth as I normally would.</li>
            <li> But after a few tries it felt much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this after having used a regular toothbrush my whole life it felt like I had just come out of the dentists office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get a few more of these for birthday gifts to my kids</li>
            <li> I have had Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and before I got the fancy one they all lasted a few years.</li>
            <li> Our first one lasted at least 5 or more years.</li>
            <li> She is enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li> When it worked I liked I would give it four stars, but for how expensive this is I expect the battery to last more than two years.</li>
            <li> worth mentioning, I stay in Singapore, Philips only offer shipping to US or Canada.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a timer to make sure you brush your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li> Though the handle is more expensive, the Pro Results replacement brush heads for the Easy Clean are cheaper than the e series heads, saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this one will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Given that my first one did not last much beyond the warantee, I recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the fancier models again.</li>
            <li> I like the speed  and cleaning of the Sonicare better than the Oral B, however, the handle gives me trouble.  </li>
            <li> I am using the normal head, though my set came with a diamond head as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a top of the line model I had for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand.</li>
            <li> If you want to have teeth that look, feel and are clean, get this line of Sonicare toothbrush (there are other Sonicare toothbrushes of the same design with more bells and whistles such as the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush).</li>
            <li> you are new to electric toothbrushes I highly recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly doubt there&#x27;s anything new I could add</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought a cheaper (non-Sonicare) model and while that brush did seem to reduce the amount of tartar/plaque that built up between cleanings, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as this one.  </li>
            <li> The new unit is much smaller and lighter overall than the old unit making it more convenient to maneuver around your teeth.</li>
            <li> This model is much easier to keep clean (the other one could grow mold on the inside) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to clean than other electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, this is much easier to clean and maintain without having buildup on the item.  </li>
            <li> After the first few brushes, your teeth feel funny from the strong vibrations that you dont get from a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> The other two were impossible to keep clean, so I gave it one more try with the Easy Clean.  </li>
            <li> The switch seems to be more sensitive than the switch on previous Sonicare models I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I often developed tartar rather quickly on the inside of my lower front teeth despite mouth washes and regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I have occasional dry mouth which cause more plague buildup</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes some getting used to--the action of the sonic bristles tickles the gums but they do a far better job cleaning teeth than other brushes (battery powered or muscle powered) I have used.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel clean, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same kind of cleaning as I would with a different product.</li>
            <li> It comes with several pre-programmed settings right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Although I like the design of the Easy Clean, the battery power is incredibly weak vs. the Essence.</li>
            <li> I especially like the 30 second timer (for each quadrant) that really helps get my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean very well, but last only 7months of use (2 times/</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Sonicare user for a long time.</li>
            <li> My outside teeth was clean but the top of my teeth was yellow-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this, half of the yellow has come out and my teeth are whiter than before using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, convenient, and its small enough for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> The very small brush head and powerful strokes effortlessly removed every last bit of food and it was very comfortable even as I worked the very corner of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That still worked fine except the battery would only last 2 or 3 brushing</li>
            <li> They clean in exactly the same way as the basic model (same brush, motor, charger), but have options that are largely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No added &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; like other Sonicare brushes but rather, a huge step up from our Oral-B battery operated electric toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Before spending money on a new model, I called the Sonicare number, which was picked up by Sahim, whom I could not hear.</li>
            <li> Packaging is minimalist, akin to receiving the new Apple products.</li>
            <li> When I needed a new electric toothbrush, I asked my dentist which one I should buy.</li>
            <li> This new model builds with intensity over time, making it easier to get used the vibration.</li>
            <li> You can use the new diamond brush head on this model.</li>
            <li> and then there&#x27;s new style.  </li>
            <li> but this toothbrush has taken it to a new level.  </li>
            <li> So hoping this one will live a looong time.</li>
            <li> I like the slimmer profile and new attachment</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 5 years and had about 16 new brushes.</li>
            <li> Live the interval timer.</li>
            <li> They do send you a new handle,  </li>
            <li> Six new handles</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim for something new to try out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my new one for about 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> the new one did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I live in Lihue, HI, and couldn&#x27;t find it on the island nor could I get it mailed to Hawaii through Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> is still THE toothbrush to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Retails at approx $80, it uses the new brush socket unlike the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> which though cheaper at $50 cannot use the new brush heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> New head doesn&#x27;t get all gunked up.  </li>
            <li> It was time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> DID A LOT OF RESEARCH TO FIND A NEW MODEL THAT COULD USE THE STOCKPILE OF BRUSH HEADS</li>
            <li> I imagine the markup on the heads is a couple thousand percent as all the tech is in the body and Sonicare tech isn&#x27;t exactly new</li>
            <li> I like the new brush heads.  </li>
            <li> After using mine for a year and going to a new dentist, they could tell I use an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well done Sonicare on this new model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new one also has a lot of brush head choices</li>
            <li> You would think that with a price of almost $84.00, you would get a brand new product.  </li>
            <li> I am still waiting for a shipping label and a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I need to order a new one.</li>
            <li> So, expect to buy a new one every 2 years.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100+ for a new brush either.</li>
            <li> This item broke within a year, while trying to put in a new brush.  </li>
            <li> and she loves this new model.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the new handle</li>
            <li> Had to call  Philips and they sent me a new toothbrush .</li>
            <li> so I keep purchasing new ones.</li>
            <li> My first one had many speeds, but I found I left it on one setting its entire life, so when I went to buy a new one, I bought a single speed model.  </li>
            <li> and he directly asked me an address to replace it with a new one!</li>
            <li> Had the old e-series for many years and the batteries finally wouldnt hold a charge for very long so we replaced them with the new Pro Results brushes with Li-Ion batteries.</li>
            <li> A standard size and a compact size brush head fit the handle; my husband used the standard, and</li>
            <li> Never had such smooth teeth, let alone the back ones.</li>
            <li> You probably don&#x27;t need all the advanced features of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> After some tinkering I was able to open the casing and found that it was soaking wet with water the battery as well as</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend more money on a fancier model with all of the different modes that you&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and this particular model aggravates the condition.  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush gave up the ghost after 12 years of steady use without any problems.</li>
            <li> Also, my hygienist remarked how healthy and pink my gums were at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and let it charge until the green ready light stopped blinking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do these toothbrushes work great, but Phillips stands behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as loud as my older model either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s curious to see how his next cleaning will be.</li>
            <li> Most of the models I have used have performed to a high enough standard to leave me not wishing to use a regular manual toothbrush anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Philips&#x27;</li>
            <li> Fits the hand comfortably and just the right size to get to all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> This is just fine without all the other stuff!</li>
            <li> Present for my daughter, she loves it and helps her dental health very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since stroke speed is very fast, there apparently is an initial 14 day break in period, whereby the brush moves slower to start, but increases in speed over each of those uses.</li>
            <li> I will miss stripping the high power magnets from the old head.</li>
            <li> So I bought this new model, and the difference is obvious from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was hard to clean and got gross very quickly.</li>
            <li> This particular sonicare is smart enough to tell me when to switch areas of brushing in my mouth -</li>
            <li> It really tickled at first, but this model has a ramp up feature that starts out less intense and builds up to normal intensity over 14 uses.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend both Sonicare generally, and this particular model brush specifically.</li>
            <li> I got this cheaper one, with one button that does exactly the same thing exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> The first two lasted around seven years before starting to lose their brushing vigor.</li>
            <li> so i said, fine, refund half the purchase price and i&#x27;ll buy something else.  </li>
            <li> Apparently Philips wants you to go out and buy another Sonicare every two years instead of designing their products</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Our second one lasted exactly one year.</li>
            <li> I charged it the first day I got it (around Oct 17th), and I am still to this day (Dec 4th) still brushing on that initial charge!  </li>
            <li> The first one was replaced, but the second one they wouldn&#x27;t replace.</li>
            <li> At nearly $13 / head (MSRP), Phillips could afford to give away the toothbrushes and still make a profit!  </li>
            <li> this one is much better than the e-series we&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> The old one allowed water in, which meant mold (ew!)..</li>
            <li> This is my second PS toothbrush, and I had no problems with my first one.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has made them look like I&#x27;ve had professional whitening treatments from the dentist !  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, concise, and gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> This model gradually increases the intensity over the first several uses and lets you get usesd to the vibration.</li>
            <li> My old one lasted almost 15 years before it dies!  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a small price to pay for better performance.  </li>
            <li> First time owning a sonicare toothbrush - I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush for the last 23 years of my life.</li>
            <li> However while it worked at first the thing didn&#x27;t last 5 months.</li>
            <li> Recently, my dentist showed me that Philips had redesigned the brush so that the brushhead fits onto a spike (exactly like the cheaper brush I had been using).</li>
            <li> One thing that I was not aware of when I first used this model was that it has an \\&quot;Easy-start\\&quot; feature which increases power over the first 14</li>
            <li> They no longer offered the brush head I had (soft &amp; smaller), and it didn&#x27;t make the same sound.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same as the Healthy White model but without the extra functions.</li>
            <li> If this one disappeared tomorrow, I would but the same exact one to replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s dual voltage 110/240 so that I can use it while I travel and that the charging stand is extremely small and portable.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want one of the super-high-tech-rocket-scientist models; I just wanted a fairly simple model with the quadpacer feature, and this was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, the first one lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li> So he asked for the exact same one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted for several years.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrushes set the standard that other knock-offs do not seem to be able to meet.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, but then I realized that no matter how often it was charged (or how often I allowed it to deplete a charge), it will still stop vibrating while brushing teeth multiple times.</li>
            <li> I have another model that has a sensitive setting and a massage setting; however, I always just use the normal setting.  </li>
            <li> This is an improvement over my other, more basic Sonicare model.  </li>
            <li> when an oral surgeon first suggested it, however after using it, my teeth feel the same way they do after the dental hygienist cleans them.</li>
            <li> My first unit was the fatter handled style Essence and lasted almost six years, which, I believe, is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to send the first one back because it was not working correctly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re replacing an old one, this is also your machine!</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush &amp; I will never go back unless I&#x27;m in the woods!</li>
            <li> The first model I bought was the more expensive Healthy White model, but its extra features are superfluous.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over ten years.  </li>
            <li> a reminder that there is a small gap between the bottom of the toothbrush and the top of the toothbrush body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks on its first charge.</li>
            <li> But the functionality where it slowly reaches full speed over the first 14 brushes really helps.  </li>
            <li> I put my brush head on my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Flexcare base and it was MUCH more powerful and cleaned my teeth more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the very momentary pause/beep to indicate time to start on next &amp;#34;zone&amp;#34; of teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean model is better but the only real advantage is the heads wich work just as well on this model at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare HX6063/64 Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads]] which comes with the most expensive Sonicare toothbrush, the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean]]</li>
            <li> At my recent dental hygiene appointment, the hygienist said that my teeth were really clean and she noticed the difference from my last cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean that the &amp;#34;White+Clean&amp;#34; mode is more powerful than the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> In general the product provide much better cleaning and whiting effect on my teeth although it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare, 2 minutes (via the built-in timer) gives really clean feeling teeth in a way that I can not at this time imagine purchasing any other brand of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I assumed this was due to some technology in or the size of the brush making it clean the tops/bottoms of your teeth as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because, if it fails, Philips will replace it and it produces good teeth cleaning</li>
            <li> the case of the new HX series brushes, it&#x27;s clear that form (and profit) won over function.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offered a complete exchange of the defective unit for a new unit.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking the new model.</li>
            <li> I changed to the new model brush because I was now recharging the old sonic toothbrush battery every 4 to 5 days.</li>
            <li> The new brush design clearly fixed this issue.</li>
            <li> Since I have really sensitive gums, this has helped me to adapt to the new brush.  </li>
            <li> I HAD FOR A PREVIOUS MODEL AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD FIT ---</li>
            <li> I previously had just a cheap oral B electric toothbrush I picked up in a supermarket.</li>
            <li> It has a sleaker and less bulky design and leaves my teach feeling smooth and well cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get used to it, I&#x27;m sure, but I liked the thicker base of the older model for this reason.</li>
            <li> So far I have only charged it when I first got it</li>
            <li> The Quadpacer is nice, just a small pause in the vibration every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it took me some getting used to since I am a fan of bigger brushes, and the brush head is small so it can reach all areas of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Nice handle small enough for kids to hold.</li>
            <li> The small size makes it easy to hold and maneuver (as compared to the older models).</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years, still going strong.</li>
            <li> but they were never very good (more noise than cleaning)</li>
            <li> The design allows me to reach anywhere in my mouth, and after a little getting used to it, I am fine with the &#x27;quadrant&#x27; system it uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price for something I use every single day.</li>
            <li> I am one who never feels like I get my teeth good enough, but the small-ish head gets back behind my back teeth better than my larger tooth brush did.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made SUCH a positive change.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive about these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My first one was a bulkier Essence model and the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t retain much of a charge after several years.  </li>
            <li> Researched other models, this one fell in the mid-range sweet spot for price and features.  </li>
            <li> The built in timer is kind of dumb..</li>
            <li> I finally caved in to my dentists gentle suggestion that I get a new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a better design than the previous version.  </li>
            <li> Shiny teeth, healthy gums, spend less money ( after initial investment)</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Philips Sonicare products over the years and am as satisfied with this toothbrush as the previous ones.</li>
            <li> first, the body doesn&#x27;t seem to have very durable dampeners within so the item begins to vibrate intensively; second, after tacking the brush off the body several times to clean it, the fit of the brush on the metal pin loses its tightness, so the head begins to magnify the vibration - major tooth chipping potential.  </li>
            <li> I certainly will the next time I need one.</li>
            <li> To a large extent, the work is being done by the brush heads, therefore one can get different results depending on which you use.  </li>
            <li> This little gem is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is small, sleek, does not catch runoff from rinsing like the old one - it stays clean, cleans well, and is quite and gentle.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is modified, allowing better access to hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel very clean and I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re slightly less yellow after using for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> While strange at first, you learn to open your jaws a little more and it minimizes the occurrences.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has some new design features that are quantum leaps above the older styles.  </li>
            <li> The older ones lasted quite some time and this new one will hopefully do the same.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t collect all that toothpaste gunk that previous models did; it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> Clearly an upgrade from the $15-20 OralB electric toothbrush it is replacing.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare closes their box with a clear tamper proof sticker.  </li>
            <li> The comparison tables don&#x27;t make this clear.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised at how gentle it actually was.</li>
            <li> The hygienist said she had never worked less to clean someone&#x27;s teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit comes with the handle, proresult head with clear cap, and charger</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and the directions weren&#x27;t really clear on the washer and brush assembly to the power head.  </li>
            <li> Stupidly, I spent more money for brush heads that were the same as this one, just a different color.  </li>
            <li> For several years I was using a $5 Crest Spinbrush, which was an improvement over a manual toothbrush, but not by that much.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Oral B Sonic Complete brush that would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product, and so far it exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> I keep it plugged into charger in a cabinet near my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> It is easier to cover all of the tooth surfaces, especially far back in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;travel case and cap\\&quot; that it comes with is just a cheap plastic cover for the actual brush part, so don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting an actual case for the entire brush.</li>
            <li> Wow I received this brush in the mail about 5 days ago</li>
            <li> I travel frequently</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> goo collecting under the cap like the old model.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf and he likes it so far.</li>
            <li> and it looks like it is working well so far.</li>
            <li> Two years ago when i bought the flexcare model it came with a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Now if i want a soft brush, or sensitive as sonicare calls it, i need to purchase them separately.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes are preferred and recommended.</li>
            <li> really well, battery stays charged for a month with daily (2x/day) use!</li>
            <li> But with a soft head (needs to be ordered separately)</li>
            <li> Thus far, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Every time I brush my teeth, they feel like they have been professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> The charger works with european or US electrical currents which is very convenient for traveling and living overseas.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare broke after 6 years.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s the old style brush heads</li>
            <li> My old sonicare lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li> by far, I&#x27;ve used it for a month.</li>
            <li> Every brush leaves me feeling as if I just had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does the job without all the extras which I never used in my old toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that all the Soniccare models except one are sealed batteries.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare EasyClean and similar Sonicare models (the ones with the slim handles) are now better than Oral-B for international travel (including 220V European and Asian countries) for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old Oral-B.  </li>
            <li> When you brush your teeth it feels like you had a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> However the heads for this do seem to wear away frequently.</li>
            <li> I used to have the old Sonicare</li>
            <li> I guess my mouth is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had an old style Sonicare and also and Oral B electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive gums</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this one.  </li>
            <li> The old one had a stronger vibration</li>
            <li> so far, the brush is living up to</li>
            <li> I am an adult over 50 that just had her braces removed after 18 months.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner, the battery last for days on end and it has made brushing my teeth a much easier process.</li>
            <li> replaced a 10+ year old Braun that was still working well.</li>
            <li> if you want to be sure you are getting the newer model that doesn&#x27;t accumulate gunk inside it, uses the newest brush heads, and has the feature that lets you know when you&#x27;ve completed each 30 second cycle - without all the extra stuff that I never use and that makes it a lot more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have had six of them so far.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electronic toothbrushes for nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li> I use it at bedtime but still can&#x27;t get away from my old type brush which I also use after lunch each day.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many months without complaint.  </li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold a charge longer than my old electric brush.  </li>
            <li> This was an upgrade for my old Phillips.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any really breath problems like with traditional brushes</li>
            <li> I chipped my front tooth when I was young and have a cap over it (baseline for tooth color).  </li>
            <li> The old one lasted about five years.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it cleans and feels as well as the old one.</li>
            <li> the old style heads and those of the Braun catch all kinds of crud and gunk</li>
            <li> and you get a soft beep/stop reminder to switch quadrants.  </li>
            <li> Sleeker, thinner, and doesn&#x27;t collect spit like the old ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old</li>
            <li> that really surprised me a lot.</li>
            <li> It was the Flexcare model, which has four cleaning modes (sensitive, massage, \\&quot;on-the-go\\&quot; and cleaning).</li>
            <li> Love the 2 minute timer unless I am running late for work.  </li>
            <li> I owned the old sonicare model and it stopped working after about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It fixed everything that I disliked about my old Sonicare, which was primarily the gunk build up under the brush head unit.</li>
            <li> Charger is very compact and simple.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the frequent interruptions.  </li>
            <li> I had 2 of the old types that the brush head screwed onto.  </li>
            <li> After 2 years of use, the on/off button is completely gone and we can no longer turn the toothbrush on/off</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Cannot be fixed.</li>
            <li> I never used any of the fancy functions on my old brush.</li>
            <li> I was always cleaning moldy gunk out of my old one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to switch out the brush heads on this if you&#x27;re sharing the handle, and the charger is smaller than the E series charger also.</li>
            <li> frequently (or ever).</li>
            <li> If you keep the brush head on, over time old toothpaste begins to build up</li>
            <li> and I noticed on my old HX6950 that mold had started to grow on the rubber that is attached to the metal tip.  </li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t find the soft bristle brush anymore, I will have to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade because my boyfriend wanted my old one.</li>
            <li> Wow, is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> That was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added sensitive paste to my regimen.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my 2-years old Flexcare with ultrasonic cleaning module.  </li>
            <li> It is so much sleeker than the last electric tooothbrush I owned and takes up virtually no space on my sink counter.  </li>
            <li> I balked at the nearly $90 price tag...but decided to get it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush gets my teeth way cleaner than my old Oral B manual.</li>
            <li> Overall, it performed very well.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit to get used to after using an Oral-B brush as the pulsating brush is much faster and smaller than what we were used to.  </li>
            <li> far it is favorable because: It is slimmer and lighter than my old unit.</li>
            <li> The medium bristle that I got with this is an order of magnitude softer than the sensitive Oral B that I have</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than my last few Sonicare models &amp; it still has the quadpacer, I still feel it keeps my teeth in top condition &amp; white.</li>
            <li> recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces especially because of how much it&#x27;s helped me.</li>
            <li> Had an old electronic toothbrush that stopped working on me after 4+ years of use.  </li>
            <li> but they also provide lots of space for crud to build up that requires regular cleaning or it gets really nasty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see my teeth got whiter after a month without changing anything besides the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The old ones were pain because you had to screw them off</li>
            <li> I chose this unit because it was the least cost that still included the 30 second interval timer (beep tone), a feature that I liked with the old brush.</li>
            <li> After getting this replacement, I realize that the old one had lost its punch way before it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Sonicare was still working (after more than ten years!), but it was an older model that collected water (and thus mildew), even though I was careful to dry it off after each use.  </li>
            <li> i have been using for nearly a year</li>
            <li> The brush on my old one rotates, this one vibrates.</li>
            <li> My old one gave out after years of use.</li>
            <li> We have had the old style</li>
            <li> Purchased it when my old Sonicare croaked.</li>
            <li> The reason I purchased this model was that the last one I had would get nasty/funky where the brushhead attached and it really creeped me out.</li>
            <li> It really makes difference in terms of the overall state of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> and I had to have soft brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I bought a pack of soft brush heads</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested replacing my old OralB with this for its ability to scour away deposits.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a 10 year old model&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it has met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I had given up on our old brushes (the dome-style design) as they required frequent cleaning that was meant disassembling them or replacing them at substantial cost.  </li>
            <li> It does build up debris between the head and the part of the brush you hold in your hand, so that needs to be cleaned frequently or it will buzz loudly.</li>
            <li> Have used it about a month so far.  </li>
            <li> This model only has one setting, but that is really all you need.  </li>
            <li> I have had a problem with Gingivitis almost all my adult life.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to replace the old one I lost while on vacation, then also one for my husband, my son, and my daughter in law.</li>
            <li> So far, this works well.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare for years.</li>
            <li> The sonicare brush has been working well so far.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have that rubberized handle piece like our old model.  </li>
            <li> The old model would start to peel off.  </li>
            <li> and wow, have I noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums &amp; teeth</li>
            <li> is much much quieter and still does the same job.</li>
            <li> Wow how technology has changed.</li>
            <li> My son requested this for Christmas to replace his old worn out Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> The people who complain about the soft brushing and immediately switch probably don&#x27;t know about this feature.</li>
            <li> I returned it and spent $10 extra for Healthy White.</li>
            <li> With such a simple design, you would think someone could make a cheap, generic brush replacement????</li>
            <li> I would definitely not recommend going for the higher-end models unless you&#x27;re convinced the added features will be of real value to you over time.  </li>
            <li> I had the old Phillips Sonicare brush (that I&#x27;ve used for almost 10 years).  </li>
            <li> It does have the extra feature of the Quadpacer that I really like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to my old Sonicare, this is a sIight improvement.</li>
            <li> It was more expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, Sonicare models that are more expensive than this one do not offer features that make them worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because I was doing a good job with my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and good heavens, tooth brush heads are expensive as hell.</li>
            <li> Yes, I realize it is very unscientific of me to blame it on the Oral B, but you can&#x27;t deny the fact the other brushes (even the manual ones) were doing something a little better than the Oral B was doing.    </li>
            <li> This version came with no such stand, and while the system makes cleaning easy, it clearly is not designed in contemplation of several-times daily switching of heads</li>
            <li> Smaller brush head fits easily in gaps where teeth are missing and gets deeper between normal teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vibration takes some getting used to, lips and gums feel a little weird the first few brushings,but later feels great - more alive.  </li>
            <li> I love the little pause it gives me to let me know that I have spent 30 seconds on a particular area and</li>
            <li> They sell a new model that has an almost identical brush head that is slightly modified so they don&#x27;t fit old sonicare models (Hooray for you big business!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the last year,  the flexcare was producing a loud sound, probably due to the interface between the brush and the handle.  </li>
            <li> My only beef was the cost compared to the other entry-level model - but that ~$30 premium is worth it for the much improved head design.</li>
            <li> The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> problem: the case is sealed, so apparently when it stops, there is no alternative to buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> Teeth were very clean and did not require hardly any scraping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this model - more expensive models just have different timing options which I guarantee you&#x27;ll never (or rarely) use.</li>
            <li> Small charger makes charging easy.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonic Care brushes before and this is considerably small and yet easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love that toothbrush, finally back to Sonicare after a few years of OralB. The round head doesn&#x27;t work for me, Sonicare&#x27;s long bent brush head is so much better.</li>
            <li> Our kids like the professionally clean feeling they now get with little effort.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works same as older model as far as brushing goes.  </li>
            <li> It feels solid and no extraneous sound; hopefully this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The heads that come with this are small enough to get in between teeth and vibrate enough on their own to make brushing effortless.</li>
            <li> Why make such a big deal about the travel charger (nice and small) and then not provide a travel case?  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why some reviews say it&#x27;s not as powerful as their other brushes.</li>
            <li> The brush and replacement brush heads are a bit expensive, but they&#x27;re certainly cheaper than fillings, or more significant dental issues down the road.</li>
            <li> This is my third one, as I obviously can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare!  </li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush and will divorce my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous toothbrush for a busy busy individual .</li>
            <li> The new series brushes aren&#x27;t much more complex than a standard manual toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads are more expensive than a new toothbrush but teeth are much cleaner using this.</li>
            <li> it is just a subtle beep every thirty seconds so that you can make sure you evenly brush all quadrants of your mouth, instead of jumping around.  </li>
            <li> I always had to be careful starting that brush up because it would easily slip into some different setting and I would have no idea when to change sectors in my mouth, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have had it a few months now, and it gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace an older model who&#x27;s battery finally died after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Essence mainly because of its larger brush head.</li>
            <li> This one takes the same brush heads but has only one setting and its exactly like the one I was used to using.  </li>
            <li> After owning an older model sonicare for a number of years I could not handle the gross stuff that grew inside the toothbrush anymore.</li>
            <li> And the brushhead attachment stays cleaner since there is no big cone to buildup crud as in the older model.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the timing mechanism that beeps when it is time to move to a different section of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The key reason we chose this particular model was because the Amazon, on-line information indicated that a travel case and travel charger were included in the package.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from an older model which accumulated gunk but the handle last over three</li>
            <li> This was replacing an older model that finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> It did make my gums ache slightly as they got used to being super sonic cleaned</li>
            <li> I particularly like the built-in timer, which causes the brush to pause briefly every thirty seconds and to shut off after two minutes.</li>
            <li> I am going back to the older Sonicare</li>
            <li> Edit: Since I wrote this lazy \\&quot;review\\&quot; I got the Flexcare &amp; Healthy White Plastic Travel Handle Case.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that finally died after 5 years.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I really have about it now is that it doesn&#x27;t display how much charge it has, it only flashes a light when battery is getting low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the 3-pack of sensitive heads at the same time and she&#x27;s used those in place of the normal head.</li>
            <li> Each of us has an older model with a big screw-on brush head assembly.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an older Sonicare that finally died after years of use.</li>
            <li> I always thought the vibration would be bothersome but exactly the opposite - I like the back and forth.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, The first was the Essence, the second was the Flexcare.</li>
            <li> Dentist seemed to notice the difference in using a sonicare toothbrush - particularly on the gums, and especially if you are a &amp;#34;hard brusher.&amp;#34;  This toothbrush prevents you from brushing your gums away.  </li>
            <li> So far after two uses, I can tell quite a difference over my normal brushing and feels like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, because you can simply push the button again, but I am not sure who is cleaning all their teeth and mouth in two minutes.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B and loved the small, round brush head design.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to charge it (it was still working, but the light was flashing indicating it was down to 20% charge)  </li>
            <li> I have not used any other electric toothbrushes, but I have used a regular toothbrush when I was out of town and forgot my Sonicare, and I did not feel clean at all after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting the next model up, which is the HealthyWhite model even if you don&#x27;t use that function.  </li>
            <li> but overall, i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and you can use the diamondClean brushes that are highly rated.</li>
            <li> .after waiting over 3 months I finally got a return label to send back the broken Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> I usually take a traditional toothbrush when I travel and really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my teeth as clean as they should be, but I&#x27;m going to take it on an upcoming 5-day trip and test out the guaranty of a 2-week charge.  </li>
            <li> My old brush finally gave out so had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one, no questions asked and a postage-included padded envelope to send back my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends Sonicare and no other brands... and, after using it for a year, I can see why!</li>
            <li> Owning a Philips medical device is very exciting, especially when their next up apparatus likely costs over 10x is sold through the buy-you-lunch sales reps types.</li>
            <li> It is also far less powerful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet powerful, and goes for months on a single charge.</li>
            <li> so you spend the right amount of time on the 4 main surfaces (upper outside, lower outside, upper inside,</li>
            <li> It really cleans your teeth well and holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> It holds a long charge and leaves moth very refreshed.</li>
            <li> It hums and vibrates so much that I don&#x27;t think I can stand to use it long term.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy to take it apart and clean it regularly, so I had to throw out an expensive piece of equipment</li>
            <li> I knew it would be better than a regular toothbrush, but I was shocked at how much better it was.  </li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing and regular professional care but the teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> chose this brush as I did not feel any real need for the bells &amp; whistles on the far more expensive models</li>
            <li> I apparently brush longer than 2 minute naturally.  </li>
            <li> Have to drive to gas station in the middle of the night and get a normal overpriced cheap-quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I must say, I will never go back to a normal tooth brush again.</li>
            <li> I can never go back to a normal toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I could back off when using a normal toothbrush (baseline for my brushing habits).</li>
            <li> I thought the timing for the different quadrant was a cool feature but after purchasing it was pointless and didn&#x27;t care too much for it.</li>
            <li> I believe it is well worth the extra price to get the &amp;#34;Quadpacer&amp;#34; setting that goes in 30 second intervals and stops for a second and continues telling you to change pattern and direction.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I was unable to use it due to an intense tickling feeling on my gums, but I found out that you can set the toothbrush to get progressively more intense over the course of several brushings to allow your teeth to adjust.</li>
            <li> The only other comment I would make is that the toothbrush only comes with one head so if you&#x27;re sharing you&#x27;re going to have to come up with some more dough to get a second one.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the SoniCare not long after I purchased the Oral B, because I really missed the way the Sonicare felt and cleaned my gums</li>
            <li> last tip - if you are a first time user and adjusting to this like I did, make sure you are opening your mouth a little wider, so that the back of the buzzing brush head doesn&#x27;t hit your other teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a helpful feature for people who maybe brush a little too quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe i was unconciously looking for an excuse to buy a new one because my old one was so LOUD, and I felt like it took forever to brush my teeth with the litle brush</li>
            <li> We have two of these, and prefer them over the higher priced model that has variable speeds, because we only use the high speed, and the button on the other one gets hit by mistake, cause a change in speed while brushing.</li>
            <li> The slim handle is great and the small base is nice and simple.</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis due to dry mouth from illness and medications and using the Sonicare has made a HUGE difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the handle is slimmer and more lightweight and seems to need to charge less often.</li>
            <li> I contacted the support center through a live chat and they are sending me a new brush handle!</li>
            <li> This is a much cleaner version, and I plan to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had that thing for years, so I figured rather than buying new heads for the toothbrush, I would upgrade the entire thing.</li>
            <li> My teenage granddaughter likes this new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush...</li>
            <li> I told them I am buying a new charger anyway as an extra for my children</li>
            <li> At my last cleaning the dental hygienist, a new girl, convinced me into buying a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is having to buy new replacement units that include another recharger - not needed, and extra brushes - not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my earlier model of the sonic tooth brush I had to recharge the battery every 8 to 9 days, i.e. when it was new.</li>
            <li> I would bet that all new models have the same problem because of the slender body that keeps side to side vibration in check.  </li>
            <li> The new heads just pop off, but also don&#x27;t seem to get mildewy if left on.</li>
            <li> I wore out the last Philips Sonicare I had, so that&#x27;s why I got this new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;8-28-12 -UPDATE - as another reviewer suggested to me, I did follow up with Phillips &amp; they are sending me a new toothbrush handle today &amp; a prepaid shipping label to send the defective one back.</li>
            <li> Now that I finally upgraded to a new model</li>
            <li> in other Sonicare items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 14 day ramp up feature for those who are nervous about switching from a manual - the intensity starts out very gently and gradually</li>
            <li> Also, no crevices that can catch waste like the old unit use to do (and required disassembly quite often to clean it out properly).</li>
            <li> The Oral B was much louder and even the soft bristles were rigid and rough on the gums.</li>
            <li> Works better than ever and such a design improvement with no space to collect liquids that turn icky.  </li>
            <li> Until then I had only really used a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally brush that way, but I find the thirty second reminders encouraging to help me brush for the whole 2 minutes as recommended.</li>
            <li> Not many bells and whistles are on board (quite normal at it&#x27;s price point), but it has everything to get your mouth feeling fresh within two minutes.</li>
            <li> It has fewer bells and whistles (almost none) but has the same motor/force/brushes per second and the Quadpacer - which is all I really used anyway.</li>
            <li> really well - no film is left, resulting in the just back from dentist feeling</li>
            <li> - It comes with two heads and the only description of them appears on the box and are very similar, i.e. gentle, gum lines, etc.  </li>
            <li> I really like the timer &#x27;reminder&#x27;, which is a brief pause in the vibration that reminds you to move on to a different quarter of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The old one had a rubbery coating which was comfortable but sometimes got icky and smelly</li>
            <li> The timer works very well ensuring every quadrant is brushed equally</li>
            <li> I charged and set both to full power (not easy start of ramp-up).  </li>
            <li> It felt pretty weird at first and the zone alarm was pretty useless since everyone has certain spots on their mouth that require much more attention than others.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to feel good about your toothbrush when it&#x27;s smelly and full of creepy mold.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement for a ten year old Sonicare with the large head,  The smaller head is a great improvement and the replacements are so much less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the first toothbrush of theirs that solves my problems with the other designs.</li>
            <li> The bases last for YEARS and the heads are a little spendy but worth it!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are pretty expensive, they should cost the same as a toothbrush, they are more like three times that.</li>
            <li> No other electric tooth brush even comes close to what the Sonic does in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I also love how small the brush head is because it reaches all the way back to my back molars.</li>
            <li> They have all worked great with some lasting as long as 4 years before the seal where the brush head plugs into the handle fails and allows water to get in.</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> I bought my first sonicare after a dentist basically mandated it after I had to have my teeth scraped due to gingivitis.</li>
            <li> Customer service gives you a reference number but the call takers only add half of the information you give them, full address, phone number etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same as the &#x27;white&#x27; function on my other which they say is used to polish/whiten rather than clean...</li>
            <li> I still need to clean the inside of my lower gums with a rubber tool, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s MUCH better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare Died Exactly After 1 Year, Not sure to buy another one after being so careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush stops charging or water must have gotten in\\&quot; Starts for a second makes a beep with light and turns off immediately\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t think the extra features are worth it of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> My older model (that cost $20 more) only took a few hours to a half day.</li>
            <li> It feels like my teeth are really clean when I use this and in the last month I&#x27;ve already noticed that my teeth are a little whiter.</li>
            <li> HX5610/01 Essence and find that a little bit gross to clean the head part.</li>
            <li> It was not able to hold a charge for more than a single brushing.  </li>
            <li> It is very slender and keeps a charge far longer than any of the other two.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some getting used to with how fast it is and how odd it really feels.  </li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get used to, but it really does feel like an adequate teeth cleaning</li>
            <li> My teeth were becoming loose and after a few weeks of using this toothbrush, almost all mobility is gone.</li>
            <li> In addition, due to the powerful magnet attached to the head and the more powerful amplifier, it was nearly impossible to stall the original Elite models, no matter how hard</li>
            <li> Sort of expensive for a toothbrush, but well worth it if you like that shiny clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The design improvement I mentioned above is part of an overall improvement in quality over older models.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and keeps the charge for a long time</li>
            <li> charging stand makes it easy to keep on my very small sink</li>
            <li> so much I could hardly brush at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people like me who have a bad gag reflex.</li>
            <li> Price is a amazing for how it is compare to the expensive sonic</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t bother with a general review as there&#x27;s over 2,000 reviews.  </li>
            <li> couple of years ago my dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product.</li>
            <li> but generally it should be cleaned after every use to prevent any buildup.</li>
            <li> /whitening generally just increases the duration the toothbrush is kept running by 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> a generally &amp;#34;feels cleaner&amp;#34; after using the device.</li>
            <li> The box, the manual, and even the product description here all clearly state that this model has a feature called Quadpacer that beeps and pauses in 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the softer bristled brushes, having sensitive gums, and following the general advice of dentists and hygenists.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the old way since I started using this electric toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> so I barely have access to the faucet)</li>
            <li> I still use the regular old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much anyone else spent on this toothbrush</li>
            <li> With this and flossing they barely do anything when I go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is far and away beyond the toothbrushes found in drugstores and big box items.  </li>
            <li> I used the sensitive mode while my gums were getting used to it and have worked up to the regular setting.</li>
            <li> I like the force and frequency of the vibration and apparently it works for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Finally I had one young lady</li>
            <li> In a speaker, the permanent magnet is attached to the speaker cone and moves back and forth in proximityto a fixed voice coil.</li>
            <li> I had one of these several years ago when I was young and lost it.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare Elite finally died.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last one was 5 years old, and it still works, I just prefered this model because of easier cleaning.</li>
            <li> and we are still on the initial charge; the old one needed a charge every 5-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This last one lasted 6 months before it stopped vibrating and made a loud buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was &amp;#34;So we need to drop $80 on an electric tooth brush because you never learned to brush your teeth?&amp;#34;  I then came to the conclusion that we needed to focus on solutions and realized that this might allow her to keep her teeth in old age.  </li>
            <li> I like the way my teeth feel - as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> However, I personally don’t favor the soft bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, but haven&#x27;t been back to dentist yet to see just how well</li>
            <li> My ten year old Sonicare just stopped working one day but my dentist still insists on this brand of electric toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve yet to open the package of soft bristles for the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days without charging, brushing three times/day (9 sessions in total) and the battery lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW, not only do my teeth feel cleaner, I never have any gum sensitivity anymore, AND my receding gum have improved greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this model rather than replacing my old e-series toothbrush when it finally died.</li>
            <li> Further, these toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper.</li>
            <li> So I bought this one for my adult son who just finished extensive dental work.</li>
            <li> I barely used it.  </li>
            <li> I just bought a second one for my 10 year old son.</li>
            <li> The power of the sonic action obliterates any gunk between your teeth especially calcium buildup.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is sleek and the charging stand is much smaller than my old toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The battery on teh old one died so this was simply a relacement.</li>
            <li> MY OLD SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH LASTED OVER TEN YEARS AND IS A DURABLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old e-series brush recently died and we were looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare didn&#x27;t have the 30-second beep as a cue to move to the next area to brush.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t vibrate harder) and a pulse mode, which I don&#x27;t really get the point of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Btw it works completely through vibrations, so there is no rotation of the bristles or head of toothbrush, but it is detachable and they have different styles you can use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not buy another Sonicare and will switch to the Braun brand--which my wife has had for nearly 10 years with the same battery and no problems!</li>
            <li> It only has one working mode, but to be frankly, my last Panasonic one has lots of functions and among the 4 yrs I owned it, 99.9% of the time I just used normal tooth cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> It also means that when traveling I can leave the charger behind for most trips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s skinnier, a better charging base, overall better design.  </li>
            <li> I use to unscrew the old head all the time in order to let it dry out a little, but it was always full of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> Might be a year, might be a little more or less.</li>
            <li> It is also very gentle on my gums (I have previously had a problem of receding gums that has since halted now that I&#x27;ve switched from a manual brush).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wish the new heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but still, what price would you put on healthy teeth and gums?</li>
            <li> Doesnt get dirty like the other models.thisbis the most important feature and</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it does still does its job - just not nearly as well as my old one which makes me want to just go back to using my old one!</li>
            <li> always gave his hygienist extra work, until a few months later after using the bulky original non-pacer Sonicare</li>
            <li> I asked why shipping time was so long when Amazon could have a new one to me in two days, and was told that was how Philips worked.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Sonicare a few years back but had the problem of gunk getting stuck in the middle chamber (where the brush attaches) and I&#x27;d have to clean my toothbrush with every use.</li>
            <li> I try to clean it after use and it only takes a few extra seconds.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that due to the (wild guess here) way sonic vibrations work, it seems to collapse all the bubbles and foam that you normally get with brushing.</li>
            <li> Reason for this purchase / replacement - dropped prior one too many times on the hard floor; after last drop, no longer worked properly.</li>
            <li> Have been using original Model FC but replacement heads are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I personally think the timer is set a little too short for my liking, as I go two full cycles</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know if they have a different speed, or other difference, but I just plain like the ones with the snap on top.  </li>
            <li> To quote an old commercial of a different product &amp;#34;oh what a relief it is&amp;#34;, not to have to recharge the battery on such a frequent basis.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush, but very pricey, and the starter head bristles are a little too hard and sharp for my liking.</li>
            <li> Solid product, though it tickles in some areas of my gums like no other!</li>
            <li> At first I liked the circular brush, but the thing felt heavy and clunky and somewhat sloppy compared to the Sonicare (yes, I know there is a difference between the battery powdered models and the more expensive offerings).</li>
            <li> Thanks to other customers who replied to my post</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable compared to the other models.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very slim but it continues to perform well like other soni care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $59 to avoid extra dental work and cost later on down the road.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have 2 types to choose from if you step up in quality: Oral-B (with the round spinning heads) and Philips (with the more traditional up and down stroke head).</li>
            <li> Mre expensive models largely just add more time to the cycle to do things like &amp;#34;focus on vanity surfaces&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;focus on gums&amp;#34; which this one can totally do if you simply turn it back on .</li>
            <li> Seriously, it could cause real harm if you do other then put it lightly against your teeth.</li>
            <li> the new one feels better and and doesn&#x27;t get all dirty like the old one&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth honestly never felt so clean.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that we&#x27;ve had is the sound.</li>
            <li> Seeds were stuck, including one far back between my last two lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> It lasted much longer than expected and it finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because I didn&#x27;t feel the extra bells and whistles were necessary for me, although I did want a brush with the quad feature like my old one, which this one has.</li>
            <li> I have been using an cordless toothbrush for the past ten years but more recently it has not recharged properly (ten years is a long time).  </li>
            <li> Brush is not too small nor too big (I guess this won&#x27;t stand true for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so far the most expensive toothbrush I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The secret here is that the newer design brush attachments allow for ease of replacement brush&#x27;s suited for your individual concerns as there are many styles to choose from.</li>
            <li> The older toothbrushes had a lot of empty space in the inside and seams that would fill with water and goo and get moldy.</li>
            <li> I notice my teeth are smoother and after about a month I&#x27;m noticing that they are whiter because the false cap part is more yellow !!!  </li>
            <li> I have owned a Sonicare rechargeable in the past that was much more expensive, and this certainly performs as well at much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I kissed soda goodbye, bought this new Sonicare toothbrush and committed to flossing every single day - no matter what.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted a little over 10 years</li>
            <li> You might think that 60 bucks is a lot to spend on a toothbrush, but the condition of your teeth can have a major effect on your overall health.</li>
            <li> It usually stops right when I&#x27;ve had time to thoroughly clean my teeth, gums, and tongue, but sometimes I just have to get an extra few seconds in!</li>
            <li> I have an old cap and my natural teeth are actually trending back towards my cap color which was the color of my teeth a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts long enough that it doesn&#x27;t have to live on its charger.</li>
            <li> 2 days later i had my new tooth brush with a free extra head and a package to return the broken one.  </li>
            <li> One needs to try it to understand what they mean when they say you can feel the sonic care clean.</li>
            <li> not sure what the warrenty is - by the time I find it in my mess of papers - it will probably have just expired. :)</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was apparently the same things everyone else didn&#x27;t like: the size, the so-so battery life and the filth that would form inside the handle and brush heads.</li>
            <li> Apparently the warranty is for 2 years only.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t have the different settings like the higher end models, but those features are not worth the extra $40, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> However, just remember the first few times it will feel \\&quot;weird\\&quot; my wife said it tickled.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in June 14 and by october it was making a funny noise, and before the end of october it was dead.</li>
            <li> I was becoming concerned about and tired</li>
            <li> It lasted a good 8 years before the battery would no longer charge, and due to the nature of it, the battery was unable to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> This way, you brush upper  or bottom, left or right teeth for 30 seconds, then the toothbrush gives a slight beep, encouraging you to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> Recommend cleaning base and taking top apart each time to keep clean.</li>
            <li> yea much better than my old essentials which i had for more than 10 years, that one finally died, and decided i wanted one without the cavity to hold all that nasty gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this reason I chose the least expensive of the smaller head toothbrushes, the Easy Clean, which had reviews as high as their most expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly this Sonicare toothbrush or any other Sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, while using the Oral B, I have always received high praise from my dental hygienist (no plaque buildup or cavities), even when I went a couple of years between cleanings due to health reasons.</li>
            <li> I was immediately disappointed in the Easy clean output.  </li>
            <li> Philips must not be doing well and to compensate is saving money by making these VERY skinny and removing about half the bristles they had before.  </li>
            <li> A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It works well and is much lighter that the previous versions.   </li>
            <li> Since I began using it, my gums are much healthier and my teeth have less plaque when I go for a cleaning...as an added bonus, they seem to stay whiter, too.  </li>
            <li> I actually have become fanatic about keeping my teeth clean and white because this tooth brush gives me a reason.</li>
            <li> This is very valuable, I found previously, with just a 2-minute shut off, I would often turn the brush off before the 2 mins was up.</li>
            <li> bought this specific model because the higher priced models from Sonicare are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The higher end/more expensive models have features that I just wouldn&#x27;t use, but this one is worth it for the Lion battery.</li>
            <li> It was good while it lasted, but since this low quality product is now broken and Philips won&#x27;t replace it until some unknown date in the distant future, I&#x27;m giving it 2/5.</li>
            <li> I must admit my mouth needed to get used to the sonic vibrations and this brush actually starts off slow and increases over a two week period to full strength to help with this.</li>
            <li> I would swear that the unit also slowed down at the same time, now giving a gentle massage instead of a brisk cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I let the battery run down before I recharge even though the manual says overcharging isn&#x27;t possible, I really would prefer not to have to replace them in a year.  </li>
            <li> When you finally catch it, it tells you the gentle action of the last few days was not battery or your stronger gums, but layers of dried bacteria (even with the Philips Sonicare UV Station) non-noticeably rattling the whole mouthpiece.  </li>
            <li> Is it really that hard just to answer a simple question?&lt;br /&gt;People, don&#x27;t get fooled by the 5 star reviews, the only reason they rate it high is because they have not reached the &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; point yet.</li>
            <li> This is nice and thin, feels good in the hand, doesn&#x27;t get all goopy and nasty under the brush stem like the older model.  </li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding new brush heads for my old Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> standard brush head - unless I want to use the one designed for gums, which is small but not the right head for tooth brushing... Philips does make a compact head but not for this handle..</li>
            <li> The metal shaft becomes loose inside the body, it gets gradually louder as the vibrating action decreases.</li>
            <li> I can see right away that the small, light charging base will fall over easily and possibly drop the unit off the countertop.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model that was difficult to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I let it run down at least once after i chage it and occasionally to make sure im not trashing the battery.</li>
            <li> thought I had simply not taken care of the item the first time I had this issue, but the same breakage occurred even when I was very careful to keep my second purchase dry and corrosion-free.</li>
            <li> But, I also didn&#x27;t want to go with the entry-level model, particularly not those that used the old &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; style heads.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the new Sonicare was not NEARLY as strong as my old Sonicare.</li>
            <li> they vibrate so fast and so little</li>
            <li> and while I did like the performance of the Sonicare I refuse to purchase from a company that forces its consumers to purchase new products due to planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thought of using a hand held toothbrush again was so foreign to me that I promptly ordered a new charger and it arrived before my toothbrush needed to be charged.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I needed a new electric toothbrush--our Braun was losing usable charge every other day.  </li>
            <li> Much more subtle in the dark at night.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you are new to Sonicare and if you are sick of cleaning your E-series then it&#x27;s worth the purchase of a new one.</li>
            <li> It seems that the size trades off for being slightly less powerful than other models.</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last forever (second one lasted 7 years) but having the dental hygienist hardly touch me is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a key point because other ones are very loud.</li>
            <li> on the other hand, it is quiet, has a beeper to time the sections of your mouth (and turns off after 2 min), and I felt like my teeth were so much cleaner in 2 minutes than the usual 3-4 I did with the older</li>
            <li> I heard it trying to do clean and move, but... too weak.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought a cheaper sonicare to try and take $$; however, the cheaper one is heavier, doesn&#x27;t have the little buzz to change sides and did I mention heavy?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it did!!!  </li>
            <li> charging base is miniscule, with a simple structure, but very effective and requires virtually no effort to insert the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other stopped working after 7 years which lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I never used any of the other options that the HX6950 offers such as Gum Care, Refresh, etc., so</li>
            <li> POS stopped working in less than 12 months under normal use.</li>
            <li> I mentioned this to the dentist and he did say that I may be brushing too hard and if the bristles aren&#x27;t tight enough they will act like razors and cut the gums.... easy fix.</li>
            <li> (my Braun was 3-5 days when new and down to 2 days after a couple of days)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> yes, replacement heads are expensive compared to a normal toothbrush, so this is a more expensive option, but the results for your dental health are worth it</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing one for each of my kids when they are a little older.</li>
            <li> After much research, I found that the older Philips models, with the much bigger base to the replaceable brush end, were getting reports of significant material (toothpaste, saliva, etc.)</li>
            <li> Also quieter than the other Sonicare models, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Your entire brush session is also timed to be 2 minutes flat</li>
            <li> Took a little getting used to, but now I don&#x27;t think I could switch back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And it is easier to clean than the older model that had a large cup that got filthy inside, where the magnet part is.</li>
            <li> The price for the replacement heads seems a little high.</li>
            <li> It has a higher frequency than the Other brand I previously owned.</li>
            <li> When not turned on,  the brush can be moved easily; I believe it is loose or partially broken.  </li>
            <li> This time the new handle took a week and a half to get here.  </li>
            <li> bought my previous model at my dentist&#x27;s office, but wondered if there were any new models that my dentist didn&#x27;t carry</li>
            <li> Every 30 seconds a slight pause in the vibration lets you know you should move to a new quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy and the test will be the next visit to the dentist when I expect to have a less painful time in the chair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not waste $70 again on a toothbrush that can last only half a year.</li>
            <li> The extra software options are not useful: they just vary the length of time and lower the intensity of the brushing action.</li>
            <li> My other sonicare was hard to clean and there was always build up on it.  </li>
            <li> The only minor issue I have is that several times while brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> The handle/brush are long enough to get to the back teeth without any problems.  </li>
            <li> so I know I brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> When it finally got to the point that the battery would no longer hold a charge long enough to get through a brushing, I decided to buy another Sonicare with the quadpacer feature.  </li>
            <li> Battery last for so long, sometimes I don&#x27;t even remember when is the last time I charge it.</li>
            <li> After having these for a few months they are exactly what we expected.</li>
            <li> I replaced her older sonicare model (heavy, bulky) by this uniy</li>
            <li> Actually, I made it through a 3 week international vacation on one charge, so it wants you to rough it a little.</li>
            <li> When the first broke down I bought this one with much less money but performs equally well for a 2 munute brush.</li>
            <li> only recommendation to Philips is that the handle is still too smooth for a firm grip, especially when you&#x27;re dealing with the icky realities of toothpaste, water and saliva.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected, not a distinct two minute timer,tends to be messier than my older model,can&#x27;t locate replacement heads for this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember exactly) uses a hard plastic sleeve instead of rubber</li>
            <li> It reaches those hard to get places and works really well!</li>
            <li> only draw back to this model (and it&#x27;s very minor)</li>
            <li> so I did buy the sensitive heads for the brush which are the same price as the regular ones and a little softer for my gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist says there is far less buildup than my last O*B electric brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head is compact and effective AND less expensive than the E series brush heads.</li>
            <li> I give it 1 star less because it doesn&#x27;t seem to oscillate (move back and forth) as fast as my other ones.  </li>
            <li> Another good thing i like is the base and the charger have a firm connection ( small projection in the charger) so that it cannot fall off easily.</li>
            <li> ...in the Sonicare collection, this one works as well as more expensive models while being free of useless features.</li>
            <li> If you brush in one area for too long, it will buzz at you to move to the next tooth/area.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to brushing my teeth and often restart to get flat surfaces when my time is up.</li>
            <li> we will see how long the current one lasts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth actually felt cleaner, and the results didn&#x27;t take long to notice.  </li>
            <li> They may not last as long as a Braun</li>
            <li> do have to be careful with it because it can hurt if your not careful.</li>
            <li> This model solves the problem with the fairly flat attachment from the handle to the brush head.</li>
            <li> Battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds a charge long enough for a road trip</li>
            <li> If i had to do it again I would buy the thicker Phillips tooth brush with the flat bottom.</li>
            <li> I had one for a long time and finally gave up the ghostbut</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s lightweight enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Simple, basic does what it is supposed to without the other useless features and bulk, which makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li> So, now we have a good product but are simply disappointed in what we received...</li>
            <li> So there is a clear difference, for me, between the brushheads this one uses and one step down.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the original sonicare -- no more (or very little) gunk accumulation below the brush</li>
            <li> The other Philips toothbrush I had, a sophisticated one with lots of useless buttons, started acting up within a year, so it got replaced under its warranty.</li>
            <li> (how does it last that long w/o a charge?!)</li>
            <li> managed to leave it on a plane, however so for me it didn&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li> Since this unit is spec&#x27;d to 31,000 bruch strokes per minute, same as the other Li-ion powered Sonicare brushes, I assumed it would have the same overall power as the others with just fewer features.  </li>
            <li> Two of them didn&#x27;t last very long, the others, no problem.</li>
            <li> Will last for a very long time (6 mos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than two years old (did not send in the guarantee being told in CA</li>
            <li> My dad frequently commented on my previous bristle brush hygiene</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had with the old Sonicare model was that the heads were sometimes difficult to attach/remove -- and, more crucially, the manner in which they attached to the handle made cleaning difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> iIt was always disgusting to clean inside the old toothbrush, with this model you don&#x27;t find anything gross when you clean it.</li>
            <li> It was less than a year old.</li>
            <li> Waited so long to write a review, because I wanted to see how long it would last</li>
            <li> I had a different Sonicare Model previously that had options for different types of cleaning (express, regular, deep, etc)</li>
            <li> However, I had some staining on my teeth recently and never connected to my old Sonicare toothbrush until it went dead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine how it would be any different from any other tooth brush until you actually use one for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better because it doesn&#x27;t let gunk build up at the base of the brush like older models, and the charger is compatible for 110-220 V (unlike the last one).</li>
            <li> She said to buy the least expensive one, as they are all good.</li>
            <li> Old one gave good service but had one major fault---allowed disgusting \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; to build up inside the handle.  </li>
            <li> Next time I need one for myself, I&#x27;ll buy a single speed version like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, a single over night charge operates it daily for over two weeks.</li>
            <li> A lower intensity is only useful if your teeth are very sensitive due to poor hygiene or due to</li>
            <li> It is too soon for us to tell, but it seems likely that this design will have far less problems accumulating internal grit and likely will not go dead because of crud accumulating around the internal magnets.</li>
            <li> I have had an oral B electric toothbrush it was starting to loose it&#x27;s charge after having it for 4-5 years.</li>
            <li> it eco friendly uses less toothpaste, so waste is less.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go a step above the back and forth or round and round electric toothbrushes but didn&#x27;t want to pay for all the bells and whistles that really don&#x27;t help your teeth or gums.  </li>
            <li> I rotated the box just long enough to see it contained what I&#x27;ve been waiting for: the single post / screw-less brush head design.  </li>
            <li> Product worked fine until it completely failed after 21 months.  </li>
            <li> For every Sonicare model I have owned before this one, I would actually skip brushing because the black bacteria would gross me out enough to not want it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> a nice cap that you put on the toothbrush when finished so that when other people are brushing or washing their hands, they don&#x27;t spill their dirty hands water on to your toothbrush (after all, who know where their hands have been,</li>
            <li> I see from reviews that several other people had the same problem.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great like my past Sonicare, except the new design eliminated that disgusting buildup the old design allowed.</li>
            <li> It was a little over 6 years old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i had a toothbrush so that i could clean the cavity of the old essentials soniccare, how crazy is that?</li>
            <li> There is a guy on eBay who will replace the battery for you, but our toothbrush looked so ratty after 5 years of hard use that we opted to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> The buzzing of the electric toothbrush was a little unnerving the first few times, and the vibration felt like that from a dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
            <li> just REALLY wish the brush wasn&#x27;t so hard</li>
            <li> The brush fits into the chassis much better and doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward space for run off to collect.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well, so apparently the more expensive sterilizer version wasn&#x27;t necessary, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I do buy some knockoff brush heads as they get expensive and it&#x27;s important to change every 3 months or sooner.  </li>
            <li> Only last me about 12 to 18 months on average.</li>
            <li> I recently heard the average person brushes their teeth for only 46-47 seconds!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare years ago, but it went to its reward after long use.  </li>
            <li> (I open wide to get my teeth as well as possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minimal cleaning as compared to earlier models.</li>
            <li> I havent charged it in over 2 weeks to see how long the battery lasts, its still going.</li>
            <li> I had another brand of sonic toothbrush before this one and expected the Sonicare to feel the same.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush would shut off long before the two minutes is up</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As for me I like it because they battery lasts long</li>
            <li> That also happens to be how long the warranty was.</li>
            <li> The technology has come a long way.</li>
            <li> and I will fully stick with this company as long as they keep making quality products.</li>
            <li> maybe that&#x27;s as long as one is supposed to brush.</li>
            <li> so you know how long to brush each &amp;#34;section&amp;#34; of your mouth (the booklet that comes with it tells you about the sections).</li>
            <li> Long use before recharging is needed.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The battery on it lasts extremely long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit came with just one brush head, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for a long time now and haven&#x27;t had the money to do it until now when it was on sale.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare however, is a considerable improvement in a few ways over the Oral B models I have used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for how long Sonicare will continue to provide replaceable heads for those, so I went with the cheapest model that uses the newest heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think Amazon should improve in this area, they should always know the warranty information about the product on their site, not direct customers to the manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it lasted so long</li>
            <li> However, it seems like a long time before the timer gets engaged.</li>
            <li> Battery stays charged for a long time maybe 20-30 cleanings.   </li>
            <li> I hope this replacement lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> It felt strange allowing the toothbrush do all of the work...</li>
            <li> Now I wish I had not waited so long.</li>
            <li> I had one a long time ago</li>
            <li> It stops for an instant every 30 sec.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long</li>
            <li> Not to mention a decently long warranty.</li>
            <li> The battery on this one doesn&#x27;t seem to stay charged as long as the one I replaced.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing staying with that old version.  </li>
            <li> Well, I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited this long.</li>
            <li> I fought using an electric toothbrush for a long time but my dentist has been pushing it and my hygienist recommended this one.</li>
            <li> I won;t go into a long rambling discussion about the qualities of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> (It still needs to be cleaned often as it is not completely sealed.)  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly long charge.  </li>
            <li> There is not space in the charge unit to store excess cord and cord is long.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get freaked out by the way it feels because it is a strange feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so R&amp;D costshave been recouped a long time ago.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After 1 year and 7 months, the toothbrush started to act strangely.  </li>
            <li> no matter how long I brush.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, too.</li>
            <li> When this arrived it was obvious that it had been opened and closed up again.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I am a long time</li>
            <li> close shave approaching wet, razor shave.  </li>
            <li> Long intervals between charging.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Fits inside my travel kit, sturdy, works thus far (have had it for a few months).  </li>
            <li> you are going on a REALLY LONG trip,</li>
            <li> Stays charged for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> so the user can decide how long to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> advice is to buy a basic electric toothbrush that fits your individual preference (round or traditional brush head).  </li>
            <li> It seems to keep charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, one charge on this thing lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;FAST SHIPPING...</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement brush heads and plan to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought two minutes was going to be a tediously long amount of time</li>
            <li> The battery lasts an incredibly long time; over a week between charges.</li>
            <li> After a few months, lots of noise and not a lot of action.</li>
            <li> Problem is, my sample didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare - the first one lasted 5 years - and there seems to be a change for the worse in terms of quality control.  </li>
            <li> The head base is smaller compared to my old Sonicare toothbrush, but i like it better.  </li>
            <li> This model has a smaller brush head which is easier to keep clean than the older model with the larger base at brush head attachment.  </li>
            <li> This new design means no gross pond scum growing in the cap-like thingy.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are less expensive than many of the others.</li>
            <li> Also I am glad this uses a much less expensive replacement brush type.</li>
            <li> Did everything it was supposed to do for less money than the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> and I like this less expensive one much better.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend the compact version of this brush as it does not have the same bristle configuration and lasts even less time than the standard size</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a simple function and yet it has made brushing my teeth less of a chore.</li>
            <li> It does everything the more expensive ones do for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> so does that mean this isn&#x27;t cleaning as much?  </li>
            <li> The EasyClean model represents a big improvement over previous models and avoids the gross buildup present in other Sonicares.</li>
            <li> Anything more expensive does not really provide anything extra (despite what the marketing department wants you to believe), and anything less expensive uses the old brush heads.</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago I bought one of the more expensive Sonicare models and it broke after about a year.  </li>
            <li> I definitely swear by them and recommend them over any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It also required daily cleaning to prevent the buildup of mold and other gunk.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this one and wondered why it took me so long to switch to electric!</li>
            <li> Yep, I will never go back to any other type of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Same &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; brush head as the other brushes&lt;br /&gt;4) 2 minute timer to allow for 30 seconds of brushing per quadrant in your mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have pretty weak teeth</li>
            <li> With regular flossing and brushing your dental bills should be minimal!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without a Sonicare toothbrush!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a really weak model</li>
            <li> Dentist, hygenist, and myself all notice a difference - no longer causing major gum recession and little time in hygenist chair for cleanings.</li>
            <li> Product is well made and is quiet compared to other Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> The brushes hardly moved compared to my older Essence.  </li>
            <li> Holds its charge for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time and the size is great--not bulky</li>
            <li> Also very long battery cycle between charges.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very minor issue,  you can still feel the pause</li>
            <li> Also the battery lasted a very long time. ..</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds its charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This was less than half the cost of a new FlexCare.</li>
            <li> would think it should be sealed and stayed dry inside, but</li>
            <li> so it can dry out fully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it sucks compared to my older one</li>
            <li> Previous models have been wide enough to result in occasional collisions with front teeth when reaching rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You generally get a little bleeding when you start with an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I’ve been using it for a few weeks and consider it a major improvement over the Essence series.</li>
            <li> Like small size and closed brush to base design because easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Still, two years of clean teeth and no gum problems isn&#x27;t bad, especially since when I team it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine anti-plaque and whitening toothpaste, my dentist apparently doesn&#x27;t notice that I haven&#x27;t been flossing.</li>
            <li> Single pole, single hole, single seal.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single issue, and in my experience the battery has lasted longer than advertised on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery lasts forever on a single charge.</li>
            <li> selling the SAME EasyClean brush (HX6511/50) in other countries, a dual voltage charger is NOT always included in non-US markets - instead a single voltage charger sometimes is!</li>
            <li> I would have given it a single star</li>
            <li> Single click on/off.</li>
            <li> When it works, it&#x27;s a 5 star, but since the performance was so limited it gets an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; in my book.</li>
            <li> The previous one lasted quite a long time but finally gave out.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than my other (less expensive)</li>
            <li> I have a Healthy White model from about two years ago and when the brush head is pulled off the soft gasket material at the base is black with mildew.  </li>
            <li> This model is not powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> well, the first 10 months, then it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> My dentist warned me not to let the brush sit too long on one area and be careful around my gumline, or it could wear away the enamel.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads are expensive but I suppose that is true of all these devices.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m curious to see how long the life of the battery is on these newer models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the least expensive model I could find with the better charging and head-type, but without all the extra features (and cost).</li>
            <li> Not to mention if you didn&#x27;t do a good job rinsing it out, you could sometimes taste the old nasty toothpaste gunk that hid out in the hollow portion of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The only issue with these Sonicare toothbrushes is cleaning the base, which requires a bit more maintenance than a regular throw-away toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I spent a really long time researcher which Sonicare to get.</li>
            <li> The stem starts getting loose in 6 to 9 months and becomes unusable in 9 to 12 months.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement to my HX6950 because the metal tip where the brush head connects became loose and fell off after being dropped.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads on the Oral-B were always too loose</li>
            <li> After two weeks of owning the Easy Clean the little tiny metal part that it sits on to charger base snapped off!  </li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has truly enhanced my daily brushing, hands down</li>
            <li> I ordered this slimmed down version of the toothbrush because I have a similar toothbrush at my winter home in Florida.  </li>
            <li> Also, the charging base is simple (and it charged quickly) and I personally like that there aren&#x27;t extra decorations and details in different colors attached to this thing.</li>
            <li> and then I finally broke down and bought this.</li>
            <li> It is a little annoying but the upside of a clean brush is worth it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, just a few months after receiving the replacement (which I assume was refurbished) it crapped out in the same way as the original.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the new product with a slimmer handle and less intrusive base.</li>
            <li> No more following brushings with a toothpick to get what lesser brushes won&#x27;t budge.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the same model that I had previously.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Sonicare brush that was cheaper and larger</li>
            <li> back to the Oral-B Pulsar, a packet with 4 units for less than U$15,00.</li>
            <li> Even though I previously used an OralB, the &#x27;sonic&#x27; speed of this brush makes for a different experience.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m less likely to skip brushing in the morning if I&#x27;m in a rush for some reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you drink coffee or black tea (especially tea)</li>
            <li> Beware that more expensive is NOT better.</li>
            <li> The small base is great too.</li>
            <li> The Hx6511/50 has a slightly different design in this area which uses less of the rubber protector, so hopefully it won&#x27;t be an issue, but I would still remove the brush head after cleaning anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Sonicare is smaller and lighter than the previous model we use.  </li>
            <li> Our previous models were 110 only.  </li>
            <li> The charger is smaller and less obtrusive.</li>
            <li> The charging stand is smaller too, taking up less space.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted about 18 months, which I thought was a bit short given the price.  </li>
            <li> but this one does the same job for a lot less.</li>
            <li> It was a different design from my previous one, is curved and has no washers separating the pieces.  </li>
            <li> A big improvement over the previous model I had.  </li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to using this item because the vibrations can be a little aggressive, but once you&#x27;ve got it down there is no going back to a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Again, every other Sonicare models other than this one require a screw tight fit which isn&#x27;t so tight after a few rings of dried bacteria form on the threads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having hated the Sonicare E-series I had years ago, I was pleased to see this new slim design.</li>
            <li> I read many bad reviews but they must have gotten defective ones as I have never had a single problem with any of mine.</li>
            <li> After 7 years my original Sonicare began turnning itself off and on, which can be very disturbing in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days to get used to an electric toothbrush, but I am glad I selected the less complicated HX6511 model.</li>
            <li> Having the heads that snap right on the base keeps the handle clean (whereas other models have the little ring things and water and crud buildup there).</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted well over 5 years - I only updated because I wanted one that had a smaller base &amp; looked more updated.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> - the heads take a little bit of effort to remove and re-attach -- nothing burdensome, but not the swift deal that the prior version entailed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a month now and my teeth are almost white again.</li>
            <li> A little smaller and lighter&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I wish the head was a little bigger, I was use to a Crest Spin Brush Pro -</li>
            <li> The individual heads are quite pricey $8-$10 each, but can be bought in packs of 2-4 to save a little bit.</li>
            <li> I Wish the brush was a little larger.</li>
            <li> Their other multi-function ones also have a high failure rate unlike this model</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brush attached to the handle with collar system that was very difficult to keep clean and was generally gross.  </li>
            <li> To a large extent, I find the wide array of brushes unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> it is hard to change my toothbrushing method from the old, manual brush)</li>
            <li> Not too soft and not too hard as to bruise my gums.  </li>
            <li> This model has a snap-on head which is really, really, really tough to get off, definitely not meant to be switched out multiple times a day for multiple users.</li>
            <li> Would be kinda hard to go back to a basic toothbrush</li>
            <li> Hard to go back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> It has too many functions which can go bad</li>
            <li> Only issue I have is that it randomly turns off in the middle of use at times forcing me to waste an extra second of my life turning it back on.</li>
            <li> I went through about 4 of them, with at least a couple different types, and the story was always the same.</li>
            <li> I think they have imporved the batterys over the past 20 years, how long I&#x27;ve been buying this basic model.</li>
            <li> I thought the 30 second warning beep was silly but it turns out to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Some of the more expensive models have a lot of features I would consider useless such as different speed settings and the UV cleaner.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve never bought an expensive toothbrush, don&#x27;t let the price spook you, this product is well worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> I spent $79 for it.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for 3 months and it has performed as expected.  </li>
            <li> HX6972/10.  I have been using Sonicare brushes for roughly 3 years now.  </li>
            <li> Getting beyond what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> Someone had carefully opened and resealed it.  </li>
            <li> i wish it didn&#x27;t shut off after 60 sec.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t pay attention to the time and am careful to always keep the brush moving.  </li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> and the head is not very worn</li>
            <li> The Oral B was quite harsh, and I personally avoided letting it touch my gums.</li>
            <li> Green LED instead of blue.</li>
            <li> but we were careful to wipe them after each use so maybe that helped.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks for the Easyclean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military</li>
            <li> The bristles, brush head size and handle exceed what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, but it stopped working properly after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I bought a basic Sonicare a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Be careful with is brush.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to throw my copy of the rebate from in the recycling bin and toss the cardboard box (minus the UPC bar code I had cut out and submitted) into the cardboard recycling box.</li>
            <li> I must be rough on these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Though I have not yet been back to have my results checked yet, my teeth and gums feel cleaner and stronger after just a few weeks use.</li>
            <li> Its not as heavy as the FC making it feel a bit &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;, but I gather that&#x27;s because the battery is smaller.</li>
            <li> A few years back my Sonicare stopped working</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> you really do not replace the heads that often.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the gimmicks, I have had them all, and at the end of the day this one works just the same as the highest price ones.  </li>
            <li> but I find the button to turn it on is much harder to work than another brand I had.  </li>
            <li> This model is SO much easier to keep clean than the previous type with the \\&quot;gunk trapping\\&quot; brush base.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 second warning and effeciency of brush; just wish the brush head was round as I was used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A smaller charging base for better packaging in travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the manual suggests; guiding the toothbrush slowly, instead of actual scrubbing is all that is required for desired results in only two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bigger, more stable charging base with places to store brush heads</li>
            <li> I am a vine member and got a different kind of Phillips as part of the program (something with ultrasonic cleaning capability) and I hated it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be nice if the charging base had some way to fold the cord up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the proper technique down where it isn&#x27;t dripping down the toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> Our biggest concern with the brush was the head assembly that would get gummy, moldy, and just plain gross.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $15 more and the cost of the actual brush heads are going to make the cost of the base unit pointless anyway.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I doubt it will last as long as my earlier model because it seems products just aren&#x27;t built to last.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous, for a tooth brush that cost $70, is supposed to last two years and lasted only one?</li>
            <li> (I always wiped clean and dried the unit after every use, this thing is an expensive toothbrush!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one thing I have changed from the previous Sonicare&#x27;s I have owned, is that the previous two I kept on the charger all the time, but the last one died within about a year, and would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> After the first replacement head i tried to place, the product base broke and was making a loud noise and not functioning properly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely glad I got the less expensive one instead of spending money on all the extra and unnecessary features.</li>
            <li> it works fine, just a little lite weighted, always afraid while its charging it will fall over, would of liked a stronger base</li>
            <li> I mean the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode on this is clearly not as powerful as the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode on my HX6711.  </li>
            <li> thing is that the detachable brush and the bottom of the toothbrush gets dirty and you have to clean it once in awhile.</li>
            <li> At first my tickle response was outrageous, but I stayed with it and now enjoy my sonic session, that is timed automatically to shut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since 2002 and bought this to replace an older and tired model.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you use too much force on the brush head, you will eventually bend the metal spindle holding the brush head to the base (and motor).</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, the dual voltage charger and single voltage charger have the same appearance and the same model number: HX6100.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He told me the way the other toothbrushes work, they are too harsh and after extended use will leave like a dark line above the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> This is a little strange if you&#x27;re used to a bunch of foam from the tooth</li>
            <li> the brush head comes loose every time I use it and the noise is deafening!!</li>
            <li> The head actually moves very little compared to the Braun Oral-B system.</li>
            <li> my husband first insisted that we should buy these expensive toothbrushes because the dentist recommended it</li>
            <li> Yes, it vibrates my teeth if I let it touch teeth other than the ones I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles as their other models, but you don&#x27;t need them nor will you ever use them.</li>
            <li> I would explore other manufacturers before purchasing another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> and I literally never used any other mode.</li>
            <li> no more gross stuff</li>
            <li> In other words after a couple of years</li>
            <li> The brush itself is small enough to get around to all areas.  </li>
            <li> I have used Philips toothbrushes in the past, but different models.  </li>
            <li> but this is to point out the difference between this and other Elite models.  </li>
            <li> Every other sonicare I&#x27;ve owned came with one.  </li>
            <li> (all those other features seem to be overkill).  </li>
            <li> I never use either of the other two modes.</li>
            <li> The suggested change time is to change them when the blue strip fades, which usually goes in a month or two.</li>
            <li> I travel to other countries a lot and need the 110-240 charger.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare in the past 12 years.  </li>
            <li> In my personal opinion, the item is too expensive to last only a year and then self-destruct.  </li>
            <li> I found this while I was looking around and researching other things.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> I had that one for two years and NEVER used the other options.</li>
            <li> Other people&#x27;s reviews lead me to this cheaper option.</li>
            <li> We have used thes for years and would not use any other brand.</li>
            <li> My other Sonicare didn&#x27;t have this option</li>
            <li> Next I noticed how small the brush heads are.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep the other as a spare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Sonicares and always valued what they do however</li>
            <li> but I never used the other functions and didn&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand to the other brand.</li>
            <li> The other Sonicare models had modes and features I did not want or need.  </li>
            <li> I am updating these reviews to reflect my discontent with the instructions and warn other users.</li>
            <li> The InterCare are a little smaller and seem a little softer.</li>
            <li> Wish my other toothbrush had died sooner.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my son because he lost his other.  </li>
            <li> In other words, after two years the brush is disposable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need all the other fancy bells and whistles in the line.  </li>
            <li> We usually charge it once every ten days or so.</li>
            <li> I used to place the other models on the sink in their charger but not with this model.</li>
            <li> Small enough to stick in the corner.</li>
            <li> I have owned other Sonic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> other difference is that the Oral B replacement heads are about $2 cheaper than the Sonicare replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I had the Flexcare Plus, but never once used any of the other features.</li>
            <li> I just hope this lasts longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> I compared with Walmart, the Sonicare factory outlet and other online stores.  </li>
            <li> As some other reviewers may have mentioned, the Quadripacer DOES NOT BEEP.  </li>
            <li> The head is small enough for my mouth which has been an issue and it seems to be softer bristles.  </li>
            <li> The effort required by the user is very minimal.</li>
            <li> Very minimal motor</li>
            <li> One head has all green bristles, the other head has a mixture of blue and green.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not good enough that something charges all night long while I&#x27;m not using an outlet and cords are not snared by what&#x27;s plugged in (and taking up space on a pedestal sink</li>
            <li> The only downside is the cost of the 3-pack brush heads which averages around $30 which is a total rip-off.</li>
            <li> Sadly the unit stopped taking charge and would randomly start on and off by it own.</li>
            <li> It has held up to heavy use, and only needs recharging every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy the Sonicare toothbrush because I did not know if there was a better one, in spite of the fact that I was disappointed with my previous Sonicare because once the batteries die you can&#x27;t buy a replacement battery or send it to Philips to be refurbished.</li>
            <li> less stains, less plaque, minimal tartar build up and extremely healthier gums.</li>
            <li> This thing is no joke, it blows all the other ones i had hands down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not abusing this product, don&#x27;t press too hard, and have been very careful with this third unit.</li>
            <li> the little spigot that the brush rests on, combined with the base&#x27;s very small footprint, doesn&#x27;t really hold it securely and I&#x27;ve already knocked or dropped the brush on the floor as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but for the amount I spent I think its ridiculous that I can&#x27;t simply replace a battery to keep on using it.  </li>
            <li> My toothbrush died less than one month after the warranty expired and Philips was not willing to replace it.  </li>
            <li> It also has a slightly slimmer handle than other models and brands and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> My Easyclean came with a standard hard brush.</li>
            <li> The brush was too big for my mouth and the bristles were too hard.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish Philips would have included was a hard plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to get used to the vibration, but now it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner than when I use a regular toothbrush, plus I know that I&#x27;m not brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I would brush too hard with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist because I have brushed too hard over the years.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems long (no recollection of excessive charging).  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not cheap, but a small investment relative to the benefit.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t disable the timer</li>
            <li> When the gunk buildup was too much to deal with and the battery started to fail, I bought the HX6511.  </li>
            <li> or so I spent last time on a toothbrush that had features that only made it more difficult and annoying to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird when the plastic brush head hits a tooth and my whole head vibrates, again,</li>
            <li> The only negative is I have arthritic hands and often unintentionally turn it off while I am holding it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> They will send my complaint to the proper department?</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34</li>
            <li> charger base is a better design - no place for dirt to accumulate</li>
            <li> There is not much to getting these things to work, but mine was dead in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking once I am sure where I want to keep the charging base</li>
            <li> So, I love this one&#x27;s pin design and compact base.</li>
            <li> and I loved it...except it would get nasty where the head connected to the wand.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s neat, least I think it&#x27;s neat -- is that if you push the power button once, and then again in less than I believe 30 seconds, you can continue to go back to that timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It is slightly slimmer and the charging base seems much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that the handle could be non-slip, as my hand starts to slide when water and toothpaste manage to run down it</li>
            <li> It comes down to this</li>
            <li> You need to turn the charger upside down to see it.  </li>
            <li> Have to wipe my sink down after each use or there are splatter drops on all surrounding surfaces.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush broke down after about 16 months of use.  </li>
            <li> I do not like that it cannot be set down on the counter without rolling onto a side.  </li>
            <li> This means that  after putting on toothpaste it can&#x27;t be set down on the counter without the toothpaste contacting the surface.  </li>
            <li> I can see why Sonicare has such a loyal customer base.</li>
            <li> falling down.  </li>
            <li> Also, at the end of every cleaning, I have to wipe down my mirror and faucet and cabinets.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush handle fits all other Philips heads, so I can use the primo diamond tip!</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a new charger I decided to change to the EasyClean 500 series because it eliminates the problem I had with gunk collecting inside the brush heads of the Essence brushes (gross, nasty, hard to clean stuff), and it has a dual voltage charger (100-240V).</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very expensive and wear out too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am late for a cleaning by several months, and I feel like this product is actually getting my teeth ready for the cleaning so that it won&#x27;t be so painful.</li>
            <li> Moisture doesn&#x27;t get inbetween the brush head attachment and the handle nearly as badly as the original model.</li>
            <li> I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to an Oral B version, the full-blown, gimmicky one with the timer and clock and other whizz-bangs and doo-dads.  </li>
            <li> Very small gap between the body and the brush head are the only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The basic brush handle is slim and has a very small footprint.</li>
            <li> I replaced an Oral-B Sonic with this unit due to a dead battery.</li>
            <li> for performance, I&#x27;ve used the the EasyClean toothbrush for a few weeks now and it does make my teeth feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34;  That said, I often have to restart the cycle because I feel I have missed spots due to its bulky brush head.  </li>
            <li> The handle and stalk is also less bulky.  </li>
            <li> If I had the charger for the previous model, I would throw this one out.</li>
            <li> or so you are left with a useless piece of equipment that you simply have to throw away.  </li>
            <li> The handle is half the size of my previous models.</li>
            <li> He says it uses less toothepaste and cleans well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s predecessor lasted less than 2 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like on the sonicare an actual toothbrush head instead of a circular head that is difficult cleaning for 30 seconds for a quarter of your mouth trying to hit each tooth front, back and underneath.</li>
            <li> They both stopped working in a year or less.</li>
            <li> The oral b Vitality I had previously lasted longer than this item which is why I&#x27;m won&#x27;t be purchasing another Sonicare item.</li>
            <li> For over one and a half months now I&#x27;ve used this device.  </li>
            <li> I never took oral hygiene seriously until I started to physically notice it on my teeth (the woes of being an arrogant teenager).  </li>
            <li> In fact, it is the redesign of the brush heads that make the newer Sonicare HX series so much less</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get a Phillips toothbrush because they would do less damage to my crowns.</li>
            <li> All the features of the more expensive models seem useless</li>
            <li> + years of manual  brushing forgotten in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, there was this model, which there was a coupon for, thus making it about fifty dollars less than the model</li>
            <li> We purchased this as replacement to our previous Sonicare which we used for 9 years.</li>
            <li> Each time the toothbrush lasted me less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Sonicare brush that had the screw-on brush heads.</li>
            <li> My previous one lasted just about 3 years and had stopped charging.</li>
            <li> It quit charging after less than a year.</li>
            <li> This simpler version has one less button, which means one less button to hit accidentally while brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentler than my previous brush, too.   </li>
            <li> The HX6511 was half the price and lighter.  </li>
            <li> And without the rubber grip it becomes much less ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> I do wish the heads were a bit smaller because cleaning the bottom front teeth in back is difficult.  </li>
            <li> The snap on heads (like this model) collect much less grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just hope that it lasts 10 years like the previous model.  </li>
            <li> no grocery store battery - run brush does even half what this one does.</li>
            <li> I prefer the OEM heads after trying to save money with the less pricey copys.</li>
            <li> It takes less counter space.</li>
            <li> I can tell when I have my teeth cleaned how much less work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle for less.</li>
            <li> I paid less for this one too.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Previous to that</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare died and I ordered this to replace it.</li>
            <li> It works well and my dentist says I have less tartar that has to be cleaned off.</li>
            <li> I did previously.</li>
            <li> My second Sonicare started to not function properly just shy of the one year warranty and Philips</li>
            <li> As a replacement for a previous Sonicare, it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning (obviously) and every night after flossing every day without fail for the following</li>
            <li> My hygienist told the dentist when he came in for the final checkup that she noted serious improvements</li>
            <li> Price was about $30 less than in the store</li>
            <li> My dentist has less and less to do since I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older model that failed on me.  </li>
            <li> No fancy case, a basic charging stand, and what I see as a bonus - no special cleaning modes or timing modes - which are useless and get activated too easily by an extra button on the handle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be frustrated a minute later, so I said I&#x27;d try back, scrolled down at their site to the number at the bottom and spoke to a rep, who told me my experience was the norm with that model - at the same time apologizing!</li>
            <li> binaries.&lt;br /&gt;Patriarchy is so destructive, even for inanimate objects.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this brush has really opened me up to the beauty and diversity of this crazy, mixed up world we live</li>
            <li> The rubber grip on my Oral B would get dirty with toothpaste residue and was hard to clean and keep sanitary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different electric toothbrushes in the past and couldn&#x27;t get past that feeling like it was scrambling my brains.</li>
            <li> I took it off and it&#x27;s still going, so battery lasts long (I used it at least twice a day).</li>
            <li> Mentally I just could not get past it no matter</li>
            <li> While the EasyClean&#x27;s handle is lighter and more ergonomically designed than those of the E-series, I&#x27;m disappointed to say that I still find its brush head design to be messy and cumbersome to use if you have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> Wish the grip was a little less slippery.</li>
            <li> In the old models, gunk built up inside the brush head and it was disgusting to clean out.</li>
            <li> I hide the charger beneath the sink and then every few months the toothbrush &amp;#34;tells&amp;#34; you that it needs to be charged by buzzing and shutting down.</li>
            <li> (I packed it too tightly in a suitcase without taking the brushhead off-oops)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less intrusive on the bathroom countertop because the base is much more compact than in the past.</li>
            <li> I called Sonicare for a replacement toothbrush and charger, but they said they were required to only provide the base first</li>
            <li> It has the 30 second quadrant timer, but not the programs, which are of no use to me and are somewhat confusing if you get into one and are not sure how to escape.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, my previous one died.</li>
            <li> It has very little power, it just does not have the power of other ones I have had.</li>
            <li> Also keep little cap on it.</li>
            <li> That one came with a little stand to hold a pair of heads, for two users.</li>
            <li> It takes up little counter space because of the compact charging unit.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to as the vibration can give an almost &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you&#x27;d want any of the other Sonicares.</li>
            <li> The other models offer bells and whistles that I never used in the past so why pay for them.  </li>
            <li> It has a two minute timer with little &amp;#34;alarms&amp;#34; so you get all your teeth....</li>
            <li> but wish it stayed on a little longer.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and people said moisture might have gotten inside to the inside circuit board and caused a malfunction.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a thorough job of cleaning my teeth with the little beeps to remind one of switching zones in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i like the concept and like it when it works but have little confidence in the quality of the battery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December 2013 so have been using it for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> it feels a little weaker when brushing.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to</li>
            <li> My dentist comments on how little plaque I have on my teeth now.</li>
            <li> If you are still a little skeptical,which I was at first,think of it this way.</li>
            <li> A little noisy but</li>
            <li> and i have not had to recharge it in its little holster once yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little</li>
            <li> I like this little guy.  </li>
            <li> The Flexcare had features I never used and it lasted a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I think this brush is a little quiter.  </li>
            <li> Just like the other ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this model less than a month when the charging light stopped turning off and instead remains on whenever the unit is in its base.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be disappointed as your teeth feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> so you neither waste time, nor spend too little time on your teeth.</li>
            <li> If you do get it be be careful and don&#x27;t push it too hard against your gums.</li>
            <li> The base is very light weight and small, it tips over all the time!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, but how could I complain after getting that much use out of it?  </li>
            <li> I figured the battery needed to be replaced, but imagine my disappointment when I found out that this cannot be done because this toothbrush was designed in such a way that you can&#x27;t simply replace a battery.  </li>
            <li> In spite of careful care and storage, lasted only 13 months; now the vibrating brushhead motion stops and starts randomly while turned on.  </li>
            <li> Wiping-down the charging base whenever it appears anything less than clean with a multipurpose cleaner has always worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had thought that anything by Phillips would be of the same caliber, but this product was an immense disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric toothbrush for years, but they were always heavy and clunky.</li>
            <li> I guess quality control is dead</li>
            <li> The base is so light that the kink in the cord from being packed twists the unit, making it fall over.  </li>
            <li> A few additional observations I&#x27;d like to make.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace my dead Sonicare</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the Oral B.  </li>
            <li> I thought the battery was dead</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I fully charge it, use it until the battery is dead, then charge it again.</li>
            <li> brush heads are not cheap</li>
            <li> We bought it in December, and it was dead by November.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks to get used to</li>
            <li> OK, I did that and upon opening the base, I realized there were 2 tiny copper wires that connect the base cap directly to the circuit board, as a result</li>
            <li> As you can see, there were a lot moisture got trapped inside the unit</li>
            <li> I turned it off (just hold the on-button for a few seconds and it will buzz letting you know it&#x27;s off).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and is still running well.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> This review will compare the Sonicare to the Cybersonic II, even though the Cybersonic II is not available.  </li>
            <li> I thought that all the newer Sonicares that use the proresults brush heads are the same, except for some unnecessary buttons and brush modes.</li>
            <li> the sensation of brushing takes a few weeks to get used to</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> So he advised me that they can ship it to my friend in US, and my friend can help ship it to me.&lt;br /&gt;That is just too much trouble, so I asked is there anything I can do to fix it by myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recommend buying replacement toothbrush heads as you need to replace them every few months for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have trouble with the battery or</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few hours</li>
            <li> it will show you the few things you need to do to keep the brush working well and how the timing mechanism works.</li>
            <li> It is like getting my teeth cleaned everyday.</li>
            <li> toothbrush itself is not cheap, but is well priced through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Combined with a Waterpick water flosser, I feel like I have stepped out of the dentist everyday.</li>
            <li> The one thing missing with this brush is a travel case.  </li>
            <li> and I left the charger behind.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper alternatives.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of use my teeth are noticeably whiter and my gums have never been healthier.</li>
            <li> These provide all of the necessary functions without a bunch of unnecessary window dressing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the toothbrush but was missing two of the three brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few months now</li>
            <li> A FEW TIMES</li>
            <li> My teeth do seem cleaner and healthier after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to pay extra to get unnecessary features.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had come with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of 1&#x27;s, 2&#x27;s and a few 3&#x27;s and no 4&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Now my teeth feel like they have been cleaned by the hygienist everyday.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY ANNOYING THING IS IT PULSE TOO MUCH DURING BRUSHING</li>
            <li> This one works a little differently, and even though it works just as well (if not better), it was a little tough to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I had the older model, which was big and bulky, very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This model does not have all the extra buttons/ settings which she never used on previous models, so it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> You will use less toothpaste too!</li>
            <li> plus it costs less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews about hard bristles</li>
            <li> Phillips EasyClean electric toothbrush seems to be the answer to all the negative comments I&#x27;ve read about other electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Plain jane sonicare but works like a champion.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the minority, but compared to my older Sonicare Elite e7300, this toothbrush is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve yet to clean the base.</li>
            <li> Only down side is the OEM replacement brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought the &amp;#34;fancy electric toothbrush&amp;#34; after some expensive dental visits.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little on the small side, which I think helps to work in the harder-to-reach areas of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> Went with the less expensive model as a 1st purchase, will definitely check into the upgrades when needs replaced.</li>
            <li> more nasty bacteria black mold growth in the bottom of the brush head.</li>
            <li> but usually I want to go another round</li>
            <li> After 6 months of twice-daily use by two people (4 uses per day total), the toothbrush has started to operate unevenly - at random the sound gets annoyingly louder, and/or the vibration weakens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a $150 competitor brand that uses a small circular brush head, and that was a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter to hold, and the charging base is much smaller, so it&#x27;s less obvious and takes up less room on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch takes little pressure which is helpful for me as I occasionally have pain in my knuckles that can make pressing buttons difficult.  </li>
            <li> I like the new brush heads as they do not get dirty and the handle is slimmer.</li>
            <li> The heads (unlike our last Sonicare model) are EXTREMELY difficult to remove, thus making switching them out multiple times daily impossible.</li>
            <li> This brand offers lots of models but the one reviewed is the least expensive and takes care of what needs to be done.  </li>
            <li> I was almost shocked at the difference which made me realize how much plaque I was missing with my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare lasted at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> What an idiot idea, completely at variance with proper brushing procedure.</li>
            <li> It’s smaller and sleeker than my old model; the charging base is compact too.  </li>
            <li> But the old style brush heads got filthy inside even with daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> There is very little space to collect water and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the charging base is lighter than the actual toothbrush and power cord, so I can&#x27;t even get it to stand up easily on the base while trying to charge it.</li>
            <li> The round head of the Oral B brush allows the user to access those hard to reach spots, like the backside of the front teeth and wisdom teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is small and takes up very little room.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s small and compact, with</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always skeptical of the need for a powered toothbrush but the above recommendations bolstered by clinical and scientific data has changed my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called and asked a receptionist to give me the product name and model number and proved the sadistic bastard wrong by simply going to Amazon, finding the product and hitting \\&quot;buy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I, being small, the compact size.</li>
            <li> I have had Sonic toothbrushes in the past, and I am sold on them.  </li>
            <li> No better product out there.</li>
            <li> Purchased small replacement heads because I bought it for my mother for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how&lt;br /&gt;it works</li>
            <li> I have owned them in the past</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to see a charger (which is small btw) laying around the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I wish the base of this was heavier, or larger, as I can barely get my toothbrush to stand in it without falling over.</li>
            <li> I did not like electric toothbrushes in the past</li>
            <li> As one of the lesser expensive toothbrushes, the EasyClean met all of our expectations.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the brush head&#x27;s plastic bag had been torn open.  </li>
            <li> Simple design without the useless bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Only downside is expensive brush head replacements</li>
            <li> I still have 2 refill heads and not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I would start randomly in the middle of the night and bounce around til it ended up in the sink still buzzing.</li>
            <li> it had all of the bells and whistles and mostly never used any of them.</li>
            <li> It has a small brush head that fits my mouth well.  </li>
            <li> The small charging stand, the size of the head,and how it feels on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it came only with one.</li>
            <li> It made a terrible racket, made my gums sore, and didn&#x27;t do any better of a job cleaning my teeth than the manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The small brush-head takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> on a side note, when inserting the brush head, there is meant to be a small gap between the toothbrush handle and the brush head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to replace the battery operated version (which chewed through batteries at an unbelievable rate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since my purchase, I found the replacement heads at my grocery store of all places (price is not necessarily better).</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the replacement brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so lazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am using the brush correctly, but I still feel &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; places on my teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I recently had which failed and not able to get parts.</li>
            <li> my teeth feel polished everyday!</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy for me to brush!  </li>
            <li> The brush just snaps onto the handle, there&#x27;s no more bulky cap-like thing to screw in.  </li>
            <li> I have rheumatoid arthritis (my hands have been compromised for the past fifteen years).  </li>
            <li> usual</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the brush heads were not so expensive,</li>
            <li> In my case, because my mouth is small, I wish I had purchased another Oral B.</li>
            <li> But the material is too slick.</li>
            <li> I had to admit it is a gift for lazy people.</li>
            <li> I scoffed based on past experience, but purchased the Sonicare anyway.</li>
            <li> and I usually want to go for longer.</li>
            <li> within  a few monts of sonicare use, all problems ceased!  </li>
            <li> Not sure of it&#x27;s longevity yet.  </li>
            <li> The brush that comes with the package is very firm, which means you have to buy a softer brush if you don&#x27;t want your gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that both the charging base and the female charging connector on the toothbrush are both solid plastic.  </li>
            <li> The more expensive model used a rubber sleeve at the base of the metal post that holds the brush.</li>
            <li> , I purchased 4 of these on different dates for each family member and we use the same charging base without having to swap the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d have to keep the whole charger on my counter, but alas, I use this twice a day, and haven&#x27;t charged it in weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still liking it a lot though, just not loving it the same.</li>
            <li> Not a very good decision on my part.</li>
            <li> While this brush works, it is pathetically weak, like the battery is half charged (it&#x27;s fully charged).</li>
            <li> the two minute auto-off feature, no more do I tell my boss I was late to work</li>
            <li> Pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, as I was really looking to improve my brushing.</li>
            <li> What I liked about it is that the brush fits directly into the base, without a &amp;#34;collar&amp;#34; around the point where the two parts meet, and where disgusting debris can collect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because it tickled horribly, but I very quickly got used to it</li>
            <li> Even though I took them apart every day to rinse and dry, they were difficult to keep from getting a mildew buildup.  </li>
            <li> I also learned the hard way you have to brush the toothpaste across all your teeth with the power off, then you have to close your mouth around the brush before you turn it on.</li>
            <li> His gums stopped bleeding because he does not need to brush as hard with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I find that hard to believe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard on the teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push hard when brushing with these sonic-care products.  </li>
            <li> the charging stand hardly takes up any space at all.</li>
            <li> I decided not to go with a toothbrush that had all the bells and whistles, which was hard not to, but I knew in the end</li>
            <li> and I credit them with maintaining my oral health to the point where I hardly ever need any work at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; it is hardly moving...</li>
            <li> and it is really hard to floss,</li>
            <li> My dentist said I brush too hard and my gum line was suffering.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B is tapered so that the wand is thicker toward the brush head making it hard for your hand to slip and turn the brush</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s a bit hard to hold when turned on and vibrating.  </li>
            <li> but maybe I was pressing to hard on my teeth with my manual toothbrush before?</li>
            <li> They would recommend to remove the base with a flat head screwdriver and blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Recently my dentist said that I was continuing to brush too hard, thus dangerously exposing my roots.</li>
            <li> For last couple of years, I was using an expensive Braun model that the dentist who did my gum surgery suggested, but that always felt like a jack hammer in my mouth, and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the round little brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked and disgusted when I pried open the insides of my old brush head bottom--I had to use a screw driver to pop off a plastic disc up inside the old brush attachment.</li>
            <li> The vibrations were also tickling so bad I couldn&#x27;t get near my gums</li>
            <li> At least a month between charges.</li>
            <li> I brush 2-3 times per day and floss, even on really late nights.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed  only a few reviews complaining about noise or vibration issues, so maybe I received a bad model.  </li>
            <li> Finally no cavities to harbor mold, grim, old toothpaste, saliva, etc.</li>
            <li> I had that model for at least 5 years with no problems until I connected the charger to a 220 voltage outlet in Europe.</li>
            <li> BUT I recommend removing at least every couple of days</li>
            <li> If I fully charge this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to put it on the charger again for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> (seems to be somewhat common).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still and all, it&#x27;s easier than manual brushing and apparently at least as efficacious, so</li>
            <li> They admitted this was a common problem with these toothbrushes, but do nothing to address the situation.</li>
            <li> Minus one star because it&#x27;s expensive, replacement brushes, too.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was that I had a dickens of a time finding the brush replacements (it was confusing as to which model goes with what).</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for at least a couple of weeks, but I charge it once a week.</li>
            <li> when you brush your teeth late at night others don&#x27;t get disturbed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I contacted Philips and the customer service rep was rude.</li>
            <li> and it needed to be removed and cleaned out at least once a week.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush sucks.</li>
            <li> Shipping is 7 to 10 business days, which we all know means at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> The old style screw on top would gather that nasty crap inside.  </li>
            <li> The one frustration is that both the brush and the charging base are so lightweight, that the slightest jostling of the cord knocks the whole unit over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean the length of the bristles, I mean the distance from the tip of the toothbrush to where the bristles peter out at the handle</li>
            <li> I have small hands and am weak in the arms.</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as some of the other models, but everything you need.  </li>
            <li> I had a older sonic care which was bulky and use to collect paste between the brush head and base.</li>
            <li> My husband was constantly having interventions ( even horribly unpleasant surgery) for his gums....</li>
            <li> the stand is very small and moves all over when trying to lift off the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head has a very small attachment connecting mechanism: simply a very small recess in the bottom of the brush head component that pushes onto a slim metal rod in the handle.</li>
            <li> The customer service rep said she couldn&#x27;t send a new base, so i waited and waited.</li>
            <li> If they were less expensive and it didn&#x27;t shut off automatically, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Seriously folks - when I switched to electronic toothbrushes it made a world of difference in my oral health.</li>
            <li> head&amp;#34; replacements of less expensive handles.</li>
            <li> On the Philips/OralB decision, have always used the less expensive ones from OralB because of the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li> Now the replacement brush heads are less expensive because they have put the magnets that vibrate the brush head  inside the handle</li>
            <li> This has seriously changed my nightly habits.</li>
            <li> Although the e-series is quite a bit less expensive than the newer models, I was concerned that Phillips would quit manufacturing the heads and, indeed, it appears that they no longer make the e-series handles.</li>
            <li> Our old Sonicare was a brush and fat base, a real waste of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad - I like this toothbrush, but if I have to replace it every 18 months, I&#x27;ll be going back to manual brushes.</li>
            <li> no travel case or charger .. not a good deal, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> Now you won&#x27;t have to throw out this relatively expensive brush after a few months.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> No plastic cap at the bottom of the brush base where lots of germs and old paste to hide like before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will be searching for a brush that will last longer, or at least come with a warranty.</li>
            <li> That is an advantage for travel, especially as the charging base is quite small.  </li>
            <li> I have an E-series brush that still works after several years, but I got sick of cleaning the mold and gunk that would sit in the reservoir of the handle.</li>
            <li> I started using Sonicare toothbrushes several years ago when I was sick of getting my teeth scraped at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I have no recourse after only 7 months.  </li>
            <li> and quits altogether after 2 minutes; you have to restart the dumb thing to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so customers can simply replace a bad battery so they can continue to use what they already have  Sorry, but I don&#x27;t like throwing my money away like that</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a unit that failed - battery bad, low power, wouldn&#x27;t move brush when against teeth.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it was not a great visit.</li>
            <li> Smaller charging base too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the unnecessary bells &amp; whistles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for another Sonic care handle that had broken.  </li>
            <li> 10 business days later I got the base, and the toothbrush still wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li> My family is addicted to our Sonicare toothbrushes.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already broken.</li>
            <li> And BTW, Sonicare stands behind their products.  </li>
            <li> It gets worse.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would destroy my enamel, loosen my fillings, and traumatize my roots.  </li>
            <li> Its already broken...</li>
            <li> I dropped it this morning and must have broken something on the inside.  </li>
            <li> , charger base is much smaller and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the base was a bit larger, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to tip over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I explained I was tired of the game.  </li>
            <li> I was tied of the game</li>
            <li> Results in the base requiring basic support during charging to avoid falling-over.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> So maybe I got a dud base, but it seems they are not all the same.</li>
            <li> and I was still annoyed.  </li>
            <li> &quot; it now means simply removing the brushhead--just pull it off--and running the place where it attaches to the base under water.</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix....</li>
            <li> remaining under the bigger base.</li>
            <li> That stuff annoyed me to no end.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it, my problem is that it&#x27;s always gone before 2 years, this time was 18 months if life.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is quite thin and not bulky.  </li>
            <li> After each brush, I pull the head off, rinse around the base and put the head back on in about 5 - 10</li>
            <li> I had the standard base e series before this.</li>
            <li> Hoping that this will eliminate unnecessary trips to the dentist</li>
            <li> I leave it off the charger daily and put on the base at nights.  </li>
            <li> Buying this product was a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> Smaller charge base.  </li>
            <li> I had to speak with a supervisor because they were only going to send the handle, not the handle and charging base.</li>
            <li> I was told if the replacement handle wasn&#x27;t the problem to call them back and they would send a charging base.</li>
            <li> The supervisor did finally agree to send both the handle and charging base.</li>
            <li> have no connection to Phillips and I am angry over the Flexcare failure.</li>
            <li> That is absurd and seriously takes away from the rating of this brush.</li>
            <li> The new heads just slip over a metal bar and leaves no room for the disgusting gunk to get in there.</li>
            <li> Makes the teeth-cleaning process at the dentist a lot less painful and lengthy.</li>
            <li> life&#x27;s not fair!).</li>
            <li> Being a devoted Sonicare user for about 20 years, I had been living with major disappointment in my last model where the nasty, disgusting, pink &amp; gray slime would build up inside.</li>
            <li> You would think they would want the broken unit to find out what failed</li>
            <li> I use to have the big bulky lowest end model, which I hated and resented.</li>
            <li> Replaced an earlier model with this one because I hated the grunge that would get into the handle.</li>
            <li> Someone told me that is because if you leave it on the base charging all the time, you mess up the battery.</li>
            <li> Just a very very weak brush.  </li>
            <li> Dental hygienist advises against using a the hard bristle brush, which is bad for gums.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get the plaque and would scrub so hard I&#x27;d damage my gums causing roots to show which is painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I trysted with another, O Philips Sonicare,</li>
            <li> My last dental appointment was the worst of my life.  </li>
            <li> I regret it at this point unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Plus at amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a gimmick , but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I find it is difficult to remove the handle from the stand.  </li>
            <li> What you don&#x27;t get is a bunch of needless features.</li>
            <li> One thing that was weird when I tried it was the sonic vibrations will tickle your lips when trying to take care of your front teeth.</li>
            <li> Totally useless</li>
            <li> I tried those and though they &#x27;looked&#x27; the same as the Philips brand heads, they were horrible.</li>
            <li> And according to Amazon, we are unable to return it.</li>
            <li> Anyway I&#x27;m stuck with a expensive piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> We have the newer expensive version of this brush.</li>
            <li> That is an expensive proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The length of the brush head makes it difficult to contain the splatter.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> they sad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the Sonicare</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d forgotten how useless they are for cleaning this tea drinker&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my dentist urged me to buy one.</li>
            <li> Ill be covered.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need all of the useless bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Wrong unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Is there any way to defeat this silly feature?  </li>
            <li> , everything else is useless markup.</li>
            <li> The replacement toothbrush heads aren&#x27;t expensive either.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads can be expensive</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is to heavy for the base.. .  .</li>
            <li> they tell me that they so sorry and  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has stopped working.</li>
            <li> But would I purchase from a company that fails to provide a product as described, and doesn&#x27;t seem to care?  </li>
            <li> All the programs are useless.  </li>
            <li> So, I upgraded to this one because the head seemed to be seated differently and was hoping to avoid that nasty problem altogether.</li>
            <li> My dentist even said don&#x27;t get an expensive one, any one will do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a weird one that loves to brush her teeth and go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these electric toothbrushes in about 4 years and all have failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the company has not resolved the space between the brush head and the battery operated unit part which collects toothpaste and run-off.</li>
            <li> It has a deep vibration that drove my gums and lips insane.  </li>
            <li> I like the slim handle and small charging base for traveling.  </li>
            <li> This happened even after I removed the head after every brush and got water in all the hollow places where the nasty saliva toothpaste mixture could hide.</li>
            <li> The charger base is very small</li>
            <li> The base is very small and should have rubber on bottom to keep it from tipping over.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with the poor reception...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st one that I have been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> I asked for this for my birthday and my family thought I was crazy.</li>
            <li> I have been too chicken to take them out.  </li>
            <li> Cleans like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more slimy, gunky, germ encrusted, unsanitary crap under the brush head!</li>
            <li> Lame!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant feeling either.  </li>
            <li> but it is impossible to find.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I rinsed out the Oral B one, I would end up with a bunch of disgusting gunk on the charging base.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad, though I would check Amazon for coupons from Philips Sonicare as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad toothbrush or</li>
            <li> Is it just a bad model and they are not stocking it</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad unit.  </li>
            <li> Then I figured that maybe I got a bad unit.  </li>
            <li> I also confess that I am a bad brusher.</li>
            <li> I had a bad cleaning and my dentist told me to get one.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a really bad thing.</li>
            <li> Now the bad news.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using the Sonicare, I no longer have to worry about painful scraping.  </li>
            <li> After that painful experience, he bought this toothbrush and loves it.</li>
            <li> , it was almost painful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because my Elite lasted 7 or 8 years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> the options: (a)</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, however, in the touch of the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one this is replacing I&#x27;m disappointed with.  </li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed using this product</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was immediately disappointed -</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with the purchase of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was looking at some seriously bad news before I switched brushes, and I haven&#x27;t had bad news since!</li>
            <li> Annoying if you have a master bath within sight and don&#x27;t want to close the door.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that the base stopped working.</li>
            <li> I called them again and this time insisted they send me a base.</li>
            <li> the base didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> /&gt;However after a couple of years of use, the toothbrush no longer charges when sitting on the base all night.  </li>
            <li> Film-formation is retarded for an appreciably longer time.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t collect stuff in the base</li>
            <li> and then the base charger died and now it&#x27;s not functional anymore.  </li>
            <li> It always got filthy and goopy with toothpaste on the inside.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need an annoying noise to tell me to move to another section of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but there was a gap that led the base to fill with slimy toothpaste sludge.</li>
            <li> and there is no leakage into the base</li>
            <li> And now I just have to throw it away as it can&#x27;t be repaired, which I hate to do.</li>
            <li> The manual says you can leave it on the charging base without diminishing its ability to fully recharge, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have the UV cleaning base from a brush or two ago and that does nothing but wear out the brush head.  </li>
            <li> The recharging base DOES NOT HAVE pegs for two brush heads.</li>
            <li> When you travel, seperate the brush from the base.</li>
            <li> Base connector is plastic and will not take alot of abuse.</li>
            <li> I was also concerned when I read of people dripping water onto the base and shorting out the brush.</li>
            <li> They nor I have any idea whether it is the handle or base or both.</li>
            <li> That makes brushing very expensive!</li>
            <li> Prepare to be shocked and awed with the results!  </li>
            <li> I tried a Braun Oral B, but hated how it felt.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I tried electric toothbrushes; hated them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I prefer this design vs the screw on cap, which gets really nasty inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging system does not have ANY chance of shorting out or shocking anyone since there are no metal contacts exposed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no accumulation of nasty gunk under the head&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the nasty stuff accumulated in the nooks and crannies.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> It looked really nasty.</li>
            <li> Look it up, it&#x27;s an awful procedure that I didn&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> Bad customer service trumps all for me!!!</li>
            <li> If find this VERY annoying.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> been 4 years and still on the same battery and no cavities ... a great investment ... Hold lightly to the teeth as advised by my dentist</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool.  Was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Works better than the older model of SoniCare.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6748ef43ec9adf1b8096721af6b84314]] This is a good news - bad news - good news story of an excellent brush that conked out on me after only 23 months but was still under warranty and quickly replaced by the manufacturer. I would have given it five stars if it had lasted longer. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars because it was wonderful while it worked. I purchased it here in June 2014, and it stopped working 2 days ago (April 17, 2015). I got a whole 10 months out of it. I&#x27;m so disappointed because my Elite lasted 7 or 8 years. This thing will no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> LOVE this tooth brush. I had another Sonicare that died after 4+ years. I was hesitant to spend $$$ to replace it....until I had my 6 month check up at the dentist. Let&#x27;s just say it was not a great visit. I came home and placed my order immediately! I chose this model because I liked how much cleaner this one was. No plastic cap at the bottom of the brush base where lots of germs and old paste to hide like before. Smaller charging base too. I wasn&#x27;t sure if these electric toothbrushes were worth it, but now I know they are. $60 on a tooth brush will save me hundreds at the dentist.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my other Sonicare unit which had to be cleaned out several times a week and still wasn&#x27;t all that clean. This unit doesn&#x27;t collect gooey stuff and cleans in seconds. I have gingivitis and since using the Sonicare I have been getting perfect reports from my hygienist, gums pink and healthy.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. The other Philips toothbrush I had, a sophisticated one with lots of useless buttons, started acting up within a year, so it got replaced under its warranty. Then, over a year later, the same thing happened, except this time I had to throw it away. Someone told me that is because if you leave it on the base charging all the time, you mess up the battery. They don&#x27;t tell you that.&lt;br /&gt;So I got this cheaper one, with one button that does exactly the same thing exactly the same way. And now I unplug it once it&#x27;s charged and almost exhaust the battery before plugging it again to charge.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one with the 1st costing a little more, But this one is just as good...</li>
            <li> It died after 3 years it was good before that. I don&#x27;t know if they offer a warranty but if they did im sure it&#x27;s over. Kind of disappointing electronics don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace an older model who&#x27;s battery finally died after 5 years.  We wanted to make sure it used the same charger and brushes, and it does.  I am happy to say that the new one DOES NOT have the rubber handle that the older one has, which has gotten yellow and mildewed.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my husband first insisted that we should buy these expensive toothbrushes because the dentist recommended it, I pooh-poohed the idea.  But after he bought his, and I used it a couple of times, I had to have one too.  Just makes my teeth feel SO much cleaner than hand-brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargable battery lasts a week or two, and our first toothbrush lasted about 5 years.  There is a guy on eBay who will replace the battery for you, but our toothbrush looked so ratty after 5 years of hard use that we opted to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li> YES!  great design and works well.  Super gum stimulation ;+}</li>
            <li> Cleans my teeth better than a manual brush, and doesn&#x27;t have lots of expensive features I didn&#x27;t need.  Dentist recommended this model, and it is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I never understood the big deal about an electric toothbrush. That is until I used this one. My dentist recommends brushing teeth for two minutes. Two mins with a manual toothbrush seems like an eternity, but with this model the time flies by. I love the little pause it gives me to let me know that I have spent 30 seconds on a particular area and that its time to move on to the next one. Yes, it vibrates my teeth if I let it touch teeth other than the ones I&#x27;m brushing. It&#x27;s a vibrating toothbrush so that is to be expected. While strange at first, you learn to open your jaws a little more and it minimizes the occurrences. My dental hygienist recommends Philips products and didn&#x27;t think all the extra bells and whistles were worth the additional expense. This is the model she recommended and now so do I.</li>
            <li> I used this model less than a month when the charging light stopped turning off and instead remains on whenever the unit is in its base.  When I called Sonicare, the representative gave me the run-around, saying it was not a problem and refusing to give me any explanation about why it happened.  I would swear that the unit also slowed down at the same time, now giving a gentle massage instead of a brisk cleaning.  I loved my original Sonicare, which I used for years, and I also loved the original brush heads, but I feel cheated by this new model.  I am now looking for a different brand of electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and ask myself every time I use it why it took me so long to get one. I think that it&#x27;s completely worth the money you pay for (if not on the more inexpensive side) but that&#x27;s just an added bonus. I do with that the standard brush heads that come with it were more compact in size but if anything I can give them to my dad and he&#x27;ll have no problem using them. Heads are easily interchangeable and easy to keep clean. Great product and already recommended it to someone for them to replace theirs.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase an electric toothbrush after going to the dentist and needing a lot of work. They had a Sonicare on display so I researched it on Amazon when I got home. Some of the more expensive models have a lot of features I would consider useless such as different speed settings and the UV cleaner. I run my brush head under the faucet with the power on to sonic-shake the germs off it. Seems like it should keep the brush head clean. The one thing I don&#x27;t like about Sonicare is the fact that it shuts off after two minutes. I feel rushed even though I know I can turn it back on again. I also learned the hard way you have to brush the toothpaste across all your teeth with the power off, then you have to close your mouth around the brush before you turn it on. I splattered toothpaste all over the place the first time I used it. I do feel that is gives a very good cleaning. So far I have only charged it when I first got it and it hasn&#x27;t needed a recharge in 5 days. I am not crazy about the blinking light during charging. Annoying if you have a master bath within sight and don&#x27;t want to close the door. The price for the replacement heads seems a little high. If they were less expensive and it didn&#x27;t shut off automatically, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric toothbrush upon the recommendation of my dentist, and I am not sorry.  I have been using an electric toothbrush for years, but they were always heavy and clunky. This one is light and very easy to use. It cleans well and when you are finished your mouth feel fresh and clean.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it. Good investment.</li>
            <li> just what i needed. great product.</li>
            <li> Died on my wife 15 months after we bought it and it appears the warranty is only 12 months on this model.  The Phillips warranty return website says I can&#x27;t return it for a replacement.  I&#x27;ve had one of the original Sonicare toothbrushes for over 6 years and have never had a problem.  I guess quality control is dead and they know it as they&#x27;ve shortened the warranty period.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job of cleaning which I can tell just by running my tongue across my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day to help keep my teeth feeling dentist clean. The brush head cost is steep, so I have opted to use a manual brush once a day and I feel like my teeth are still much better off than with manual brushing / flossing alone.</li>
            <li> Simple but good.  Simply Good!</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare years ago, but it went to its reward after long use.  I read a LOT of reviews before purchasing this model.  Philips must not be doing well and to compensate is saving money by making these VERY skinny and removing about half the bristles they had before.  I figure that in another 10 years they will be selling Sonicares with about 10 bristles.  The base is so light that the kink in the cord from being packed twists the unit, making it fall over.  I have to prop it up with a heavier object.  I absolutely LOVED my original Sonicare, but I consider this one trash.  To add insult to injury, I called Philips to see if there were any options with the bristles/brush heads.  The rep I spoke with convinced me to buy their deluxe brush heads, claiming they were much better.  HAH!  Stupidly, I spent more money for brush heads that were the same as this one, just a different color.  Guess that would be my fault.  As the saying goes, fool me once  .  .  .</li>
            <li> Purchased my first about 10 years ago, nothing compares to this toothbrush. Great clean feel and easy on the gums!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For several years I was using a $5 Crest Spinbrush, which was an improvement over a manual toothbrush, but not by that much.  This Sonicare brush is so much better I&#x27;m kicking myself for not getting it years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand makes it easy to keep on my very small sink and it&#x27;s always ready (it cannot become overcharged so you can leave it in the charger at all times).  The timer that stops the brush for an instant every 30 seconds so I know to change quadrants of my mouth is very useful; I doubt I was putting in the full two minutes dentists recommend with the Spinbrush.  The biggest test for the brush&#x27;s effectiveness came today after I ate popcorn.  Seeds were stuck, including one far back between my last two lower teeth.  The very small brush head and powerful strokes effortlessly removed every last bit of food and it was very comfortable even as I worked the very corner of my mouth.  No more following brushings with a toothpick to get what lesser brushes won&#x27;t budge.  Considering the cost of dental work, this brush is sure to pay for itself many times over in the long run.  Some more expensive models have more bells and whistles, but I feel like this perfectly meets my needs.  If I have one nitpick it&#x27;s that the handle could be non-slip, as my hand starts to slide when water and toothpaste manage to run down it (I open wide to get my teeth as well as possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never bought an expensive toothbrush, don&#x27;t let the price spook you, this product is well worth the investment.  Besides, Amazon will let you return it if you don&#x27;t like it so there&#x27;s no risk.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, bought a second one for my travel bag. Doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles as their other models, but you don&#x27;t need them nor will you ever use them. Their other multi-function ones also have a high failure rate unlike this model</li>
            <li> Mine was purchased 3/12 used daily and stopped working in July 2013. I liked that it was easy to clean but such a short life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Oral B Sonic Complete brush that would no longer hold a charge.  This on turns off when the 2 minutes are up.  There is also a whole list of types of toothpaste not to use with it.  It&#x27;s okay, but I am not impressed and would not recommend it.  It is better than the original Sonicare I had years ago.  It&#x27;s brush attached to the handle with collar system that was very difficult to keep clean and was generally gross.  It too had rules about types of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my hubs and my dentist.  I keep going back to my good ol&#x27; manual hand held toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and I am doing what the directions state but it does not seem to get my teeth any cleaner than a regular toothbrush.  I may have to keep trying it for an extended period, but sofar meh.&lt;br /&gt;6/13/14- so I have been using this for about 6 months now.  My gum health has improved a ton.  I got the diamond head replaceable heads now and its like a dentist clean daily.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the same model that I had previously. It was used by two people for two years, until it started to loosen up where the brush head connects. It got many hours of use until the problems started to show up, but it worked great until that happened.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. I love every feature of this toothbrush and it performs exactly as described. The price isn&#x27;t too bad, though I would check Amazon for coupons from Philips Sonicare as well.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE TOOTH BRUSH!</li>
            <li> very good for dental care</li>
            <li> Let me tell you a short story.  I&#x27;ve never had a cavity in my life.  I bought a Sonicare Elite back in 2003, and it was the BEST toothbrush I ever owned.  It lasted a good 8 years before the battery would no longer charge, and due to the nature of it, the battery was unable to be replaced.  Disappointing, but how could I complain after getting that much use out of it?  I decided to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; to an Oral B version, the full-blown, gimmicky one with the timer and clock and other whizz-bangs and doo-dads.  Now 3+ years later guess what? -- I have a cavity.  Yes, I realize it is very unscientific of me to blame it on the Oral B, but you can&#x27;t deny the fact the other brushes (even the manual ones) were doing something a little better than the Oral B was doing.    So, now I&#x27;ve upgraded again, to this toothbrush similar to my original Elite.  What a difference!  Where have you been?  What have I done?  I&#x27;m sorry I trysted with another, O Philips Sonicare, rest assured I will never stray again!  Please forgive me and take me back...    EDIT:  A few additional observations I&#x27;d like to make.  The head feels MUCH more nimble and easier to get into the corners of my mouth than the old SoniCare Elite.  The handle and stalk is also less bulky.  Overall, it&#x27;s a better design than the previous version.  Still loving this brush.  What a difference between this and the Oral B!  Pair this with a good foaming toothpaste, and you&#x27;ll love the results just as much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the old way since I started using this electric toothbrush...Very nice!</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare toothbrush! I&#x27;ve bought one for everyone in my family! Our dentist is pleased too.......  : )</li>
            <li> Replaced my $20 O ral-B with the Easy Clean model.  Read many online reviews about maintenance on the brush/body of the toothbrush and am pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;ve remodeled to keep clean and easy to maintain.  Brushing is easy with preset quad timer.  Best of all teeth feel fresh from the dentist clean.  Sort of expensive for a toothbrush, but well worth it if you like that shiny clean feeling.  Bought both my son and husband the Healthy White model for Christmas and both love it.</li>
            <li> It works great, but takes a while to get used to, the noise level is low as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am enjoying and it eco friendly uses less toothpaste, so waste is less.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare Brush I&#x27;ve owned. The first two lasted around seven years before starting to lose their brushing vigor. This brush is clearly the best design. The head detaches in a very clever way that prevents water  buildup and mold developing. That was the biggest problem I had with the Elite. It is very slender and keeps a charge far longer than any of the other two. At least a month between charges. One tip I learned from the beginning was not to leave the brush on the charger full time - it won&#x27;t keep its charge as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back to this model (and it&#x27;s very minor) is that it did not come with a travel case. This is the first brush I had that didn&#x27;t and I always travel with it. The solution for me was to put it in a ziploc since its length prevents me from using it with an older case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this one...I did a lot of research since the models are all so similar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this electric toothbrush.  I like that it&#x27;s small and compact, with no bells &#x27;n whistles.  And it gets my teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li> dentist says I&#x27;m cleaning great as a result of Sonicare</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 2 weeks so far. I love it, teeth feel really clean after the first use, it gives you that &#x27;&#x27;Just came from a dentist appointment feeling&#x27;&#x27;. Very easy to keep clean. I had it for 2 weeks using it twice a day and I didn&#x27;t put it on the charger yet.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and switch to an electronic toothbrush.  I like Sonicare the best.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare - I had the first one for about 20 years I think and it was about done I think. I love this brush - it does a wonderful job - I had a root canal about 20 years ago and doc recommended it. My dentist and the dental-hygenist also recommend it - I figure they know what they are talking about. It does a great job. Get one if you don&#x27;t already have one!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for mine that broke recently, of another model. This one is quieter, sleeker and seems to do the job well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my dentist and I love it. It is not harsh on your teeth, yet, they are squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare and specifically the Easy Clean model was recommended by our hygienist and seconded by the dentist when I spoke to him about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was always skeptical of the need for a powered toothbrush but the above recommendations bolstered by clinical and scientific data has changed my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I&#x27;ve only had the device for a short time, I find that I enjoy using it and feel (and see) that I am doing a much better job of enhancing my dental health.  I&#x27;ll be looking forward to hearing the verdict during my next cleaning and exam.</li>
            <li> I like it. The battery lasts forever (2 weeks?) of 1x/day brushing. Nice that it doesn&#x27;t grow mold inside like the previous Phillips I had.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare!  I had one years ago and after years of use, went back to an old-school toothbrush.  My dental habits were less than perfect for a few years (I have 3 kids under 3, so if I can brush twice a day, I&#x27;m happy).  My last dental appointment was the worst of my life.  The fact that I was not using an effective toothbrush and wasn&#x27;t flossing enough did me in (soda didn&#x27;t help either).  After spending several hours in the dental chair, I decided no matter what, I was never going to do that again.  I kissed soda goodbye, bought this new Sonicare toothbrush and committed to flossing every single day - no matter what.  It&#x27;s been over 2 months now and I have kept my commitment to my dental care.  I brush 2-3 times per day and floss, even on really late nights.  My teeth still feel as clean as they do after a professional cleaning.  This toothbrush is not only easier to use than a regular toothbrush, but the timer helps immensely.  I don&#x27;t think I ever brushed for 2 full minutes with a reg brush.  I exceed the 2 minutes every time now, just making sure I am thorough.  I am extremely satisfied and highly recommend this Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product-arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I am 60 and my dentist highly recommended a Sonicare product.  After research I found that this one has all the necessary features at the best price.  My choppers felt cleaner and polished after the first use.  I wish the fact that the box contains a travel case had been published because I bought a second travel case because I did not know.</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth much cleaner than a rotary brush or manual one. Easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Received on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Nice improvement over the older model. The handle is slimmer, you don&#x27;t have the cup where the brush attaches which quickly gets slimy where you have to use bleach or peroxide to clean bacteria. The area is sealed so cleaning is much easier. Has a 2 minute shut off with a notification buzz every 30 seconds so you can pace your cleaning</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel wonderful, I&#x27;d never go back to old-fashioned toothbrushes. No complaints.</li>
            <li> recommended to me by my dentist. i noticed a diffrence in my oral health and this product does a great job,clensing my teeth and massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product, and so far it exceeds my expectations. When used properly, it is great for plaque removal that is gentler than brushing manually, especially for anyone with gum recession and exposed roots.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> Inadvertently wrote my review for the brush head.  Please read that.</li>
            <li> This is really a great toothbrush! I love the slender, sleek style. It doesn&#x27;t collect all that toothpaste gunk that previous models did; it&#x27;s a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve done for my teeth, other than flossing. My teeth are whiter and cleaner and my gums are healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been.  My husband started using one as well and has had similar results. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Should have switched from a manual to Sonicare a looong time ago. My husband and I both love our toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a fancier Sonicare, but this one is better- simple, easy to clean, only takes an inch of counter space, does its job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband following his dentist&#x27;s suggestion because of deep grooves in his teeth. He was impressed enough that everyone in the family now has one. Our kids like the professionally clean feeling they now get with little effort. We like the timing modes that can be used to make sure you&#x27;re giving all your teeth ample cleaning time. The one (quick) learning curve was remembering to keep your mouth shut when the brush is on!</li>
            <li> Got this for my guy and of course, he loves it!  It produces great results and it is very convenient to use!  SS</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush will buy another when the time comes</li>
            <li> Having read the description, will a 12-hr.(overnight) charge last a week? I&#x27;m a person who bought the original Sonicare and was happy with it - needed to be charged once a week, if that. I bought the Essence mainly because of its larger brush head. It&#x27;s less than two years old (did not send in the guarantee being told in CA it&#x27;s not binding) and it needs to be charged at the end of the day after charging up all night. If I had the charger for the previous model, I would throw this one out. Before spending money on a new model, I called the Sonicare number, which was picked up by Sahim, whom I could not hear. He then spoke louder. It&#x27;s my experience \\&quot;Can you hear me better now?\\&quot; volume will not be maintained throughout the call and I&#x27;ll be frustrated a minute later, so I said I&#x27;d try back, scrolled down at their site to the number at the bottom and spoke to a rep, who told me my experience was the norm with that model - at the same time apologizing! I was told it should be kept in the charger at all times. This is how Detroit screwed up with \\&quot;planned obsolescence\\&quot; and made it easy for their competitors. Not all of us have a bathroom with more than two outlets. If it&#x27;s not good enough that something charges all night long while I&#x27;m not using an outlet and cords are not snared by what&#x27;s plugged in (and taking up space on a pedestal sink so I barely have access to the faucet) I&#x27;ll start looking around. I agree with those who say quality control went downhill - engineers are prodded by marketers to screw up a good thing - someone tell these people they&#x27;re going backward.</li>
            <li> These are the best electric tooth brushes that there are. We bought 4 to give as gifts because we like how they clean our teeth.</li>
            <li> two years and still working really well. Love it.</li>
            <li> Just had my teeth cleaned by my dentist and he said this is doing a very good job of&lt;br /&gt;keeping my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Must have. Doesnt get dirty like the other models.thisbis the most important feature and exactly what I was looking for after I had a Essence model. Also....Super cleans the teeth. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to floss.</li>
            <li> Minimal cleaning as compared to earlier models.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist  were very pleased I purchased this!  I have shorter checkups now. If you need to amp your cleaning to the next level, do it!  My teeth look great!</li>
            <li> Working to perfection, I&#x27;m happy as a fat lark!</li>
            <li> For the price this is a great toothbrush.  It doesn&#x27;t make your entire face vibrate or feel like there&#x27;s a jackhammer scrubbing your teeth.  Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Great standard eletric toothbrush, no bells and whistles, theres not 3 different modes to choose from, you just turn it on and go. I havent charged it in over 2 weeks to see how long the battery lasts, its still going. Great product</li>
            <li> Very effective at cleaning but so loud it can be heard 2 rooms away!  Manufacturer said the Easy Clean model is the quietest (!!!).  The replacement Easy Clean they sent was as loud as the first. I would explore other manufacturers before purchasing another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> So much better than the older model. Charge last for over a week - no need for charger on trips.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is the best by far.  This comes from my Dentist and Dental Hygienist.</li>
            <li> Stopped working or charging after 5 months. This is the second one that died.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I can&#x27;t wait to brush my teeth every morning and night. And my teeth are definitely much whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has it all: the brushing cycle is not like most electric toothbrush options. It is massaging as well as cleaning. I like the quad-timer which reminds me that it&#x27;s not over yet!</li>
            <li> A great Xmas gift for adults or kids. They love these</li>
            <li> We had an older fancier Sonicare that finally died and we loved it but never used all of the features.  This one takes the same brush heads but has only one setting and its exactly like the one I was used to using.  After 5 years of using a Sonicare my dentist tells me every visit that my teeth and gums look great.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to get used to, but it really does feel like an adequate teeth cleaning</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare toothbrush that I&#x27;ve owned. Before buying this one here, I had an Essence 5300. I&#x27;ve had that thing for years, so I figured rather than buying new heads for the toothbrush, I would upgrade the entire thing. I thought about buying another Essence model, but I decided to get a &amp;#34;nicer&amp;#34; and more expensive model. I regret it at this point unless I&#x27;m doing something wrong. When I got this Sonicare I charged it for about 12 hours just in case, then I proceeded to brush my teeth as I normally would. I immediately noticed the new Sonicare was not NEARLY as strong as my old Sonicare. It is also much quieter. I thought, &amp;#34;Maybe they&#x27;ve improved on these and made them better?&amp;#34; After I was done brushing my teeth I looked at my teeth and I could tell it did not remove all the plaque that I had on my teeth. I then compared it to my old Sonicare and noticed the vibrations from my old Sonicare are MUCH greater than this new one. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad toothbrush or what but it sucks compared to my older one and I&#x27;m really disappointed with my purchase. I gave it 3 stars because it does still does its job - just not nearly as well as my old one which makes me want to just go back to using my old one!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this tooth brush, the only thing that i don&#x27;t like about it....is the brush doesn&#x27;t have a guard on the back of the brush. The previous one that I have does, otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li> My wifes overpriced Dentist had been recommending that she purchase a sonic toothbrush that his office sold at, in his words, \\&quot;a lower price than you can find anywhere\\&quot;. I called and asked a receptionist to give me the product name and model number and proved the sadistic bastard wrong by simply going to Amazon, finding the product and hitting \\&quot;buy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I guess its a good product. I still use the regular old toothbrush. The wife loves it though and thats all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;So, in the future, don&#x27;t believe anything your Dentist tells you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this. I keep it plugged into charger in a cabinet near my bathroom sink. Also keep little cap on it. Bought one for my daughter and she likes it too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Sonicare! My teeth feel so clean, I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over them, haha. I use this with Brushing Rinse (sometimes available on Amazon, sometimes on Vitacost), my teeth and gums have never been healthier and my teeth are so white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Highly recommend this model - more expensive models just have different timing options which I guarantee you&#x27;ll never (or rarely) use. I used to have a higher end model and I literally never used any other mode. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I bought the Diamond Clean brush heads to use with this model, I read that they are compatible but I&#x27;ll update this review for sure when I try it out. The brush heads make a way bigger difference than the model of the toothbrush, I recommend you spend your money on those instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re dentist will be able to tell that you are using a Sonicare, that&#x27;s how good they are!</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare Hx6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Toothbrush is an excellent value at Amazon.com. I bought this for my wife after having one myself for several years. You actually feel the clean. One needs to try it to understand what they mean when they say you can feel the sonic care clean. Your teeth feel clean. However, just remember the first few times it will feel \\&quot;weird\\&quot; my wife said it tickled. You will get a hold of how to hold and use the brush to avoid that feeling. This model for the price offers the best value. Plus at amazon, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The product worked great but completely died after just over a year.  I will try another one but if it has a similar lifespan, that will be the last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Sonicare toothbrush for a month now and I have to say that I like it. This is my first electric toothbrush. I chose this brand because of the heads. The Oral B toothbrushes all have that circular brush head or the dual-moving head. I tried out both on my boyfriend&#x27;s Oral B brush and I didn&#x27;t like them. I like the Sonicare much better because it feels more like a regular toothbrush. It is easier to cover all of the tooth surfaces, especially far back in the mouth. This toothbrush isn&#x27;t bulky like many other electric toothbrushes. It is light and slender. It&#x27;s easy to clean, just pop the head off and rinse. When I first got it I charged it for 24 hours. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month and I haven&#x27;t had to charge it again yet. The \\&quot;travel case and cap\\&quot; that it comes with is just a cheap plastic cover for the actual brush part, so don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking you&#x27;re getting an actual case for the entire brush. The Quadpacer is nice, just a small pause in the vibration every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant. I do wish that it didn&#x27;t turn off automatically after the 2 minutes because I often like to go back and hit the important spots one more time. Also, the Easy-Start ramping up period over the first 2 weeks is a great way to get used to the brush without your gums being aggravated. Overall, I like the toothbrush. My mouth feels cleaner and stays cleaner longer than it does with a regular toothbrush. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any whitening of my teeth like I had hoped, but there is still time. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this style toothbrush becuase it&#x27;s gentler on the gums. A little over a year ago I bought one of the more expensive Sonicare models and it broke after about a year.  Further, I was always pushing the extra buttons on the more expensive model while holding the toothbrush. The more expensive model broke after a year and even though I think that&#x27;s too short of a lifespan, I decided to get another Sonicare anyway.  This model is perfect. It&#x27;s cheaper, and doesn&#x27;t have any of the unnecessary bells &amp; whistles. I don&#x27;t expect this model to last much longer than the previous one, but functionally it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this thing! It really cleans your teeth well and holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Tried this one as my old sonicare with the rare earth magnets is failing after 12 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like comparing cave man tools to a scalpel. and its way underpowered- the sonic part is not here on this model. more like low rumble that shakes your teeth out rather than clean them. not even 20 seconds I could stand with this one,</li>
            <li> switching from manual to electric was smart But Sonicare heads fall off HX6511/50 model after 6 months use of product-try &#x27;shimming&#x27; motor shaft with plastic film-heads stay on a little longer but why go through this bother-just buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush worked great for a year, and then just stopped working.  It appeared the gasket was worn between the brush and the replacable head.  I sent it back, and got another from the company. so customer service was great, about 3 months later it happened AGAIN.  They replaced it with a whole new handle again.  When it happened the third time, they would not honor it because the warranty was two years from the original purchase.  It had been two years and one month from my original purchase.  BUT we went through THREE handles in two years.  I have a series e and it has lasted for years and years.  I will be buying a series e now. This was much easier to clean, but doesn&#x27;t matter if it won&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> Nothing cleans your teeth like an electric toothbrush and this one is just perfect.</li>
            <li> I loved it until it stopped working 2 months after I purchased it.  It won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Sonicare Elite, which died after many years of good service. That one came with a little stand to hold a pair of heads, for two users. A standard size and a compact size brush head fit the handle; my husband used the standard, and I, being small, the compact size. Every day, twice or more often per day,  we would each switch to our personal brush head and when finished brushing, place it back in the stand.  It was very simple to screw the heads on and off.  This version came with no such stand, and while the system makes cleaning easy, it clearly is not designed in contemplation of several-times daily switching of heads - the heads take a little bit of effort to remove and re-attach -- nothing burdensome, but not the swift deal that the prior version entailed.  I wonder how the handle and the heads will stand up to three months of  repeated pulling off and pushing on, 4 or more times a day. It seems as though the manufacturer intended for each user to have his or her own handle - and the price of a single one is considerably higher than the approximately $30 I paid for the original that served us both. Does Philips hope we will buy a separate toothbrush with handle  for every member of the family?  Also, there appear to be no compact brush heads for this model- I am stuck with the too- big- for- my-petite-mouth standard brush head - unless I want to use the one designed for gums, which is small but not the right head for tooth brushing... Philips does make a compact head but not for this handle..</li>
            <li> Very pleased with toothbrush.  It was a gift and my don in law lives it</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a gimmick , but boy was I wrong. This device is simply amazing. No words will do it justice, just buy one . The only problem is there are too many models to choose from. The \\&quot;easy clean\\&quot; seams to give the most bang for the buck .</li>
            <li> Went from manual brush to this, and I can feel my teeth much cleaner after using this. I rarely charge the battery. The heads that come with this are small enough to get in between teeth and vibrate enough on their own to make brushing effortless. A great investment for healthy teeth</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, i bought one after a visit to the hygienist to get my teeth cleaned, and she mentioned (yet again...) how much my teeth would benefit from buying an electric toothbrush. I have been using one of the cheaper ones from Oral B, but one use of the philips sonic care and i am a convert... I&#x27;ll come back after my next teeth cleaning to let you know if it made a difference. Regardless, it feels great...  August 2016 Update: A year and one month after I bought this, the unit died. I went to the amazon page and saw the phone number for Philips customer service. I called and got a replacement handle within one day. It was such a delight! But worked for one day...  I called Philips again, explained the problem and told them in my opinion it&#x27;s not the handle that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s that the base stopped working. The customer service rep said she couldn&#x27;t send a new base, so i waited and waited. This time the new handle took a week and a half to get here.  No matter, I got my new handle, it worked great - for ONE day. I called them again and this time insisted they send me a base. We&#x27;ll see.. I&#x27;ll be back to update y&#x27;all.  August 21, 2016 - guess what? the base didn&#x27;t work...I called to let them know it didn&#x27;t work at all, and the customer service rep - oh, no problem, we&#x27;ll send you another charger... I said NO. I am now without my toothbrush for five weeks. This is ridiculous, for a tooth brush that cost $70, is supposed to last two years and lasted only one? NO, I need you to send me a whole new, brand new in the box retail unit. Charger and handle and top.  She said couldn&#x27;t do that, so i asked to speak to a supervisor. None was available. She asked to put me on hold, put me on hold and STILL couldn&#x27;t get a supervisor.  She said she&#x27;ll get back to me, and never did.  I called again today, spoke to a very nice young man by the name of Cody. They can&#x27;t send a whole new unit because they don&#x27;t have one in their parts department (huh??) so i said, fine, refund half the purchase price and i&#x27;ll buy something else.  he updated me that their escalation team is handling it and will get back to me.... I&#x27;ll keep y&#x27;all posted :)</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush, and I had never used an electric brush.  It works great and is actually fun to use.  I noticed a significant difference in my gums (improvement) within a week.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this toothbrush. His gums stopped bleeding because he does not need to brush as hard with this toothbrush. It leaves his teeth feeling very well cleaned.</li>
            <li> I have had Sonic toothbrushes in the past, and I am sold on them.  This generation of toothbrush is lighter, and the battery stays charged longer.</li>
            <li> I think the product does a nice job cleaning teeth, but my Sonicare became so noisy over a months period that I&#x27;m returning it for a new one.  In my case, the brush head fitting became so loose that it kept falling off. I replaced it with the other brush head that was provided but the product was still very loud and the vibration was still a lot more intense than when I first received the product.  There are two issues I see with this item: first, the body doesn&#x27;t seem to have very durable dampeners within so the item begins to vibrate intensively; second, after tacking the brush off the body several times to clean it, the fit of the brush on the metal pin loses its tightness, so the head begins to magnify the vibration - major tooth chipping potential.  I&#x27;ve noticed  only a few reviews complaining about noise or vibration issues, so maybe I received a bad model.  Hopefully, the replacement will not have the same issue.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning teeth.  It takes up little counter space because of the compact charging unit.  As received, no brush was included in the package.  Amazon offered a complete exchange of the defective unit for a new unit.  Amazon provided one-day shipping of the replacement unit and prepaid shipping of the returned unit.  This was very fair of Amazon because the lack of a brush in the factory-sealed container was not Amazon&#x27;s fault.  The manufacturer, Phillips, needs to practice better quality control of the packaging of their product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush February 17 , 2015 and this is March 31 2015. The toothbrush stopped working and I am not allowed to return it. My window was over March 23.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned Sonicare toothbrushes and loved them but this model was a thinner style and didn&#x27;t last over 4 weeks. I spent $79 for it. Now using a 9.99 electric toothbrush from rite aide and I figure&lt;br /&gt; I will get more for my money in the long run.  And I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare for 20 years. This model is nice because it&#x27;s so slim and has a long charge life.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t use an electric toothbrush these days? This is the best - not that I&#x27;ve used other brands or anything, but sure beats manual brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fully as advertised.  Easy to clean, handle is easy to grip.  Brushes seem to get teeth clean.  I especially like the 30 second timer (for each quadrant) that really helps get my teeth clean.  Highly recomend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Tracks time used and let&#x27;s you know when to proceed to next section for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Piece of JUNK.  Motor burned out after 1 month.  Called Philips and was told this is a problem they&#x27;ve been working on.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY AN ORAL B !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing &amp; just as expected! So happy I got this easy clean model and not the standard. Having a 30 second beep Is such a great feature and makes brushing easier.</li>
            <li> I have only had my Sonicare for about a month but am very pleased with its performance.  The only minor issue I have is that several times while brushing my teeth I inadvertently touched the on/off switch and turned the brush off.  The switch seems to be more sensitive than the switch on previous Sonicare models I have used.</li>
            <li> After owning an older model sonicare for a number of years I could not handle the gross stuff that grew inside the toothbrush anymore. This model is SOOOO much better! no more gross stuff and it works just as well. In fact it&#x27;s a big lighter which is better.</li>
            <li> Packaging is minimalist, akin to receiving the new Apple products. Owning a Philips medical device is very exciting, especially when their next up apparatus likely costs over 10x is sold through the buy-you-lunch sales reps types. I rotated the box just long enough to see it contained what I&#x27;ve been waiting for: the single post / screw-less brush head design.  This is my 4th Sonicare toothbrush, having tried most every model since introduction due to dadDDS. I can say they operate identically. My dad frequently commented on my previous bristle brush hygiene always gave his hygienist extra work, until a few months later after using the bulky original non-pacer Sonicare everything was improved at a time I was eating lots of popcorn and sodas (high school).  I hardly use bristle brushes when I&#x27;m without my Sonicare, preferring to spend 20 minutes with a few peppermint flavored birch toothpicks; the kind that eventually fray flat for good surface scrubbing.  For every Sonicare model I have owned before this one, I would actually skip brushing because the black bacteria would gross me out enough to not want it in my mouth. I really hope the fix for easy cleaning has been made.  Again, every other Sonicare models other than this one require a screw tight fit which isn&#x27;t so tight after a few rings of dried bacteria form on the threads. This led to greatly noticeable reduction in action intensity, sometimes over days time. When you finally catch it, it tells you the gentle action of the last few days was not battery or your stronger gums, but layers of dried bacteria (even with the Philips Sonicare UV Station) non-noticeably rattling the whole mouthpiece.  Single pole, single hole, single seal. Simple. I hope I&#x27;ll be using this one until battery death (then I&#x27;ll erase all this and complain about the battery :)</li>
            <li> Gets my teeth really clean. Easy to use. Like the timer. Doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my counter. Great!</li>
            <li> Good design - easier to keep clean that previous models I have had.</li>
            <li> to this Sonicare Easy Clean toothbrush, you definitely should! Wow I received this brush in the mail about 5 days ago and I am already happy with the results. After the first few brushes, your teeth feel funny from the strong vibrations that you dont get from a regular toothbrush but i definitely loved the smooth after the dentist feel it gave to my teeth. I also love the 2minute timer, and quadspacer which keeps me on track on brushing each part of my mouth equally.</li>
            <li> A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrushes. It is too soon for us to tell, but it seems likely that this design will have far less problems accumulating internal grit and likely will not go dead because of crud accumulating around the internal magnets.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush! I had a previous Sonicare brush that was cheaper and larger (it used the e-series screw-on toothbrush heads), and I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded to this one. I don&#x27;t need all the fancy knickknacks and doodads that are in the more expensive models, and this one definitely does the trick. Mine also came with a carry case, which I REALLY like. (I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t.) I travel frequently so it&#x27;s nice to have a case for it. I&#x27;ll never go back to manual brushes again. Seriously folks - when I switched to electronic toothbrushes it made a world of difference in my oral health. It&#x27;s not just hype. After not having been able to visit a dentist for a couple years, I was told by my dentist to try out the Sonicare and it&#x27;s made SUCH a positive change. I was looking at some seriously bad news before I switched brushes, and I haven&#x27;t had bad news since! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from the older design, which built up a funny odor.  Nice tidy, small design, with good agitation.  No better product out there.</li>
            <li> Wow.  What a difference from the supermarket battery toothbrushes.  Very high-speed vibrations make brushing easy and your mouth feels sort of tingly afterwards.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare Healthy White quit after 3 years, so I downgraded to this model.  Downgrade isn&#x27;t really the right term because the one thing I really missed with the Healthy White was the pause function which allowed me to rinse my mouth and resume brushing without having the timer completely re-set like the Healthy White did.  With all the brush heads now available, I don&#x27;t see the need for the Healthy  White since I really didn&#x27;t use the various functions.  The only downside I see to this brush is that the handle is a bit slippery compared to the matte finish of the Healthy White.  Wish Sonicare would incorporate that feature in he Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;As with all Sonicare models my teeth feel great after using- like after a trip to the dentist and a thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush.  The other two were impossible to keep clean, so I gave it one more try with the Easy Clean.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month and so far it&#x27;s a breeze to keep clean.  If you like the Sonicare but not the cleaning, this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! I had another brand of sonic toothbrush before this one and expected the Sonicare to feel the same. I was pleasantly surprised on my first use. My kids each have one as well, and the Quad Pacer feature is great for making sure they get all of their teeth brushed. My Sonicare was delivered on January 10; it is now February 4 and I have not had to recharge it yet! Great battery life!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. It holds a long charge and leaves moth very refreshed. Philips customer service is great if you have a issue, so buy with confidence. It&#x27;s the best toothbrush you can buy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far so good....it works great...just hope it lasts..my last one died at one year....hope this one lasts longer...hope to get two years!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I use the Sonicare from now on.  And I&#x27;m glad I took her advice.  You can tell a world of difference compared to a manual toothbrush.  You don&#x27;t really need the fancy $200 brush unless you just want to shell out that kind of money.  This particular model does a great job.  If you brush in one area for too long, it will buzz at you to move to the next tooth/area.  It&#x27;s worth the $59 to avoid extra dental work and cost later on down the road.  I will never go back to a manual toothbrush ever again.  Oh, and you get a better price buying it on here than Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  And that&#x27;s with their 20% off coupon, too.</li>
            <li> Cleanings at the dentist arent as invasive since i&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush. My dentist says there is far less buildup than my last O*B electric brush. It has a higher frequency than the Other brand I previously owned. And the brushhead attachment stays cleaner since there is no big cone to buildup crud as in the older model. The charge lasts well over a week also.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush, loved it at first, and it worked really well in the beginning.. well, the first 10 months, then it&#x27;s broken. The battery won&#x27;t get recharged. After charging it for a whole day, it still dies after 5 seconds. Have to drive to gas station in the middle of the night and get a normal overpriced cheap-quality toothbrush. Very disappointed. And when I emailed to get a warranty policy on this product, I was expecting a straightforward answer like &amp;#34;it does not have a warranty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it does come with 1 year warranty&amp;#34;. However, that wasn&#x27;t the case. Amazon emailed me back two days after and sent me a link back to the product page. Is it really that hard just to answer a simple question?&lt;br /&gt;People, don&#x27;t get fooled by the 5 star reviews, the only reason they rate it high is because they have not reached the &amp;#34;breaking&amp;#34; point yet.</li>
            <li> Slimmer handle and really neat.</li>
            <li> I had one years ago and just got another one and now I wonder why I stopped using it back then. Huge step forward for oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Love how clean my teeth feel afterwards!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with the toothbrush.  I find it is difficult to remove the handle from the stand.  the stand is very small and moves all over when trying to lift off the brush. I have used an electric toothbrush for many years.  This is the 1st one that I have been unhappy with.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!  I wish I would have gotten one earlier.</li>
            <li> Stylish and works great.  Very fast vibration frequency.  Very small gap between the body and the brush head are the only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars.</li>
            <li> After using Sonicare Essence for 5 years, I got this one as a replacement. It&#x27;s much lighter and battery last much longer, also looks nice!  I was thinking to get White 710, but this works perfect. If I want to brush more for whiting purpose, just push the button one more time. I feel I saved $15:) I am really happy about the product!</li>
            <li> Great product, my second one in ten years.</li>
            <li> Phillips EasyClean electric toothbrush seems to be the answer to all the negative comments I&#x27;ve read about other electric toothbrushes. It is designed to keep the toothpaste out of the motor and batteries. The charge lasts for about 2 weeks before charging is required. It is sleek and lightweight. Replacement brushes are less expensive than many of the others. I would definitely recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a couple of years ago at the suggestion of my dentist since I tend to build up plaque quickly on my teeth.  After using this toothbrush for a couple of years I have not only felt the difference versus using a manual toothbrush, but I ended up having much better checkups during my dentist visits.  The two minute interval (30 second for each quadrant) takes out all the guess work in having to brush for 2 minutes.  The toothbrush does an excellent job in breaking up plaque and cleaning in areas that a normal toothbrush simply can&#x27;t get to,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However after a couple of years of use, the toothbrush no longer charges when sitting on the base all night.  The toothbrush would shut off long before the two minutes is up and recently it won&#x27;t even stay on for 10 seconds.  I figured the battery needed to be replaced, but imagine my disappointment when I found out that this cannot be done because this toothbrush was designed in such a way that you can&#x27;t simply replace a battery.  In other words after a couple of years or so you are left with a useless piece of equipment that you simply have to throw away.  I don&#x27;t know how much anyone else spent on this toothbrush but for the amount I spent I think its ridiculous that I can&#x27;t simply replace a battery to keep on using it.  Apparently Philips wants you to go out and buy another Sonicare every two years instead of designing their products so customers can simply replace a bad battery so they can continue to use what they already have  Sorry, but I don&#x27;t like throwing my money away like that and while I did like the performance of the Sonicare I refuse to purchase from a company that forces its consumers to purchase new products due to planned obsolescence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not go back to using a manual toothbrush, but the next electronic toothbrush I buy won&#x27;t be from Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothbrush, not so great design.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much yet. But I feel this is a good product. Hopefully my teeth will be in better shape in 6 months :)</li>
            <li> Sensible does the job tooth brush.  I give these as gifts often and people tell me their dentist comments on how much cleaner their teeth are.</li>
            <li> Very please with transaction and with item.</li>
            <li> whatever stank you got going on... this will get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I liked the Philips Sonicare with more settings to choose from a little better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare toothbrush since the original model appeared on infomercials in the 1990s.  This model is my 3rd. Each model has worked well and lasted for years. I expect this to do the same. I find this to be a great improvement over my prior models for a few reasons. First, the size is great. The handle is half the size of my previous models. That means it&#x27;s lighter and more comfortable to hold than previous models. In spite of the smaller size, the battery life is better. I just had to recharge mine for the first time after using for at about 5 or 6 weeks. That means once it&#x27;s at full charge, I can put the charger away and not have it cluttering up space. It also means that when traveling I can leave the charger behind for most trips. Also, there&#x27;s a light on the power button that blinks when power is getting low so you know when to pull out the charger. Finally, this is more powerful than my previous models. Another reviewer said this was not as powerful and insisted he did not have the Easy-start feature activated. I find that hard to believe. I can&#x27;t imagine a Sonicare with more power. (And I do recommend you leave the Easy-start feature on if you&#x27;re not used to Sonicare.)  Improved in every way. Very happy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I hardly take the time to write reviews of things I&#x27;ve purchased but this toothbrush is awesome. My dentist is always telling me how I have plaque build up at certain areas in my mouth and every time I used a regular toothbrush I wouldn&#x27;t get the plaque and would scrub so hard I&#x27;d damage my gums causing roots to show which is painful.  Since I&#x27;ve gotten this toothbrush my teeth feel clean after every brush and it&#x27;s not such a PITA to brush anymore. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for another Sonic care handle that had broken.  I am happy with the simplicity of this handle and recommend it.  It is my preference because it uses just the brush replacements rather than the &amp;#34;whole head&amp;#34; replacements of less expensive handles.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever made. Quiet and TEN times better at removing plaque! My favorite feature is the built in quad-timer than beeps every 30 seconds so you spend the right amount of time on the 4 main surfaces (upper outside, lower outside, upper inside, lower inside)</li>
            <li> Replaced one just like this.. works as stated.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush.  These toothbrushes are like the Terminator to the stains or plaque on your teeth.  There will be no prisoners taken when you unleash the Sonicare toothbrush onto your teeth and gums.  Prepare to be shocked and awed with the results!  Brushing has never been so effective or fun.  Mission accomplished!</li>
            <li> I love the timer which indicates 30 second increments. That way you can brush each row of teeth for the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> The basic Sonicare is excellent. It cleans better overall than the original design (particularly the back molars). Also, the handle is lighter, and the charger compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not pay more (let alone twice) for any of the \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; versions. They clean in exactly the same way as the basic model (same brush, motor, charger), but have options that are largely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the options: (a) For a softer mode, a manual brush with extra-soft bristles (like the Nimbus) is more effective and gentler on the gums, (b) for a \\&quot;deeper\\&quot; mode (just more time), press the button twice instead, and (c) the UV system to \\&quot;sanitize\\&quot; the head by killing bacteria is useless, and provides no real health benefit compared to rinsing the brush.</li>
            <li> It is quiet compared to the OralB I had been using.  It vibrates, pulsates and moves at high frequency as the videos you can see online show, Philips calls it Sonic.  Every 30 seconds there is a brief pause and noise to tell you to move on to the next quarter of your teeth.  After two minutes it shuts off.  You get used to all of the above pretty quickly.  Battery life seems long (no recollection of excessive charging).  The handle/brush are long enough to get to the back teeth without any problems.  The brush itself is small enough to get around to all areas.  Short term quality has been good, long term is to be determined.  But, if you register Philips gives you 2 1/2 years warranty which seems generous.    Clearly an upgrade from the $15-20 OralB electric toothbrush it is replacing.  Lightyears ahead of a manual toothbrush.  If you are in the market for a \\&quot;high end electric toothbrush\\&quot; seems the two real decisions are - how many bells and whistles do you want to pay for and do you go Philips or OralB.  I wanted to go a step above the back and forth or round and round electric toothbrushes but didn&#x27;t want to pay for all the bells and whistles that really don&#x27;t help your teeth or gums.  This model seems like a happy medium point.  On the Philips/OralB decision, have always used the less expensive ones from OralB because of the toothbrush itself.  At the higher end, one trusts the toothbrush itself on the OralB and Philips is a wash.  Philips seemed to me to have more experience and more research into the mechanics at this price point and that tilted me toward the Sonicare.  Would make the same decision today after using it.    All in all, nothing not to like.  I would recommend this Sonicare to anyone looking.</li>
            <li> I used to have an older model Sonicare that lasted me almost six years. It would still work, but was falling apart, so my wife bought me this model. I really liked this model and felt the design was an improvement. However after three months, the toothbrush quit charging. I called Sonicare for a replacement toothbrush and charger, but they said they were required to only provide the base first and if that wouldn&#x27;t work they would send the toothbrush. 10 business days later I got the base, and the toothbrush still wouldn&#x27;t charge. I called again and was told a toothbrush would be sent to me, but they didn&#x27;t have anything in stock and there was no timetable they could give me. That makes me suspicious about what is happening at Sonicare - are quality issues the reason they are out of stock? From having to replace so many toothbrushes? Is it just a bad model and they are not stocking it anymore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t received any answers and am still waiting to hear back from them as to what they will do. Needless to say, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from older model used for over 5 years, so far so good.  Overall happy with purchase, no cons I can think of.  Researched other models, this one fell in the mid-range sweet spot for price and features.  Really light, powerful, good battery life, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for better oral care than conventional toothbrushes.  So far, so good.  No cavities on my latest check-up.  I am also using the Philips Sonicare AirFloss to supplement my brushing routine.  Both products have exceeded my expectations.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> When I needed a new electric toothbrush, I asked my dentist which one I should buy. There are so many options. She said to buy the least expensive one, as they are all good. I&#x27;m very happy with this model, especially because it takes up so little space at my sink.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the money. Does an excellent job. Stays charged for a long time.  Timing feature works well too.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH FEEL GREAT I LOVE HOW IT TELLS ME WHAT TIME IT IS BY TALKING TO MY TEETH</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps my teeth feeling like I just left the dentist after having my teeth cleaned. After having my dentist &amp;#34;suggest&amp;#34; (read &#x27;nag&#x27;) I get an electric toothbrush for years, I finally got this one and I can see why he kept nagging. It has made a huge difference in how my mouth feels.</li>
            <li> I loved this toothbrush for one year, then it died. It was still charging but something broke internally. Which caused it to make a LOT of noise and the head no longer vibrated. My previous Sonicare lasted at least 5 years. When this one worked it worked great but it should have lasted longer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips Sonicare elect. toothbrushes for years. This is the first toothbrush of theirs that solves my problems with the other designs. This EasyClean 500 Series has a slim compact handle--slimmer than any of the others I have used. Love it! And the best design change they made is the easy-to-clean attachment of the brush head to the handle. The brush head has a very small attachment connecting mechanism: simply a very small recess in the bottom of the brush head component that pushes onto a slim metal rod in the handle. Finally no cavities to harbor mold, grim, old toothpaste, saliva, etc. I was shocked and disgusted when I pried open the insides of my old brush head bottom--I had to use a screw driver to pop off a plastic disc up inside the old brush attachment. They should have made these changes years ago!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really, really clean after I use this!  This is a great toothbrush.  Works wonderfully!  I am so glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Easy. There is only one button. It rests every 30 seconds to alert you to change the quadrant of your mouth. Does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I like this model. It gives you the low profile brush heads and a lithium ion battery. What you don&#x27;t get is a bunch of needless features. No fancy case, a basic charging stand, and what I see as a bonus - no special cleaning modes or timing modes - which are useless and get activated too easily by an extra button on the handle. I got 2 for the price of 1 of the highest end models.</li>
            <li> The power on this product is really good. I am disappointed, however, in the touch of the brush. The brush runs so quickly that I can&#x27;t control it on my teeth. I will definitely try another brand when I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  I also have one and love it.  I love the slim handle and the quad reminder is great.  I have been buying Sonicare toothbrushes for years and am always satisfied.  The delivery time was as promised.  Amazon is great!!  Prices are reasonable.  I always check with Amazon before buying anything.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. My hygienist recommended it since I am fighting excess tartar and build up on my teeth. She said to just get the most simple model, no whistles and bells. I agree now that I have it. It does just what I need it to to. A feature i love is the timer that tells you when to move from one area of your mouth to the next, it automatically shuts off when the 2 minutes are up. I find that helpful so I know I brushed long enough. Since switching from a manual toothbrush my teeth feel much cleaner and my gums look very healthy. Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;ll make me switch toothbrushes.  My dentist originally recommended Sonicare nearly 15 years ago.  I like this stlye, Easy Clean, better than my two previous ones.  It&#x27;s light and thin, easy to hold and easy to maneuver around in my mouth.  The 15 second pauses are more valuable than you would think, helps keep you focused in one area until it&#x27;s time to move on.  The on/off switch takes little pressure which is helpful for me as I occasionally have pain in my knuckles that can make pressing buttons difficult.  I usually take a traditional toothbrush when I travel and really don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting my teeth as clean as they should be, but I&#x27;m going to take it on an upcoming 5-day trip and test out the guaranty of a 2-week charge.  Highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling clean every time I use it. I use it once in the morning and once at night for 2 minutes each. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it once yet, so the battery is very good.</li>
            <li> Philips new and smaller but powerful Electric Toothbrush is wonderful - easy to pack and handy to use to keep your teeth healthy and bright</li>
            <li> My last died after a couple years. These are great brushes. I prefer this design vs the screw on cap, which gets really nasty inside. My dental checkups have been great since I&#x27;ve been using</li>
            <li> I just got the toothbrush and I&#x27;m very happy with it. My mouth feels like I just got back from the dentist after using it for two-minutes! Dentist recommend you brush your teeth in sections: Bottom front, bottom back, top front, top back. So after brushing one section for 30-seconds the brush alerts you to move to the next section. It&#x27;s very helpful and it makes brushing fly by without having to watch the time.</li>
            <li> Love this sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he really likes it. He says it uses less toothepaste and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Looks exceptionally nice. Purchased small replacement heads because I bought it for my mother for Christmas. She like the smallest toothbrush she can get. This had excellent ratings and I got a great deal on it.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t live without this toothbrush and will divorce my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous toothbrush for a busy busy individual . I am not sure how&lt;br /&gt;it works but it does. I bought it with the waterpic and my teeth&lt;br /&gt;and gums are very healthy. I bought this under threat from my dental&lt;br /&gt;hygienist and do not regret the investment since I saved money on&lt;br /&gt;the purchase at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son for Christmas and he says it a big improvement over the screw top model!&lt;br /&gt;No goo collecting under the cap like the old model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare fan for many years now and this was actually a replacement for an old one.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and my dental checkups a breeze.</li>
            <li> Product worked fine until it completely failed after 21 months.  Just stopped being able to charge at all.  Will maybe look for another brand now.</li>
            <li> THIS DEVICE REALLY REMOVE FOOD FROM TEETH COMPARES TO MANUAL BRUSH. THE ONLY ANNOYING THING IS IT PULSE TOO MUCH DURING BRUSHING</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare brush before but did not like how it felt.  This new model builds with intensity over time, making it easier to get used the vibration.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It provides the next best thing to a professional dental cleaning. I love the feeling I experience when I have finished brushing. My only question is: Why didn&#x27;t I get this toothbrush years ago?.</li>
            <li> I like my sonicare very much. I just hope that there is no problem with it. I have owned them in the past and I had some issues. I like how clean my teeth feel after I brush.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brushes are great for that just visited the dentist feeling.  The EasyClean model represents a big improvement over previous models and avoids the gross buildup present in other Sonicares.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the original model I had for years finally stopped holding any sort of a charge (6+ years). I much prefer this model since it is so much easier to keep clean. Moisture doesn&#x27;t get inbetween the brush head attachment and the handle nearly as badly as the original model. A vast improvement.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Easy to use. Holds its charge for a very long time.  Easy to clean.  Also makes me brush the full 2 minutes (and I love that it beeps after every 30 seconds so that you know to switch up your brushing area).</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare works great. Dental check-ups are now much better.</li>
            <li> Went with the less expensive model as a 1st purchase, will definitely check into the upgrades when needs replaced. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This 5 star rating is just by looks and only using for a week. I bought this for my bf and he likes it so far. I got it for him since he has sensitive teeth and an unusual fear of the dentist. I was hoping this would solve both and it looks like it is working well so far. As for me I like it because they battery lasts long so I don&#x27;t need to see a charger (which is small btw) laying around the bathroom counter. Also the toothbrush itself is slim - not like the giant sonicare from back in the day at all. So with the right toothbrush holder you could feasibly use that still if you are used to having your toothbrush there. One con is that I read a lot of reviews about these and different versions and people said this version keeps the water/junk out of the brushhead connection. However, the one we received doesn&#x27;t even sit flush with the rest of the brush. So we just take it apart after every use and rinse it. (It is just pull off/push on). I was hoping it would seamlessly fit together so you wouldn&#x27;t have to do that. Maybe it is just this unit... ?</li>
            <li> After feeling the difference over and above a traditional tooth brush, the wife also had to have one. Glad the kids have already moved out or I&#x27;d be buying them one too.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush with this brand specifically recommended by our dentist to protest gums.  Cleans great for adults and kids. Charge lasts forever.  Can travel for weekend without recharging.  Probably longer.</li>
            <li> I had the top of the line model which broke in less than a year. I loved it but couldn&#x27;t justify for a toothbrush that only lasts a therefore I bought the cheaper model. Its good but def not the top of the line.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothbrush for 3 months and it has performed as expected.  I particularly like the timing mechanism that beeps when it is time to move to a different section of my teeth.  I feel confident that all parts of my mouth are getting adequate attention during my tooth brushing activity.  I highly recommend this brush to others.  It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model that was difficult to keep clean.  I love this new model!  It does not get all gunked up and it is very light weight.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips toothbrushes in the past, but different models.  I chose this model because of it&#x27;s slim design.  I have been very pleased.  Simple to use.  Very easy to clean (a good improvement from some previous Sonicares).  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace my dead Sonicare HX6972/10.  I have been using Sonicare brushes for roughly 3 years now.  I noticed after about 3 months of using my first Sonicare brush that my teeth looked whiter and felt cleaner.  I recommend this brush to everyone and swear by it.  The replacement brush tips can be pricey but you should be able to find \\&quot;bulk\\&quot; package deals every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly this Sonicare toothbrush or any other Sonicare brushes.  If you try it, I guarantee you will never go back to the traditional toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> works nicely. Slightly smaller size. would recommend it. I have nothing more to say to recommend this product. Good nighy.</li>
            <li> I wish the base of this was heavier, or larger, as I can barely get my toothbrush to stand in it without falling over.</li>
            <li> I had to give praise to Amazon because they handled my order so kindly! We ordered this toothbrush to use as a couple. However after we received it, we realized it will not work this way. The heads (unlike our last Sonicare model) are EXTREMELY difficult to remove, thus making switching them out multiple times daily impossible. I couldn&#x27;t use this brush as I thought I could, and Amazon was amazing in helping me get a refund. I love Sonicare and this is the third Sonicare we&#x27;ve had thru the years, all the previous models had twist-on heads, which made switching them out very quick and easy. This model has a snap-on head which is really, really, really tough to get off, definitely not meant to be switched out multiple times a day for multiple users. Other than that, this is a great upgrade from our last Sonicare--having a snap-on head means you don&#x27;t get \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; growing inside the handle where the heads twist on and off. If you&#x27;re going to use this as a couple or family, you&#x27;ll need to buy multiple handles. After using Sonicare for years I can not stand using a manual toothbrush, the difference is stunning in how clean your teeth feel and general teeth/gum health. Thanks again AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> I switched to this cheaper Easyclean model after my Flexcare broke. I like the solid plastic handle, unlike the flexcare rubbery wrap which cracked and yellowed in the bottom. Two years ago when i bought the flexcare model it came with a soft brush. Now if i want a soft brush, or sensitive as sonicare calls it, i need to purchase them separately. Soft brushes are preferred and recommended. My Easyclean came with a standard hard brush. It&#x27;s hard on the teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare has enabled me to avoid some dental work and works very well.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> My dentist even said he noticed a difference.  My teeth feel cleaner than they did with a manual brush.  I didn&#x27;t realize all the hype about electric toothbrushes but after trying a battery operated brush from CVS, I wanted the real thing and am very happy with this.  Its been about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Clean teeth feel great! This brush is easy to use.  My hygienist is proud of me.  I smile a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Clean really well, battery stays charged for a month with daily (2x/day) use!</li>
            <li> This model of Sonicare is great.  I like that it is simple with one button and feels good in the hand.  Does a great job cleaning like all sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!  2 minutes seems to fly with the helpful timer.  I look forward to brushing my teeth and often restart to get flat surfaces when my time is up.</li>
            <li> Brush is not too small nor too big (I guess this won&#x27;t stand true for everyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the two minute auto-off feature, no more do I tell my boss I was late to work cause I over brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice cap that you put on the toothbrush when finished so that when other people are brushing or washing their hands, they don&#x27;t spill their dirty hands water on to your toothbrush (after all, who know where their hands have been, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging system does not have ANY chance of shorting out or shocking anyone since there are no metal contacts exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the brush does its supposed to do, it vibrates while I move it around my tooth and shuts off two minutes after I turned it on.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Sonicare products for a number of years and wanted to get our daughter one of her own. The key reason we chose this particular model was because the Amazon, on-line information indicated that a travel case and travel charger were included in the package. So, now we have a good product but are simply disappointed in what we received... no travel case or charger .. not a good deal, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The buzzing of the electric toothbrush was a little unnerving the first few times, and the vibration felt like that from a dentist&#x27;s drill. But after a few tries it felt much more comfortable. My teeth remained clean for a noticeably longer time as compared to regular brushing. Film-formation is retarded for an appreciably longer time.</li>
            <li> This is the second somicare that I have used. My first was recommended by a dentist and cost me over $100 with all the features which I never used. When the first broke down I bought this one with much less money but performs equally well for a 2 munute brush. I went to another dentist for cleaning recently and he just told me that my oral health was excellent. I brush 2-3 times a day and each time also with a bristle proximity brush as well as the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I feel the vibrate is very strong... good quality</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare that was a gift about 8 years ago.  It was not able to hold a charge for more than a single brushing.  The old style screw on top would gather that nasty crap inside.  This new design is a huge improvement. I am using the new Diamond clean brushes with this and they work fantastic.  I share this with my girlfriend and you can easily swap the head much faster than the old design.  The slim handle is great and the small base is nice and simple. I went with this model as I would never use all the different modes and the UV cleaner does nothing.  Very happy with the upgrade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean but the metal shaft on the handle came loose only after 5 months of use. Now it makes a buzzing sound and the brush head wobbles. There appears to be a fundamental design flaw with this toothbrush. I upgraded from an older model which accumulated gunk but the handle last over three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave as gift to brother he loves it says he hardly feels and good for pockets</li>
            <li> If you are a Sonicare fan--this is the model for you.  It has the 30 second quadrant timer, but not the programs, which are of no use to me and are somewhat confusing if you get into one and are not sure how to escape.  It does not have the ultraviolet sterilizing feature, but I think you can buy this separately if you want it.  You can use the new diamond brush head on this model.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush for the &amp;#34;shower toothbrusher&amp;#34;.  In purchasing this I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how it would work out as I prefer to brush my teeth in the shower in the morning, and obviously having any type of electric device in the shower can be risky.  However, I have had this brush for about a week now, brushing in the shower every morning, and I have had no problems.  It should be noted that both the charging base and the female charging connector on the toothbrush are both solid plastic.  So you don&#x27;t have to worry about water/corrosion effecting the charging connection.  How they&#x27;re able to charge using plastic on plastic, I don&#x27;t know - but it works!  Otherwise, the brush itself seems to be working quite nicely.  It does take a little getting used to as the vibration can give an almost &amp;#34;tickling&amp;#34; type feeling for the first couple uses.  I personally adjusted to that after a couple days.  The brush head is a little on the small side, which I think helps to work in the harder-to-reach areas of your mouth.  All in all, so far it has proven to be a nice electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> It works.  It&#x27;s predecessor lasted less than 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;I think, for the price, the life should be a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Delivered in timely manner and works great!</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to. Pretty intense if you&#x27;re used to manual brushing. But with a soft head (needs to be ordered separately) I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s eliminating plaque very well; and a little more comfortably than with the harder brush head it comes</li>
            <li> I have had this toothbrush for 3 months and it has been a good purchase.  This is a good product and it has provided me a good cleaning.  I like the built in timer for the four increments of brushing recommended.  I kept the manufactures package and use it for storage while traveling.</li>
            <li> I just had a great customer support experience with Philips Sonicare. I purchased an HX6511/50 back in 2012 and it worked great for 2.5 years! That also happens to be how long the warranty was. 6 days after the warranty ended the brush broke. It would vibrate, but the brush head would stop moving with the slightest pressure. I contacted the support center through a live chat and they are sending me a new brush handle! I would have gladly paid for a new one because it cleans so well.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say that hasn&#x27;t been said already. It&#x27;s an amazing toothbrush. The 30 second timer helps keep you on pace and the fact that it runs for 2 minutes is absolutely perfect. My teeth are cleaner and whiter than they have ever been. There is no doubt in my mind that my dental hygienist will be impressed at my next visit!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! My entire family uses it . . . we just buy different heads for each of us.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  Invigorates my gums and my teeth have that &amp;#34;just cleaned from the dentist&amp;#34; feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and the 30 second pulse for even brushing is great.  It&#x27;s much better by far than the old sonic are.</li>
            <li> I got this item for a lower cost than I saw in stores and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase it works very well. I did not like electric toothbrushes in the past but I like how this one starts with a low power spin and eases in to faster spinning was a nice adjustment for my sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> My family is addicted to our Sonicare toothbrushes.    On 3 different occasions, while traveling internationally, we have had our Sonicare chargers meltdown.  International adapters were used each time.  This year I called and talked with a Sonicare specialist.  Best decision I could have made.  She recommended this model and it works perfectly.  Finally, we can take our Sonicare&#x27;s along.</li>
            <li> After three months with this toothbrush, my teeth feel better than ever.  I have not had a single issue, and in my experience the battery has lasted longer than advertised on a single charge.  Cleaning is simple, brushing is simple, and charging is simple.  \</li>
            <li> My teenage granddaughter likes this new Phillips Sonicare toothbrush...I would recommend it.  Much better than her regular toothbrush.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is so much better than the previous model (without the EasyClean heads). In the old models, gunk built up inside the brush head and it was disgusting to clean out. With the Easy Clean heads, they eliminated that problem. Much better!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  The Dentist noted the difference after just two weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have this toothbrush and we both love it! It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but worth it for the clean feeling it gives you.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and Amazon had the best price of all the big and small box stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has the basic Sonicare model and this EasyClean is much thinner, lighter, and hold a charge to safely use it for a week of travel and still have power to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, its perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Rick&lt;br /&gt;Designer and Artist</li>
            <li> As one of the lesser expensive toothbrushes, the EasyClean met all of our expectations.  Thus far, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Well, it seems to work well.  I can&#x27;t really say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a toothbrush, tho.  :)</li>
            <li> 1,000 stars. I&#x27;ve been drinking far too much coffee and my teeth were browning. I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a month now and my teeth are almost white again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush - no unneeded bells and whistles like the more expensive models. Just a really good, effective clean for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the Oral B.  Even the &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own both and prefer the Phillips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;EasyClean&amp;#34; model still has a lithium battery that gives a light feel and lasts a long time on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EasyClean is cheap without the extra frills you don&#x27;t need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to electric toothbrushes I highly recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really need all the fancy modes, of course you can spend more money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already broken. I guess that was made in China.</li>
            <li> I asked for this for my birthday and my family thought I was crazy. It makes my teeth feel clean every time I brush, like I have just been to the dentist. Since I got mine each member of my family has gotten one for either a birthday or Christmas and they all love it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product and after much research I decided to buy it. I was very impressed with the difference I feel when I brush and how clean I feel my teeth are. I&#x27;m hoping that my dentist will agree on my next check up! Btw, I just saw the same brush at Walmart for $69!!!</li>
            <li> I have only had my sonicare toothbrush 4 days now and I LOVE it! Every time I brush my teeth, they feel like they have been professionally cleaned. No regular toothbrush can come close. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a regular toothbrush. The vibration takes some getting used to, lips and gums feel a little weird the first few brushings,but later feels great - more alive.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I already like brushing my teeth and this electric toothbrush make it even more fun.  I particularly like the very momentary pause/beep to indicate time to start on next &amp;#34;zone&amp;#34; of teeth.  The charge stand is a perfect size to not take up bathroom counter space.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The charger works with european or US electrical currents which is very convenient for traveling and living overseas. The toothbrush is great like my past Sonicare, except the new design eliminated that disgusting buildup the old design allowed. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure why you&#x27;d want any of the other Sonicares. Been using this brush for about a year with no problems. Works great and makes my teeth feel twice as clean as traditional brushing. The only downside is the cost of the 3-pack brush heads which averages around $30 which is a total rip-off.</li>
            <li> 3rd Sonicare toothbrush.  Have the 4100 model and the Elite Healthy White.  I&#x27;ll probably use this product line the rest of my life unless someone else comes close to their functionality but a lot cheaper.  Bought this because it was $15 cheaper than the HealthyWhite and only states that the &#x27;whiting function&#x27; is different.  I won&#x27;t bother with a general review as there&#x27;s over 2,000 reviews.  I highly doubt there&#x27;s anything new I could add but this is to point out the difference between this and other Elite models.  I give it 1 star less because it doesn&#x27;t seem to oscillate (move back and forth) as fast as my other ones.  I thought the battery was dead so charged it a full 24 hours and no difference.  I can tell by the vibration, noise level and amount of toothpaste foam after 2 mins.  It&#x27;s about the same as the &#x27;white&#x27; function on my other which they say is used to polish/whiten rather than clean...so does that mean this isn&#x27;t cleaning as much?  I would highly recommend getting the next model up, which is the HealthyWhite model even if you don&#x27;t use that function.  It&#x27;s only $15 more and the cost of the actual brush heads are going to make the cost of the base unit pointless anyway.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. It works well and is much lighter that the previous versions.   Secondly, you don&#x27;t need to charge it but once every five days which makes it a great travel toothbrush.   Would highly recommend the product!!!!</li>
            <li> this is the BEST toothbrush ever!  It is compact and does the job.  It also travels easily as it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li> Why make such a big deal about the travel charger (nice and small) and then not provide a travel case?  Every other sonicare I&#x27;ve owned came with one.  Pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> I resisted buying one all these years because for various reasons I didn&#x27;t think I would like it at all. And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE it and I ordered my wife one as well and she loves hers as well.  You will find mixed ratings just because different people have different likings on what happens to their teeth but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Much more slim and streamlined than the older model I had been using for years.  Much better engineering resulting in a much more sanitary and less messy brushing experience.  I&#x27;ve used sonicare for around 10 years now, this will be my fourth model, always so satisfied I&#x27;ve never been tempted to try another brand.  Definitely recommend if your interested in making a wise investment in your oral health!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself, and liked it so well, I got my husband one, too.  Good battery life and cleaned better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> Always used cheap electric brushes or normal brushes until this. After a weeks use I&#x27;m really liking it, seems to do a good job of cleaning, I like the way it stops vibrating for a fraction of a second to tell you when 30seconds is up and to move on to the next section of your mouth. Should have got this years ago!</li>
            <li> It has decided not  to charge any longer.  Too bad - I like this toothbrush, but if I have to replace it every 18 months, I&#x27;ll be going back to manual brushes.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare products.  My old Sonicare broke after 6 years.  I bought this and it&#x27;s great.  No problems.  The head base is smaller compared to my old Sonicare toothbrush, but i like it better.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had an oral B electric toothbrush it was starting to loose it&#x27;s charge after having it for 4-5 years. I wanted to try a Sonicare and there are a few good key differences. When you turn it on it&#x27;s like a nice low hum where the oral B sounds like you have just started up a lawn mower to go to town on your teeth. I like on the sonicare an actual toothbrush head instead of a circular head that is difficult cleaning for 30 seconds for a quarter of your mouth trying to hit each tooth front, back and underneath. After brushing I feel like my mouth is much more cleaner, and there is no holes in the toothbrush part where residual toothpaste gets stuck and has to be washed out. One thing that was weird when I tried it was the sonic vibrations will tickle your lips when trying to take care of your front teeth. But I have been using it for a couple days an it seems that I might be getting used to it. But I do like this toothbrush alot and it is quieter not that is a factor but when going to bed you don&#x27;t want to hear a lawnmower in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my e-Series battery finally died.  It&#x27;s so much better than the e-series because&lt;br /&gt;(1) the head just pulls off (no unscrewing)&lt;br /&gt;(2) no accumulation of nasty gunk under the head&lt;br /&gt;(3) handle is much smaller and easier to hold&lt;br /&gt;(4) charger base is a better design - no place for dirt to accumulate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the same features as the e-series, including the quadra - timer thing (hesitates every 30 seconds and stops after 2 minutes) but is easier and more pleasant to use.  So far as I can see,replacement brushes are cheaper than for the e-series - I bought a soft head and have the firm bristle that came with it.</li>
            <li> Very good when it worked, but after about a year the motor made a whining sound and no long turned the brush head.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean after using this! I tried an automatic toothbrush about 20 years ago and it sucked. The technology has come a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace my older model sonicare after I couldn&#x27;t stand the funky black build-up between the brush head and the handle any longer. This is a much cleaner version, and I plan to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> philips sonicare has perfected the toothbrush, in my opinion.  if you want to keep your teeth as clean and healthy as possible, this is the way to go.  they&#x27;re not cheap, but a small investment relative to the benefit.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush died less than one month after the warranty expired and Philips was not willing to replace it.  You would think they would want the broken unit to find out what failed but they were more interested in selling a new unit.</li>
            <li> At first seemed to do a good job, but after a few weeks I noticed my teeth weren&#x27;t as clean and white as my regular toothbrush. Disappointed, as I was really looking to improve my brushing.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this same model</li>
            <li> My whole family uses these toothbrushes.  They work great  - they do occasionally die but Phillips has been great about replacing for us at no charge.  I believe there is a one year warranty.</li>
            <li> This was replacing an older model that finally gave up.  This new one feels like it works better.</li>
            <li> it works fine, just a little lite weighted, always afraid while its charging it will fall over, would of liked a stronger base</li>
            <li> Much better than my e-series.&lt;br /&gt;No more nasty bacteria black mold growth in the bottom of the brush head. The design of this model eliminates any open spaces where bacteria may thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts forever on a single charge. Much quieter and stronger than the e-series as well.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. The previous one lasted quite a long time but finally gave out. I had no qualms about spending the money on another one, and this one works even better than the last.</li>
            <li> I made the purchase after a bit of research and expected better from Philips than what I received. The product did not charge at all. There is not much to getting these things to work, but mine was dead in the box. It went back the same day.</li>
            <li> Much better than the older and cheaper version (Philips Sonicare Essence Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush) where gunk and crud accumulates inside the connection of the brush and the body of the tooth brush. This one also has a much better battery life. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years and years.  They absolutely are the best available for oral hygiene.  This brand offers lots of models but the one reviewed is the least expensive and takes care of what needs to be done.  The other models offer bells and whistles that I never used in the past so why pay for them.  And BTW, Sonicare stands behind their products.  These toothbrushes have a two year warranty.  I suggest purchasing a pack of replacement heads along with the brush as the head should be changed every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Simply put:  this is a no frills, just what you need, perfect first sonic toothbrush purchase!  I looked at dozens of electric toothbrushes from every brand and chose this because of the simplicity, ease of use, price and quality.  It has a two minute timer with little &amp;#34;alarms&amp;#34; so you get all your teeth....and that&#x27;s pretty much all you need (all those other features seem to be overkill).  Having the heads that snap right on the base keeps the handle clean (whereas other models have the little ring things and water and crud buildup there). Will be purchasing one for each of my kids when they are a little older.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a present for my daughter after enjoying my first Sonicare.  I have enjoyed my unit and it has improved the cleaning of my teeth according to my Dentist.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my mom for Christmas.  I have a Sonicare myself and love it so I decided that I would get her the same brand.  The package came very quickly and was in great shape.  I don&#x27;t know if it works or not yet but as of now I can say that I am happy with product and seller and would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot in my days and this one is my favorites.  I accidentally tossed my charger in the garbage!  Customer service for sonicare  is amazing.  I told them I am buying a new charger anyway as an extra for my children and I offered to buy one extra for the mistake I made (I just asked for a discount) and they sent me a new one for free.  Now that&#x27;s service!! Getting beyond what&#x27;s expected and I will fully stick with this company as long as they keep making quality products. Teeth are very important to maintain.  This toothbrush make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> My Wife has a Sonicare which I was sharing with her.  I went online and ordered this one not knowing this was some type of mini version.  Totally useless so I went back to sharing my Wife&#x27;s full size Sonicare.  I used it for 20 seconds so the seller said I could not return it.  A waste of money.  Buy the full size version and NOT this one</li>
            <li> At my last cleaning the dental hygienist, a new girl, convinced me into buying a Sonicare.  She had a Flexcare model to show and gave me a $10 coupon as well.  Sonicare has allot of models which seems overwhelming until you do a little research.  It comes down to this, there&#x27;s the old style brush heads and then there&#x27;s new style.  The newer models range from EasyClean to DiamondClean.  They are all basically the same except for bells and whistles.  The different power settings are just different time settings.  Higher models offer more LEDs and fancier bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the brush for about 3 weeks now and am very happy with it.  Sonicare claims whiter teeth.  Mine are coffee stained, but it has actually lightened up a shade.  I have an old cap and my natural teeth are actually trending back towards my cap color which was the color of my teeth a long time ago.  My teeth feel cleaner to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, now for the buying experience.  I love Amazon and I love their Prime service, but they dropped the ball on this one.  My new toy arrived in two days nicely packed just like Christmas.  When I opened the box is was immediately obvious that the toothbrush had been opened.  Sonicare closes their box with a clear tamper proof sticker.  Someone had carefully opened and resealed it.  It gets worse.  Upon inspection everything was there, the handle vibrated good and the charger worked.  Unfortunately the brush head&#x27;s plastic bag had been torn open.  I can only assume someone tried it and decided to return it.  Uuugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course being Amazon returns are easy, but that&#x27;s the problem.  Amazon, this is a hygiene product.  You can&#x27;t just restock returns.</li>
            <li> Owned many other electric toothbrushes with limited success.  Mostly the others claim to clean and do not in everyday practice.  The Phillip Sonicare is pricey, but it really works.  There are a number of brush heads to fit personal preference and cleaning needs.  Follow the instructions regarding time to clean each &#x27;quadrant&#x27; and the results in the product claims are realized.  It&#x27;s rare these days to have a product meet the manufacturers claims, and this toothbrush does.  If you want to have teeth that look, feel and are clean, get this line of Sonicare toothbrush (there are other Sonicare toothbrushes of the same design with more bells and whistles such as the Philips Sonicare Flexcare Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush).</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare and I absolutely love it! I can never go back to a manual toothbrush . This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  I&#x27;ve always been meticulous about my teeth but this toothbrush has taken it to a new level.  My dental hygienist even commented about the lack of tarter buildup.  I have traveled with it without the charger stand and the charge has lasted a week.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Works as well as the higher end Sonicare lines, just fewer bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> My first lasted 5 years before and I loved it.  This is a replacement and I&#x27;m still happy!  I would definitely recommend this unit to anyone looking for electric toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t compare to others since I&#x27;ve only owned Sonicare.  I do wish the brushhead price was lower.</li>
            <li> Third Sonicare this is the best. Stays clean, big advantage. Simple design without the useless bells and whistles. Cleans great, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My old sonicare lasted 5 years.  This one is much nicer and stays charged a lot longer.</li>
            <li> My dentist always tells me how clean my teeth are every vist. With this and flossing they barely do anything when I go in for a cleaning. The first time I used this after having used a regular toothbrush my whole life it felt like I had just come out of the dentists office.</li>
            <li> So much better then my old Sonic Care battery operated unit (My was over 10 years old). This new one is much lighter, smaller and more powerful then my older unit. I really like it! Also, no crevices that can catch waste like the old unit use to do (and required disassembly quite often to clean it out properly).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a spinbrush for years and thought it was the way to go, but after using this, the difference is night and day. my teeth feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I feel this is a very superior toothbrush. It feels like I just came from the hygienist after using it. I had the basic Sonicare before this but this is much smaller lighter, easier to use, and all-around more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> i like the toothbrush a lot. i&#x27;d prefer if it had softer bristles but i think i can buy sensitive brushes to fit on the toothbrush. my mouth feels very clean after using. i wish it didn&#x27;t shut off after 60 sec. maybe that&#x27;s as long as one is supposed to brush. but i like the 15 min interval notices... but wish it stayed on a little longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for a year. The first time I used it, it felt like I just came from having my teeth cleaned at the dentist. I like how it has a built in timer so you know how long to brush each &amp;#34;section&amp;#34; of your mouth (the booklet that comes with it tells you about the sections). Even though I&#x27;ve always had good oral hygiene, I have noticed an overall improvement since I started using this toothbrush. It&#x27;s easy to use, and it&#x27;s good at holding a charge. I don&#x27;t keep mine on the charger all the time. I fully charge it, use it until the battery is dead, then charge it again. So far I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> Love this device!  Teeth feel so clean. They are all still working as they should after several years of daily use. Wish the new heads weren&#x27;t so expensive, but still, what price would you put on healthy teeth and gums?</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.  Dentist-recommended.  Great purchase from Amazon with quick delivery.  Don&#x27;t push hard when brushing with these sonic-care products.  The high-frequency work performed by the brush will keep your teeth and gums clean, especially just below the gum line.  I use this Philips brush on a once-daily basis to achieve a thorough cleaning, and combine with a RADIUS toothbrush for manual brushing several times a day after meals for a quick clean.</li>
            <li> by far, I&#x27;ve used it for a month. Everything works perfectly well and it&#x27;s much more efficient in terms of cleaning than my last one. The battery is also working great by far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift because it is was what she wanted.  She absolutly loves it and recommends for me to use it with the additional burshes I purchased of course.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a great product. I&#x27;ll get a few more of these for birthday gifts to my kids</li>
            <li> I own a three speed version of one of these and bought this one as a gift. It has only 1 &#x27;brushing mode&#x27; (speed) and that is all that is needed in my opinion. I never use either of the other two modes. Next time I need one for myself, I&#x27;ll buy a single speed version like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that I cannot get the advertised 3 months use out of a brush head. I probably get only 8 weeks use at best before the &#x27;reminder bristles&#x27; fade to the point where Sonicare recommends replacement. That&#x27;s why I gave this product four stars rather than five. The price here at Amazon is much better than what I&#x27;ve been able to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago my dentist told me that generally speaking, he sees a 30% improvement in gum health for people who purchase this product. My experience backs this up. Just yesterday, my hygienist remarked (without prompting) that she always sees an improvement in patients&#x27; teeth when they use an electric brush. (no product name from her)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the  &#x27;standard size&#x27; brush head and I believe my teeth are being cleaned better than ever before. In addition to the Sonicare motion, the cut and angle of the bristles are probably the difference makers. I would not recommend the compact version of this brush as it does not have the same bristle configuration and lasts even less time than the standard size brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads are not cheap so be prepared to spend $$ for replacements. Amazon has the best prices for those too. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t go for &#x27;off brand&#x27; replacement heads promoted by some online deal brokers. I tried those and though they &#x27;looked&#x27; the same as the Philips brand heads, they were horrible. Some didn&#x27;t even fit and kept coming off and the longest use I got from any of those was probably 1 week before they started to come off in my mouth. I could go on and on about those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you want to Really take care of your oral health, this toothbrush is great!eat!</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has truly enhanced my daily brushing, hands down I will never go back to manual brushing. Every brush leaves me feeling as if I just had a professional cleaning. Long use before recharging is needed. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.  My teeth honestly never felt so clean.  My dentist warned me not to let the brush sit too long on one area and be careful around my gumline, or it could wear away the enamel.  So I don&#x27;t pay attention to the time and am careful to always keep the brush moving.  Even doing that my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have.</li>
            <li> Does the job. This is an upgrade to my last Sonicare. I took it on a 10 day trip and it held the charge. Like that this is easier to keep clean than the last ones. I am a huge Sonicare fan. Very good for teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok, but I feel like they aren&#x27;t very powerful and the headsize isn&#x27;t very big.  Teeth feel clean, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting the same kind of cleaning as I would with a different product.</li>
            <li> This is my second sonicare. I had the first for over 3 years. I definitely swear by them and recommend them over any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love that that I can just put the DiamondClean brushes on this one without having to spend $200+ on the other.</li>
            <li> I really loved this toothbrush...while it lasted. We bought it in December, and it was dead by November. Is this what I should expect from a sonicare? I&#x27;m disappointed and will be searching for a brush that will last longer, or at least come with a warranty.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well and I like the built-in timer. The replacement heads are expensive but I suppose that is true of all these devices.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the more expensive one I replaced.  Have used sonicare for many years and am very satisified.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare Died Exactly After 1 Year, Not sure to buy another one after being so careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush stops charging or water must have gotten in\\&quot; Starts for a second makes a beep with light and turns off immediately\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The brush was too big for my mouth and the bristles were too hard. I was afraid it would destroy my enamel, loosen my fillings, and traumatize my roots.  I sent it back.  I am currently using a child-sized battery-operated toothbrush that I paid $3.18 for; it is more my size and speed.  I may try again with something that has a smaller brush and softer bristles.  My dentist thinks the Sonicare is the way to go, but I will wait a bit before trying again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush.  It does the job without all the extras which I never used in my old toothbrush anyway.</li>
            <li> Its already broken... I have to press the on button dozens of time to start or end it. This thing is a Huge pain...</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean.  It&#x27;s all that the description claimed it would be, and I love it.  It keeps its charge well and is convenient to take on a trip.  I feel my teeth and gums are in the best condition they&#x27;ve ever been after using this brush for about a month so far. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush works great</li>
            <li> Good price and offers everything I need in a Sonic toothbrush.  I really like the slender handle on this model.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare in two years. Yes, I got the more expensive one with three speeds. Two of them. They both stopped working in a year or less. So I got this one, yes I am very brave. But this one is very simple, one speed, but perfect! I love the feel of it in my hand, the brush size is perfect, and keeping my finger crossed that this one lasts longer than a year. I have had Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and before I got the fancy one they all lasted a few years. So hoping this one will live a looong time.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  It is great.  Although it takes getting used to the sonic vibration, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush stopped working 2 months after my husband started using it. And according to Amazon, we are unable to return it.</li>
            <li> Mine worked for 1.5 years and then stopped.  Phillips claims a 2 year warranty but that is based off the model number&#x27;s manufacturer date not your date of purchase.  Anyway I&#x27;m stuck with a expensive piece of junk.  The oral b Vitality I had previously lasted longer than this item which is why I&#x27;m won&#x27;t be purchasing another Sonicare item.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is having to buy new replacement units that include another recharger - not needed, and extra brushes - not needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised that all the Soniccare models except one are sealed batteries.  You have to throw out the entire unit and buy another package with extras not needed.  I would prefer that they have replaceable batteries.</li>
            <li> had to go back to the Sonicare jest gets my teeth cleaner and fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different electric toothbrushes in the past and couldn&#x27;t get past that feeling like it was scrambling my brains. This has a cool feature that works you up to the full power. Honestly I&#x27;m not a big fan of the quadrant buzzes (it buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know to move on to a different part of your mouth) but it&#x27;s a helpful feature for people who maybe brush a little too quickly. It feels like my teeth are really clean when I use this and in the last month I&#x27;ve already noticed that my teeth are a little whiter. I would definitely recommend it for the price and am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very user friendly.  Battery lasts a long time.  My gums feel much better and are no longer bleeding.  I love the 30 second timer to allow for a thorough cleaning of all four quadrants.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. Good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order the Sonicare travel case.  It comes in the box with the unit.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Easy to use and very easy to keep clean. It was just what I expected. Good buy.</li>
            <li> my teeth have never felt so clean before, I am a smoker and I can tell you that this toothbrush has scrubbed away some of the years of stains smoking brings by a couple shades!!! feels really nice and its convenient that its rechargeable</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare EasyClean and similar Sonicare models (the ones with the slim handles) are now better than Oral-B for international travel (including 220V European and Asian countries) for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) THE PHILIPS SONICARE EASYCLEAN INCLUDES A UNIVERSAL VOLTAGE CHARGER (FOR BRUSHES SOLD IN USA), ORAL-B DOES NOT ANYMORE&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare EasyClean (and its slim-handled Sonicare cousins) include a dual voltage / universal voltage charger*, but Oral-B no longer does. (There is an Oral-B dual voltage charger that is -supposedly- sold separately but it is impossible to find. Perhaps Oral-B no longer makes it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Despite selling the SAME EasyClean brush (HX6511/50) in other countries, a dual voltage charger is NOT always included in non-US markets - instead a single voltage charger sometimes is! To make matters worse, the dual voltage charger and single voltage charger have the same appearance and the same model number: HX6100. The only way to distinguish between them is to check the voltage label, which is displayed on the bottom of the charger. You need to turn the charger upside down to see it.  I wish Philips / Sonicare would stop this practice and be consistent across all countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) THE PHILIPS SONICARE EASYCLEAN HAS A PHENOMENAL 3 WEEK BATTERY LIFE, WHILE ORAL-B BRUSHES &#x3D; 10 DAYS AT MOST&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare EasyClean&#x27;s 3 week battery life (brushing 2x daily) is also superior to Oral-B&#x27;s and therefore another reason that Sonicare is better for international travel.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush. Seriously: my dental hygienist said I could come back IN A YEAR because my teeth were so great. The cost is worth it. The bases last for YEARS and the heads are a little spendy but worth it! I use mine for longer than I should, but the sonic-ness of it just makes all the difference. Just ask my dentist. This would make a great wedding gift for a couple, or a great graduation present. Start the younguns out right.  UPDATE: Our first one of these lasted years. Our second one lasted exactly one year. The pin that holds the toothbrush head just came out WITH the toothbrush head--they got stuck together. Warranty says two years, so we will see if they honor that...</li>
            <li> My teeth were lookin like some candy corn chicklets before i got this brush. It takes a few weeks to get used to but my gumline looks so much healthier and doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. It did make my gums ache slightly as they got used to being super sonic cleaned but now i love brushing my teeth and the timer is awesome! Only downside is expensive brush head replacements but im a Sonicare lifer now so whatever.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I love this unit. The function that I find most useful is the two minute timer. It alerts you via vibration after thirty seconds that it&#x27;s time to move onto another section of your teeth. As per the manual, I like to brush thirty seconds in the front of my top teeth, thirty in the back, thirty in the front of my bottom teeth, and thirty in the back. It&#x27;s such a simple function and yet it has made brushing my teeth less of a chore. I love it and I&#x27;m sure my teeth love it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This EasyClean model also lives up to its name. The toothbrush head is easily detachable and easily cleaned. I usually clean it after two or three uses but generally it should be cleaned after every use to prevent any buildup.</li>
            <li> Purchased a toothbrush June 26th of 2015. The toothbrush was great until it stopped charging about a month ago. I would have given it a single star but I contacted Philips and they are sending me another handle with no questions asked so it gets 4.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of bells and whistles but it does exactly what it needs to do.  Holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> We have the newer expensive version of this brush. We bought this for our travel brush. Its just not as powerful as the upgraded version. Its good though.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  It works well and is fairly quiet during use.  It also has a slightly slimmer handle than other models and brands and fits well in the hand.</li>
            <li> Works better than ever and such a design improvement with no space to collect liquids that turn icky.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Purchased in response to my oral hygienist&#x27;s recommendation. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my new Sonicare, and am grateful for my hygienist&#x27;s advice.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old Oral-B.  I like it better than my old Oral-B because the Sonicare has:&lt;br /&gt;-Dual voltage for international travel&lt;br /&gt;-A smaller charging base for better packaging in travel.&lt;br /&gt;-A smaller brush head for better gum line brushing.</li>
            <li> Clean very well, but last only 7months of use (2 times/day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so far the most expensive toothbrush I have ever bought. I love the clean feeling after use and I cannot live without it. Sadly the unit stopped taking charge and would randomly start on and off by it own. I did a little research and people said moisture might have gotten inside to the inside circuit board and caused a malfunction. They would recommend to remove the base with a flat head screwdriver and blow dry it. OK, I did that and upon opening the base, I realized there were 2 tiny copper wires that connect the base cap directly to the circuit board, as a result (it worked like a trap!!!), they broke. As you can see, there were a lot moisture got trapped inside the unit (I always wiped clean and dried the unit after every use, this thing is an expensive toothbrush!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit was sealed pretty good from outside, there would be no impossible way to get in and blow dry the inside on a daily basis(you would think it should be sealed and stayed dry inside, but no). This is more like a design flaw, moisture got in and could not get out, tiny wires connect directly to the opening cap....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not waste $70 again on a toothbrush that can last only half a year. I still have 2 refill heads and not sure what to do with it. May be I will use them as ordinary toothbrush, lol</li>
            <li> This was my second Sonicare toothbruth.  My first one had many speeds, but I found I left it on one setting its entire life, so when I went to buy a new one, I bought a single speed model.  It works very well.  I particularly like the built-in timer, which causes the brush to pause briefly every thirty seconds and to shut off after two minutes.</li>
            <li> Pro: The product works as promised. My front teeth become white through one week use. My inner teeth are cleaned better and I believe they are healthier now. In general the product provide much better cleaning and whiting effect on my teeth although it&#x27;s a little expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oppo： The product doesn&#x27;t include a travel box and I think it&#x27;s not convenient since I have a lot of traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to find out what kind of warranty replacement coverage there might be on this unit. Purchased it from Amazon in April 2013, 10 months ago, and it quit yesterday. The toothbrush handle lights up and the unit squeals, but does not vibrate anymore. That is an expensive proposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review edited an hour later: I called Philips at 1-800-682-7664 and they are sending me a free \\&quot;replacement handle\\&quot; to be received in 7 to 10 business days. They unit has a 24 month warranty. ALL GOOD.</li>
            <li> Dr recommended an electric toothbrush after having a heart attack.  Better change for better brushing and no inflammation due to bacteria.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my son who is extremely happy with this product.  He initially had a battery one and likes this so much better  that he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about it not being ready for him when he needs it. .</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a thorough job of cleaning my teeth with the little beeps to remind one of switching zones in the mouth.  It is also a low profile device that is easy to clean and does not take up much room on the counter.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. My teeth feel very clean after brushing with this toothbrush. The Easy Clean is Philips basic toothbrush  for their newer rechargeable electric toothbrushes. I wanted a basic electric toothbrush without all the extras that I did not need and did not want to pay for. The Easy Clean comes with the handle, one ProResults brush head, a charger and a small plastic travel cap that goes over the brush head. The only thing I wish Philips would have included was a hard plastic travel case.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. Works great and well made. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Try it and you love it!</li>
            <li> I bought one for all of us. When you brush your teeth it feels like you had a professional cleaning. It&#x27;s a bit hard to get used to the vibration, but now it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend thus to everyone.</li>
            <li> I used a similar oral B that I purchased at my dentist&#x27;s office for about 10 years until it finally died. I ordered this thinking it would be the same but it&#x27;s not even close.  This thing is so noisy my husband commented on it every morning for the 1st week or 2 I used it.  It hums and vibrates so much that I don&#x27;t think I can stand to use it long term.  I wished I&#x27;d gotten another oral B.</li>
            <li> I have used a Philps Sonicare Cleans White for two years and love it.  My hubby&#x27;s Oral B finally bit the dust.  I bought him the Easy Clean (Cleans White no longer available) and he likes it as well as his Oral B.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he is very happy with it so far. The design is nice and thin and will be so much easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I must say, I will never go back to a normal tooth brush again. The timer on this thing is amazing. You brush your teeth and it does a different buzz to tell you that its time to switch sections. My teeth have become two-three shades lighter since I started using it. Additionally its a lot easier to brush your teeth. You put the brush on an angel and let it do its thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minutes flies by and is almost slightly enjoyable to brush your teeth. However the heads for this do seem to wear away frequently. The suggested change time is to change them when the blue strip fades, which usually goes in a month or two. The heads of the toothbrush however do last a lot longer then the suggested value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of suggestion, this tooth brush does not need to be on the charger at all times. The battery on it lasts extremely long. I charge mine about once a month. The tooth brush lets you know when the battery is to low to operate. Great buy would suggest for all my friends, which I don&#x27;t do often.</li>
            <li> This is my third one, as I obviously can&#x27;t live without my Sonicare!  I just can&#x27;t seem to go back to manual toothbrushes, but I love this version.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> For over one and a half months now I&#x27;ve used this device.  It does a great job cleaning my teeth.  I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day (in the morning) and use another manual brush at night.  I&#x27;m VERY impressed with the battery life.  I charged it the first day I got it (around Oct 17th), and I am still to this day (Dec 4th) still brushing on that initial charge!  I&#x27;ve probably only missed 5 days using it.  I have not put it back on the charger yet, and it&#x27;s still running fine!  The stated two weeks for twice-a-day brushing appears to be a conservative estimate.  Kudos to Philips!!  What else can I say?  The unit appears to be great quality, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  If I figure out something to complain about, I&#x27;ll come back and post it...  Update on 12/15/2013 - I finally had to charge it (it was still working, but the light was flashing indicating it was down to 20% charge)  Update on 12/22/2016 - Had this toothbrush for three years now and loved it.  I dropped it this morning and must have broken something on the inside.  ARGH!!  I&#x27;m ordering another one.  It still retains it&#x27;s charge very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare tooth brushes for many years and have been very happy.  However, the real test of a product is how well it is backed by the manufacturer.  For the first time in 15 years, my Sonicare broke after 1 year of use.  I called Customer service and, after a rather lengthy wait time (being honest here), they sent a replacement immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product any time to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to have the old Sonicare and I love the new slimmer easy to clean design. I searched and compared prices at all the major stores and this was the best buy. There are more expensive models but this has all the features I wanted and works great..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. I know several people who swear by it and now i know why.  My teeth feel as clean as a dentist cleaning.  wouldn&#x27;t mind the brush area being a bit bigger but overall, i highly recommend. i&#x27;m giving to my daughters for a holiday gift.</li>
            <li> I have bought 5 Philips Sonicare brushes. Some better than others. Two of them didn&#x27;t last very long, the others, no problem. The first one was replaced, but the second one they wouldn&#x27;t replace.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush.  Only two stars?  How could that be?  It does not hold up so it only gets two stars .  I am on my 4th Norelco tooth brush of this style, so obviously I like it.  The brush snaps on a stem.  The stem starts getting loose in 6 to 9 months and becomes unusable in 9 to 12 months.  They make another model where the brush screws onto the top.  Those last forever.  However, the ones that last forever do not have 110-240 chargers, which the snap on type do.  I travel to other countries a lot and need the 110-240 charger.  Also, I don&#x27;t know if they have a different speed, or other difference, but I just plain like the ones with the snap on top.  I just wish they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as more expensive models and only has one cleaning mode. I will pay more next time.</li>
            <li> My last sonicare lasted 11 years (nicad batteries) and worked well.  This model has lithium ion cells.  I have always liked the quad pacer feature.  I like the slimmer profile and new attachment mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit came with just one brush head, we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  So far I&#x27;m liking the new model.</li>
            <li> but eeds shorter brush head.  The length of the brush head makes it difficult to contain the splatter.  Have to wipe my sink down after each use or there are splatter drops on all surrounding surfaces.  Other than that, I love the clean feeling of my teeth.  I have actually felt my gums tighten up after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is a gift that keeps on giving. Love how it makes my teeth and gums feel. Wish it came with extra brushes.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it. It does help with the process.But there is a limit. this is an item that I trust anyone who would purchase it knows what it does. Is an in-depth review necessary. Come on Amazon filter it so that reviews apply to a product that could actually benefit from one!!!!</li>
            <li> This may be the low-end but it works great and charges on the higher-end stands. It has just one setting. These also have an initial setting that &amp;#34;expires&amp;#34; as you use it to help your mouth acclimate. I turned it off (just hold the on-button for a few seconds and it will buzz letting you know it&#x27;s off).</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came on the market.  This is my third Sonicare in the past 12 years.  This is my favorite so far.  It is easy to clean.  Small charger makes charging easy.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a good investment. It is truly everything that it advertises for. Honestly, it took me some getting used to since I am a fan of bigger brushes, and the brush head is small so it can reach all areas of the mouth. The timer is a good reminder to get my 2 minutes in and the box says to switch out the brush heads every 3 months, but they can go for more. The replacement heads are 30$ for a pack of two (unless you find some manufacturer coupon). It&#x27;s an investment, but I&#x27;ve seen the different in my teeth: less stains, less plaque, minimal tartar build up and extremely healthier gums. I also floss daily and use mouthwash along with this toothbrush, so your results could vary.</li>
            <li> Unlike our old one that quit working eventually, this one pauses if too much pressure is on the brush while it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I had a Sonicare toothbrush for about 5 years and had about 16 new brushes. I was glad to find the model that used the same brushes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and tremendously beneficial for dental care.  My dentist recommended it to help with care and overall dental health.  Totally enjoyable and beneficial.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this toothbrush.  Since I began using it, my gums are much healthier and my teeth have less plaque when I go for a cleaning...as an added bonus, they seem to stay whiter, too.  I asked who would spend this much money for a toothbrush?  Now I know....I certainly will the next time I need one.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush broke down after about 16 months of use.  The main shaft became wobbly, and it would not brush effectively. Changing the brush did not help because the shaft is part of the toothbrush body.  I am going back to the older Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600 toothbrush.  I had that model for at least 5 years with no problems until I connected the charger to a 220 voltage outlet in Europe.</li>
            <li> Smaller, no problems with gunk buildup or mold, charger base is much smaller and it works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love the toothbrush, its worked flawlessly for the past year.</li>
            <li> It worked for 3 minutes and died. I tried the procedure that is in the manual to see the battery and it destroyed the back of the product, off course I lost the warranty. Reading carefully the manual, it is there, this procedure should not be used... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x60;m back to the Oral-B Pulsar, a packet with 4 units for less than U$15,00. The biggest advantage, it comes without user manual.</li>
            <li> For me, an electric toothbrush is not the answer.  I guess my mouth is just too sensitive. I&#x27;m sure that the device is as it is supposed to be.  There is supposed to be an audible beep that sounds in 30 secound intervals.  I do NOT hear any such sound.  Again , that is just me and most likely not the fault of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 2 months. Great toothbrush that gives thorough and deep cleaning. Tartars on teeth surface was removed within 1 week of usage. The battery lasts for 5+ days without a need for recharge under twice a day usage.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding toothbrush for the money. A real value. Wish I would have bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had an old style Sonicare and also and Oral B electric toothbrush.  I finally caved in to my dentists gentle suggestion that I get a new Sonicare.  Well this one is great.  It is small, sleek, does not catch runoff from rinsing like the old one - it stays clean, cleans well, and is quite and gentle.  Totally does the trick.  I&#x27;m delighted!</li>
            <li> This model is much better than the higher-end models. Single click on/off. I wish the base was a bit larger, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to tip over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: the carrying case is nice in the higher end models, but I can&#x27;t stand the fact that, on the premium models, you have to press the button 3+ times to turn the brush off when you&#x27;re done (or stand there with your finger depressed 2+ seconds waiting for it to shut off.) For that reason alone, I highly recommend this simpler model over the more fancy ones. Trust me on this...</li>
            <li> My wife swears by her&#x27;s. It has ccut her dental bills. The first one lasted about 4 years so we can&#x27;t complain too much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product works really good</li>
            <li> I have used the toothbrush as soon as I received. It worked very effectively which make my tooth white! I like it!</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as powerful as the step-up model, I also have an HX6711. The comparison tables don&#x27;t make this clear. I don&#x27;t mean that the &amp;#34;White+Clean&amp;#34; mode is more powerful than the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode (although it is). I mean the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode on this is clearly not as powerful as the regular &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; mode on my HX6711.  Does the less powerful motor make a significant difference in how well it performs? I would think so, but I&#x27;m not a dentist so I can&#x27;t say. I do prefer the more powerful one and would not buy this again. That said it&#x27;s still a Sonicare and still a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my dentist, the Sonicare toothbrush delivers as promised in terms of efficacy.  My checkups improved directly thanks to it.  Problem is, my sample didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  I bought it in June of 2013 and in June of 2014 its battery would no longer charge.  I even tried another charger--no luck.  Then it died.  In my personal opinion, the item is too expensive to last only a year and then self-destruct.  But while it lasted, it was excellent.</li>
            <li> Replaced the cheaper model with this one.  It was more expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Just a very very weak brush.  I held it up against my teeth, and it didn&#x27;t even move.  I heard it trying to do clean and move, but... too weak.  I returned it via Philips.</li>
            <li> the first one lasted two months. we will see how long the current one lasts.&lt;br /&gt;i like the concept and like it when it works but have little confidence in the quality of the battery.</li>
            <li> yea much better than my old essentials which i had for more than 10 years, that one finally died, and decided i wanted one without the cavity to hold all that nasty gunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had a toothbrush so that i could clean the cavity of the old essentials soniccare, how crazy is that?</li>
            <li> Better and better product - excellent product R&amp;D improvement. Now the replacement brush heads are less expensive because they have put the magnets that vibrate the brush head  inside the handle and they are no longer subjected to water, wear, or corrosion. I really like the much slimmer handle. FIVE STARS.</li>
            <li> Cleans your teeth without effort, easy to use, holds the charge. If prior experience with this brand is any indication, don&#x27;t expect it to last more than 2-3 years. I had another Sonicare where the I replaced the battery which worked for 3 months then it started going wachy. I would start randomly in the middle of the night and bounce around til it ended up in the sink still buzzing. The replacement heads are pretty expensive, they should cost the same as a toothbrush, they are more like three times that.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to set up and start.  It works well.  I do not like that it cannot be set down on the counter without rolling onto a side.  This means that  after putting on toothpaste it can&#x27;t be set down on the counter without the toothpaste contacting the surface.  I get around this by putting on the toothpaste while the brush is still in the charger.</li>
            <li> Compared to my 13 year old Phillps this model is a lot lighter and smaller in diameter, but just as powerful and effective. Also I am glad this uses a much less expensive replacement brush type. And it is easier to clean than the older model that had a large cup that got filthy inside, where the magnet part is.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever experienced.  It is far and away beyond the toothbrushes found in drugstores and big box items.  Anyone who tends toward gum disease will find this brush a must-have.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush! I ended up returning it ONLY bc target was running a sale, but if you&#x27;re thinking of getting a Sonicare I&#x27;d recommend this model. It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush and I think it does everything you want. I used the sensitive mode while my gums were getting used to it and have worked up to the regular setting. I have really sensitive gums and I was surprised at how gentle it actually was. Great purchase that I don&#x27;t regret. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and is still running well.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done!  Glad I listened to the reviews!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use so grandson is using it often. This is his first electric toothbrush and he seems to really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a good tooth brush and I must like it because this is the second one I have used. The first I got at the Dentist&#x27;s office it had all of the bells and whistles and mostly never used any of them. This brush is nice just seems a little over priced.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old Sonicare with this one.  The old one had a stronger vibration but I had to rinse it out every time.  This one doesn&#x27;t collect stuff in the base so it is better.  Now that I have been using it for a few weeks I don&#x27;t notice the difference anymore.  I think I read someone saying on another review that it beeps to change the area in your mouth you are brushing but it does not beep.  It pauses so you know when it is time to change.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toothbrush after listening to my husband talk about how good Sonicare toothbrushes are for the longest time.  Until then I had only really used a regular toothbrush.  When I first used it, it felt like there was a battle in my mouth.  It definitely takes some getting used to with how fast it is and how odd it really feels.  But the functionality where it slowly reaches full speed over the first 14 brushes really helps.  I also really love how it buzzes to signal that I need to switch to another part of my mouth.  To be honest, my teeth never felt cleaner, even after cleanings at the dentist!  I can&#x27;t imagine going back to using a regular toothbrush ever again.  One last tip - if you are a first time user and adjusting to this like I did, make sure you are opening your mouth a little wider, so that the back of the buzzing brush head doesn&#x27;t hit your other teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy clean is an understatement.  There is very little space to collect water and bacteria.  Toothbrush is like most Phillips Sonicare type.  It has a small brush head that fits my mouth well.  Always makes teeth and gums feel clean. The quad timer is a good touch.</li>
            <li> Sonic brushes are the best.  This next generation is lighter and has better heads that don&#x27;t collect unreachable mold.  Try it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare.  This one is the most simple and that was all I wanted.  The charger base is very small so it doesn&#x27;t impose on the counter. If you like a lot of fancy features, this one isn&#x27;t it but it works great.  There is a good comparison chart in the product description where you can check out the various models.  One model I have uses the larger replacement toothbrush and I don&#x27;t like it.  Make sure you remove the brush and clean under the area under the bottom of the brush regularly because it can get a little yucky under the plastic that attaches to the motor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only has this for about a week and i will never swtich again to a diffrent toothbrush. After i brush it feels like i just left the dentist&#x27;s office- my mouth feels so clean! i love that it lets you know when to swtich to a different section and shuts off after 2 minutes. My teeth and guns already look healthier.</li>
            <li> I never took oral hygiene seriously until I started to physically notice it on my teeth (the woes of being an arrogant teenager).  I found this while I was looking around and researching other things.  I paid $70 at the time, and I was EXTREMELY skeptical that it could actually be better than the &lt;$20 electric toothbrush I was using at the time.  The difference was literally astounding.  My mouth actually felt cleaner, and the results didn&#x27;t take long to notice.  Coupled with proper toothpaste, mouthwash, and flossing, I was able to save my teeth before any of the damage became permanent.  It was probably one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in recent years.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist for annual cleaning. My outside teeth was clean but the top of my teeth was yellow-ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this, half of the yellow has come out and my teeth are whiter than before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience may differ because ever since I bought this tooth brush, I brush right after I eat. Sometimes, I just brush for like 20 mins while waiting on the phone or something. I actually have become fanatic about keeping my teeth clean and white because this tooth brush gives me a reason.</li>
            <li> I ordered this electric toothbrush as a Christmas gift for myself.  Great price &amp; so far, the brush is living up to it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;Was recommended by my dentist &amp; he gave me a $10 coupon to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived well before the holiday &amp; in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas to myself!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonic brush and it never disappoints.  No other electric tooth brush even comes close to what the Sonic does in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I am an adult over 50 that just had her braces removed after 18 months. I have an electric brush and water pic but wow what a huge difference. The first couple of times I wasn&#x27;t sure I could finish brushing because it tickled so much with the high vibrations. But after 2 weeks sold on it. My teeth feel amazing after brushing and love the two minute timer. Can&#x27;t wait for my cleaning in march to see if I get two thumbs up from dentist office. Thinking my husband needs one</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these for myself couple years ago, bought one for Christmas gift for son. This is an excellent electric toothbrush. Works well, is compact, lightweight and cleans up nicely. In my opinion, best purchase for the price!</li>
            <li> Works well and leaves you with a clean feeling. However, it moves so quick it takes some getting use to.</li>
            <li> I originally bought a cheaper sonicare to try and take $$; however, the cheaper one is heavier, doesn&#x27;t have the little buzz to change sides and did I mention heavy? I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to return it and purchase this one! I didn&#x27;t think electric toothbrushes would REALLY make your teeth that much cleaner as I brush my teeth 3x/day but I was wrong. After the first week of using this, my teeth did feel more clean. I found that this model is a great happy medium of not too cheap, very light and efficient for the money. Also, this one is also have the size (of the cheaper sonicare) which makes it easier for travel.</li>
            <li> Smooth and fast.  Really cleans the teeth.  Forces me to take my time on each section of my mouth. Stays charged for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting one of these for a long time now and haven&#x27;t had the money to do it until now when it was on sale.  Shoudl have got it years ago though.  My teeth have never felt cleaner, the battery last for days on end and it has made brushing my teeth a much easier process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this toothbrush. The head is extremely fast in a &amp;#34;back-and-forth&amp;#34; motion and I feel like my teeth are really clean after I use it. It&#x27;s really handy for getting in those hard-to-reach places like wisdom teeth and at the gumline, plus it&#x27;s been about a month since I bought it and the head is not very worn yet (the standard one it comes with).</li>
            <li> i have impacted wisdom teeth that keep getting infected. I have been too chicken to take them out.  This toothbrush is the only thing that gets back there &amp; all around.  I can never go back to a normal toothbrush.  what a difference!</li>
            <li> Love it, very powerful and gets your teeth really clean</li>
            <li> ive been using sinicare for 25 years</li>
            <li> so far, so good.  I charged it up when I got it and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  That was two months ago, I think.  I like it.  I like the 30 second quick-pause it does to let you know the countdown until it turns itself off (2 minutes).</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Great value, long lasting, and will save your teeth and gums!  My first one lasted 6 years and my dental visits have been a breeze!  My only oral health routine is using this brush twice a day.</li>
            <li> This is really a great electric toothbrush, much improved over previous styles and models.  Fits the hand comfortably and just the right size to get to all the hard to reach places. Teeth get really clean!</li>
            <li> My Oral B toothbrush battery stopped holding a charge after several years of use. After Google searching the pros and cons of Oral B vs. Sonicare, I decided more or less on the spur of the moment to try out the Sonicare. Some of my comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare does not have any rubber grip on the case (the Oral B does have a textured rubber grip). The rubber grip on my Oral B would get dirty with toothpaste residue and was hard to clean and keep sanitary. The smooth plastic of the Sonicare is a bit more slippery, but far easier to keep clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the vibrating action of the Sonicare to be just as effective as the mechanical action of the Oral B. My teeth feel just as clean, but I feel as though it is gentler on my gums. The Oral B was quite harsh, and I personally avoided letting it touch my gums. Not a big deal if the Sonicare brush touches my gums, it is quite gentle once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare timer pulses every thirty seconds and shuts off after 2 minutes. This is supposed to signal you to brush each quadrant of your mouth for 30 seconds. I don&#x27;t personally brush that way, but I find the thirty second reminders encouraging to help me brush for the whole 2 minutes as recommended.</li>
            <li> It looks like that should be three brush head in the box, but i only find one in the box?</li>
            <li> Loving it so far. replaced a 10+ year old Braun that was still working well.</li>
            <li> I really liked using this tooth brush and how clean my teeth felt, that should earn it a 5 star rating.  However... 2 months of use it stopped working.  So, I paid a lot of money for a tooth brush that only lasted about 60 days.  Not good.  It was not returnable per Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I did go buy another one, different model at Costco, so in the event it stops working I will have return options.  The tooth brush was good, the longevity was not.</li>
            <li> It does a great job and my teeth have never been cleaner.  It is quiet and you can use the diamondClean brushes that are highly rated.</li>
            <li> I studied different reviews of sonicare and chose this one finally. It&#x27;s a right decision. I like the force and frequency of the vibration and apparently it works for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Light weight. The battery held well for 2 weeks without recharging when I went on vacation and forgot to bring the charger. Easy to handle and easy to clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Won&#x27;t go back to a manual brush ever.  Live the interval timer.</li>
            <li> It is the best option if you want to be sure you are getting the newer model that doesn&#x27;t accumulate gunk inside it, uses the newest brush heads, and has the feature that lets you know when you&#x27;ve completed each 30 second cycle - without all the extra stuff that I never use and that makes it a lot more expensive.  For last couple of years, I was using an expensive Braun model that the dentist who did my gum surgery suggested, but that always felt like a jack hammer in my mouth, and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the round little brush heads.  My new dentist said Sonicare is best, and so I switched back, and realized how much better I like it and how I missed Sonicare toothbrush.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush</li>
            <li> In spite of careful care and storage, lasted only 13 months; now the vibrating brushhead motion stops and starts randomly while turned on.  Maybe I just got a bad unit.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my very good dentist.  It&#x27;s the one this is replacing I&#x27;m disappointed with.  It died.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!  I purchased this model in November 2013.  I have had six of them so far.  They would last about a month, then stop working before the two minutes were up.  I pressed the button to restart the brushing and it would stop again, make a funny whining noise and that was it. Customer service gives you a reference number but the call takers only add half of the information you give them, full address, phone number etc. so they can send you a replacement handle. They do send you a new handle,  Finally I had one young lady that &amp;#34; escalated&amp;#34; my situation to someone over her head.  She offered me another handle.  I explained I was tired of the game.  Six new handles In seven months was enough.  Another person sent me an email, I presume even higher up, offering me another handle or a refund.  I explained to him I was tied of the game and I would like a refund please.  That was almost three weeks ago.  I am still waiting.  Please, save your money and do not buy this model.  I wish I could give it no stars.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing!  The first couple of times I used it I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to like it because it tickled horribly, but I very quickly got used to it and now it doesn&#x27;t tickle at all.  Cleanest teeth I think I have ever had - which I am sure is due to the fact that it has the timer function as much as the sonic technology.  I was dubious as to whether I really wanted the quad pacer, but I am really glad I went for the model with that feature - it is just a subtle beep every thirty seconds so that you can make sure you evenly brush all quadrants of your mouth, instead of jumping around.  And it makes sure I do the full 2 minutes every time!  Definitely a bit of an investment, but considering what dental work costs, well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Dentist told me to get this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got done having a bridge put in top teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told me the way the other toothbrushes work, they are too harsh and after extended use will leave like a dark line above the bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All teeth problems start at the gum line so remember that when you brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using electronic toothbrushes for nearly 20 years now. Most of the models I have used have performed to a high enough standard to leave me not wishing to use a regular manual toothbrush anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Philips&#x27; Sonicare however, is a considerable improvement in a few ways over the Oral B models I have used. What I like most of all is the how much fresher my mouth feels after the toothbrush does it&#x27;s job. The effort required by the user is very minimal. As the manual suggests; guiding the toothbrush slowly, instead of actual scrubbing is all that is required for desired results in only two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the slimness the body of the motor unit. Previous models have been wide enough to result in occasional collisions with front teeth when reaching rear teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stock bristles are very comfortable. As good as I have encountered over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge time isn&#x27;t much of an improvement over what I am used to. Up to 24 hours is normal for a full charge from an almost completely drained battery. The good news is, I went three weeks before I needed to recharge the HX6511/50. I have found the battery on almost everything rechargeable does do better in the long run when a full, uninterrupted charge is provided every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very low maintenance is required. Keeping the brush, the replaceable head and the charging station clean is easy. A rinse of the head and motor body after every use is worthwhile. Wiping-down the charging base whenever it appears anything less than clean with a multipurpose cleaner has always worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very minimal motor vibration.&lt;br /&gt;2. Teeth-hugging bristles&lt;br /&gt;3. Impressive ergonomics. Good fit in the palm and easy to guide.&lt;br /&gt;4. Green LED instead of blue. Much more subtle in the dark at night.&lt;br /&gt;5. Leaves mouth feeling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;6. Price.&lt;br /&gt;7. Convenient when traveling - dual voltage and 50/60Hz. Charges just about anywhere offering electricity (socket fitment adapter may still be required).&lt;br /&gt;8. On/off button is easy to access, but not where you are likely to keep accidentally switching it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge time no worse than the competition, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have improved in 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;2. Power cord takes a couple of weeks to soften. Results in the base requiring basic support during charging to avoid falling-over.&lt;br /&gt;3. Open with care to avoid packaging cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. Philips are offering a very well thought-out design here which works very effectively. Not many bells and whistles are on board (quite normal at it&#x27;s price point), but it has everything to get your mouth feeling fresh within two minutes. And it does so without feeling as though it is applying too much pressure or excess scrubbing to teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My teeth have literally never been so clean. I also love how small the brush head is because it reaches all the way back to my back molars. We&#x27;ve had ours for 3 months and it&#x27;s still running like a champ. Love it. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The tooth brush is utterly fantastic. You will actually brush your teeth for two minutes and the results are noticeable. The battery life is great. I charge mine once every 3 weeks. I would recommend this to anyone. Look at it this way, right now you spend $90 on a toothbrush, it will prevent you from spending hundreds of dollars at the dentist</li>
            <li> This is my second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. First one lasted forever. When it finally needed replacing I read the reviews for the EasyClean. Some said there were charging issues. I have had this one for quite some time and have only charged it three times. Great toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> Its the best that there is, this is the third one I&#x27;ve owned in 30 years, dropped the last one in the shower and broke it after 7 years.</li>
            <li> started getting more &amp;#34;4s&amp;#34; for gum gaps a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;went to the dentist yesterday and 75% of the gum shrinkage improved.&lt;br /&gt;AND...the cleaning was easy this time because this tool truly works to zap build up&lt;br /&gt;best buy I&#x27;ve made in years</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.  Good product.  My dentist recommends this model. I would recommend this tooth brush to anyone that asks me.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  It&#x27;s 100 times better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great at cleaning your teeth. Much cheaper than what I could get it for at the store and dentist office.  These tooth brushes only last about 2 years with me.</li>
            <li> I am now on day 27 and the indicator light is still on steady, indicating the battery still has over 20 percent of charge remaining. On my earlier model of the sonic tooth brush I had to recharge the battery every 8 to 9 days, i.e. when it was new. I changed to the new model brush because I was now recharging the old sonic toothbrush battery every 4 to 5 days. To quote an old commercial of a different product &amp;#34;oh what a relief it is&amp;#34;, not to have to recharge the battery on such a frequent basis.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush this is my third sonicare and my dentist is very happy with the results.recommended to anyone great purchased</li>
            <li> My wife has used a Sonicare for years but this is the first time I have used one (at 74 years of age it is hard to change my toothbrushing method from the old, manual brush) so it took me about a week to get accustomed to it.  Now that I have used ii for two months, I like the way it cleans my teeth.  I use it at bedtime but still can&#x27;t get away from my old type brush which I also use after lunch each day.</li>
            <li> This model works well.  I have used it for many months without complaint.  Amazon offered best price considering all factors.</li>
            <li> I like the sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s much more efficient than manual brushing and is good for the gums. I&#x27;d advise you to get the easyclean sonicare, the basic is all you need. The others have different cycles, but you can always brush longer if you want. You can also put any healthy white or diamond brush head on the easy clean. I definately recommend getting this type of sonicare over the older e-series versions. The heads on those have a large collar that gets slimy and you have to take it off and clean it all the time. The easy clean, healthy white, diamond series.... these all have the simple snap in heads.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and white, my gums are healthy. I like brushing my teeth.  I&#x27;m sure I will have a successful check-up.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s strong, convenient, and its small enough for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I&#x27;ve read I guess I&#x27;m in the minority, but compared to my older Sonicare Elite e7300, this toothbrush is a disappointment.  It may be sleeker looking, easier to clean and lighter weight, but it has nowhere near the cleaning power of the older Elite models.  If you compare the two, it becomes immediately obvious that Phillips is attempting to capitalize on the reputation of their original Sonicare, while lowering the quality and increasing their profits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their description points out that the brush \\&quot;cleans with up to 31,000 movements per minute\\&quot;, the same as the original Elite model.  What they don&#x27;t tell you is that each up &amp; down movement (sweep) of the brush is much shorter and as a result, nowhere near as effective. It is also far less powerful.  If you apply even a moderate amount of pressure to the bush, it will stop oscillating.  It still makes noise, lots of it, but it doesn&#x27;t provide any brushing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also interesting to note is the fact that the suggested retail price of the replacement heads is nearly identical to that of the older model, although they are not nearly as complex, or costly to manufacture.  At nearly $13 / head (MSRP), Phillips could afford to give away the toothbrushes and still make a profit!  The new series brushes aren&#x27;t much more complex than a standard manual toothbrush!  In fact, it is the redesign of the brush heads that make the newer Sonicare HX series so much less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!Tech Alert - If tech stuff bores you then stop reading now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original heads contained a powerful magnet that was affixed directly to the brush.  When you turned the toothbrush on, an electromagnetic signal was generated within the handle that caused the magnet, and therefore the brush, to vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is virtually identical to the way a permanent magnet speaker works.  In a speaker, the permanent magnet is attached to the speaker cone and moves back and forth in proximityto a fixed voice coil. When an audio signal is applied to the voice coil (from an audio amplifier), the magnet attached to the cone moves back and forth, generating sound.  The more signal that&#x27;s applied, the louder the sound.  In the case of the original Sonicare Elite, the brush head acted like the speaker cone and the voice coil was contained in the handle.  The handle also contained an amplifier along with an ultrasonic oscillator tuned to 31 KHz. All in all, an ingenious design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to its larger size, the older Elite model could contain a more powerful amplifier and I suspect larger batteries to support it.  The unique head design, with the magnet attached directly to the bush, produce a longer throw (sweep) of the bristles, resulting in more thorough brushing.  In addition, due to the powerful magnet attached to the head and the more powerful amplifier, it was nearly impossible to stall the original Elite models, no matter how hard you brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!End Tech Alert!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of the new HX series brushes, it&#x27;s clear that form (and profit) won over function.  The new brushes may be more ergonomic, easier to care for and lighter weight, but when it comes to cleaning teeth, they&#x27;re no where near as effective and it seems to me that&#x27;s what you buy a toothbrush for, to clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I had one of these several years ago when I was young and lost it. Bought it and have been using it since January 2014. It&#x27;s REALLY great. It makes my teeth noticeably cleaner, but it&#x27;s also been awesome for my gums. This is the first time I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist where they didn&#x27;t say I had inflamed gums and when I told them I was using a Sonicare they sad that&#x27;s probably why. This is totally worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful to teeth, and I like that soft feeling. The battery can use a long time, so awesome!</li>
            <li> After the initial &amp;#34;tickle&amp;#34;, it is a pleasure to brush.  My teeth certainly feel cleaner and most assuredly are cleaner.  The battery seems to hold a charge longer than my old electric brush.  My dentist will be happy.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Keep buying these and then keep throwing them away after they stop recharging. Might be a year, might be a little more or less. But I&#x27;ve bought about 5.  Not again. Switching to the Health product and we will see how that does.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s good but not as powerful as I thought it would be.  I kept it and use it but wished it had been a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> Very nice tooth brush. Easy and comfortable to use and keep clean. My teeth feel cleaner than when using a regular tooth brush. I been using it for about five months.</li>
            <li> Cleans like crazy.  Just be prepared for the oddest sensation on your gums for the first week.  Even though I previously used an OralB, the &#x27;sonic&#x27; speed of this brush makes for a different experience.  You do get used it so don&#x27;t worry about that.  It&#x27;s not an unpleasant feeling either.  More of a tickle than anything.</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning teeth. Replacement heads are more expensive than a new toothbrush but teeth are much cleaner using this.</li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B Triumph for a few years and while the Oral-B&#x27;s head is a better shape for your mouth, the action of the Sonicare is far better and gives my mouth a cleaner feel. Both will get the job done, but I&#x27;ll be sticking with Sonicare in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a Healthy White model from about two years ago and when the brush head is pulled off the soft gasket material at the base is black with mildew.  I could not really afford a better model and doing some research found I did not have to spend the money.  The Pro Brush that comes standard with this says it removes 2X the plaque of a manual toothbrush.  You do NOT have to buy a more expensive model - just buy the better brush heads.  Almost all of the available brush heads fit this model except Essence of course.  The Diamond Clean and the Interdental brush heads claim to remove 7X as much plaque as manual brushing so if you want a better clean - just buy different brush heads.  They recommend changing brushes every 3 months but I brush 2x a day and can go longer.  I have gingivitis due to dry mouth from illness and medications and using the Sonicare has made a HUGE difference in my oral health.  My purchase came with a $ 4.00 coupon towards brush heads and $ 26. in other Sonicare items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 14 day ramp up feature for those who are nervous about switching from a manual - the intensity starts out very gently and gradually increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT understand why it is called Easy Clean because it has exactly the same attachment as my Healthy White. It can be a bit of a pain to get off BUT I recommend removing at least every couple of days so it can dry out fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a FANTASTIC product and you will not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim for something new to try out. I love it! The vibrations tickled my mouth at first but after a couple times using it I got used to it. It actually feels really good. After I brush my teeth with this they feel very clean. It is a nice sleek design and the charging stand hardly takes up any space at all. The price I paid on amazing was about $20 cheaper than what I saw the exact same product for at Target so I would highly recommend getting it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is our third or fourth sonicare in about 15 years. we love them. this one is much better than the e-series we&#x27;ve had in the past. glad to not have to screw on brush heads but rather slide them on the metal post. we did not have the issues of gunk build up at the bottom of the heads as some mention but we were careful to wipe them after each use so maybe that helped. i would highly recommend using this model. i&#x27;m not a big fan of the quad notification  but for the feeling of how clean these things leave your teeth, it is worth it. i do like the smaller handle. it is much lighter than the e-series and easy to move in your mouth. we&#x27;ve had our about 3-4 months now and it works great. i&#x27;m curious to see how long the life of the battery is on these newer models. Our first one lasted at least 5 or more years.</li>
            <li> After the first replacement head i tried to place, the product base broke and was making a loud noise and not functioning properly.  I called Philips and received an immediate assessment of the product followed by a replacement sent in the mail that day.  2 days later i had my new tooth brush with a free extra head and a package to return the broken one.  Very impressive.</li>
            <li> This was an upgrade for my old Phillips. The old one allowed water in, which meant mold (ew!)..but this one doesn&#x27;t! I also love that it make a noise every 30 seconds so you can rotate every section of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is great, I like that it has the 30 second intervals to remind me to change positions. I haven&#x27;t had any really breath problems like with traditional brushes</li>
            <li> I really like this..I find it very easy to use.  This is my first one..so I can&#x27;t really compare...but it works really well and I find it very easy to use.  I guess the best thing is I got a good report from my dentist as I have had this now for about 6 months..which is really good news.  I would really recommend this.</li>
            <li> This review will compare the Sonicare to the Cybersonic II, even though the Cybersonic II is not available.  Reason?  Because I&#x27;m thinking many people bought them about the time I did and are now looking for a substitute, since the Cybersonic 3 is almost identical to the original model and reviews say it doesn&#x27;t last long.  My Cybersonics lasted about 6 years each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons the Sonicare is better:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Faster motion means more scrubs per minute&lt;br /&gt;2.  Smaller brush head fits easily in gaps where teeth are missing and gets deeper between normal teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3.  A little smaller and lighter&lt;br /&gt;4.  Metal spindle and interface between handle and brush.  The Cybersonic has a plastic interface that wears out quickly if you have a family snapping brushes and flossers in and out daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons the Cybersonic II was better:&lt;br /&gt;1,  Has a very, very good flossing system included... the best I&#x27;ve ever seen&lt;br /&gt;2.  Bigger, more stable charging base with places to store brush heads&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cheap replacement brushes (providing you didn&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;free brush&amp;#34; scam where they sent you a new brush each month and charged 6 bucks for shipping) and flosser snap-ins.  Of course this cost depends on how often you replaced brushes and flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Cybersonic batteries kept charging fully for many years, I will let you know eventually how long the Sonicare batteries last.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I can see right away that the small, light charging base will fall over easily and possibly drop the unit off the countertop.  I&#x27;m thinking once I am sure where I want to keep the charging base, I&#x27;ll put a dab of silicone caulk under it to hold it steady.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do like the Sonicare, it&#x27;s speedy and really feels like it is getting my teeth cleaner, but I will still keep the remaining handle and floss heads of the Cybersonic until they die completely and then look for more on eBay.  That flosser is a thousand times better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.better than flossing string or tape, works very well and very fast.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!</li>
            <li> I would not want to do without this super tool. My mouth is so much cleaner  and it shows when I go to my dentist. I wish I had this 45 years ago.</li>
            <li> Philips states the warranty is two years but when you call them they ask for the receipt. Who keeps a receipts for two years?  This is my third tooth Philips electric tooth bush and 2 of 3 died shortly after a year.  It cleans well but be prepared for a pricey piece of e-waste after a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace another Sonicare brush that conked out after five or six years.  That toothbrush had a lot of bells and whistles that I found I wasn&#x27;t using.  I like the sleek design of this toothbrush.  It looks smart, and it is easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Works great and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid use of Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes for many years. My last model did not have a timing mechanism. It also required daily cleaning to prevent the buildup of mold and other gunk. This model has no areas for buildup. It also has a &amp;#34;timing&amp;#34; device. I love the improvements.</li>
            <li> Slim, light and a joy to use.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare Elite finally died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this model because I didn&#x27;t need/want all of the extra features found in the higher-end models of Sonicare. But, I also didn&#x27;t want to go with the entry-level model, particularly not those that used the old &amp;#34;elite&amp;#34; style heads. The only complaint I had with the old Sonicare model was that the heads were sometimes difficult to attach/remove -- and, more crucially, the manner in which they attached to the handle made cleaning difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I opted for this model, with the newer snap-on heads, and I&#x27;m very happy with my choice. The handle fits well in the hand, it&#x27;s easy to operate, and it&#x27;s quite simple to remove/attach the heads (when sharing the unit amongst family members).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a toothbrush goes, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> electric toothbrush are really fun to use</li>
            <li> Excellent. Do Not buy the more expensive &amp;#34;multi function&amp;#34; one. I had that one for two years and NEVER used the other options. It just started losing its mojo and so I bought this model. I cannot tell you how fabulous this brush is. Just like after a dental cleaning every time you brush. Incredible invention.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get a Phillips toothbrush because they would do less damage to my crowns. I ordered this one a couple years ago and it has never missed a beat. We replace the heads now and then and my wife and I both use it, using our own heads marked with the color rings that come with the extra heads.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy toothbrush with essential functions, perfect for what I need. It only has one working mode, but to be frankly, my last Panasonic one has lots of functions and among the 4 yrs I owned it, 99.9% of the time I just used normal tooth cleaning feature. And I guess it&#x27;s the same to most of the people.&lt;br /&gt;Another great deal for this model is that it&#x27;s actually working fine on both 110v and 220v, makes it very easy to use aboard.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush yet! makes your teeth so clean, as if you had just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> Cleans so well my dentist commented on how well my teeth looked.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other people&#x27;s reviews lead me to this cheaper option. Electric toothbrushes have mostly solved my gum disease</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> After 7 months of use, this toothbrush has started intermittently stopping while I am using it.  I was careful to charge it fully before its first use, in fact, it worked beautifully until about 6 months.  I have changed the heads every 3 months, and I use only the Phillips Sonicare brand replacement brushes.  This is my second PS toothbrush, and I had no problems with my first one.  I am disappointed that I have no recourse after only 7 months.  My last one was 5 years old, and it still works, I just prefered this model because of easier cleaning.</li>
            <li> ccI had an electric brush years ago...it was OK. But never bothered getting another one. This one is just awesome. I like everything about it. The small charging stand, the size of the head,and how it feels on my teeth. I am late for a cleaning by several months, and I feel like this product is actually getting my teeth ready for the cleaning so that it won&#x27;t be so painful. Another great feature is that it turns off after 2 minutes...but usually I want to go another round, This actually makes me WANT to brush my teeth and look forward to brushing!!! c</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. my last one lasted about 10 years. Only problem I had with the last one was it cleanability. This new updated style has resolved that problem perfectly.  Couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else either.  Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> this is a lower end brush and it shows. the brush head comes loose every time I use it and the noise is deafening!! I wish I had purchased one of the more expensive options. brushes just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my dentist tell me I was brushing too vigorously and I could back off when using a normal toothbrush (baseline for my brushing habits). I chipped my front tooth when I was young and have a cap over it (baseline for tooth color).  After using this toothbrush for just a couple days I notice my teeth are smoother and after about a month I&#x27;m noticing that they are whiter because the false cap part is more yellow !!!  And no my teeth weren&#x27;t yellow ! This toothbrush has made them look like I&#x27;ve had professional whitening treatments from the dentist !  I love this thing, LOVE IT !  WELL worth the money ! You get what you pay for in this case and this toothbrush is fantastic !  Update 3/13/2015  The head piece tends to get moisture in it and will acquire mold inside but it is fairly easy to clean. Other than that, the toothbrush is still going strong and I still love it. No other issues, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing a Sonic, and I&#x27;m very happy with it!! I&#x27;m buying for the whole family now!!! Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. My daughter loves it and says her teeth feel super clean after each use. :)</li>
            <li> talk about a clean feeling, dentist confirms its effectiveness each time i go. you wont be disappointed using this product</li>
            <li> This little gem is fantastic. It&#x27;s quiet powerful, and goes for months on a single charge. I hide the charger beneath the sink and then every few months the toothbrush &amp;#34;tells&amp;#34; you that it needs to be charged by buzzing and shutting down. Then you just plant it on the stand for a night and you&#x27;re good to go for another few months! Mouth always feels clean and fresh and tingly after use. Only thing I wish is that it came with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Lighter, faster charging and most of all, the toothbrush heads stay CLEAN because&lt;br /&gt;there is no space for gunk to accumulate.</li>
            <li> I love the sonicare toothbrushes, this one is the more basic model, but it does everything I need it too!</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes since 2002 and bought this to replace an older and tired model. I thought that all the newer Sonicares that use the proresults brush heads are the same, except for some unnecessary buttons and brush modes. It seems that is not the case. While this brush works, it is pathetically weak, like the battery is half charged (it&#x27;s fully charged). I put my brush head on my wife&#x27;s Sonicare Flexcare base and it was MUCH more powerful and cleaned my teeth more thoroughly. So maybe I got a dud base, but it seems they are not all the same.</li>
            <li> It does what it do. Only issue I have is that it randomly turns off in the middle of use at times forcing me to waste an extra second of my life turning it back on.</li>
            <li> so glad I got this instead of the more expensive version. Works great! Simple, and does the job. I thought the timing for the different quadrant was a cool feature but after purchasing it was pointless and didn&#x27;t care too much for it. Definitely glad I got the less expensive one instead of spending money on all the extra and unnecessary features.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old Oral B.  The base is very small and should have rubber on bottom to keep it from tipping over.  I put a suction cup soap dish under it and that works well.</li>
            <li> All I know is I am very pleased with this unit! My teeth have never felt cleaner and since I am mostly disabled by a stroke this works really well for me.</li>
            <li> It has four beeps to let you know when to move on to the next area.  I like that.  It also initially works up to full speed the first dozen times or so.  This helps your mouth get used to the vibration.  It gets my teeth really clean, I love it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this because I was doing a good job with my manual toothbrush. This electric does a better job of doing my back molars and it reaches deeper in between the teeth. My teeth feel noticeably cleaner with this as opposed to a manual brush. Battery lasts for many brushes on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this specific model because the higher priced models from Sonicare are a waste of money. The higher end models are the same hardware, but with a different outer skin and more software programming. The extra software options are not useful: they just vary the length of time and lower the intensity of the brushing action. Most people will not use these extra \\&quot;features.\\&quot; If you need more time, you can turn the brush on again. Lowering the intensity defeats the purpose of an electric brush. A lower intensity is only useful if your teeth are very sensitive due to poor hygiene or due to injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lower end models use the older style brush heads. I don&#x27;t know for how long Sonicare will continue to provide replaceable heads for those, so I went with the cheapest model that uses the newest heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare&#x27;s highest end model (DiamondClean) claims to clean even better than this model. That is only true of the brush head that model comes with. Those particular DiamondClean brush heads are compatible with this EasyClean model and can be purchased separately; therefore, cleaning performance between the two models are exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This EasyClean model is the only model I recommend. Anything more expensive does not really provide anything extra (despite what the marketing department wants you to believe), and anything less expensive uses the old brush heads.</li>
            <li> Great item.  Well worth the price.  Takes a bit getting used to when it comes to the speed it goes.  I am used to my $25 Oral B Vitality electric toothbrush I have been using for years.  Night and day difference between this and cheaper models.  I believe it is well worth the extra price to get the &amp;#34;Quadpacer&amp;#34; setting that goes in 30 second intervals and stops for a second and continues telling you to change pattern and direction.  With my old toothbrush I used just to clean all over for two minutes in general.  This breaks your mouth down into 4 quad sections for better cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it for sure!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my wife. She is enjoying it everyday.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much, would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> We have used thes for years and would not use any other brand. The old one lasted about five years.</li>
            <li> Great purchase package arrived in time couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> After 7 years my original Sonicare began turnning itself off and on, which can be very disturbing in the middle of the night.  This fits the original charger and UV sanitizer, plus the refill heads I had in supply.  Love this thing durng semi-annual cleanings; much less picking and scraping by the hygenist.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am a major fan.  My latest one was a 4 year old Essence 5000 series and I recently smoked the charger while in Europe (I forgot it was not dual voltage).  Instead of buying a new charger I decided to change to the EasyClean 500 series because it eliminates the problem I had with gunk collecting inside the brush heads of the Essence brushes (gross, nasty, hard to clean stuff), and it has a dual voltage charger (100-240V). It also has Quadpacer which I consider essential.  As a side benefit, the brush heads are cheaper,  it uses lithium batteries (which are lighter and last longer) and the charger is smaller. I’ve been using it for a few weeks and consider it a major improvement over the Essence series. Anyone considering purchasing an Essence should also note that the current Essence model does not have Quadpacer. Do yourself a favor and spend the few extra bucks for the Easyclean. It is the cheapest model that has all the important features. Check out my review of the Essence for a comparison.</li>
            <li> My gum disease has disappeared with using this brush just at night. No surgery.  It was rated the best several years ago when I purchased my first one.  Like any rechargeable produced the battery wore out so I purchased the same brush again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and packaging. The product is aptly named as it&#x27;s very easy to clean. The toothbrush and charger take up next to no space in my bathroom. The travel bag is very handy.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I bought with the lowest price I could find. Love sonicare</li>
            <li> We bought this for our children to share. It&#x27;s an upgrade from their kids sonicare which stopped vibrating after about a year or so.</li>
            <li> Great price and works awesome</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement to a more expensive model of the Philips toothbrush. In my opinion it cleans and feels as well as the old one. I would give it 5 stars if it had an indicator of the battery level, so you could charge the brush before it runs out.</li>
            <li> I had this for more than one year and I love it.  Battery life is great and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS Phillips Sonicare.  It&#x27;s compact, concise, and gets the job done!  The first one I had, had bells and whistles I never used!</li>
            <li> My dad love it. I myself use Philips Sonicare HX5610/01 Essence and find that a little bit gross to clean the head part. I asked this about my dad and his toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this one uses a global charger which makes travel around the world much easier lol. (mine can only be used inside the U.S. )</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. Effectively cleans, it&#x27;s not loud. It is definitely worth the money. My dentist noticed an improvement when I had went for my cleaning after purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I had the original Sonicare for several years and loved what it did for my teeth. What I didn&#x27;t like was apparently the same things everyone else didn&#x27;t like: the size, the so-so battery life and the filth that would form inside the handle and brush heads. All of those problem have been eliminated. This model is slim and feels good in the hand; the older model felt like a vintage hot rod, great at what it was supposed to do but lacking the tightness that comes with modern engineering. Cleaning was a tremendous hassle on the older model and part I least liked about it. I&#x27;ve had this model for a month and it still looks as clean as it did the day it arrived. Finally, the battery life has been exceptional. My wife and I both use this twice a day and we are still on the initial charge; the old one needed a charge every 5-6 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one of the best consumer products I&#x27;ve purchased in a while.</li>
            <li> There are many excellent reviews for this toothbrush on here, hundreds in fact, so I just want to highlight some of my main observations:&lt;br /&gt;- this model is very good value, and I do not see benefits of getting the higher end ones (I used to have a top end Braun and never used its extra modes or features);&lt;br /&gt;- the depth of cleaning outperforms the Braun (both in feeling and in reports back from my dentist)&lt;br /&gt;- the battery life is excellent, lasting at least two weeks on 2-3 minutes of brushing twice a day (my Braun was 3-5 days when new and down to 2 days after a couple of days)&lt;br /&gt;- the sensation of brushing takes a few weeks to get used to (it gradually rises in intensity over a couple of weeks, but still felt pretty intense) but once you are used to it, it feels absolutely fine&lt;br /&gt;- the old style heads and those of the Braun catch all kinds of crud and gunk but these new Sonicare heads stay clean and sanitary all the time&lt;br /&gt;- yes, replacement heads are expensive compared to a normal toothbrush, so this is a more expensive option, but the results for your dental health are worth it</li>
            <li> From my research it seems like you can pay more for a sonicare toothbrush, but you don&#x27;t get much more.  This toothbrush is more compact than the old style Sonicare toothbrush (the ones that had screw on toothbrush heads) and it works about as well.  Because it doesn&#x27;t have the screw on toothbrush head, cleaning is much easier and there aren&#x27;t as many crevices to get gunked up.</li>
            <li> The little beep is fantastic at encouraging you to brush each quadrant the full 30 seconds.  Slimmer than the model I used to have--so easier to use.</li>
            <li> Had the old style and it was so gunky to clean.  This one is a dream.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  I never thought there was a difference in battery operated toothbrushes until I ordered this for my wife.  After using it you feel like you&#x27;ve just left the dentist every time.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine how it would be any different from any other tooth brush until you actually use one for the first time.  I&#x27;m in the military so I&#x27;m typically pretty &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; but after using my wife&#x27;s toothbrush, I ordered one for myself!</li>
            <li> This is the best electric toothbrush I ever used. I like it and it feels good in the mouth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how awesome a good toothbrush could be until I bought one. This has seriously changed my nightly habits. The brush works 1,000 times better than a normal toothbrush and tells you when to change sides. The brush heads swap out super easily when it&#x27;s time (it also tells you that) and goes forever on the same charge. I&#x27;ve brought it with me on week long trips with no charge and it lasted just fine.  It&#x27;s also much quieter than some of the alternatives. Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Brush is VERY noisy and really too tall.  Does the job, but not as handy or nice as older models.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush was better than I had expected. I have used an older model for many years, have been very pleased with it, but it finally died. I would have bought this sooner had I realized the significant improvements they made over the years.</li>
            <li> Battery crapped out almost exactly two years from when I bought it.  When it worked I liked I would give it four stars, but for how expensive this is I expect the battery to last more than two years.</li>
            <li> I love that toothbrush, finally back to Sonicare after a few years of OralB. The round head doesn&#x27;t work for me, Sonicare&#x27;s long bent brush head is so much better. Unfortunately it came only with one.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush. This is my second one. My other stopped working after 7 years which lasted much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I absolutely love it! I decided not to go with a toothbrush that had all the bells and whistles, which was hard not to, but I knew in the end I wouldn&#x27;t use all the fancy stuff. This toothbrush is perfect. Press the button, spend 30 seconds in each quadrant (it will let you know when to switch quadrants), and then after 2 minutes it automatically shuts off. Very simple. The brush only vibrates, it does not go in circular motions. My husband has a different kind of toothbrush that does go in circular motions so hopefully it&#x27;s as effective, which I&#x27;m sure it is. Oh and it does come with a travel case!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd sonicare toothbrush that our family owns (both of our children have the kids version). This is a no-nonsense electric toothbrush that does a great job cleaning.  Simply start the toothbrush and you get a soft beep/stop reminder to switch quadrants.  After 2 minutes it will turn off.  Easy to use and a great investment in your dental health.</li>
            <li> These sonicare are always the Perfect toothbrush .</li>
            <li> got this as replacement for the worn out  older model.  It charges easily,  handle allows a good grip, cleans well  and is quiet</li>
            <li> Works just as described.  Great improvement to a battery operated toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought for a Christmas gift.  We love Sonicare toothbrushes.  They may not last as long as a Braun but they do clean your teeth well.  I like them better because they rotate at a faster RPM.  That may be why they wear out faster.</li>
            <li> This is my wifes third or fourth Sonicare toothbrush. They have all worked great with some lasting as long as 4 years before the seal where the brush head plugs into the handle fails and allows water to get in. This model does not have all the extra buttons/ settings which she never used on previous models, so it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a year now, and am very happy with it. I did replace the standard brush head with the &amp;#34;diamond clean&amp;#34; brush heads, which cost a bit more but have denser bristles. The brush and replacement brush heads are a bit expensive, but they&#x27;re certainly cheaper than fillings, or more significant dental issues down the road. I find that not only does this brush clean better than a standard brush, but I also use it more regularly. (I&#x27;m less likely to skip brushing in the morning if I&#x27;m in a rush for some reason).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist (without knowing I was using this brush) said in my last visit that my teeth and gums looked great, and that she couldn&#x27;t find any plaque to scrape off during the cleaning! I do of course also floss and mouthwash, but this brush has made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t switched to sonicare yet, do it now.</li>
            <li> this one was a gift but I&#x27;ve had one for many years....I feel like I haven&#x27;t brushed when I&#x27;m away from home....</li>
            <li> Great product. I Highly recommended this unit. Works perfectly. If you want clean teeth, this product works wonderfully. Just plug it in and let it charge and then you are all set.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush delivers on its promise to clean teeth at home like never before.  It gets rid of all the nasty stuff accumulated in the nooks and crannies.  Makes hand-brushing and flossing seem primitive and ineffective.  Far better than any other low-speed electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  A great little brush.</li>
            <li> I got this one for my son to take to college.  What I liked about it is that the brush fits directly into the base, without a &amp;#34;collar&amp;#34; around the point where the two parts meet, and where disgusting debris can collect.  Also, with him being at college, I figured that he would never bother cleaning it, as I clean the one at home here.  I bought a pack of replacement heads, also, which are readily available.  The one size apparently fits many of the Sonicare models.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! My teeth feel dentist clean after use.</li>
            <li> Love the new design.  Sleeker, thinner, and doesn&#x27;t collect spit like the old ones.  This model is  great for me it has the two minute timer, battery indicator, and charger.  All the features of the more expensive models seem useless so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay extra for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for more than ten years.  THis purchase was for my son.  It makes not only tooth, but also support healthy gum. I use this blush with the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Works great, exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 is perfect and meets all my expectations.  The design and fit are just what I wanted, and the 30 second &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; is also just what I wanted.  The bristles, brush head size and handle exceed what I expected.  Recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the product. The built-in reminder to move to another section when brushing is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love it. My teeth haven&#x27;t been this clean since I was a kid.  I used to have a tartar issue on my lower front teeth but not anymore. My hygienist hates it because I haven&#x27;t seen her in over a year. It cleans your teeth that well!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in a few years and the size has greatly reduced. Compact and easy to fit on any vanity. This model gradually increases the intensity over the first several uses and lets you get usesd to the vibration. Would give 5 stars if it came with more than one head and the plug was a flat style.</li>
            <li> My hygienist suggested an electric toothbrush so I purchased this one and wondered why it took me so long to switch to electric! My teeth feel so much cleaner, easy to use, and worth every dollar.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush and I use it daily and have been a fan of Sonicare for 25 plus years</li>
            <li> The electric toothbrush is for the UK.  I can&#x27;t use it here without a converter.  The seller was from the UK and if he were honest, would have brought this to my attention.  I didn&#x27;t realize he was from the UK when I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to see some friends from the UK to re-gift it as it makes no sense to pay postage back to the UK.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I bought one at Walmart and like it very much!</li>
            <li> I both this because my peridontist told me it is the best.  I&#x27;m 62 years old and I have always taken good care of my teeth.  When I told him I was using a regular toothbrush he said if you want no further problems get the sonic.  I&#x27;m happy with it and it definitely will get all the gook out.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful with it because it can hurt if your not careful.</li>
            <li> This replaces my Sonicare that I bought 15 years ago, which finally ran low on battery power. Actually, it is the second replacement I bought for it. I wasn&#x27;t aware that the first didn&#x27;t have the 30-second timer in it and I didn&#x27;t like that. I love my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have used this more than 1 year and now I decided to give it a review because it suddenly stopped work.&lt;br /&gt;It will start automatically by itself, and I cannot even stop it by press the button.&lt;br /&gt;So I contacted the amazon service asking about the warranty information. But the agent have no idea about the warranty information and ask me to call Philips. Of course he/she gave the number to call.&lt;br /&gt;I think Amazon should improve in this area, they should always know the warranty information about the product on their site, not direct customers to the manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok. anyway, I called Philips. I told the agent the serial number and he directly asked me an address to replace it with a new one! that really surprised me a lot. (Usually I need to spend an hour to get a replacement for warranty, because they always have some kind of excuse)&lt;br /&gt;But worth mentioning, I stay in Singapore, Philips only offer shipping to US or Canada. So he advised me that they can ship it to my friend in US, and my friend can help ship it to me.&lt;br /&gt;That is just too much trouble, so I asked is there anything I can do to fix it by myself.&lt;br /&gt;He told me I can try to reset it.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, fully charge, hold the button for 10 second. release it, turn off.&lt;br /&gt;Bang! It works now!&lt;br /&gt;It is really good service from Philips, I have been a customer of them many years for many products.&lt;br /&gt;Despite their recent discontinuing RQ12 shaver head, they are still doing a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides all these, I think the product itself is pretty good. It help me ensure 2 min brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It worked reasonably well for 3 years and then the base charger died and now it&#x27;s not functional anymore.  Apparently the warranty is for 2 years only.</li>
            <li> I had an older Sonicare for years before it&#x27;s stopped charging, so I got this one to replace it. This model is much easier to keep clean (the other one could grow mold on the inside) which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Replaced an older unit with this one.  Much smaller.  Easier to clean!</li>
            <li> very nice and easy to use, recommended</li>
            <li> I like it.. Seems to be a pretty good electric tooth brush</li>
            <li> These are great when they work!!........Second one that broke under a year...this time in a record 10 months.......our first one lasted about 5 -6 years!....plan to contact the company.</li>
            <li> I had a higher-end model, but we never used any of the extra features or modes.  When it died, we replaced it with this unit.  It does everything we want and was cheaper.  My only complaint is that you can&#x27;t disable the timer pulses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do a fantastic job cleaning.  I used to have stained teeth from drinking tea and coffee.  A couple of weeks with the Sonicare, and they disappeared.</li>
            <li> Dental techs recommended Sonicare and I finally bought one and I (and they) notice the difference in my teeth cleanliness</li>
            <li> Bought it locally. Using the original ProResults and black DiamondClean heads together (looks really sweet with those by the way). Love it so much that I can&#x27;t wait to finish this review and go brush my teeth.    2014/11/8 Edit: Since I wrote this lazy \\&quot;review\\&quot; I got the Flexcare &amp; Healthy White Plastic Travel Handle Case. It fits perfectly. The DiamondClean heads too even though their bases are a bit wider. Do get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.    Almost two months of usage, the brush has yet to disappoint me. It&#x27;s my little morning joy. It certainly works! Never had such smooth teeth, let alone the back ones. It&#x27;s just a matter of getting used to the brush and you start feeling every hair&#x27;s location despite the vibration.  During the first week I literally abused it - brushed 3-4 times a day and it still managed way past 2 weeks on one charge.     Function wise - no need for more buttons, more accessories (except for the case),  more lights, more programs etc. If I need to brush some more, I turn it on again. If the battery is low,  it vibrates when switching off, and can work for some days more. That&#x27;s it. 30+ years of manual  brushing forgotten in less than a week. Good riddance!</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare toothbrushes for years. My old brush finally gave out so had to get a new one. I like the new brush heads as they do not get dirty and the handle is slimmer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that finally died after 5 years. Since it lasted so long I wanted to stick with this brand. It works wonderfully no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve owned in the last 15 years and I credit them with maintaining my oral health to the point where I hardly ever need any work at the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest version has slimmed down the handle significantly, which is not a bad thing.  However the stand has also been minimized and that&#x27;s not so good.  Firstly the inherent &#x27;torque&#x27; in the power cord makes it hard to set it securely on the counter top, it keeps trying to twist away, particularly when the brush is in use.  Second the little spigot that the brush rests on, combined with the base&#x27;s very small footprint, doesn&#x27;t really hold it securely and I&#x27;ve already knocked or dropped the brush on the floor as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product apart from this.</li>
            <li> I bought the Sonicare HX6511 Easy Clean Toothbrush as a birthday gift for my husband and he loves it!  Good quality and a great value.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works well, and is comfortable to hold.  However, it seems like a long time before the timer gets engaged.</li>
            <li> this is my first electric toothbrush and I am very happy. My teeth feel fresher and cleaner when done. It shuts off after 2 minute cleaning time, which is helpful.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush cause it runs so quiet compared to some and the speed of the electric brush seems to make my teeth feel cleaner. It holds a charge for a very long time and the size is great--not bulky so is great when we travel.</li>
            <li> brush does a very good job and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to clean than other electric toothbrushes.  The brush head is easy to remove for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. When I went for my last cleaning, the dentist said mine was definitely the cleanest mouth they&#x27;d seen all day. The hygienist said she had never worked less to clean someone&#x27;s teeth/gums. Ha! Sounds like I am making this up, but I am not. I had an Oral B one before, and never got such comments from the dentist (but it was a different dentist--maybe they had different standards??). The good check-up probably has something to do with genes, but I really believe this toothbrush helped.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I looked at a lot of the different Sonicare models before purchasing. I think it is worth getting the Easy Clean because it has the beeps to mark 30 seconds. This is very valuable, I found previously, with just a 2-minute shut off, I would often turn the brush off before the 2 mins was up. Now, I have no problem making it to 2 mins and sometimes even go over. In my opinion, Sonicare models that are more expensive than this one do not offer features that make them worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for about six years. A few months ago, my previous one died. It was the Flexcare model, which has four cleaning modes (sensitive, massage, \\&quot;on-the-go\\&quot; and cleaning). My husband uses a manual toothbrush, so I went out and got myself one. I&#x27;d forgotten how useless they are for cleaning this tea drinker&#x27;s teeth. My teeth got noticeably more stained. So, being a bit of a cheapskate, I bought a battery powered toothbrush. Awful! It made a terrible racket, made my gums sore, and didn&#x27;t do any better of a job cleaning my teeth than the manual one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed my Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my previous model at my dentist&#x27;s office, but wondered if there were any new models that my dentist didn&#x27;t carry so I got onto Amazon. Lo and behold, there was this model, which there was a coupon for, thus making it about fifty dollars less than the model I figured I&#x27;d buy again. I never once used any of the special cleaning modes when I had the Flexcare model, so this one made sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this one better. The charger stand is a bit smaller and looks nicer sitting on my sink. It does the same job. You can use any of the Sonicare heads, including the Diamond head that comes with their top of the line model. That is the one I use and it does a great job of keeping my teeth looking good and feeling almost as clean as if I had just gone to the dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you drink coffee or black tea (especially tea) you simply must use a Sonicare! I sound like a shill for the company, but I don&#x27;t think they need any help. I&#x27;m just a happy customer.</li>
            <li> We purchased this as replacement to our previous Sonicare which we used for 9 years. This is definitely an improvement, sleeker, lighter &amp; just as hygienic. The smooth plastic shell is much better than the original rubber coated version. V  ery pleased &amp; would highly recommend as great VFM too.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for over a week for one user. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for nearly a year now, and cannot say enough good things about it. My teeth feel much cleaner after brushing than they ever did with a manual toothbrush. When I first got it I was unable to use it due to an intense tickling feeling on my gums, but I found out that you can set the toothbrush to get progressively more intense over the course of several brushings to allow your teeth to adjust. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up on it. I would recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a product that is with you at the start and end of your day? Faithfully cleaning your teeth beautifully (to the point your dentist compliments you on them) and never once letting you down? Only thing it asks for is a quick charge every once in a while (how does it last that long w/o a charge?!) and a new brush head when the last one looks like its ready to go to the happy brush after life..... After much researching, I bought this brush a looong time ago and its still going strong. GREAT PRODUCT!! Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Nice improvement over previous design. Good value and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Waited so long to write a review, because I wanted to see how long it would last and it is still going, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my Sonicare. I&#x27;ve used it for several years as recommended by my Periodontist to treat gum disease. Alway loved it. I purchased this one thru amazon and was so impressed by the ease and by the prompt delivery. Ordered it on a Thursday pm and it was delivered on Saturday am! I saved over $40 by using an app on my phone. Can&#x27;t get much better than this!</li>
            <li> good value for the money. I bought this as a gift. I checked prices since I purchased this and I got a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these and had the same breakage issue each time -- the metal insert that holds the brush to the handle will pop out when changing the toothbrush head. It cannot be re-inserted to restore full functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had simply not taken care of the item the first time I had this issue, but the same breakage occurred even when I was very careful to keep my second purchase dry and corrosion-free. Each time the toothbrush lasted me less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> the best would not buy anything else</li>
            <li> I had the older model, which was big and bulky, very awkward to use. This thing is light and slim, a huge improvement! The only complaint is that the charging base is lighter than the actual toothbrush and power cord, so I can&#x27;t even get it to stand up easily on the base while trying to charge it. Would have also been nice to include a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!!  Easty to se!  Price is great!  my dental tech recommended a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; one,this was far cheaper than the best brand at a big box store!  Price, quality and fast service !!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning your teeth. Has 4 interval settings so you can time the brushing of each quadrant of your mouth and do a thorough job. Recommend buying replacement toothbrush heads as you need to replace them every few months for maximum effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This will be my 3rd Sonicare in 12 yrs, my last one actually lasted me 5yrs replacing the heads every 6 months or so. I hope this one will too.</li>
            <li> Our family has used Phillips Sonicare products for years and all of them have worked as they are advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 days and my teeth have never felt cleaner! I was concerned about it fitting to the back of my mouth to clean my wisdom teeth, but it reaches great!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what my dentist has to say!</li>
            <li> The Sonic Care toothbrush is working great. It is easy to work and makes a real difference. I like the timing feature. Great price too.</li>
            <li> after loosing and forgetting them in hotel rooms i keep coming back to this toothbrush. Nothing cleans like a sonicare. The Diamond Clean model is better but the only real advantage is the heads wich work just as well on this model at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Good price; fast service.</li>
            <li> My teeth are really clean &amp; like smaller handle.</li>
            <li> I bought the EasyClean after my beloved FlexCare (that I had for 8 years!) finally died. This was less than half the cost of a new FlexCare. It has fewer bells and whistles (almost none) but has the same motor/force/brushes per second and the Quadpacer - which is all I really used anyway. It works great! And it is, in fact, very easy to clean. Perfect!!</li>
            <li> My old one died and the lure of one not building plaque and gunk very appealing. I&#x27;m happy with choice.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be much better.</li>
            <li> Like a vibrator for your teeth.  Teeth feel cleaner after using this brush.  Love the 2 minute timer unless I am running late for work.  Battery stays charged for a long time maybe 20-30 cleanings.   Status Update:  The toothbrush died today and no longer moves via mechanical operation.  Can i still be used as a &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; well of course, but the purpose of this brush is to actually clean your teeth not rub them manually.</li>
            <li> Employed for over a year, this toothbrush has reliably cleaned my teeth and gums better than anything else ever has.  My teeth are whiter, my gums pinker, and my mouth is healthier because of it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and easy to use. Really like the way my teeth feel after using it as well as the additional brush head included. Once again Sonicare has come through with a great product.</li>
            <li> I owned the old sonicare model and it stopped working after about 10 years.  This new model is fabulous, I love it. Using the sonicare is addicting.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to clean than the older Sonicare I owned.</li>
            <li> Present for my daughter, she loves it and helps her dental health very much.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Sonicare brush that had the screw-on brush heads. It never stayed clean, and just got really gross after awhile. This new version works just as good, if not better, but doesn&#x27;t have the areas that can fill with moisture and funk. All in all, this is a must have!</li>
            <li> My last Phillips electric toothbrush died after seven years.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I got my money&#x27;s worth out of it, using it at least twice a day for seven years.  I bought this one and it serves me just as well as the last.  I notice some people bringing their chargers with them on trips, and I never do.  If I fully charge this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to put it on the charger again for at least a month.  My mouth feels cleaner than when I use a regular toothbrush, plus I know that I&#x27;m not brushing too hard.  My dentist gives me high compliments on my teeth and gums whenever I go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works good.  No problems.  It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I like it.</li>
            <li> We bought as a gift she likes it</li>
            <li> When my dentist told me to suck it up and go buy a Sonicare I was a little perplexed by the number of different versions available. I&#x27;m convinced that this one is the best value. You probably don&#x27;t need all the advanced features of the more expensive models. I&#x27;ve been happy with this and don&#x27;t find myself concerned that I don&#x27;t have a UV head sanitizer or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a few other electric toothbrushes, but the Sonicare is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These tools do not last. They do a decent job cleaning teeth and preventing decay and gum disease, but we&#x27;ve gone through 5 handles in about 6 years. This last one lasted 6 months before it stopped vibrating and made a loud buzzing noise. Philips replaced it, but planned obsolescence seems to be a marketing strategy here.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush, you&#x27;ll never go back to a regular one again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my dentist urged me to buy one. I&#x27;m very glad I did and see a real difference over the cheaper electric brushes. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than my other (less expensive) Sonicare.  My teeth feel very clean and I&#x27;ve noticed they&#x27;re slightly less yellow after using for a couple of weeks. :)  I like the buzzer every 30 seconds that tells me to move to the next sectino. My other Sonicare didn&#x27;t have this option and so I&#x27;d have to watch the second hand on the clock in my bathroom to ensure I was brushing each quadrant with an equal amount of time.</li>
            <li> owned them for years, the best</li>
            <li> I love the Phillips sonicare toothbrushes! Mu dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush for me. Will never go back to a manual toothbrush again!</li>
            <li> I really like this electric toothbrush because I can feel the difference from using a manual one. Cleaner and fresh. Helps with getting your gums toughened up so there&#x27;s no bleeding gums. Have to floss too.  My dentist approves this brand too.</li>
            <li> It is good and I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> So much easier to clean than the Sonicare I had before! Love that I can just pop the brush head on it and go. Also like that it is lighter.</li>
            <li> We like the slim design of the &amp;#34;EasyClean&amp;#34;  much better than the original sonicare design.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, easy to clean, and easy to store on the base.  The design is much improved.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of twice-daily use by two people (4 uses per day total), the toothbrush has started to operate unevenly - at random the sound gets annoyingly louder, and/or the vibration weakens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice product - brushing is easy and effective, it&#x27;s small and light and reasonably easy to keep clean, and never we&#x27;ve had any issues keeping it charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The older model with the larger brush heads (now sold as the Essence) seemed to be a more solid product, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy to keep clean and the replacement heads cost more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, contacting Philips to get a free warranty replacement was easy (it&#x27;s a 2 year warranty).</li>
            <li> So my wife comes home one day from the dentist saying she needs to buy a $80 tooth brush because her dentist said she had plaque build-up issues.  My initial reaction was &amp;#34;So we need to drop $80 on an electric tooth brush because you never learned to brush your teeth?&amp;#34;  I then came to the conclusion that we needed to focus on solutions and realized that this might allow her to keep her teeth in old age.  &amp;#34;Sure, honey, let&#x27;s pay $80 for a toothbrush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the thing came in the mail and I was still annoyed.  But you know I had to try it...  One night, after she went to bed, I snuck in the bathroom and fired it up.  It felt pretty weird at first and the zone alarm was pretty useless since everyone has certain spots on their mouth that require much more attention than others.  Anyway, I went with it.  Your whole head vibrates to this thing but it was a gentle on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it stopped, I pulled it out of my mouth feeling like I had just rubbed numbing gel all over my lips.  I ran my tongue across my teeth and lo and behold they felt like I had just stepped out of the dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely say this about technology purchases but I can honestly say that the Phillips Sonicare HX6511/50 made me a better human being.  It also earned a rare apology for my loving wife.</li>
            <li> My old one lasted almost 15 years before it dies!  I hope this replacement lasts just as long.</li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare for over 10 years and love it. This was a replacement for my older one that stopped working. What a disappointment! It has very little power, it just does not have the power of other ones I have had. I am returning it and getting a Pro.</li>
            <li> While I found that this toothbrush tickled my mouth so much I could hardly brush at first, I&#x27;ve been very impressed with how clean my teeth feel when I&#x27;m finished. I no longer felt ticklish after the first week. After a month of use, I&#x27;m very pleased. It&#x27;s a simple, well-constructed design. As long as the innards last, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Cleans extremely well, easy to hold, can tell plaque is being removed. This is the third unit purchased for my family.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare  toothbrush. My first one lasted a little over 10 years and I never had a problem with it. I&#x27;ve been using my new one for about 2 weeks now and I JUST LOVE IT! I like the way my teeth feel - as if I just left the dentist&#x27;s office after a professional cleaning. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product, like the smaller brush head and the way it attaches!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Easy clean from Amazon.  I also own a 10 year old Essence Sonicare.  I was immediately disappointed in the Easy clean output.  The brushes hardly moved compared to my older Essence.  So I returned the Easy clean to Amazon.  Then I figured that maybe I got a bad unit.  I went to Walmart and purchased a new Easy Clean and a new Essence.  I charged and set both to full power (not easy start of ramp-up).  I would say that the Essence has twice the brushing power of the newer style Sonicare.  I want a brush that really challenges my gums; and that is exactly what Sonicare recommends.  They say use the highest settings always.  Well the Easy clean is like a massaging brush rather than full power clean.  I am keeping the new Essence and returning the Easy Clean.  I would bet that all new models have the same problem because of the slender body that keeps side to side vibration in check.  The Essence is a trade off in that the user must remove the head after use and wash in under water.  It is not a sealed unit.  But it&#x27;s a small price to pay for better performance.  Beware that more expensive is NOT better.</li>
            <li> I like that the brush attaches to the handle without having to be screwed on. The handle of the screw on brushes gathers all sorts of gunk. This one is cleaner. The small base is great too. The small brush-head takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is all hype. They try to trick you into believing that their brush actually works well. It&#x27;s just a gimmick. You&#x27;re better off purchasing the Oral B version instead which does a much better job of cleaning your teeth and in between around the gums.  I wish I had known this before wasting my good hard earned money on the Sonicare. Last time I&#x27;m ever buying anything from this company!</li>
            <li> I ordered this slimmed down version of the toothbrush because I have a similar toothbrush at my winter home in Florida.  I have been very happy with that one and the new one did not disappoint.  The only other comment I would make is that the toothbrush only comes with one head so if you&#x27;re sharing you&#x27;re going to have to come up with some more dough to get a second one.</li>
            <li> After using Sonicare Elite for more than 10 years, I find this model just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> First time owning a sonicare toothbrush - I&#x27;ve used a manual toothbrush for the last 23 years of my life. After brushing with this thing for the first time, my teeth felt very smooth along the gum line. No toothpaste needed! Nice and quiet, very convenient to have a signal every 30 seconds to remind me to brush the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; of my teeth. It felt strange allowing the toothbrush do all of the work... it almost felt like I was cheating because it was so easy but in reality, the 31,000 strokes/min probably did a much better job cleaning than my manual toothbrushing ever could. Happy with my purchase so far and the 2 year warranty doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> Great product and entirely satisfied.  This was a replacement for one that I had for years and the design changes make it better than my old one.  I live in Lihue, HI, and couldn&#x27;t find it on the island nor could I get it mailed to Hawaii through Sonicare.  Thanks to Amazon I now have my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this toothbrush. It fixed everything that I disliked about my old Sonicare, which was primarily the gunk build up under the brush head unit. However while it worked at first the thing didn&#x27;t last 5 months. I ordered it in June 14 and by october it was making a funny noise, and before the end of october it was dead.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this several times before I actually purchased one. Now I wish I had not waited so long. My teeth feel so much cleaner after using this. I really like how it alerts you to when it is time to switch quadrants. I find it easier to be thorough and just like that my teeth feel better.</li>
            <li> This  toothbrush exceeded my expectations. I had one a long time ago so it was great to have one again. Glad I made this purchase. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for a replacement of the same design but different model number. My previous one lasted just about 3 years and had stopped charging. After some tinkering I was able to open the casing and found that it was soaking wet with water the battery as well as the motor were corroded beyond repair. (seems to be somewhat common). I had just purchased 14 generic brush heads that fit well with this model so I decided that I was going to give it another go. So far so good, I did register my toothbrush on the website to ensure if I have any charging,battery or motor issues in the next 2 1/2 years Ill be covered. Overall a good buy and a good rechargeable toothbrush for the price.</li>
            <li> I never thought it to be possible, but this toothbrush makes me want to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without my sonicare... there&#x27;s just nothing that does as good a job on cleaning your teeth!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product. At first my tickle response was outrageous, but I stayed with it and now enjoy my sonic session, that is timed automatically to shut off after 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Used an older sonicare and didn&#x27;t like it very much. This newer design is much better. The handle is slimmer than the older one, which is very comfortable. The brush fits into the chassis much better and doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward space for run off to collect. Charger is very compact and simple. Very happy with my purchase, my teeth feel cleaner, and I look forward to brushing my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I am a convert to electric toothbrushes, mainly because proper-size manual toothbrushes are no longer available ( a proper toothbrush has much longer brush length.  I don&#x27;t mean the length of the bristles, I mean the distance from the tip of the toothbrush to where the bristles peter out at the handle part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit seems to work well.  What I don&#x27;t like is the frequent interruptions.  It stops for an instant every 30 sec. and quits altogether after 2 minutes; you have to restart the dumb thing to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still and all, it&#x27;s easier than manual brushing and apparently at least as efficacious, so yeah, I am glad I got one.  Until it quits working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW don&#x27;t get the rotary kind.  What an idiot idea, completely at variance with proper brushing procedure.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare and I love it. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now and I don&#x27;t have trouble with the battery or the toothbrush heads it all works great.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and I like the design that I only need to press one button before I brush. Simple and no need further thinking.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted years.  When the gunk buildup was too much to deal with and the battery started to fail, I bought the HX6511.  It worked fine, but did not have a detailed battery meter like my first.  It quit charging after less than a year.</li>
            <li> I love the new design.  I had 2 of the old types that the brush head screwed onto.  Even though I took them apart every day to rinse and dry, they were difficult to keep from getting a mildew buildup.  Very gross!  So, I love this one&#x27;s pin design and compact base.</li>
            <li> Be warned, the manual states this brush takes an incredible 24hrs to charge fully. So, what you are telling me, is that when I&#x27;m out traveling, I have to devote an entire day to charge my brush?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is that possible? That is absurd and seriously takes away from the rating of this brush. Sorry</li>
            <li> First, mine came with a travel case and two toothbrushes. Ive used the Braun electric toothbrush with quite satisfactory results since 1990.  To a large extent, the work is being done by the brush heads, therefore one can get different results depending on which you use.  To a large extent, I find the wide array of brushes unnecessary.  Now to the Sonicare.  The first thing I did was to deactivate the 14 day ramp up system. This is good for first time electric toothbrush users.  You generally get a little bleeding when you start with an electric toothbrush.  Next I noticed how small the brush heads are.  Now on to my perceptions. The head actually moves very little compared to the Braun Oral-B system. But this does not equate to less effective cleaning.  This seems to clean much quicker to to the much more rapid vibration than the Oral-B.  At the end of the 2 minute timer, my teeth were clean.  An impressive feat.  So, I recommend this without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This was recommend by my dentist. I love it! Bought 3, one for me. my husband and my daughter!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I wish the head was a little bigger, I was use to a Crest Spin Brush Pro - but I couldn&#x27;t get it in the smaller places I needed to. Don&#x27;t like the beep either but I ignore it and brush the way I want &amp; restart it. The stopping allows me to add more toothpaste, you can use a dab at a time only with this brush. Not a problem for penny pinchers&#x27; like me.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece of equipment that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Easy to use, easy to clean, small footprint in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it for long so I am trying to get use to it. Overall it seems to work fine. I just got to get use to the edging feeling on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Really like this.  The timer goes off 4 times so that you brush your teeth in 4 quadrants.</li>
            <li> Love it, got one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. Mouth feels very clean. Took a little getting used to, but now I don&#x27;t think I could switch back to a normal toothbrush. I also bought this model since it was the lowest model type you could buy and still use the diamond brush replacements.</li>
            <li> We have two of these, and prefer them over the higher priced model that has variable speeds, because we only use the high speed, and the button on the other one gets hit by mistake, cause a change in speed while brushing. I&#x27;ll keep the other as a spare.</li>
            <li> Much better than I had anticipated. First electric toothbrush, and I now know I should have been using one a long time ago, and this one seems very good.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so clean! I will never go back to a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Nice handle small enough for kids to hold.</li>
            <li> Really gets my teeth clean and the &amp;#34;Quad pacer&amp;#34; feature forces me to brush for the entire dentist-recommended two minutes. The wireless charging stand is handy and makes keeping the whole thing clean very easy.</li>
            <li> Amazing cleaning with this product. Not to mention a decently long warranty.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of use, the on/off button is completely gone and we can no longer turn the toothbrush on/off so it&#x27;s garbage. Called Phillips and they said there&#x27;s nothing they can do for us. They admitted this was a common problem with these toothbrushes, but do nothing to address the situation. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Beware!! stopped working after 6 months. Cannot be fixed. when it worked it did excellent job. I wish it would last food more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she loved it! Product is of good quality and arrived in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> Love sonicare toothbrushes, makes a great gift for all ages! Really cleans your teeth, making for great dental checkups!</li>
            <li> The battery on this one doesn&#x27;t seem to stay charged as long as the one I replaced. Works great though!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush, but it stopped working properly after a few months of use. Sonicare did send me a replacement under the warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because my wife and I already have Sonicares and love them.  She is lovin&#x27; hers as well.  This toothbrush blows all others out of the water.  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  This model is simple and great to travel with.  It lasts for weeks on one charge and has a light to indicate the charge status.  I have another model for home and after 6 months of use, my dental hygentist was very pleased at how much of an improvement I had made from previous appointments.  The only difference is using this toothbrush both at home and on the road travelling.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had the original sonicare (with the split brush head) for 8 years before it died on me. I went back to regular toothbrushes for a while. What a mistake. Within a year, I had cavities again and my teeth were no longer as white.&lt;br /&gt;I received this today and immediately brushed my teeth. It felt fantastic. My teeth were noticeably whiter and so smooth. It&#x27;s been a few hours and I&#x27;m still running my tongue over my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I like this toothbrush because it&#x27;s simple. I never used any of the fancy functions on my old brush. These new head designs are so much better. I was always cleaning moldy gunk out of my old one. Overall, great buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these for my husband and I after our last cleaning. They are awesome! My mouth has continued to feel dentist clean! The quadrant timer is super helpful. The brush head works great for a more crowded mouth. The standard bristles are perfectly fine for sensitive gums.  The brushes even hold their charge really well. The only complaint that we&#x27;ve had is the sound. It does sound a lot like the dentist&#x27;s drill. It used to really bother my husband but after a couple of weeks he didn&#x27;t even think about it any more. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought one of these for myself two months ago and was really impressed with how well it cleaned my teeth. So I returned to buy one each for my husband and both sons.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Minus one star because it&#x27;s expensive, replacement brushes, too.  My opinion, only.  My hygienist recommended  Sonicare.  She will be happy.  The recommendation might backfire.  With Sonicare, I might get away with once a year visits instead of every six months. :)</li>
            <li> If you are currently using the Sonicare E series brush, the Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean is definitely worth the upgrade! No more slimy, gunky, germ encrusted, unsanitary crap under the brush head! The handle on the Easy Clean is slim and oval and feels so much nicer in your hand than the E series. The brush head is compact and effective AND less expensive than the E series brush heads. It&#x27;s much easier to switch out the brush heads on this if you&#x27;re sharing the handle, and the charger is smaller than the E series charger also. You might think that 60 bucks is a lot to spend on a toothbrush, but the condition of your teeth can have a major effect on your overall health. Seeing the dentist because you&#x27;ve neglected your teeth has an adverse effect on your wallet too! An ounce of prevention . . .  blah blah yada yada.  :-D</li>
            <li> This thing is incredible! When people say &#x27;it feels like you just left the dentist&#x27; that is no joke. The very nice smooth feeling is replicated with this toothbrush. I was almost shocked at the difference which made me realize how much plaque I was missing with my manual toothbrush. This is my first electric and I do not regret it one bit. It is very simple to use, although if you read the manual (which I highly recommend, it&#x27;s a quick read) it will show you the few things you need to do to keep the brush working well and how the timing mechanism works. Very good product!</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare and will buy more in the future. The batteries don&#x27;t last forever (second one lasted 7 years) but having the dental hygienist hardly touch me is well worth it. The Braun&#x27;s brush head has lots of places for stuff to grow, so keep those heads in some mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I bought a basic Sonicare a few years ago. It did a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth but after a while the area where the brush head attached to the handle became all gunked up and the brush didn&#x27;t work. It wasn&#x27;t easy to take it apart and clean it regularly, so I had to throw out an expensive piece of equipment and I bought a cheaper, easy-to-maintain brush instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, my teeth weren&#x27;t happy, nor was my dentist. But in the real world, people don&#x27;t have time or often, the manual dexterity, to dissassemble a toothbrush and clean it with Q-tips (!) frequently (or ever). Recently, my dentist showed me that Philips had redesigned the brush so that the brushhead fits onto a spike (exactly like the cheaper brush I had been using). So I bought this new model, and the difference is obvious from the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re not going to get a better brush in terms of cleaning. Now you won&#x27;t have to throw out this relatively expensive brush after a few months. \\&quot;Cleaning\\&quot; it now means simply removing the brushhead--just pull it off--and running the place where it attaches to the base under water. If you register your purchase, it&#x27;s warranteed for two years, so it&#x27;s an excellent investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation to Philips is that the handle is still too smooth for a firm grip, especially when you&#x27;re dealing with the icky realities of toothpaste, water and saliva. A more textured surface would be better. But five stars for making an essential improvement--and it was always a great brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush as a replacement to my HX6950 because the metal tip where the brush head connects became loose and fell off after being dropped.  I never used any of the other options that the HX6950 offers such as Gum Care, Refresh, etc., so the one function on the HX6511/50 is good enough for me.  This toothbrush uses the same type of brush heads, ProResults, which is good since I have replacement heads at the ready.  One thing that I was not aware of when I first used this model was that it has an \\&quot;Easy-start\\&quot; feature which increases power over the first 14 uses to ease you into the Sonicare experience.  Having already been used to the full power of the HX6950, I felt like the HX6511/50 was extremely weak at first, but I am noticing that it is increasingly getting stronger, so that is good.  The only complaint I really have about it now is that it doesn&#x27;t display how much charge it has, it only flashes a light when battery is getting low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do recommend is that you remove the brush head and rinse the connecting parts after each use.  If you keep the brush head on, over time old toothpaste begins to build up and I noticed on my old HX6950 that mold had started to grow on the rubber that is attached to the metal tip.  It was easily cleaned off with bleach and did not return as long as I let the area air out after each use.  The Hx6511/50 has a slightly different design in this area which uses less of the rubber protector, so hopefully it won&#x27;t be an issue, but I would still remove the brush head after cleaning anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if  you are just looking for an electric toothbrush without the need for extra features such as Sensitive, Refresh, or Massage, this toothbrush works great.  I have not used any other electric toothbrushes, but I have used a regular toothbrush when I was out of town and forgot my Sonicare, and I did not feel clean at all after brushing.  The Sonicare really delivers a good cleaning and you can tellright away the difference between a standard toothbrush and the Philips Sonicare.  I would continue to purchase the Sonicare products in the future if/when this toothbrush goes out on me.</li>
            <li> Used for two years and would never go back to manual brushing. Really cleans and gets plaque between teeth. Love the super clean feeling the ultrasonic waves give you. If your using grocery store electric toothbrush it&#x27;s not ultrasonic and not cleaning as well as this brush does. Only ultrasonic waves can break up the cell membrane wall of bacteria, melting the bacteria not just brushing them around. Replacement heads are not cheep for soniccare but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I often developed tartar rather quickly on the inside of my lower front teeth despite mouth washes and regular brushing. Decided to take the plunge with the HX6511 after reading numerous good reviews regarding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package contents&lt;br /&gt;Charging stand with worldwide voltage (100-240V)&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;Procare brush head with plastic cap&lt;br /&gt;** There is no traveling case **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Cleans teeth really well - no film is left, resulting in the just back from dentist feeling&lt;br /&gt;Also noted the tartar build up was actually being brushed away - after 3 days there was actually no longer any tartar on my teeth! Didn&#x27;t need to go to a dentist for scaling. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;No traveling case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;This is still THE toothbrush to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Retails at approx $80, it uses the new brush socket unlike the [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare HX5610/30 Essence 5600]] which though cheaper at $50 cannot use the new brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;That means once the included Pro Results brush head is worn, with the HX6511 you can buy the [[ASIN:B0086VIA3O Philips Sonicare HX6063/64 Diamond Clean Replacement Brush Heads]] which comes with the most expensive Sonicare toothbrush, the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean]] instead of [[ASIN:B000WHNI2I Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head]] and have a toothbrush that is just as good as the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean]] which retails at $190!&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush has all the necessary features of the more expensive models&lt;br /&gt;Functions like polishing/whitening generally just increases the duration the toothbrush is kept running by 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Also on a side note, when inserting the brush head, there is meant to be a small gap between the toothbrush handle and the brush head.</li>
            <li> I love this brush better than the other one I have that is same brand different type.&lt;br /&gt;This one really makes your teeth and mouth feel clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since it came out. It makes your teeth feel almost as clean as from dentist!  However, when Philips bought Sonicare, it changed.  They no longer offered the brush head I had (soft &amp; smaller), and it didn&#x27;t make the same sound. It also didn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth as clean.  Since I can&#x27;t find the soft bristle brush anymore, I will have to stop using it.  Dental hygienist advises against using a the hard bristle brush, which is bad for gums. For some models, you may be able to find a softer brush head on line--but not in any stores. Be careful with is brush.</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth really clean. I like that it has a timer to make sure you brush your teeth long enough.</li>
            <li> Ok, but feels like your teeth are gonna vibrate out of your head?,</li>
            <li> Very satisfied my teeth feel very very smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  It works great, and I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet, even though I&#x27;ve used it almost a week now.</li>
            <li> Been using a Braun for several years until my dentist recommended the Sonicare.  This thing is no joke, it blows all the other ones i had hands down.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up!!  By the way, the first charge on this thing lasted about 2 months.</li>
            <li> product as described and shipped quickly.  great price.  will always stay with Sonicare</li>
            <li> This is what I should have bought the last time around.  $70 instead of the $150 or so I spent last time on a toothbrush that had features that only made it more difficult and annoying to use.  I always had to be careful starting that brush up because it would easily slip into some different setting and I would have no idea when to change sectors in my mouth, etc.  This brush,there is one button you hit, gives you the thirty second notifications to change sectors, and then ends after two minutes.  Everything I need, and nothing more.</li>
            <li> Makes a huge difference in my oral health. This brush has made my mouth so much cleaner. I used to not notice the &amp;#34;fuzzy teeth&amp;#34; feeling I would get, but this brush makes my teeth so smooth and clean after every use that I notice when they are not clean! Occasionally I use it more than the two minutes to give myself a deep clean.</li>
            <li> This product might work well at the beginning but the handle unit has a problem that the company will not stand behind nor fix.... I had one unit go out in 13 months, they did replace it but when the replacement unit went out in 18 months then they said it was out of warranty and could not replace it... For the price of these units they should last longer that 18 months...</li>
            <li> I owned the E series for about 8 years and it was a wonderful toothbrush. I decided to upgrade because my boyfriend wanted my old one. I love this toothbrush! It is more compact and the brush heads are much better, there is not as much gunk that builds up around the brush head. I really like the two minute turn off feature and my teeth feel super clean. I didn&#x27;t want all the extra bells and whistles of the more expensive brushes as I just wanted a great cleaning toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I read all these reviews before I choose this brush and I have to say - i made the right choice! Mre expensive models largely just add more time to the cycle to do things like &amp;#34;focus on vanity surfaces&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;focus on gums&amp;#34; which this one can totally do if you simply turn it back on . I have not been able to exhaust the battery (recharged after two weeks of use but it didn&#x27;t need it). Very happy, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gives a whole new meaning to the term, brushing teeth.  Super easy and supper clean!  The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I had the last model of the Sonicare toothbrush.  The one with the greater diameter brush connection.  It always got filthy and goopy with toothpaste on the inside.  This new model has a smaller diameter connection head and stays clean.  Toothbrush works same as older model as far as brushing goes.  Very pleased with my purchase.  BT</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.It is much easier to clean than the older one I had</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to replace the battery operated version (which chewed through batteries at an unbelievable rate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Sonicare tooth brush in 2001, and it’s still going strong, so we had high expectations.  This newer model didn’t disappoint!  It’s smaller and sleeker than my old model; the charging base is compact too.  And, the best part: it works well, holds a charge, and requires little maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s one thing about the design that I don&#x27;t like: there’s a gap (even mentioned in the head installation instructions) between the head and the body.  This gap will fill with “crud”.  I don’t find Sonic seals for this model; it would be nice to have those.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Phillips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean. Over all I like it. However, I personally don’t favor the soft bristle brush. In addition, still trying to get use to the vibration when the vibrating head hits my teeth.  It is light weight and seem to hold a charge very well. Good product.</li>
            <li> Came back to Sonicare.  Best product in the marketplace.  Love the Pro results brush heads as well as the soft feel.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare is smaller and lighter than the previous model we use.  That is an advantage for travel, especially as the charging base is quite small.  But the biggest advantage of all is that it accepts multiple currents, 100-240 volts, so it can be used abroad.  Our previous models were 110 only.  It seems that the size trades off for being slightly less powerful than other models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Sonicares and always valued what they do however the older models have so many places that hold water that mold would build inside the cavity of the device.  This model solves this problem.  There are no places for water to accumulate and thus no mold.  That alone makes me thrilled.  The only thing that I have noticed is that when I have the brush in the &#x27;on&#x27; while cleaning my teeth - during the 30 to 60 second process, the unit will reset itself once or twice.  The resetting process is a short (1 second or so) loss of power, then continues.  It is a little annoying but the upside of a clean brush is worth it.</li>
            <li> I had a different Sonicare Model previously that had options for different types of cleaning (express, regular, deep, etc) but I never used the other functions and didn&#x27;t need them. This simpler version has one less button, which means one less button to hit accidentally while brushing.</li>
            <li> Wow, is all I can say.  I had my original Sonicare (the one with the large head that you had to screw on) for probably 5 or 6 years.  I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing staying with that old version.  First off, I love the Sonicare and even my hygienist agrees that my teeth are cleaner and my cleanings always go without a hitch.  Below is a list of the improvements over the older model and why you should switch.&lt;br /&gt;1)  Lighter and easier to hold with the smaller profile&lt;br /&gt;2)  New head doesn&#x27;t get all gunked up.  I use to unscrew the old head all the time in order to let it dry out a little, but it was always full of dirt.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Lasts longer, but then again I had my original for a long time and it might have gotten shorter and shorter life.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Seems to charge faster also, but see #3.&lt;br /&gt;5)  My raving about this new unit has gotten my kids excited about using one and now I&#x27;m going to order the kids version for them.</li>
            <li> Stays much cleaner than the elite series I had before but has good brushing strength and a very long lasting battery.  I think I have only charged it once in two months of owning it.</li>
            <li> The 4 rating is probably more about my dexterity (or lack thereof) in using the product than any issue with the product itself. It does clean really well. I can definitely tell a difference between it and manual brushing</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.  Much better than older models that were a mess to clean.  Does great job on teeth.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good! Recommended strongly!</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself, and after a couple weeks bought one for my husband. Very effective.</li>
            <li> bought as gift and the sonicare name speaks for the quality, great product</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand to the other brand.</li>
            <li> gift for a friend that she registered for. she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have an E-series brush that still works after several years, but I got sick of cleaning the mold and gunk that would sit in the reservoir of the handle. This model solves the problem with the fairly flat attachment from the handle to the brush head. I highly recommend if you are new to Sonicare and if you are sick of cleaning your E-series then it&#x27;s worth the purchase of a new one.</li>
            <li> I received my order on time and in good condition. I was pleased with the new product with a slimmer handle and less intrusive base. After the initial charge it preformed as described. I also liked the improved design brushes and the attachment that doesn&#x27;t allow water and tooth paste to leak into the case. The quarter timed signals are great for pacing when to move on to the next step of brushing. I would recommend this model to anyone who has used  the E-series model.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Sonicare toothbrush that lasted for about 10 years.  It lasted much longer than expected and it finally bit the dust.  It was time to buy a new one.  I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles that some models offer.  I was just used to a vibrating toothbrush and was especially used to the quad spacer that tells you to move on to the next quadrant of teeth in your mouth.  This model does all that I need and expect from a Sonicare toothbrush and I just love the slim handle and the easy to install and clean attachment that doesn&#x27;t let toothpaste, saliva, water, etc. gunk up where the two parts meet.  Gross!  That was one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the old toothbrush.  I highly recommend the Sonicare EasyClean.</li>
            <li> great product and as advertised.  managed to leave it on a plane, however so for me it didn&#x27;t last too long!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same as the Healthy White model but without the extra functions. I had been using the healthy white toothbrush for years before giving it to my wife and buying this for myself.  I was immediately disappointed - it is noticeably less powerful than the healthy white model.  My wife and I both did blind comparisons with brand new brush heads, and the years old healthy white toothbrush is definitely noticeably more powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay the extra $20 for the more powerful \\&quot;Healthy White\\&quot; sonicare model</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a day but like it so much I felt a review was a good idea. I used to have a Sonicare a few years back but had the problem of gunk getting stuck in the middle chamber (where the brush attaches) and I&#x27;d have to clean my toothbrush with every use. I see from reviews that several other people had the same problem. CLeaning my toothbrush each time does not seem like something I should have to bother with and, after a while, I got rid of it and went back to the simple brush. After a trip to a new dentist, whom I trust, she definitely recommended an electric brush as it cleans so much better. I decided to pick up a battery-powered Oral B from the drugstore so I can check out that brand and have some time to decide on what to buy. At first I liked the circular brush, but the thing felt heavy and clunky and somewhat sloppy compared to the Sonicare (yes, I know there is a difference between the battery powdered models and the more expensive offerings). I am glad to have found this newer model here on Amazon. The new brush design seems to work fine - no icky gunk - and the power of the brush seems more intense than I remember (my hand really felt the vibration), but I get a thorough cleaning. My teeth felt just as good as when I leave the dentist&#x27;s office. Also, the charging base is simple (and it charged quickly) and I personally like that there aren&#x27;t extra decorations and details in different colors attached to this thing. I just want a toothbrush...and I got it. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Like others who posted reviews, this Sonicare is an upgrade from the circular Oral-B, which I had for years. Worked fine--why get another one? Well, I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited this long. I&#x27;ve had it a week and it&#x27;s like a dental revelation.  With the Oral-B, I confess that there was still plaque on my teeth after brushing (take my word for it). I also confess that I am a bad brusher. In fact, I purchased the Oral-B after being berated by my hygienist for not flossing. \\&quot;But I floss every day,\\&quot; I said. \\&quot;Hmph,\\&quot; she said. \\&quot;Then you are an executive brusher,\\&quot; i.e., I sped through my brushings doing only the summary work. The Oral-B and its timer helped, but it was so hard to tell how long you were supposed to spend in each area, that I probably still sped through (though more effectively than the manual brushing).  The Sonicare and its quad-pacing, though, has put an end to my speedy brushing ways. My teeth are also definitely cleaner because the brush seems to do a better job of getting into nooks and crannies. It&#x27;s gentler than my previous brush, too.   The one negative--and this could be a deal-breaker for some--is the buzzines, which may remind some people (like my husband) of being at the dentist&#x27;s office. If you bump your teeth, everything goes \\&quot;BZZZZZ\\&quot; and that may freak some people out. Me, not an issue. I&#x27;m happy and the test will be the next visit to the dentist when I expect to have a less painful time in the chair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as XMAS gift so I&#x27;ve owned this for a short while. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and like a lot of reviews that I read I have to just get used to it. Also, I will update this review if good or bad things occur (hopefully all good). I must say that in the short time I&#x27;ve used it, i really like the timer on this unit but I&#x27;ve come to realize that I used to brush for a lot longer using my regular, manual, non electric oral b toothbrush (two minutes seems to short for me). I like the feature that allows you to ease into using an electric toothbrush according to the instructions, this feature must be disabled after about two weeks of use--it&#x27;s a gentler brushing mode (which is probably why I noticed the very first time that I used it that my teeth didn&#x27;t feel all that clean). One oddity: I&#x27;ve noticed more sensitivity in my teeth after just two brushing (not sure if this has anything to do with holiday eating/drinking or the new toothbrush as that brush moves very fast). I&#x27;ve added sensitive paste to my regimen. What I didn&#x27;t like was that I had a dickens of a time finding the brush replacements (it was confusing as to which model goes with what). Also, without seeing this product, i was unsure about the size head (compact or full) to get. Since my purchase, I found the replacement heads at my grocery store of all places (price is not necessarily better). This toothbrush is quiet, from my POV (a lot of reviews mentioned noise but I found it to be very quiet). It&#x27;s weird when the plastic brush head hits a tooth and my whole head vibrates, again, in my opinion, it&#x27;s a matter of getting used to this method of brushing. Again, I would give this 5 stars but I&#x27;m a very new user. Overall pleased with this purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I fought using an electric toothbrush for a long time but my dentist has been pushing it and my hygienist recommended this one. I love it. My teeth feel clean all the time. The only issue I have is that the replacement brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this.  The vibrating brush took one or two times to get used too, but I feel like this brush does a better job of cleaning my teeth compared to a normal brush.</li>
            <li> My Oral-B Sonic Complete died and I wanted a good quality but relatively low cost replacement.  I found this Sonicare on Amazon for $50 and it is better than the Oral-B.  I won;t go into a long rambling discussion about the qualities of this toothbrush.  Suffice it to say it&#x27;s comfortable to hold, powerful, has a small footprint on the counter, and simply feels like it is doing a great job cleaning my teeth,  If this one disappeared tomorrow, I would but the same exact one to replace it.</li>
            <li> We had the previous generation which we loved, but wore out.  This one works a little differently, and even though it works just as well (if not better), it was a little tough to get used to.  We had to go back and re-read the instructions.  Very happy though.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is quality.  It slender for a smaller hand, which my middle daughter had another one, but this one met her needs BETTER.  Again, quality.</li>
            <li> Great product. It gives you that dentist clean feeling after every brush. Battery charge lasts for a while as well.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended a Sonicare when I asked what I could be doing in addition to flossing. I really enjoy how clean my teeth feel after using my Sonicare.  It is like getting my teeth cleaned everyday.</li>

            <li> About a year ago my parents sent me an electric toothbrush (&lt;$20) because they were impressed with new ones that had recently tried. I was favorably impressed with the cleaning, but found that replacing the batteries always resulted in the waterproof seal being damaged and the batteries would flood. I went through about 4 of them, with at least a couple different types, and the story was always the same. Occasionally the heads would work their way apart too, even though they were within their regular use period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have 2 types to choose from if you step up in quality: Oral-B (with the round spinning heads) and Philips (with the more traditional up and down stroke head). My personal preference is the Philips type of head. After much research, I found that the older Philips models, with the much bigger base to the replaceable brush end, were getting reports of significant material (toothpaste, saliva, etc.) remaining under the bigger base. For this reason I chose the least expensive of the smaller head toothbrushes, the Easy Clean, which had reviews as high as their most expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning under the head is very easy, as I imagine it would be under the larger heads, but there is simply very little there to clean. The brush heads do a great job, and i have no doubt my teeth have never been cleaner. The design allows me to reach anywhere in my mouth, and after a little getting used to it, I am fine with the &#x27;quadrant&#x27; system it uses. This way, you brush upper  or bottom, left or right teeth for 30 seconds, then the toothbrush gives a slight beep, encouraging you to move to the next quadrant. In 2 minutes, you are done and it shuts off. This forces you to focus on exactly where you are brushing, to make sure you don&#x27;t &#x27;run out of time&#x27;. I used to brush longer, but now with the stroke speed and the strict timing, my teeth are much cleaner in a guaranteed 2 minutes. Of course you could turn the brush on again, but if you pay attention, thereis no need to to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since stroke speed is very fast, there apparently is an initial 14 day break in period, whereby the brush moves slower to start, but increases in speed over each of those uses. This can be reset if ever needed. I didn&#x27;t really notice this change over time, but I guess that is part of the intent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is miniscule, with a simple structure, but very effective and requires virtually no effort to insert the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is not cheap, but is well priced through Amazon. The individual heads are quite pricey $8-$10 each, but can be bought in packs of 2-4 to save a little bit. If this cost were to drop somewhat, I&#x27;m sure the number of users would increase dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product that exceeded my expectations! I wish I had bought one years earlier, and probably would have if the cost wasn&#x27;t such an issue.</li>
            <li> My daughters have been using this for quite a while and bugging me to get one. When my dentist suggested it was a good idea, I bought it. I love it. It becomes a good habit fast. My teeth and gums feels not only clean but massaged. Wonderful. Don&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> I have used an old style Sonicare brush for about 10 years with great results.  It worked fine although the battery was starting to fade as it would not hold a charge beyond a week which was a problem on trips.  The real reason I wanted to upgrade was the design of the old brush.  I was becoming concerned about and tired cleaning the gunk that was getting in between the brush head and the handle.  The new brush design clearly fixed this issue. The other Sonicare models had modes and features I did not want or need.  If you want Bright White just brush twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I registered my brush and was given a 25% one time coupon code that could only be used on Sonicare.com.. I bought another brush for my wife as well as a year supply of brushes that was cheaper than buying on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about the price of the brush you will not be sorry.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to a manual brush!</li>
            <li> This my 4th by Phillips. Got one in places all over the continent ( and beyond) where I &#x27;hang my hat&#x27; !</li>
            <li> i love this toothbrush</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is fantastic!  This brush makes my teeth feel like I just left an appointment with my dental hygienist. This bare bones model is all anyone needs to maintain a healthy smile. Happy brushing and don&#x27;t forget to floss...</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
            <li> Light and a nice feel to it. Battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare brushes for several years. I applied for a rebate after I bought this particular product in April. I was told to expect a rebate within 8 to 10 weeks. After 12 weeks I contacted them and was told my application had not been processed yet. Yesterday I got a postcard from Philips saying they could not honor my request since I had not submitted the UPC bar code. I decided it was time to throw my copy of the rebate from in the recycling bin and toss the cardboard box (minus the UPC bar code I had cut out and submitted) into the cardboard recycling box. This is the second and last time they have done this to me. I think Sonicare is a great product. But I will never buy another one. The one star is for their lack of honesty with their consumers.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush takes some getting used to--the action of the sonic bristles tickles the gums but they do a far better job cleaning teeth than other brushes (battery powered or muscle powered) I have used.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I got a Sonicare toothbrush and I am not disappointed! It gives me the best clean feel after I am finished and I absolutely love the timer function so I know I clean each quadrant of my mouth equally and for a full 2 minutes. It feels like you just left the dentist after every brushing and I definitely notice that my teeth are whiter and gums are healthier.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my 2-years old Flexcare with ultrasonic cleaning module.  For the last year,  the flexcare was producing a loud sound, probably due to the interface between the brush and the handle.  When not turned on,  the brush can be moved easily; I believe it is loose or partially broken.  The flexcare has too many useless options (for me, but maybe not for others).  All I needed was a two minute timer with 30 seconds interval indicator.  The HX6511 was half the price and lighter.  It&#x27;s simple.  The gap between the brush and the handle was half of the flexcare; it&#x27;s a much tighter fit and more secured.  It feels solid and no extraneous sound; hopefully this will last a long time.  Overall,  it&#x27;s painless to use and have been using the sonicare toothbrush since the beginning of the product inception.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using a battery-powered Sonicare. My wife wanted one of her own but preferred a rechargeable unit. This one fit the bill. I have owned a Sonicare rechargeable in the past that was much more expensive, and this certainly performs as well at much lower cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December 2013 so have been using it for a little over a year.  This replaced an earlier model which was still working well.  But the old style brush heads got filthy inside even with daily cleaning.  The Easy Clean is a big improvement.  It is reliable and it is easy to take the brush off the unit for cleaning.  (It still needs to be cleaned often as it is not completely sealed.)  I use it twice or three times a day and charge it once  a week, but it could go longer before requiring a charge.  I am totally fine with everything about it.  I recently received an upscale version of the Phillips Sonicare so had an opportunity to compare with the Easy Clean.  The upscale version has several modes and is a bit of a more elegant design, but costs more than twice as much.  I definitely would not purchase anything higher than the Easy Clean, which does just as effective a job.</li>
            <li> Great value. I used to use Sonicare several years ago then went back to using a regular brush. I&#x27;ve just started using it again and notice a big difference. My teeth feel a lot cleaner. I researched many of the available models and the Easy Clean seemed like the best option. I didn&#x27;t need all of the useless bells and whistles. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s dual voltage 110/240 so that I can use it while I travel and that the charging stand is extremely small and portable. I briefly though about getting the Diamond Clean with the USB charger, which would have been nice, but the case is so huge and I like to travel light. The only downside to the charging stand is that it can be wobbly and take a bit of effort to get it in position without making the brush fall over. I just wish they&#x27;d stick a micro USB input in the bottom and call it good, it would probably charge faster too. Battery life is excellent and it&#x27;s easy to clean. By they way it fits the Diamond Clean heads as well so there&#x27;s really no reason to spend more money on a fancier model with all of the different modes that you&#x27;ll never use. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I have had sonicare brushes for the last 6 years. I bought this one to replace the last one because the battery died after several years of use. This one is even better because it doesn&#x27;t let gunk build up at the base of the brush like older models, and the charger is compatible for 110-220 V (unlike the last one). I had to rely on a single charge when I went traveling before, but I don&#x27;t have that issue any more. You can also get the diamond brushes to replace the brushhead.</li>
            <li> Since this unit is spec&#x27;d to 31,000 bruch strokes per minute, same as the other Li-ion powered Sonicare brushes, I assumed it would have the same overall power as the others with just fewer features.  Wrong unfortunately.  After a full charge, in use it is noticably weaker than my wife&#x27;s Healthy White 710 Sonicare (which in turn is somewhat weaker than my old Sonicare Elite).  And without the rubber grip it becomes much less ergonomic.  I&#x27;ll be sending it back and moving up to the Healthy White which is only $10 more.</li>
            <li> Amazing how small these have become. I love my Sonic toothbrushes. This replaced my first one I bought YEARS ago.</li>
            <li> Really cleans your teeth good. My teeth and gums feel cleaner and smoother after using this.  Unlike battery operated toothbrushes that sounds like a mini jet roaring, this brush has a low soft hum like sound. Once fully charged it lasts over 2 weeks before needing another charge.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my elite.  Would make a better childs toothbrush than adult.</li>
            <li> Yep, I will never go back to any other type of toothbrush.  This Sonicare is amazing.  I did not purchase the one with all the bells and whistles and I am happy I didn&#x27;t.  I just wanted to brush my teeth and have the toothbrush do a good job.  This one delivered BIGTIME.  I had an Oral B electric toothbrush for years and then it died.  Read the reviews on-line at Amazon and thought I would take a chance.  Don&#x27;t worry, you will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Great product, clean teeth and great service.  I highly recommend this tooth are product.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Surprisingly long charge.  I do wish the heads were a bit smaller because cleaning the bottom front teeth in back is difficult.  The upper teeth don&#x27;t seem to have that problem.  Will look for a bit smaller head which will fit in all crevices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received this Sonicare toothbrush so I really don&#x27;t have a strong opinion yet.  However, I do have three questions:  A - It comes with two heads and the only description of them appears on the box and are very similar, i.e. gentle, gum lines, etc.  One head has all green bristles, the other head has a mixture of blue and green.  So, has anyone found a significant difference?   B - Admittedly, I&#x27;ve just used it for 2 days but when the bristles come in contact with my gums, lips, etc. the vibration causes a &amp;#34;ticklish&amp;#34; sensation where the bristles touch my skin.  Perhaps that comes with the territory when you are using a brush with 31,000 strokes per minute.  My question is:  does that ticklish feeling decrease or disappear over time as my skin becomes acclimated to the vibration?  C - Regarding the various beeps and timers:  Is there any way to defeat this silly feature?  I don&#x27;t need an annoying noise to tell me to move to another section of my teeth.  So, is there any way to use the on/off switch to, well, just turn it on and off and avoid the distraction of having to listen to beeps and/or having the brush stop altogether?  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist. Got it for my 8 year old who was not doing a good job with brushing. My child loves it. It is the basic model and does a great job. I recommend it, and will probably get one for myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have had one of these as a kid. Every time I go to the dentist now, they remark how clean my teeth are. Once you have one of these you will never go back.</li>
            <li> Feels good and seems to work!</li>
            <li> WOW!  I wish I would have bought this sooner.  I love how clean my teeth look and feel.  Stays charged as advertised.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be better than a regular toothbrush, but I was shocked at how much better it was.  I really love it, and how clean my teeth and mouth feel.  It easily backs up it&#x27;s claim of being twice as clean as regular brushing.  I look forward to using it actually, which is an odd thing to say about a toothbrush, but it&#x27;s that good.  You&#x27;ll be happy you bought it.  Battery life is great as well.  I have been using it twice a day for 2 weeks now and have not had to charge it yet.</li>
            <li> My teeth feels squeaky clean after each brush! Probably best value for money electric toothbrush that comes with the minimal functions that you will need. Once you&#x27;ve tried, you&#x27;ll never look back at manual toothbrush !</li>
            <li> I,ve used Sonicare tooth brushes for the last 10 or more years and I believe they do the best job. This is my wife,s first one and she admits it does a better job than her previous brand.</li>
            <li> Purchased June 2014  no longer charges Feb 2015.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product. It is so much sleeker than the last electric tooothbrush I owned and takes up virtually no space on my sink counter.  I considered giving it 4 stars just to protest the cost of replacement heads, but I guess they are in line with others and it really works well, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush does a good job.  My objection is the cord.  There is not space in the charge unit to store excess cord and cord is long.  What to do with it?  Cord shorteners look untidy and cumbersome.  Not good.  Otherwise an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Far better than the models with a screw-on head.  The snap on heads (like this model) collect much less grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the least expensive model I could find with the better charging and head-type, but without all the extra features (and cost).</li>
            <li> Have owned 2 prior to this one and like the results. (Just wish that they would last longer; maybe someday? )</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;  o  Quadpacer&lt;br /&gt;  o  Does a great job of cleaning IMHO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  o  Replacement brush heads are pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned a Philips Sonicare Advance 4300 for 10 years, and I really became accustomed to having the quadpacer feature.  When it finally got to the point that the battery would no longer hold a charge long enough to get through a brushing, I decided to buy another Sonicare with the quadpacer feature.  I didn&#x27;t want one of the super-high-tech-rocket-scientist models; I just wanted a fairly simple model with the quadpacer feature, and this was exactly what I wanted.  It is smaller in diameter than the old Sonicare 4300, but BOY does it ever do a great job of brushing... even better than the 4300... my teeth feel like I just got out of the oral hygienist&#x27;s chair after a cleaning.  I am VERY pleased with this and I just hope that it lasts 10 years like the previous model.  Oh, and Philips, if you are listening... HOW ABOUT MAKING THESE SO THE BATTERIES CAN BE REPLACED!?!?!</li>
            <li> Had this toothbrush for a year, still happy with it.  Holds a charge for days.  Doesn&#x27;t get gunky between the brush head attachment and the...handle?  Anyways easy to use and replacement brushes are readily available.  Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This does leave your gums feeling more stimulated and teeth with a cleaner sensation than standard toothbrushes.  You will use less toothpaste too!</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were so helpful in choosing the best product for me. I wanted a good, basic toothbrush with no bells and whistles, at a great price. I&#x27;m 100% happy with this one and love the job it does -- no grocery store battery - run brush does even half what this one does.</li>
            <li> I have been a Sonicare user for some time. I love how clean my teeth feel, and since I&#x27;m genetically predisposed to lots of dental problems I like to do everything I can for my teeth. I upgraded from the Sonicare Essence to the Easy Clean model almost a year ago. While I think my teeth are equally clean using either brush, I do prefer the Easy Clean for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It really is far easier to keep clean. There are no impossible to reach nooks and crannies in a cavernous area underneath the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;2. The slender handle is more comfortable for me to hold.&lt;br /&gt;3. Though the handle is more expensive, the Pro Results replacement brush heads for the Easy Clean are cheaper than the e series heads, saving money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;4. The charger is smaller and less obtrusive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bout many of these as i leave them at vacation homes. I prefer the OEM heads after trying to save money with the less pricey copys. I got a cupon for $10 bucks off a water flosser but it did not work with Amazon. It;s a good tool and gets my teeth clean and I&#x27;m so lazy i really appericite saving myself the work and the heads last quite a while. As do the battery. I don&#x27;t charge it all the time. I let it run down at least once after i chage it and occasionally to make sure im not trashing the battery. I think they have imporved the batterys over the past 20 years, how long I&#x27;ve been buying this basic model.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush, I have one already bought this one for my girlfriend. Noticeable difference after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> I had considered the newer, much more expensive, model.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  This one does everything well.  Why do I need a charger that looks like a cup?  Or a digital readout?  This has the same number of pulses per minute.  It uses the same brush head.  I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend an extra $120.  Stick with this model, everything else is useless markup.</li>
            <li> I thought these brushes were a joke at first. I had a bad cleaning and my dentist told me to get one. I balked at the nearly $90 price tag...but decided to get it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I did. This brush gets my teeth way cleaner than my old Oral B manual. My teeth feel clean, almost like having gone to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this product one star, because when I looked online for replacement heads, I couldn&#x27;t find them. Thanks to other customers who replied to my post, I found out the replacemente heads for ProResults also fit the Easy Clean.&lt;br /&gt;I used to always keep my toothbrush on the recharger, but it&#x27;s been a week I took it off and it&#x27;s still going, so battery lasts long (I used it at least twice a day). Very happy now!</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get used to; espically if your a first time electronic toothbrush user.  Overall, it performed very well.</li>
            <li> With all the different models now available, this model seems just fine.  I would have liked to have gotten an extra brush with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient, who has picky tastes, seems to really like it. I bought the 3-pack of sensitive heads at the same time and she&#x27;s used those in place of the normal head. I haven&#x27;t used it myself so I can&#x27;t describe it in detail, but I have noticed it is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit after about a year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recipient&#x27;s favorite gift from that year. She uses it every day and has never considered going back to a regular toothbrush. Even on trips, she packs the Philips brush. I can safely recommend this brush especially to those switching from a manual brush.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and this is the one I went for after a bit of research.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 months.  Works well so far, but haven&#x27;t been back to dentist yet to see just how well it does (the ultimate test!).  Battery has a pretty good life on it, as I&#x27;ve only charged it 3 or 4 times - maybe once a month it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> Love this electric brush. had built in timer so you know your getting every quadrant clean. Only down side is the OEM replacement brushes are expensive.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare, works so much better than regular toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always heard how Sonicare made great toothbrushes with a loyal customer following but never wanted to spend &amp;#34;a lot&amp;#34; of money on a toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t know why looking back, as I use it twice a day but I digress...After combing through the reviews of Sonicare brushes, I decided that the Easy Clean was the best option for my husband and I because it had the following features:&lt;br /&gt;1) Slim handle&lt;br /&gt;2) Rechargable base&lt;br /&gt;3) Same &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; brush head as the other brushes&lt;br /&gt;4) 2 minute timer to allow for 30 seconds of brushing per quadrant in your mouth&lt;br /&gt;5) No added &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; like other Sonicare brushes but rather, a huge step up from our Oral-B battery operated electric toothbrushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all 5 features that I list above are what you&#x27;re looking for in a Sonicare with no additional options wanted/necessary, than this is the brush for you.  It does take a bit to get used to after using an Oral-B brush as the pulsating brush is much faster and smaller than what we were used to.  After brushing one time, my teeth felt like I had just been to a cleaning at my dentist.  I can see why Sonicare has such a loyal customer base.</li>
            <li> My ten year old Sonicare just stopped working one day but my dentist still insists on this brand of electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;So far it is favorable because: It is slimmer and lighter than my old unit. It takes less counter space. It is quieter.&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge long enough for a road trip so I do not need to bring the charger along.</li>
            <li> I never thought i would get excited about a toothbrush but these sonic toothbrushes are something else. they vibrate so fast and so little that at first you dont think they will even work. i was looking at it saying, \\&quot; it is hardly moving...\\&quot; but thats all it takes. i am sure there is som science to it but all i know is that it works and it can remove stains and plaque with ease. the stages timer to promote good brushing is helpful too. i would recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price , I had the more expensive brush before . This is just fine without all the other stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am using the brush correctly, but I still feel &amp;#34;yucky&amp;#34; places on my teeth after brushing. I am still using this toothbrush because I think I am doing better for my teeth than the traditional brush.</li>
            <li> DID A LOT OF RESEARCH TO FIND A NEW MODEL THAT COULD USE THE STOCKPILE OF BRUSH HEADS I HAD FOR A PREVIOUS MODEL AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD FIT --- BUT THEY DON&#x27;T.  THEY HAVE TOO MANY MODELS THAT REQUIRE DIFFERENT HEADS FOR EACH SERIES</li>
            <li> Ive only been using this for about 2 weeks and what a differrence.. I was using the  Braun elect...a verry good product in itsself but Not the total job a sonic can do.</li>
            <li> They were a gift to my husband and son. So far they are impressed with the toothbrush. They say their teeth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Reasonable price.  I have extremely sensitive teeth and this particular model aggravates the condition.  Would recommend for others</li>
            <li> Has a good feel to it and cleans very well. The handle fits perfectly in my hand. Recharge nice and this unit has served me well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush handle fits all other Philips heads, so I can use the primo diamond tip! This will improve dental health rapidly!</li>
            <li> I had a more expensive Oral B cleaner that I tossed because of this guy here. The Oral B was much louder and even the soft bristles were rigid and rough on the gums. The medium bristle that I got with this is an order of magnitude softer than the sensitive Oral B that I have and I&#x27;ve yet to open the package of soft bristles for the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this toothbrush aside from it not being as rough on the gums is that it is clean! No matter how hard I rinsed out the Oral B one, I would end up with a bunch of disgusting gunk on the charging base. It looked really nasty. This happened even after I removed the head after every brush and got water in all the hollow places where the nasty saliva toothpaste mixture could hide. Not to mention if you didn&#x27;t do a good job rinsing it out, you could sometimes taste the old nasty toothpaste gunk that hid out in the hollow portion of the toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this brush for over a month now and I&#x27;ve yet to clean the base. No crud, awesome! That stuff annoyed me to no end. That alone is worth the price of entry, no joke. It does a good job cleaning the grill too and it ramps up gradually so you don&#x27;t get freaked out by the way it feels because it is a strange feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that due to the (wild guess here) way sonic vibrations work, it seems to collapse all the bubbles and foam that you normally get with brushing. I personally think the timer is set a little too short for my liking, as I go two full cycles but I end up with a mouth full of liquid toothpaste, water, saliva mixture with zero bubbles. You basically spit it out of your mouth like a stream of water. This is a little strange if you&#x27;re used to a bunch of foam from the tooth paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and good heavens, tooth brush heads are expensive as hell. I imagine the markup on the heads is a couple thousand percent as all the tech is in the body and Sonicare tech isn&#x27;t exactly new so R&amp;D costshave been recouped a long time ago. You can&#x27;t exactly come up with new, &amp;#34;innovative&amp;#34; ways to come up with vibrations.</li>
            <li> Seems weaker than the older versions Essence 5600.. maybe should bought one of the ones a tier or two higher. Although it likely cleans just as well... it feels a little weaker when brushing. Possible a plus for those who dont like the sensation. Like a more docile version the Essence 5600</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and clean.  Does an excellent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over the original sonicare -- no more (or very little) gunk accumulation below the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used oral B&#x27;s sonic toothbrush in between my original sonciare and this, I prefer this to the oral B</li>
            <li> wish it had more speeds</li>
            <li> Could not be without a Sonicare Toothbrush.  This was a replacement one, we&#x27;ve used them for years and would not consider anything else.  They tend to last about three years.</li>
            <li> This is great tooth brush, very easy to use, an internal timer lets you know when to change quadrant.  I will let you know if my next check up will reflects what I think this brush is doing!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Love the hesitation/pause at every 30 seconds so I can gauge how much longer I have to reach that 2 minute mark! Teeth are always left feeling clean and my gums are noticeably more healthier.</li>
            <li> Item came well packaged and on time.  It was what I wanted and appears to be working well.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money.  Unlike the older models, the new models are much easier to clean.  Once you start using this you won&#x27;t dislike going to the dentist quite as much and your trip may just be shorter too.  This is my second one, the first one lasted over 7 years.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest. You can feel the difference in the cleanliness of you teeth vs a regular brush, especially if you follow the instructions on how to use it vs using a manual brush. I can tell when I have my teeth cleaned how much less work the hygienist has to do since I started using a Sonicare years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I owned (the Elite version, I believe) lasted about 4 or 5 years until it would not take a charge anymore. I got a new version, and that was great, but it developed a problem with the motor or something. Philips replaced it, no questions asked, and the replacement unit has been great.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had. The last time I went to the dentist he complimented me on how clean my teeth were. The replacement toothbrush heads aren&#x27;t expensive either. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product and when my daughter told me she was in the market for an electric toothbrush I purchased this for her knowing how well it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Only last me about 12 to 18 months on average. I must be rough on these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush!!!!! i feel like i just left the dentist office every time i use it!</li>
            <li> I had the original Philips Sonicare toothbrush for over 20 years. When it finally died recently, I reluctantly ordered another Sonicare (the Easy Clean model), since many reviews of the newer Sonicare toothbrushes indicate that they are not very long-lasting. While I can&#x27;t speak yet to the longevity of this model, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at how much better it cleans my teeth than the old toothbrush, how much quieter it is, how much more comfortably it fits in the hand, and that the design keeps it free of gunk collecting between the head and the rest of the brush. The one frustration is that both the brush and the charging base are so lightweight, that the slightest jostling of the cord knocks the whole unit over. But overall, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Plain jane sonicare but works like a champion. I was recommended by my hygienist to get one of these because I was starting to experience some gum loss/disease.  Though I have not yet been back to have my results checked yet, my teeth and gums feel cleaner and stronger after just a few weeks use. It has even removed some buildup that I could feel the dental hygienist missed. The timer is a great way to insure you are getting and adequate cleaning.</li>
            <li> Really like and the price is right.  Like small size and closed brush to base design because easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> My wife talked me into trying this and I&#x27;m glad she did. It took me a little while to get used to but now that I have, I really like it. My teeth feel cleaner and I haven&#x27;t had any issues at the dentist. I&#x27;ve been surprised how long the battery charge lasts which is nice.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush on the market. I had one of these for several years and it broke. I am a vine member and got a different kind of Phillips as part of the program (something with ultrasonic cleaning capability) and I hated it. Used it for about 2 months and then I finally broke down and bought this. I have used it now for a week and my teeth and gums are sparkling clean. I love the Sonicare Elite models. You need to get one of these toothbrushes if you love your teeth! Don&#x27;t settle for less.</li>
            <li> Our family is a long-time user of Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  This was a replacement for one of our Healthy White 710&#x27;s that finally gave out.  I am happy with it.  Seems to clean as well as the Healthy White.  My teeth always feel so much cleaner after using an electric toothbrush.  Recommend!</li>
            <li> I resisted buying one all these years because for various reasons I didn&#x27;t think I would like it at all. And I have to say that it took a week or two to get used to it, but now I LOVE  it and am getting my husband one for Christmas. Honestly, it makes the entire experience of brushing my teeth enjoyable. And the difference in cleanliness, tartar build-up (I have ZERO now!), and gum health is amazing. My new dentist encouraged me to get one, and I&#x27;m so happy I did! Great product!</li>
            <li> This model is junk. don&#x27;t waste your money. I cant get refund even to upgrade. Sonicare used to have built in quality, but they are marketing  junk now. I am out 70.00</li>
            <li> Being sonic, the toothbrush does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than regular electric brushes with rotating heads ever did. The toothbrush and charger are light and compact. One time I left the charger unplugged for well over a week and the toothbrush kept doing its job, so the internal battery must be very strong.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare toothbrush is cost effective and works very well.  I had a another Sonicare model with multiple  operating modes and ended up never using them.  This tooth brush is simple and effective, just right.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t get much gunk like the earlier generation sonicare units with the bigger replacement heads. Also very long battery cycle between charges.</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;November 28, 2013&lt;br /&gt;After 1 year and 7 months, the toothbrush started to act strangely.  It would spontaneously turn on and not brush for the full two minutes.  I was often woken up at night because it would turn on and vibrate its way into the sink and just make a racket.  I called up Philips and they replaced the unit.  Philips also covered the shipping.  I was fortunate because the unit has a 2 year warranty but when I registered, they gave me an extra 6 months.  I was still well within my warranty period.  I am very impressed with Philips and their customer service.  Also, my dentist says my teeth are spectacular and visits are now nearly pain free.  I highly recommend this product because, if it fails, Philips will replace it and it produces good teeth cleaning results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 19, 2012&lt;br /&gt;After a lot of research and speaking to my dentist (who recommended either this brush or an Oral-B circular rotating brush, the latter of which she favoured), I chose the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;I chose it because, for me, the sonicating action is better at removing plaque and food debris from my teeth.  It is also very gentle on my gums (I have previously had a problem of receding gums that has since halted now that I&#x27;ve switched from a manual brush).&lt;br /&gt;I fully charge this brush and take it travelling.  So far I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days without charging, brushing three times/day (9 sessions in total) and the battery lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this because of the excellent cleaning power, gentleness on my gums and the long battery life.</li>
            <li> For several years i used the sonic care toothbrush with the large screw on top. i think it was one of the E series.  it was great at cleaning my teeth but there was a gap that led the base to fill with slimy toothpaste sludge. it&#x27;s hard to feel good about your toothbrush when it&#x27;s smelly and full of creepy mold. and i just don&#x27;t have time to dis-assemble my toothbrush and rinse it out every time i brush as some reviews have suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i swapped it out for this model. i think the design is sleeker and better looking with a smaller stand. it seems to work just as well and there is no leakage into the base so it feels so much cleaner.  plus it costs less!</li>
            <li> Being a devoted Sonicare user for about 20 years, I had been living with major disappointment in my last model where the nasty, disgusting, pink &amp; gray slime would build up inside. Mentally I just could not get past it no matter how often I cleaned it. This last time was enough, I threw it away &amp; purchased this one. I love it! It is much lighter than my last few Sonicare models &amp; it still has the quadpacer, I still feel it keeps my teeth in top condition &amp; white. BEST BEST of all, no gunk! Yay!!</li>
            <li> Once you have this toothbrush, you will never go back! My teeth feel so so much cleaner and even my dentist has mentioned how much healthier my teeth and gums are. I used to have braces and I have that retainer glued on the back of my bottom teeth and it is really hard to floss, but when I just use this toothbrush, I dont have to floss as much. It is worth the money</li>
            <li> Time will tell how this thing lasts but after 2 months it seems to be worth the money. Teeth feel clean like just came from dentist all the time. Took about a day to get used to.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to have timed the delivery of this new toothbrush perfect, because i got it the same day I got my braces on. At almost 30 years old and now having braces, I knew i needed a good toothbrush to help keep EVERYTHING clean in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 2 minute timer. Every 30 seconds a slight pause in the vibration lets you know you should move to a new quadrant of your mouth. I have noticed after just a week of use that my teeth are whiter and I haven&#x27;t changed anything but the toothbrush. Nothing gets caught between the brush head and the body of the toothbrush like the lesser model and it holds a charge for what seems like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this toothbrush for anyone with braces especially because of how much it&#x27;s helped me. I&#x27;ll never use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush again. Ü</li>
            <li> I bought two...one for wife. Great bargain...works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush.  Feels funny when you first use it, but you quickly get used to it and there is no going back to a regular electric toothbrush or G-d forbid, a manual one.</li>
            <li> Had an old electronic toothbrush that stopped working on me after 4+ years of use.  Thought it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this toothbrush!  It really gets in the nooks and crannies in your mouth and takes out the plaque build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty weak teeth so thorough cleaning is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush plus flossing and mouthwash (plus the semi yearly scaling at the dentist) ensures my mouth stays cavity free!</li>
            <li> I have used electric tooth brushes for several years. This is the best electric toothbrush i have used. Reliable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good medium range brush, nothing too fancy, but it does the job well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works great.I have had it a few months now, and it gets my teeth really clean. I like the slim design and the way the saliva/paste mixture doesn&#x27;t get into the handle and making a gross paste. Easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> this was a great buy, works great.nice item for the price . i was very satisfied and will recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Great job cleaning teeth, has lasted 3 years and counting.</li>
            <li> My last Sonicare lasted for over 7 years. It cleaned my teeth fantastically twice a day that whole time. When the battery finally stopped holding a charge, I did not even consider another brand. This new one has an even better design, in that the top just snaps on, so it is easier to keep clean. There are models with more features, but when you read through the marketing hype, it&#x27;s just longer brushing time, or variable power levels. This one cleans perfectly with its single power level, and I can just use it twice if I want extra brushing time. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Upgraded for my expired Essence. Very light, easy to maneuver, much improved brushes. Really works well near the gums to remove plaque.Charge seems to go on forever. Price was a factor and for the quality, this brush is a deal.&lt;br /&gt;My third Sonicare over the years; keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> my mouth is too sensetive. electric shocks in my gums  cannot use it</li>
            <li> I love this product. It signals  every 30 seconds so you can change position in your mouth. I have had it quite awhile and have only had to recharge it once. My dentist comments on how little plaque I have on my teeth now.</li>
            <li> I have receding gums and my dentist wanted me to consider gum grafting.  Look it up, it&#x27;s an awful procedure that I didn&#x27;t want.  So, at my dentists recommendation I tried the Sonicare system.  WOW, not only do my teeth feel cleaner, I never have any gum sensitivity anymore, AND my receding gum have improved greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product and it perhaps is the best money I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my husband. He is very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> The top brush does not stay secured to the lower handle. I would not recommend this tooth brush. I did order a replacement, which was a bit more expensive, but works much better</li>
            <li> Basic model.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush because it fits my hand perfectly. It&#x27;s much better than the wider ones.</li>
            <li> Very nice prive and eady to use</li>
            <li> Having read almost all of the reviews from other users,I concur that this model,the easy clean is the best choice for those that want the most updated version with the new design brush,without spending the extra money for stuff most people would not use. The secret here is that the newer design brush attachments allow for ease of replacement brush&#x27;s suited for your individual concerns as there are many styles to choose from. The basic brush handle is slim and has a very small footprint. It does it&#x27;s job very well! Easy to understand instructions. You will notice the difference in how your gums are massaged and your teeth actually feel like you just left the dental hygienist! If you are still a little skeptical,which I was at first,think of it this way. If you follow the directions and use this daily,think of the money you will save in dental maintenance over the next years. It should more than pay for itself!</li>
            <li> I previously had just a cheap oral B electric toothbrush I picked up in a supermarket. I was pretty happy with that. The Phillps however is so much better. Combined with a Waterpick water flosser, I feel like I have stepped out of the dentist everyday.</li>
            <li> It is just what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I replaced an Oral-B Sonic with this unit due to a dead battery. The materials of this toothbrush are superior to the Oral-B and the heads fit much better. Replacement heads on the Oral-B were always too loose and I felt like I lost some brushing effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model rather than replacing my old e-series toothbrush when it finally died. Although the e-series is quite a bit less expensive than the newer models, I was concerned that Phillips would quit manufacturing the heads and, indeed, it appears that they no longer make the e-series handles. Further, these toothbrush heads are considerably cheaper. I like the lighter weight handle and, by buying the generic heads, I will make up the price difference after 3 or 4 heads ($12/head vs $1/head).</li>
            <li> I really like this product. This sonicare tooth brush is the best option that you can choose in the market! Just buy it!</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare toothbrush gave up the ghost after 12 years of steady use without any problems. I tried to go back to  a manual toothbrush but my teeth just didn&#x27;t feel clean. I bought this one because I didn&#x27;t feel the extra bells and whistles were necessary for me, although I did want a brush with the quad feature like my old one, which this one has. My new Sonicare works beautifully, and I love the newer style. Unfortunately, I doubt it will last as long as my earlier model because it seems products just aren&#x27;t built to last. The stand seems to be unsteady, but I haven&#x27;t tipped it over yet.  And my teeth feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I am not knew to sonicaire toothbrushes.  They are great electric toothbrushes and this one is very good.  It holds a charge for a very long time and does a good job of cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> Had sonicares for years and love them. Unfortunatly dropped the last one so it broke. Well worth the money to buy again.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It charges easily and cleans my teeth really well. Recommended by my dentist after a visit. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have both been happy Sonicare users for many years.  When she found these locally on sale and with a rebate, we could not say \\&quot;no\\&quot;.  Each of us has an older model with a big screw-on brush head assembly.  Not only are replacement heads more expensive for that type but they also provide lots of space for crud to build up that requires regular cleaning or it gets really nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Easy Clean looks like it should be much simpler to keep in a hygienic condition.  My wife is happy with the reduced size and weight compared to our older brushes.  For the price, you really can not do better although the more expensive Sonicare&#x27;s do come with additional features (that may not matter to you) and sometimes accessories.  The one thing missing with this brush is a travel case.  Luckily, a quick search on Amazon found one with high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the most important part of a toothbrush is how well it cleans teeth.  My experience is with regular brushes and with 3 different Sonicare models.  With a regular brush, my teeth do not feel nearly as clean no matter how long I brush.  With the Sonicare, 2 minutes (via the built-in timer) gives really clean feeling teeth in a way that I can not at this time imagine purchasing any other brand of toothbrush.  Both my wife and I are extremely happy with our new brushes!</li>
            <li> Replaced the one I had for years. Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Love the design, love how it performs, and the technical savvy internals. It comes with several pre-programmed settings right out of the box. I like how one of them, it gradually increases the power of the toothbrush over x amount of days. My particular favorite, and the one that I continue to use, is the timer feature. Every 30 seconds, you brush a region of your mouth. It&#x27;ll send a pulse to let you know when that time is up. What&#x27;s neat, least I think it&#x27;s neat -- is that if you push the power button once, and then again in less than I believe 30 seconds, you can continue to go back to that timer feature.&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great brush that is affordable, as well as super easy to clean. Also, the battery seems to never die. Honestly I&#x27;ve been 3 weeks in between charges and that&#x27;s only because I wanted to charge it.</li>
            <li> Did everything it was supposed to do for less money than the more expensive models. Good buy for less money.</li>
            <li> Once you use a Sonicare there is no going back.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been pestering me for several years to get one of these.  I finally broke down and bought a cheaper (non-Sonicare) model and while that brush did seem to reduce the amount of tartar/plaque that built up between cleanings, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as effective as this one.  Guess you really do get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Much better than the oral b I replaced it with. It just leaves my mouth feeling so much cleaner. I paid less for this one too. Great value. Replacement heads can be expensive but I&#x27;ve been using the same one for over a month and it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 , one for myself and one for my husband.  Would be kinda hard to go back to a basic toothbrush now.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Have been using original Model FC but replacement heads are hard to find.  This is nice and teeth feel great afterwards. Its not as heavy as the FC making it feel a bit &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;, but I gather that&#x27;s because the battery is smaller.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome! My dental hygenist recommended it - and I cannot believe the difference in how clean my teeth feel in comparison to a regular toothbrush - also recommended for my gums as well as my teeth.</li>
            <li> I take this with me everywhere I go.  I stayed in a hotel and I left the charger behind.  The thought of using a hand held toothbrush again was so foreign to me that I promptly ordered a new charger and it arrived before my toothbrush needed to be charged.  It&#x27;s a great buy.  You will get used to using it and you won&#x27;t be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> This product gives an excellent clean and yet is not too harsh on the gums. I love the ease of operation and the simple design to the brush which lets you know when to switch quadrants.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Philips Sonicare Easy Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrushes, one for myself and one for my adult son as a gift. This toothbrush is much better than an old one I was using.  I like the fact that it runs for 2 minutes, stopping very briefly after each 30 seconds to change quadrants of the mouth. After brushing, my teeth feel as clean as my semi-annual cleaning by the dentist. My son, once remiss, now prioritizes brushing his teeth because of the technology and clean feeling afterwards.  The battery life is excellent, allowing me to travel weekends without the charger.  I am perhaps too happy to be the owner of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare rechargeable tooth brushes for over 20 years and our dentist always says the condition of my teeth and gums is great. So I bought this one for my adult son who just finished extensive dental work. Mom strikes again with the practical Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I started using the Sonicare at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion. I even threw away my regular brush so i wouldn&#x27;t be tempted to cheat. I love the clean feeling this brush gives me. The 2 minute timer makes brushing for the right amount of time a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I have owned three Phillips Sonicare brushes and this one is my favorite. Easy to keep clean, easy to get replacement brushes, and it holds the charge for days. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth really clean. Easy clean is the perfect model, top performance without paying for stupid bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> My other sonicare was hard to clean and there was always build up on it.  This one is much easier to clean and it does a great job!  They price was better than in any store, but the shipping took a while.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband as a gift. He loves it. The price was right; even Costco couldn&#x27;t beat it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now owned this brush for several months, and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.  It has held up to heavy use, and only needs recharging every few weeks.  It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Traveling abroad I&#x27;ve ruined electric applianes, including toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a better all around choice!  Slimmer but powerful like the&lt;br /&gt;larger models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had for a couple months now and love it!  Ended up buying this after my 10+ year old original Sonicare stopped charging.  I was surprised to see my teeth got whiter after a month without changing anything besides the toothbrush.  I like the new brush heads.  The old ones were pain because you had to screw them off and if you left them on mildew would build up on the inside.  The new heads just pop off, but also don&#x27;t seem to get mildewy if left on.</li>
            <li> Like it over my oral B. More quiet easy to hold better on gums.</li>
            <li> Great product as always.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great improvement over the Braun I recently had which failed and not able to get parts.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It replaced one I had used for years.  I&#x27;m sure this one will last for a long time.  I can purchase replacement brushes from my dentist which is a great convenience.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush but....it tip over on its side too easily. If i had to do it again I would buy the thicker Phillips tooth brush with the flat bottom.</li>
            <li> No need to continue shopping. This is ideal.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and after so many years of manually brushing it takes a little getting used to. The actual brush is fine&lt;br /&gt;and I do notice some whitening of my teeth and a generally &amp;#34;feels cleaner&amp;#34; after using the device. If I were to write the review in 6&lt;br /&gt;months I would likely give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this toothbrush in May.  It&#x27;s December and the toothbrush stopped working properly.  Lame!  To the trash it goes...</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush feels like you went to the dentist for a cleaning</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a unit that failed - battery bad, low power, wouldn&#x27;t move brush when against teeth.  Phillips offered to replace it for free but that took a month so I also bought another one to use during the replacement process.  Phillips required a proof of purchase, luckily I had bought it from Amazon so no problem printing a receipt for them.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice electric toothbrush.  It works well and I really like the timer feature so I know I am brushing enough.</li>
            <li> I like that this model is compact, lighter and easier to handle than our original Sonicare that I still love and use. I bought this for travel The charger is tiny and is also great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just REALLY wish the brush wasn&#x27;t so hard, that&#x27;s a really bad thing.</li>
            <li> I like using this toothbrush, especially like the slim handle. It is great for me, as I have small hands. My teeth get so clean, and I feel look whiter as well. I do drink coffee and tea and I think this toothbrush gets them so much cleaner than a manual brush did.  Also, my hygienist remarked how healthy and pink my gums were at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li> First off, I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years and am very happy (as is my dental hygienist)  with the cleaning results. This toothbrush replaced an older Sonicare that finally died after years of use. I chose this unit because it was the least cost that still included the 30 second interval timer (beep tone), a feature that I liked with the old brush. The new unit is much smaller and lighter overall than the old unit making it more convenient to maneuver around your teeth. The charging stand is smaller too, taking up less space. The really nice design feature is the easy push-on / pull-off brush head as opposed to the threaded collar connector on the old style. Not all Sonicare models have the push-on connection feature, so if you want this you should buy the EasyClean, FlexCare, or Diamond models. I don&#x27;t know how it could be better except if the replacement brushes were less costly. You do well to get them for $9-10 each.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd sonicare in the last 20 years. Saw my dentist this week and the &amp;#34;tooth cleaning lady&amp;#34; asked if I used an electric toothbrush, I asked &amp;#34;why&amp;#34;? The answer was that my teeth and gums were in excellent condition (no I don&#x27;t floss) So much for my sonicare fixation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Bought this to replace a Sonicare toothbrush I have been using for YEARS!!!  I love the clean I get with this toothbrush vs any other.  This product improved my checkups with my dentists. I was skeptical at first, but it did!!!  I was beginning to have issues with gingivitis in places several years ago and bought this toothbrush. My problems went away and my checkups were almost plaque free, which was amazing!!!  I have had great check ups since.  I highly recommend this toothbrush.  I am glad I switched to this toothbrush years ago.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten one of these years ago.  I&#x27;m now getting my best check-ups ever.</li>
            <li> As others have helpfully pointed out, this is the lowest price point into the most advanced brush heads. After my Flexcare died, I bought this and am even happier -- 1) because I didn&#x27;t pay as much, 2) because the biggest annoyance I had with the Flexcare, hitting one of the mode buttons unintentionally, doesn&#x27;t exist with this one, 3) This one has a more grippy on/off button that I can brace against while not affecting, while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was waiting for this one to arrive, I reverted to my husband&#x27;s old E-series Sonicare and my teeth immediately went more yellow. I could feel the plaque even after brushing. So there is a clear difference, for me, between the brushheads this one uses and one step down.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 second interval buzz it provides so you know it is time to switch to another part of your mouth,</li>
            <li> Love my SonicCare. Lost my first one and immediately got another. It can take some getting used to, but to get your teeth as clean as possible, gotta get one. After using mine for a year and going to a new dentist, they could tell I use an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I&#x27;ve used my GF&#x27;s from another leading brand and SonicCare trumps. More powerful and thorough brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush did a great job of keeping my teeth clean but died after 2.5 years. I didn&#x27;t expect it to last forever but thought it would last longer than this given the price. And now I just have to throw it away as it can&#x27;t be repaired, which I hate to do.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Sonicare user for a long time. However, I had some staining on my teeth recently and never connected to my old Sonicare toothbrush until it went dead. After getting this replacement, I realize that the old one had lost its punch way before it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is very sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter. The only negative is I have arthritic hands and often unintentionally turn it off while I am holding it. On the plus side it is easy to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are very expensive and wear out too quickly.  The older one I had before this was better.</li>
            <li> I Love this toothbrush. my teeth feel polished everyday! I bought it for me and my husband. Wish I bought it sooner</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush. The unit is slimmer than previous versions, which makes it easier to grip; the price was reasonable, and it has the most important feature to me---quadrapacer.</li>
            <li> I use this product four times a day and love the timed cycle.  It makes sure I spent the rightg time on each section of my mouth.  I would recommend it to anyone and plan to order some for my daughters and their families for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Makes my gummys feel good!  I like this toothbrush.  The only thing I dislike is that it shuts off after two minutes.  No big deal.  Get this thing!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He says it feels like he&#x27;s been to the dentist and had his teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothbrush, it beeps every time to move on to a different spot in the mouth and turns off automatically after a certain amount of time (2 min?). Makes me brush my teeth longer, and my mouth feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that the detachable brush and the bottom of the toothbrush gets dirty and you have to clean it once in awhile. More maintenance than a regular toothbrush- but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great and feels great. Teeth feel very clean after a brushing and the unit itself stays clean too. Bought one for my daughter as well and she loves it too.  Very satisfied with this product. Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll explain: I have a son who is a doctor and is very picky about everything. He definitely researches everything before he makes a decision. So he had this one and uses it many times a day (did I mention he is a compulsive body cleaner?) and it finally went to the toothbrush heaven in the sky. So he asked for the exact same one for Christmas. He loves it. If it works for him it should work for anyone!</li>
            <li> Simple and effective. I went with this model over the lower end one mainly because of the timer feature, which helps my brushing habits.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for years, and when my last one died, I looked for an easier to clean model.  I had the one with the screw on collar to hold the brush.  It was yucky to clean.  Thia one is MUCH easier.  I like that it is thinner.  It is a winner.</li>
            <li> I have replaced my clunky old Sonicare with this new Slim, light and handy model. The charge lasts well and it is easy to transport.</li>
            <li> Solid product, though it tickles in some areas of my gums like no other! Solid construction and a good buy! Hope it lasts quite a while!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of the older e Series and was very happy with them. This has a similar action and is easier to keep clean . The results have been better check up&#x27;s for all.</li>
            <li> Great, would highly recommend :) One of the best toothbrush I ever had so far. Battery last for so long, sometimes I don&#x27;t even remember when is the last time I charge it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite model of my favorite electric toothbrush company. The small size makes it easy to hold and maneuver (as compared to the older models). The battery lasts for at least a couple of weeks, but I charge it once a week. The charging time is much faster than the older models. This model is also much easier to keep clean than older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the charging base had some way to fold the cord up. I don&#x27;t need 2 feet of electric cord lying around on my sink while charging. But other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> What they say is true: Since I&#x27;ve used Sonicare, I&#x27;ve had A+ checkups from my dentist every time.  My Sonicare was still working (after more than ten years!), but it was an older model that collected water (and thus mildew), even though I was careful to dry it off after each use.  So I replaced it with this one.  It&#x27;s very much an improvement--smaller and lighter, with a streamlined design that sheds water.  I hope to get ten years of use from this one, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this Sonicare to replace a more expensive model I had that broke. The more expensive model used a rubber sleeve at the base of the metal post that holds the brush. The sleeve is designed to keep water out of the insides of the unit. This model (which is like $40 cheaper - I don&#x27;t remember exactly) uses a hard plastic sleeve instead of rubber and I&#x27;ve found it to be a much better design. I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brushes since Phillips started making them and have had several different models. I think this one is the best yet. It has the quadrabeep feature to tell you how long to brush each quadrant of your teeth but lacks some of the more advanced settings found on the more expensive models. I don&#x27;t miss those extra features at all and will likely go with this model (or similar) when I eventually need to replace this one - I don&#x27;t think that will be any time soon unless I break it myself though. The design improvement I mentioned above is part of an overall improvement in quality over older models. This brush is well-built and in my opinion the best Sonicare I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome. My dentist recommended it. Like it. Good quality. I always thought the vibration would be bothersome but exactly the opposite - I like the back and forth. Hygienist said to hold it in place against each tooth then move to the next section.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Sonicare at advice of dentist to strengthen gum line; was definitely worth the purchase as my dentist now says gums are in great shape!</li>
            <li> this brush came out when I graduated in 1994 recommended it from the beginning and do still to this day. is no better electric tooth brush on the market and this one is a great price. make you feel like you have had your teeth polished each time you use. vibration takes getting use to but increases strength over time. won&#x27;t regret this purchase and sonicare has a money back guarantee ...you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Awesome, wished I would have bought it a long time ago</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months now and it never fails to give me the feeling of nice clean teeth. Hard to go back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> i have been using for nearly a year and it really helps on the cleanliness of my mouth for sure!</li>
            <li> I use to have the big bulky lowest end model, which I hated and resented. I barely used it.  It was hard to clean and got gross very quickly. I was hesitant to get another one. However, my dentist recently recommended that I go back to an electric toothbrush.  I ended up getting this one.  I am very glad I did. It charges easily.  It cleans easily.  The design is perfect for me to hold.  I have small hands and am weak in the arms. It is not too heavy for me to brush!  I love how you can purchase extra soft bristles.  These pop right into the toothbrush.  It even beeps when I need to switch sides.  It&#x27;s my favorite toothbrush!  The price is also reasonable compared to the other models.  Who needs advanced timer functions or multiple modes?  This is a toothbrush that does what you need and stays clean. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I wore out the last Philips Sonicare I had, so that&#x27;s why I got this new one. Love the slim handle and more compact recharger.</li>
            <li> For dental quality in a handheld, we are sold with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I got my wife the diamondcare but this one is for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just day and night difference from a manual toothbrush. Sonicare all the way.</li>
            <li> This unit worked for 15 months and then broke.  Since the warranty was for 24 months, I was able to obtain a new replacement from Phillips Sonicare.  If it had lasted for five years I would have given it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I bought a different model but the brush would not spin. This one works really well. I have been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t tried an electric brush in years.  This is a honey.  Takes the tedium out of bedtime brushing.  Love the quad pacer.  Just stand and it does the work.  Husband went for a root planning.  Didn&#x27;t need it.  They just did a cleaning.  Now, that&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li> My original Sonicare - how many years old now?! - finally stopped working.  I tried a Braun Oral B, but hated how it felt.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100+ for a toothbrush, so I got this one.  Great toothbrush.  Nice narrow profile, easy to keep clean.  I am the only user, so I don&#x27;t remove the head.  Hopefully, that will prolong its life.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a year and a half. Since it&#x27;s still under warranty, Philips agreed to replace it. But they have no idea when I&#x27;ll get my replacement because it&#x27;s on factory backorder.  It was good while it lasted, but since this low quality product is now broken and Philips won&#x27;t replace it until some unknown date in the distant future, I&#x27;m giving it 2/5.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my aging electric toothbrush from a different manufacturer. The brush on my old one rotates, this one vibrates. This one seems to clean better. I really like the timer &#x27;reminder&#x27;, which is a brief pause in the vibration that reminds you to move on to a different quarter of your mouth. It is very effective for me.&lt;br /&gt;This version does not have some bells &amp; whistles of the more expensive ones; it just gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I no longer buy any rechargeable devices that have Ni-Cad batteries, because of their environmental impacts. This one does not have them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely excellent.  It gives you the feeling that you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  Now I am going to look at the Philips Flosser.</li>
            <li> still testing out well...  does a good job</li>
            <li> I have used a sonicare for about 10 years. I like it.    I just bought a second one for my 10 year old son. I kinda gave him the 3rd degree about how nice these are and that it is just like Dad&#x27;s and my son uses it with pride AND MY SON PUTS IT BACK!      My redid my son&#x27;s bathroom and it has a place for most everything, but my son would leave stuff out, but now almost every time I go into the bathroom, ever thing is put away.......How many bathrooms with kids have stuff put away? I feel this was an amazing accomplishment.</li>
            <li> This will take care of your teeth and gums almost as good as your dentist. With regular flossing and brushing your dental bills should be minimal!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and thought that it was just another toothbrush albeit higher end. I could not be more wrong. I had issues brushing with it the first two days as it tickled my gums but then I got used to it. I could immediately see that my teeth were several shades whiter and I even received compliments from family members who noticed the difference. In addition, the areas between my teeth were also cleaner before flossing. Now I am gifting these toothbrushes to all my family members.  UPDATE: I am updating these reviews to reflect my discontent with the instructions and warn other users. The brush is made well and does whiten your teeth; HOWEVER, the instructions tell you to only brush the front and back of your teeth. I assumed this was due to some technology in or the size of the brush making it clean the tops/bottoms of your teeth as well. Nope -- despite using this, flossing, and rinsing twice a day, I had two cavities on the tops of my back teeth. If you follow the instructions and do not brush the tops/bottoms of your teeth, you will develop cavities... so keeping in mind this flaw in the instructions and making sure to brush your entire mouth, this could be a five-star product.</li>
            <li> My old one gave out after years of use. If you have teeth and want to keep them, this thing is for you.</li>
            <li> Second one in 4 years.  Works great.  My teeth look and feel clean.  Just hope this one lasts longer then the first one.</li>
            <li> Slim line of this toothbrush fits better in your hand than older models plus include a travel case for ease.  Well done Sonicare on this new model.</li>
            <li> Does everything it should. Wish the grip was a little less slippery. But solid for the money.</li>
            <li> Product just as described. It took me a few days to get used to an electric toothbrush, but I am glad I selected the less complicated HX6511 model. One bottom on, one off.</li>
            <li> best ever electric toothbrush, came with a storage case for traveling...very nice</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth brush, it stays charged for two weeks so I can put it in the cabinet when not in use. It beeps when it is time to move to another section of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for this one!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this version of the SonicCare in the past and it is the best. My first one lasted for several years. When it stopped working I bought a different version. It did not have the 30 second beeps and the refill brushes had gaps that enabled water and debris to collect. I&#x27;ve also tried other brands, but I went back to this style and am happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare toothbrushes set the standard that other knock-offs do not seem to be able to meet. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheaper alternatives.  Just get a Sonicare that meets your needs and you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> My family has owned Sonicare toothbrushes for probably 10 years now. This one does all that you need. It has the quad spacer..times for 2 mins. No need to buy the more expensive model. They do not clean any better..its just a way to make you think your getting a newer more up to date version. Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Great much better than the old model doesn&#x27;t trap dirt inside ! Very happy will never stop using it because it clean my teeth so well :)</li>
            <li> This is the best tooth brush.  We have had the old style Sonicare  electric tooth  brush but this new one so much better.  The head is smaller and  you can really get around tooth and clean it really good.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to it, my problem is that it&#x27;s always gone before 2 years, this time was 18 months if life.  And I really take good care of it!!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is exactly what I was hoping for. No gimicky features, just a straightforward electric model.  The vibration took a few days to get accustomed to but over all  much  more  pleasant than the OralB spin brushes I have used in the past. After a few months of use my teeth are noticeably whiter and my gums have never been healthier.</li>
            <li> Replaced an earlier model with this one because I hated the grunge that would get into the handle. This is a nicer and cleaner design.</li>
            <li> People should know that this Sonicare brush comes with the &amp;#34;Easy-start&amp;#34; feature activated. That means the brush increases power gradually over the first 14 uses. I think that&#x27;s why some reviews say it&#x27;s not as powerful as their other brushes. To turn Easy-start off; attach the brush head on the handle and put the handle on the charger. Then hold the button on the brush for 2 seconds and you should hear a beep. Now, it should run at full power. To turn it back on, do the same and you will hear 2 beeps.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever. Easy to clean, and gets the job done! Also quieter than the other Sonicare models, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Nice toothbrush, but very pricey, and the starter head bristles are a little too hard and sharp for my liking. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I started using Sonicare toothbrushes several years ago when I was sick of getting my teeth scraped at the dentist.  Ever since I started using the Sonicare, I no longer have to worry about painful scraping.  This particular sonicare is smart enough to tell me when to switch areas of brushing in my mouth - it&#x27;s dummy proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase was for my teenage daughter with braces.  Sonicare has kept her teeth white and cavity free through all of the orthodontic work she was been through.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, motor is very powerful and leaves my teeth feeling like I just left from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The charger is a 110-220 so you dont need to worry if your in europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The timer is nice but I spend more than 30 seconds on each section and it auto shuts off after 2 mins. Not a big deal though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit comes with the handle, proresult head with clear cap, and charger</li>
            <li> This product fulfills the recommendation of my dental team.</li>
            <li> Would not go off. Then when I entered room it went off and then came back on. Then it would not shut off after I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning.</li>
            <li> This does an amazing job!  At my recent dental hygiene appointment, the hygienist said that my teeth were really clean and she noticed the difference from my last cleaning.  Would not go back to the manual toothbrush ever!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  I love the simplicity of the one button on and off, without having to cycle through various modes to turn the thing off, I like the automatic shut off after 2 minutes.  I had the earlier Sonicare models with the screw on brush heads, and the new snap on style is much cleaner, the brush itself is slimmer, lighter, and I find more ergonomically friendly.  The lithium ion battery in this thing beats the pants off of the battery life of the Oral B 3000 I also own, it goes about twice as long without having to be recharged.  The one thing I have changed from the previous Sonicare&#x27;s I have owned, is that the previous two I kept on the charger all the time, but the last one died within about a year, and would no longer hold a charge.  With this one (and the Oral B) I let the battery run down before I recharge even though the manual says overcharging isn&#x27;t possible, I really would prefer not to have to replace them in a year.  I actually bought the SoniCare not long after I purchased the Oral B, because I really missed the way the Sonicare felt and cleaned my gums but I didn&#x27;t dislike the Oral B, so I just kept both and I like them both in their own different ways, so I rotate using them.  But I do much prefer this brush, this I think is the best electric toothbrush on the market.  The higher end/more expensive models have features that I just wouldn&#x27;t use, but this one is worth it for the Lion battery.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve had it for a month or two and really like it. Purchased it when my old Sonicare croaked. If you haven&#x27;t had one before, you will love how clean it leaves your teeth feeling. The reason I purchased this model was that the last one I had would get nasty/funky where the brushhead attached and it really creeped me out. Would clean it and it&#x27;d be back in no time. This one is designed in such a way that there isn&#x27;t a place for water/toothpaste to get into. As long is lasts, I&#x27;ll be a happy camper. It holds a charge for a long time, too.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush for 2 months I can safely say I love it much more than the previous model (ESeries). Very easy to clean, the battery remains charged for a long time, nice selection of brush heads. It really makes difference in terms of the overall state of my teeth and gums. Of course it doesn&#x27;t replace flossing and regular professional care but the teeth feel so much cleaner compared to using a regular toothbrush. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Performs well. A little noisy but performance is what counts.The 30 second timer is a nice touch to evenly distribute the full two minutes among all your teeth!  And, a single over night charge operates it daily for over two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was a Braun user for many years. I was very happy with the Braun, but after my last Braun wore out (it stopped working after a couple of years), my wife suggested we try the Sonicare. I was a little worried because I was happy with what we had been using, but I took a chance bought the Easy Clean. Boy am I glad I did. It is a lot different than the Braun. There&#x27;s no question it removes more plaque the Braun and my teeth are much cleaner. The power of the sonic action obliterates any gunk between your teeth especially calcium buildup. I would get calcium buildup around my teeth even with brushing three times a day. The Sonicare Easy Clean got rid of all of it within a few days and my gums are much healthier. It&#x27;s a clean you can see and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the head it came with, but I recently bought a six pack of the InterCare brush heads. Bad move, the Intercare costs more, but I like the original head better. The InterCare are a little smaller and seem a little softer. I&#x27;ll buy the &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34; next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time. Definitely buy the newer models like the Easy Clean. Personally, I don&#x27;t think the extra features are worth it of the more expensive models. The EasyClean is great and very simple to use. Buy one, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as some of the other models, but everything you need.  You can program it to beep every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch to a different part of your mouth.  Plus, it has some new design features that are quantum leaps above the older styles.  The brush just snaps onto the handle, there&#x27;s no more bulky cap-like thing to screw in.  This new design means no gross pond scum growing in the cap-like thingy.  I used to dread looking at it, let alone cleaning it out.  It&#x27;s lighter to hold, and the charging base is much smaller, so it&#x27;s less obvious and takes up less room on the bathroom counter.  I didn&#x27;t want anything too fancy, I didn&#x27;t need a travel case or a brush sterilizer.  All I need for gleaming, whiter teeth is the magical sonicare brush itself, thank you very much.  The price is right too.  I just wish I had upgraded sooner.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Does not get gunked up like my last one.  Highly recommend and keeps the charge for a long time</li>
            <li> I had a Braun rechargeable before this one and I had to have soft brush heads.  Since this is sonic the brush that comes with it doesn&#x27;t rip up my gums at all.  Wish my other toothbrush had died sooner.  I bought a pack of soft brush heads but I think I could use the regular ones just fine.</li>
            <li> There is some kind of faulty glitche in this toothbrush. I had thought that anything by Phillips would be of the same caliber, but this product was an immense disappointment. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge, but then I realized that no matter how often it was charged (or how often I allowed it to deplete a charge), it will still stop vibrating while brushing teeth multiple times. I&#x27;ve learned that if it keeps it up, I have to tap the brush against the sink to get it started again. This toothbrush is not worth the money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested replacing my old OralB with this for its ability to scour away deposits.  It seems to do a fine job, but we&#x27;ll see what the next checkup says.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my son because he lost his other.  He has been very happy with it and wanted the same brand because he liked it so much!</li>
            <li> I own both brands, Oral-B 4000 series and this Sonicare. i&#x27;ve been using Oral  B for 3 years and the Sonicare for about 3 months. Both brands are far superior to manual tooth brushes and unless civilization comes to an end, I&#x27;m not going back to a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both types of brushes have unique cleaning advantages of their own design.&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B&#x27;s rotating round brush heads seem to clean the surfaces facing inside the mouth better, however overall Sonicare seems to be doing a better job and various research done seems to verify that Sonicare is slightly better than Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare feels like a tuning fork in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare is quieter than Oral-B, so when you brush your teeth late at night others don&#x27;t get disturbed.&lt;br /&gt;This model feels very comfortable in the hand and extremely convenient to operate, feels like a fine tuned sports car.&lt;br /&gt;This model has a lithium ion battery that is more advanced than NiCad batteries found on Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion; while both brushes are very close in performance, and both are far superior to any manual toothbrush Sonicare, particularly this model is slightly better than the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much, I purchased 4 of these on different dates for each family member and we use the same charging base without having to swap the brush heads.</li>
            <li> Too strong.. Need something with another setting</li>
            <li> Yikes!  This model takes 24 hours to charge!  My older model (that cost $20 more) only took a few hours to a half day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a 10 year old model&lt;br /&gt;That still worked fine except the battery would only last 2 or 3 brushing ( I always have it on a charger so that didn&#x27;t matter) the new one feels better and and doesn&#x27;t get all dirty like the old one&lt;br /&gt;The new one also has a lot of brush head choices</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist has been recommending that I get an electric toothbrush for years.  I love it. It makes it so easy to brush for the recommended 2 minutes and my teeth are super clean now.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best electric I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s light weight and has very good &#x27;reach&#x27;. There were no unneeded extra items.</li>
            <li> Better than Oral-B.  Great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used to have one of the higher-end Sonicare brushes, but the rubbery material got moldy after years of use. This build is plastic and does not seem it will suffer from that problem. Moreover, the brush is of the same high quality, and the brushing is of the same excellent results as the higher end model. I highly, highly recommend both Sonicare generally, and this particular model brush specifically. I could not recommend it higher -- your mouth will thank you for the investment.</li>
            <li> You would think that with a price of almost $84.00, you would get a brand new product.  When this arrived it was obvious that it had been opened and closed up again.  It seemed to work ok, so didn&#x27;t want to incure the cost to send it back, but just know that what you receive from Amazon might well be what someone else has returned.</li>
            <li> awesome tooth brush.  just left the dentis office clean feeling.  would highly recommend this to anyone.  battery lasts along time as well</li>
            <li> Liked my first Easy Clean purchase so I going to replace my sons older model that is prone to mold.  Satisfied sonic user for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare I have purchased. I am lost without a Sonicare. My dental appointments are great due to the thorough cleaning I get with this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the Sonicare toothbrush because I did not know if there was a better one, in spite of the fact that I was disappointed with my previous Sonicare because once the batteries die you can&#x27;t buy a replacement battery or send it to Philips to be refurbished. In other words, after two years the brush is disposable.They do brush your teeth quite well.</li>
            <li> For about half a year, it worked great! but then after that, all of the sudden in the middle of a use, it shut off after beeping twice and vibrating for a second, then it never became functional again. This is my second one from Philips, and don&#x27;t know why these last for only a short while. Very displeased with spending $70 for something that will break so fast.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought one of these years ago! Teeth feel so clean after using it. Charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> The only issue with these Sonicare toothbrushes is cleaning the base, which requires a bit more maintenance than a regular throw-away toothbrush. But, it&#x27;s well worth it. My dentist recommends Sonicare and no other brands... and, after using it for a year, I can see why! I&#x27;ve owned other electric toothbrushes. There is no comparison. Sonicare is simply the best. My dental hygienist and I are much happier now.</li>
            <li> This replaces my original Sonicare toothbrush.  It lasted over 10 years.  I expect the same from this brush.  I definitely wanted the quad pacer that came on this brush.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this model toothbrush!  Buy any other Sonicare but the Easy Clean! The base is very light weight and small, it tips over all the time! After two weeks of owning the Easy Clean the little tiny metal part that it sits on to charger base snapped off!  I have the part to show them that this was a defective product. The toothbrush is to heavy for the base.. .  . .keeps falling down.  So,  I am thinking no problem it has a year warranty. Customer service each time I have called  them have  been very understanding, delightful and apologetic for my inconvenience .. . but still two months later..  . ..  I am still waiting for a shipping label and a new toothbrush. Every time I have called customer service I give them the case #. . . .  they tell me that they so sorry and  will send the information to the right department to get this resolved!  I asked for a supervisor, and was told there is no supervisor? They will send my complaint to the proper department? This is not resolved many, many months later and they do not stand by the product or warranty. I have called over 10 times waiting for an email with the shipping label on where to get this sent to back to them. I read the reviews on Amazon saying they have had excellent customer service from Phillips.  .. . .I&lt;br /&gt;have not had that experience at all! They have the model number, the serial number and my date or purchase. The only emails I have received is on how do I rate their customer service.  . .ridiculous? This tooth brush cost me $69 for two weeks of usage!  I would never ever buy anything from Phillips again.  . . .going to replace it with another top leading brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************************************************************************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. .. .  .after waiting over 3 months I finally got a return label to send back the broken Easy Clean. It has been months later and still waiting for the replacement?</li>
            <li> Easy to use - has a timer functionality &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; that lets you know it&#x27;s time to switch to another section of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and my oral hygienist used to comment about how clean my teeth were. But it only lasted a year and I switched to Oral B. The comments about clean teeth stopped too. I finally switched back and the comments returned. This is not exactly a controlled study, but I feel this works better. They extend the warantee six months if you register it with Philips. Given that my first one did not last much beyond the warantee, I recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten an electric tooth brush sooner.  This one is a bit more expensive, but provides 4 30-second reminders to shift focus areas as you are brushing.  I would highly recommend, I bought one for myself and my son.</li>
            <li> good! nice! That&#x27;s it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!! just it! ..&lt;br /&gt;This is the thing I am looking for!&lt;br /&gt;Good feel!</li>
            <li> The brush does a great job, much better than I was able to do with a manual brush. The beep after 30 seconds forces me to brush each section of my teeth (upper, lower, backs) with enough time.  Will not use manual brushes again.</li>
            <li> great price and excellent toothbrush</li>
            <li> This cleans better than my old electric tooth brush - keeps the charge and the timer is great for remembering to move to a new section</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used too as it feels funny at first, but I can see teeth my are starting to get whiter.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare after speaking with my dental hygienist. I was in for my semi-annual cleaning and saw one on display.  I have rheumatoid arthritis (my hands have been compromised for the past fifteen years).  I have been using an cordless toothbrush for the past ten years but more recently it has not recharged properly (ten years is a long time).  She told me that the Philips was excellent.  I looked it up on Amazon and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual my order arrived in a couple days--I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Amazon orders.  I plugged it in and let it charge until the green ready light stopped blinking.  This toothbrush is sleek and the charging stand is much smaller than my old toothbrush.  My first use was a pleasant surprise.  The Philips rotates so fast that it makes a high pitched hum.  Quadrant cleaning is timed in 30 second increments so it&#x27;s become easier as the toothbrush lets you know when to hit the next quadrant.  When time is up it stops automatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so I will update if needed.  So far it has met my expectations.  My teeth feel cleaner--it&#x27;s like the smoothness you feel after getting your teeth polished.  This toothbrush is sleek, the brush removes easily and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gunk up&#x27; like my old toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews about hard bristles but I don&#x27;t have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this buy for everyone, more so for folks like me with RA who have difficulty using their hands.  My next purchase may be the air flosser as my hands cannot navigate a regular flossing regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these toothbrushes for years. A few years back my Sonicare stopped working so I sent them an email reporting my issue. They sent me a new one, no questions asked and a postage-included padded envelope to send back my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do these toothbrushes work great, but Phillips stands behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. My dentist uses one too BTW..</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I got it because 1) I wanted to make sure my teeth were as clean as they could be 2) I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting some awesome experience, but... Not really.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, i&#x27;m doing it wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my teeth that well. Sometimes i can still feel a film on my teeth, and i follow the instructions to the T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i don&#x27;t know anything about electric toothbrushes, but i do regret getting this. I probably would&#x27;ve been better off getting the cheaper version.The built in timer is kind of dumb.. I could totally do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the battery never seems to die. I&#x27;ve had it off the charger for a week now, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;My gums don&#x27;t look any healthier or my teeth whiter. Then again, i never had any gum problems to begin with.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go back to just a regular toothbrush - my mouth feels fresher and the dentist visit for cleaning is easier.</li>
            <li> I had given up on our old brushes (the dome-style design) as they required frequent cleaning that was meant disassembling them or replacing them at substantial cost.  This design is far more elegant and easy to maintain and the cleaning is easily as good (likely better!) as ever.  My only beef was the cost compared to the other entry-level model - but that ~$30 premium is worth it for the much improved head design.</li>
            <li> bought this item for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it! he said its the cleanest his teeth has ever been.</li>
            <li> A Great Value for the $$$$$</li>
            <li> It cleans super well.  I had an electric toothbrush, but that thing isn&#x27;t close to what this thing does for my teeth and gums.  Dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> After using this toothbrush, I can&#x27;t stand to use a regular toothbrush. It is better than the older models because you can easily remove the head. It does build up debris between the head and the part of the brush you hold in your hand, so that needs to be cleaned frequently or it will buzz loudly. I still need to clean the inside of my lower gums with a rubber tool, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s MUCH better than any other toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Really works well and is easy to use</li>
            <li> This model is not powerful enough.  I am a long time Sonicare user and mistakenly ordered this lighter model.</li>
            <li> Great purchase and investment in dental hygiene. The brush looks great, brushing is ultra&lt;br /&gt;easy, and teeth feel very clean afterwards. Not much else to say, I recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I got myself this toothbrush for Christmas. I&#x27;d been matching models and prices for sometime. All my research paid off when I bought this toothbrush. It really does feel like I just came from the dentist. I would reccomend this product. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never had whiter teeth ever before buying this product. It performs much better than the more expensive models. I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Good bang for the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good close shave approaching wet, razor shave.  Long intervals between charging.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for money.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought the &amp;#34;fancy electric toothbrush&amp;#34; after some expensive dental visits. It really tickled at first, but this model has a ramp up feature that starts out less intense and builds up to normal intensity over 14 uses. After just a couple days  using it my teeth are much whiter and my gums are looking healthier.</li>
            <li> I have had all of the other sonics toothbrushes and this one is the best! Price is a amazing for how it is compare to the expensive sonic toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
            <li> My daughter had a Sonicare that finally died after 6 years.  She is so happy to have this new one. She said nothing cleans teeth like the Sonicare!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a simple Sonicare toothbrush without all the heads, frills, accessories, etc... and so far so good.  This toothbrush is quite thin and not bulky.  These are great toothbrushes that last for a fairly long time.  Keep in mind, this model does not come with replacement heads.  The good thing... you really do not replace the heads that often.  Will last for a very long time (6 mos. - 1 yr.).</li>
            <li> i had an electric toothbrush that was more expensive than this one (from OralB). worked fine for a year, and then it just died. my girlfriend&#x27;s OralB also died; hers at the 6-month mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, this sonicare is AWESOME. i&#x27;m most impressed with the battery life. i&#x27;ve been using this for what feels like a month and i have not had to recharge it in its little holster once yet. trying to figure out when this thing will actually lose power. besides that, the vibrations from the toothbrush are great, and the bristles are awesome. just stiff/firm enough.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush does a great job and is easy to use.  Have used it about a month so far.  My only wish is that the brush heads were not so expensive,</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare. My first one lasted probably 6/7 years, and finally started not working so good. My new one is great, and the removeable head doesn&#x27;t gunk up like my older one did. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s great for people like me who have a bad gag reflex.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the hype. I&#x27;m a little (okay a lot) obsessed with dental hygiene, and I love brushing with this toothbrush! The head is smaller than one would expect, but for good reason--precision cleaning. I love the timed brushing feature. It usually stops right when I&#x27;ve had time to thoroughly clean my teeth, gums, and tongue, but sometimes I just have to get an extra few seconds in!</li>
            <li> I got this Sonicare to replace one that broke. (I packed it too tightly in a suitcase without taking the brushhead off-oops) Anyway it is great. I don&#x27;t need a fancy timer since I have a lot of prior brushing experience.The old one had a rubbery coating which was comfortable but sometimes got icky and smelly and I had to use Clorox on it. I recommend this one to anyone.</li>
            <li> love it ... easy to use and good to travel with. Would buy it again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of this model (my first was lost when American Airlines totally lost my luggage!), and it&#x27;s as good as the first one.  Previous to that, I had a fancier model, but never used the extra features.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money on the fancier models again.</li>
            <li> Great.  I have had them before but the batteries always lost steam.  Hoping this lasts longer.  they want more words to submit my review.  ???</li>
            <li> If you want a Sonicare toothbrush, this is a great one that isn&#x27;t too expensive. Easy to assembly, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.  I have used it for over six months now without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason why I purchased this product is because of the Easy Clean.  There is no place for water or deposits to catch.  After each brush, I pull the head off, rinse around the base and put the head back on in about 5 - 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The force of the toothbrush is good.  Not too soft and not too hard as to bruise my gums.  The toothbrush also does not slip in my hands when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charge lasts a very long time.  I recharge about every 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the timer every 30 seconds.  I know that you can turn it off but I find it very useful and after a while, you begin to subconsciously know when the 30 seconds will be up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great toothbrush that I see myself continuing to use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and love them. The battery on teh old one died so this was simply a relacement. good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> My dentist said I brush too hard and my gum line was suffering.  Since switching to the Sonicare, my gums have improved and my over all oral care has improved.  The built in timer helps ensure you brush properly.  You don&#x27;t need all the other fancy bells and whistles in the line.  This brush does what it needs to.  It may cost more than a standard brush, but I am sure I make it back at the dentist visits now.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare, and probably the lightest to handle.  It&#x27;s also less intrusive on the bathroom countertop because the base is much more compact than in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare products for many years with good performance. This is the 3rd brush that I&#x27;ve bought in about 10-12 years.</li>
            <li> We have used Soniccare brushes in our home for well over 15 years and just had to purchase a replacement motor, great brush and much more compact than the one we have used all these years.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush!  The Sonicare technology helps to keep your teeth cleaner and whiter than a regular toothbrush.  This model only has one setting, but that is really all you need.  I have another model that has a sensitive setting and a massage setting; however, I always just use the normal setting.  So this basic model (which I bought for travel) is sufficient.</li>
            <li> Better than more expensive model of sonicare......so much happier without settings.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush.  Replaced my sonic e series which I&#x27;ve had for 6 years. Fits perfect in your hand and not too bulky. Way better than my e series</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive about these toothbrushes.  The feeling of cleaness in your mouth after using one of these will surpass anything you have felt in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this brush as I did not feel any real need for the bells &amp; whistles on the far more expensive models and I feel that my decision was correct.  These provide all of the necessary functions without a bunch of unnecessary window dressing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them as a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Since Ive had a sonicare toothbrush for the last eight years, the new slimmer model is really great especially if you have arthritis or any hand pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush on Sept 11, 2011 - Today (Aug 24, 2012) I need to order a new one. I am going to try a different model. This one stopped charging 2 days ago. I am very disapointed. While it was operating, it was awesome but I would expect more than a year of service. My previous Sonicare lasted well over 5 years - I only updated because I wanted one that had a smaller base &amp; looked more updated.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the warrenty is - by the time I find it in my mess of papers - it will probably have just expired. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8-28-12 -UPDATE - as another reviewer suggested to me, I did follow up with Phillips &amp; they are sending me a new toothbrush handle today &amp; a prepaid shipping label to send the defective one back. No hassel.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;I am appreciative of the reviewer that suggested that I follow up.</li>
            <li> I like this little guy.  Fits inside my travel kit, sturdy, works thus far (have had it for a few months).  Feels great on your gums.  The beeps are especially helpful.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product definitely cleans our teeth much better than manually brushing. We usually charge it once every ten days or so. It is a quality product at the right price. We would not go back to a regular toothbrush. Waiting for 2 rebates to come, they should have been received by now.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist  recommended a sonic brush for me so I started researching and found this one. It does an excellent job cleaning and my teeth feel like I just left the hygienist&#x27;s office when I use it. Love the timing feature too, it ensures I don&#x27;t rush and get to all my teeth evenly. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my third Sonicare toothbrush, The first was the Essence, the second was the Flexcare. The Easyclean, the current toothbrush I use, is the best of the three. I didn&#x27;t like the brush head on the Essence and it used NiCad batteries. The Flexcare had features I never used and it lasted a little over a year. It has too many functions which can go bad and they did. Also, the buttons sometimes would get pressed by mistake while I was brushing. They&#x27;re too close to where you hold the toothbrush. It had a Lithium battery which is far superior to the NiCad of the Essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Easyclean is simple, On/Off. I&#x27;m hoping that it&#x27;s simplicity leads to a longer life. It also uses a Lithium battery and it is amazing that it holds it&#x27;s charge for two to three weeks before needing to be recharged. I used to place the other models on the sink in their charger but not with this model. Everything goes in a drawer and comes out only when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I&#x27;m finished with the toothbrush, I wipe the brush head with my towel and pull the brush head off and wipe the top of the toothbrush body to keep it clean. It takes two seconds and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Sonicare toothbrushes have significantly helped my teeth and especially my gums over the years. I have had a problem with Gingivitis almost all my adult life. I have to constantly take extra care with my teeth and gums and see my dentist and periodontist regularly. They both highly regard the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no connection to Phillips and I am angry over the Flexcare failure. I called them to complain and they said there is a two year warranty but that I needed to provide the store receipt. I couldn&#x27;t find it so, I lose. This time, I registered the toothbrush online to prevent the same issue if it occurs again and they added a extra six months to the warranty to boot.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself to replace the old one I lost while on vacation, then also one for my husband, my son, and my daughter in law. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Replaced another Sonicare model with this one.  Old one gave good service but had one major fault---allowed disgusting \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; to build up inside the handle.  Read reviews for many rechargeable electric toothbrushes before deciding on the HX6511/50.  Several of the reviews for this model mentioned a simplified handle-to-brush connection that greatly reduced the opportunities for gunk build-up like they had experienced with various brands/models.  For me this was the deciding factor and so far, so good.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles of some models but it covers the basics (and more)quite well.  Main thing---it&#x27;s easy to clean and keep that way.  Goodby \\&quot;gunk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is our 3rd unit. The older ones lasted quite some time and this new one will hopefully do the same. We also received the kids one as a gift and find it very fun to get them to brush. Will always have one of these.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush. Nice and clean. Easy on my gums.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Sonicare toothbrush about three months ago when my dentist specifically recommended it.  After years of improper brushing technique (sawing motion back and forth) my gums have receded and exposed the roots of my teeth.  To protect from further gum erosion, but still effectively fight plaque, I have been using this and like it. I watched a YouTube video that demonstrates proper brushing with it. The manual says you can leave it on the charging base without diminishing its ability to fully recharge, but I don&#x27;t. It lasts a good two weeks before I recharge it. I then recharge it for about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Good product, but WaterPik is better for my purposes.  WaterPik gets food particles out that no toothbrush, manual or electric, gets.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for travel but it is so superior that I now use it exclusively.  Goodbye Oral-B.  The Sonicare brush does an excellent job cleaning my teeth and one charge will easily last 3 weeks (twice a day, everyday, two minutes each brushing).  I always bought battery operated toothbrushes for travel but they were never very good (more noise than cleaning) so I decided to find a lightweight rechargable toothbrush for travel.  This one has excellent reviews so I ordered it.  It&#x27;s great.  So great I use it whether I&#x27;m travelling or not.  So great I am purchasing one for my husband also.  It comes with in a container that is perfect for travel.  Unles you are going on a REALLY LONG trip, no reason to take the recharger with you.</li>
            <li> Good product.  My previous one lasted about 18 months, which I thought was a bit short given the price.  So for the replacement, I bought this no-frills model (since I never used all the &amp;#34;special features&amp;#34; of the more expensive models).  So far, this works well.  Teeth are clean!</li>
            <li> If everyone had one of these and uses the toothbrush as directed visiting the dentist would be gun.</li>
            <li> I have never had a toothbrush I liked as welll as this  I does a fantastic job. I would buy again from this. vendor.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic toothbrush.  The Sonicare brand was recommended by my dental hygienist and I chose the EasyClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush after reading reviews online.  I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Keeps my teeth very clean with no irritation or pain to my gums. Easy to clean. Small enough to stick in the corner. Stays charged for long periods of time. Recommend cleaning base and taking top apart each time to keep clean. Just takes a second.</li>
            <li> Works Great. Teeth feel super clean! Feels like I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. A + +</li>
            <li> I spent a really long time researcher which Sonicare to get. This one has everything you need. Has the exact same brushing vibration stuff as the top of the line model, uses the same heads. It just doesn&#x27;t have the extra gimmicks, for instance &amp;#34;whitening mode&amp;#34; Is just an extra 30 seconds added to your brush time that you focus on the front.&lt;br /&gt;Been using about 6 months teeth feel great after using it, haven&#x27;t seen the dentist yet but I have good hopes. The thing holds a charge for months, pretty impressive. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> for a bit more or almost the same you can get the much newer model with the stonger vibrations. I made this mistake. I will keep this one, and buy the newer version too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the newer head but just one speed.</li>
            <li> Nice, efficient rechargeable toothbrush.  It cleans my teeth well and the product is easy to keep clean.  I&#x27;d recommend it for quality, durability, attractiveness and value for price.</li>
            <li> You will notice a significantly cleaner feeling than your manual brush. Cleans great. Holds charge. No problem with crowns or veneers. Feels great on your gums. Four 30 second timed intervals for each quadrant of your mouth. This is the right price point to get the best features for the best price.</li>
            <li> The compactness of the toothbrush and its charger are wonderful - much easier to store and travel with than older models</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to love this toothbrush as much as I loved my other Sonicare, but I love this one even more!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean the connecting section between the head of the brush and the base. It&#x27;s not as loud as my older model either.&lt;br /&gt;I only need to charge this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great toothbrush and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush! Powerful, small handle, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Really  cleans your teeth well. The best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush we have ever used. If you want really clean teeth, a highly usable brush, get this one.</li>
            <li> My previous Sonicare died and I ordered this to replace it. It works well and my dentist says I have less tartar that has to be cleaned off. I would recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> Great improvement on prior models. Like lighter handle and strong motor</li>
            <li> This is an improvement over my other, more basic Sonicare model.  As other reviewers said, this is much easier to clean and maintain without having buildup on the item.  Seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Very good and no added features which dom&#x27;t help anyway.</li>
            <li> This was a fabulous toothbrush... while it lasted. Unfortunately, it has stopped working. I contacted Philips and the customer service rep was rude. He told me that without a receipt (who keeps a receipt for a toothbrush) there was nothing he could do. I have the serial numbers, that sort of thing, I can&#x27;t believe there isn&#x27;t a work around for this. Then he hung up on me! Anyway, I will NEVER buy another Philips product. Bad customer service trumps all for me!!!</li>
            <li> I had an old Sonicare for years. Now that I finally upgraded to a new model I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long. This one does a better job, feels better in my mouth (it&#x27;s much slimmer), and is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sonicare for almost 2 months and I absolutely love it. I can&#x27;t wait for my next dentist appointment!</li>
            <li> The sonicare brush has been working well so far. Time will tell if it makes any difference in my dental checkups.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare Tooth brush and I can&#x27;t live without it and the trips to the dentist are a lot more enjoyable too.</li>
            <li> Everything about this toothbrush seems to be wonderful with one exception.  The box, the manual, and even the product description here all clearly state that this model has a feature called Quadpacer that beeps and pauses in 30 second intervals.  Except that in reality, it doesn&#x27;t BEEP!  I called Philips directly, and the cheery woman on the phone explained that it isn&#x27;t supposed to beep.  Despite what the packing and advertising claims.  It doesn&#x27;t beep, it&#x27;s not supposed to beep, and the company doesn&#x27;t seem to care that they are marketing a product that does not perform as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it&#x27;s a very minor issue,  you can still feel the pause and it does shut off after 2 minutes.  But would I purchase from a company that fails to provide a product as described, and doesn&#x27;t seem to care?  Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop Wisely.</li>
            <li> Love this. Easy, quick and thorough.</li>
            <li> I thought electric toothbrushes were the same. This one is amazing and you can&#x27;t feel a film on your teeth when you are thru brushing. Also, very healthy for your gums. I have recommended it to others because it is great! Your teeth feel so much cleaner than with a regular or cheap electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for and glad I made splurge.  Teeth feel very clean and brush very easy to use and stays charged</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does make a difference in oral hygiene. I&#x27;ve had both this version and one with the ultra violet sterilizer. This one works just as well, so apparently the more expensive sterilizer version wasn&#x27;t necessary, at least for me.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have that rubberized handle piece like our old model.  The old model would start to peel off.  This one just has a nice smooth plastic handle.  Much improved.  It did not come with the dual head holder though.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of other people&#x27;s (better) reviews. The brush that comes with the package is very firm, which means you have to buy a softer brush if you don&#x27;t want your gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Brush is powerful and easy to operate - but most importantly it cleans up much better than my old brush.</li>
            <li> I had an Oral B and loved the small, round brush head design.  However, the Oral B brush lacked the &amp;#34;sonic technology&amp;#34; that my dentist insisted is superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having hated the Sonicare E-series I had years ago, I was pleased to see this new slim design. While the EasyClean&#x27;s handle is lighter and more ergonomically designed than those of the E-series, I&#x27;m disappointed to say that I still find its brush head design to be messy and cumbersome to use if you have a small mouth.  Furthermore, the EasyClean stops at the end of the 2-minute cycle rather than just giving an alert and allowing the user to continue brushing uninterrupted if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it over, I would buy another Oral B.  The round head of the Oral B brush allows the user to access those hard to reach spots, like the backside of the front teeth and wisdom teeth.  The Oral B toothbrushes also continues to operate after giving a 2-minute &amp;#34;alert&amp;#34; (double vibrate) so the user can decide how long to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, I&#x27;ve used the the EasyClean toothbrush for a few weeks now and it does make my teeth feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean.&amp;#34;  That said, I often have to restart the cycle because I feel I have missed spots due to its bulky brush head.  Also, at the end of every cleaning, I have to wipe down my mirror and faucet and cabinets.  What a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, the Oral B brush glides easily over and around each individual tooth with no mess. Furthermore, while using the Oral B, I have always received high praise from my dental hygienist (no plaque buildup or cavities), even when I went a couple of years between cleanings due to health reasons. This leads me to believe that adding  &amp;#34;sonic technology&amp;#34; to my regime won&#x27;t make a measurable amount of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to buy a basic electric toothbrush that fits your individual preference (round or traditional brush head).  IMHO, the &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; (whitening mode, etc.) don&#x27;t seem to be worth the added expense.  In my case, because my mouth is small, I wish I had purchased another Oral B.</li>
            <li> I had the standard base e series before this. This one is much improved. It has a sleaker and less bulky design and leaves my teach feeling smooth and well cleaned.</li>
            <li> I had one for a long time and finally gave up the ghostbut it was a good performer.  I decided to stay with the same brand.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Can&#x27;t stop feeling my teeth with my toungue because they are so clean and smooth.  I would highly reccomend getting one of these.  Could pay for itself by avoiding a cavity!</li>
            <li> I have owned other Sonic toothbrushes.  This is by far the best.  Really leaves your teeth feeling clean.  has a very good charge. Better than my previous oral b toothbrush and love the interval timer.</li>
            <li> This was my third Sonicare over the years and I love them.  They have saved me hundreds of dollars at the dentist. I would recommend them to everyone.  Used to have very tender gums and now they are so healthy that the hygenist mentions it everytime I am there.  I particularly love this Sonicare because it is simple to clean; just rinse it off, dry it and put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> Works great has a timer that I need. It seems to keep charge for a long time. Cleaning is as I would expect from this company. Very good.</li>
            <li> Still working many months later.  I expect this to stop working after two years as all the Philips Sonicare Tooth Brushes seem to do.  Keeps you buying more so why make them last?  Anyway, love this brush with the compact heads.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on all the gimmicks, I have had them all, and at the end of the day this one works just the same as the highest price ones.  All the programs are useless.  I have the UV cleaning base from a brush or two ago and that does nothing but wear out the brush head.  Just rinse with water, put the cover on and repeat.  Replace head every couple months.  The imaginary threat of germs from your tooth brush is there to upsell you.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush! i traded in an oral b which i had been pleased with but my dentist recommended this. super powerful, i notice my teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our dentist as the best model for us and we both love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Sonicare Easy Clean. I was dubious when an oral surgeon first suggested it, however after using it, my teeth feel the same way they do after the dental hygienist cleans them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a coupe months and wow, have I noticed a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, one charge on this thing lasts a really long time. I was afraid I&#x27;d have to keep the whole charger on my counter, but alas, I use this twice a day, and haven&#x27;t charged it in weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my teeth feel a lot cleaner ever since I started using the Sonicare. I keep running my tounge over them, and they feel so smooth! I also went to the dentist recently and he was really impressed by how clean/well kept my mouth/teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an automatic stop, so I can kind of just brush and forget about it until it stops itself. This way I know I&#x27;m brushing for the appropriate time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I now love brushing my teeth! It seems trivial, but it really is a great product for helping you keep up your smile :)</li>
            <li> I resisted electric toothbrushes for years. Once I used my first Sonicare, I loved it. Every aspect of tooth brushing was better than a manual (except cost of the unit and replacement brush heads). This is my second Sonicare. My first unit was the fatter handled style Essence and lasted almost six years, which, I believe, is above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?&lt;br /&gt;1. The new design, lighter, thinner is great. But the material is too slick. It would be better if the unit had a little grip to it. Makers of pocket point and shoot cameras, such as Canon, have dealt with and solved this problem.&lt;br /&gt;2. The recharging base DOES NOT HAVE pegs for two brush heads. What?! How can my wife and I share the unit easily? Am I supposed to balance the brush heads on the counter or in the medicine cabinet? Unstable and potential unsanitary. Am I supposed to buy TWO Sonicare toothbrushes. Forget that.&lt;br /&gt;3. No carrying case. Boo hiss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips should put every effort into making the unit complete and perfect and drop the effort to nickel and dime the consumer. The product is great. The total package and experience is subpar. But it. Use it. Let Philips know that they dropped the ball 10 yards short of the goal line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over a week now and love it!  It is as advertised, easy to use, easy on the gums and can reach everywhere it needs to.  It came charged out of the box and I have not had to charge it yet!  It does a great job cleaning my teeth and I can already tell a  difference in how my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace an older model that failed on me.  So far, so good.  Dentist seemed to notice the difference in using a sonicare toothbrush - particularly on the gums, and especially if you are a &amp;#34;hard brusher.&amp;#34;  This toothbrush prevents you from brushing your gums away.  It also seems to help with plaque build up on the inside of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had to send the first one back because it was not working correctly.  Kept turning itself off.  The second one is better, but still turns off too soon at times.  I have had a Sonic care for years.</li>
            <li> Oral hygiene has always been a challenge for me. This product has brought *significant* improvement. It&#x27;s worth the price for something I use every single day.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected, not a distinct two minute timer,tends to be messier than my older model,can&#x27;t locate replacement heads for this</li>
            <li> I received the toothbrush but was missing two of the three brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had the fancier version of this, the healthy white, for like 6 years and it finally got too grimy. After reading a TON of reviews of it and then this more affordable option (thank you everyone) and decided to go for this one. No regrets! You can always buy the fancier replacement heads but I don&#x27;t even think they are necessary. I&#x27;ve had it a few months now and it&#x27;s awesome. Just as effective as healthy white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to electric toothbrushes, this is your machine! If you&#x27;re replacing an old one, this is also your machine! I LOVE brushing my teeth with this, and I can&#x27;t stand using regular toothbrushes anymore. I brush my teeth for longer duration and more frequency because it&#x27;s fun and easy. I bought my first sonicare after a dentist basically mandated it after I had to have my teeth scraped due to gingivitis. My teeth and gums have been in impeccable shape since I&#x27;ve started using these. Yay!</li>
            <li> 3rd Phillips Sonicare I&#x27;ve owned in a lifetime (i&#x27;m 50 something!)  Love the slim design not as bulky as the other two and is very light.  Easy to clean. Has the quad pulse to remind you to move from different areas of the mouth.  Like it a lot, runs well.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  I have had remarkable results with mine.</li>
            <li> Very good toothbrush.  Worked very well, for almost two years.  It did a great job on my teeth - and is good for my gums as well.  I&#x27;ve been buying the soft heads for it and have been very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem: the case is sealed, so apparently when it stops, there is no alternative to buying a new one.  The brush I ordered on August 14th two years ago stopped working yesterday - about a month short of two years.  And now I either pay to replace it or move on to something else.  Still, two years of clean teeth and no gum problems isn&#x27;t bad, especially since when I team it with Tom&#x27;s of Maine anti-plaque and whitening toothpaste, my dentist apparently doesn&#x27;t notice that I haven&#x27;t been flossing.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Takes some getting use to if you have never used a brush that vibrates. The battery life is great. I have gone three weeks between charges and the brush was still going. I use to have a Rotadent and it was good, but this Sonicare is better.</li>
            <li> My first electric toothbrush &amp; I will never go back unless I&#x27;m in the woods! Actually, I made it through a 3 week international vacation on one charge, so it wants you to rough it a little. Nothing but nice things to say about this brush...</li>
            <li> This may not be a fair ratting but I find the button to turn it on is much harder to work than another brand I had.  (If I may add my hands are crippled.)  It seem to do a good job of brushing but I don&#x27;t care for the vibration.</li>
            <li> I think I will use this forever! I bough this for my parents, friend and in law. Great product !!</li>
            <li> Not much to say here since this electrical toothbrush has been doing the job perfectly for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Had been using smaller travel sonic toothbrushes for months. Decided with the online coupon I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed as your teeth feel squeaky clean. Best price toothbrush with $10 online coupon</li>
            <li> Better dental health which is fun to use.  Who likes brushing your teeth?  You will actually do a better job brushing and save trips to the dentist.  The dental staff is pleased that I am finally getting the right amount of brushing in 2 minutes to improve my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. My teeth feel very clean after using this brush. Love it.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended Sonic Care as the way to keep my mouth healthy any my teeth clean.  I have used Sonic Care brushes before and this is considerably small and yet easy to handle.</li>
            <li> MY OLD SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH LASTED OVER TEN YEARS AND IS A DURABLE PRODUCT. OVER THE YEARS I DROPPED IT A FEW TIMES AND IT HELD UP AND NEVER BROKE EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  IT REALLY GETS YOU TEETH CLEAN AND DOES WONDERS FOR YOUR GUMS IF YOU MASSAGE THEM WITH IT, THIS PRODUCT CAN SAVE YOUR GUMS AND TEETH AND I HIGHTLY RECOMMEBND IT TO ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THE ONLY THING I WISH ALL COMPANIES WOULD BRING THEIR FACTORYS BACK FROM OVERSEAS AS WE NEED THE JOBS HERE AT HOME AND I MISS AMERICAN QUALITY CONTROL. NO WONDER THERE ARE NO JOBS HERE. LETS BRING IT ALL HOME.</li>
            <li> I have purchased both the Oral B and Sonicare electric toothbrushes.  I like the speed  and cleaning of the Sonicare better than the Oral B, however, the handle gives me trouble.  It is shaped such that your hand slides up toward the top of the brush head and your hand turns the switch off.  If find this VERY annoying.  The Oral B is tapered so that the wand is thicker toward the brush head making it hard for your hand to slip and turn the brush off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other difference is that the Oral B replacement heads are about $2 cheaper than the Sonicare replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist,super clean!! I have sensitive gums &amp; teeth so I did buy the sensitive heads for the brush which are the same price as the regular ones and a little softer for my gums.The charge holds up for about a month maybe longer,I  wouldn&#x27;t go back to a manual toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Works great. There&#x27;s no point in spending more than what this model costs. 2-minute timer with 30-second indicator is all you need. Plus, this is the improved design, so there&#x27;s no build up in the brush attachment and you don&#x27;t have to buy any &#x27;collar&#x27; as some had to for the model that&#x27;s $10 cheaper. I&#x27;ve used it without sitting it on the charger for 7 days and didn&#x27;t get any low battery warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a $150 competitor brand that uses a small circular brush head, and that was a waste. Philips Sonicare with the &#x27;normal&#x27; toothbrush head is much better and even my dentist friend prefers this style.</li>
            <li> I used to have an Oral B electric toothbrush, but I left it in a hotel room a while back and never called to ask them to ship it to me. Maybe i was unconciously looking for an excuse to buy a new one because my old one was so LOUD, and I felt like it took forever to brush my teeth with the litle brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This on the other hand, it is quiet, has a beeper to time the sections of your mouth (and turns off after 2 min), and I felt like my teeth were so much cleaner in 2 minutes than the usual 3-4 I did with the older brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star rating only because of the size of the brush. I am a &amp;#34;thrifty&amp;#34; person and not prone to spending this kind of money on myself. This was a fantastic splurge and I will from here on out buy this toothbrush for myself. I have never had a clean feeling like this (except after a teeth cleaning at the dentist) and am sold on this product. I would highly recommend it to anyone and in fact have already told all my family members and friends that they should get one. Awesome clean that lasts until my next brushing. And it saves me time because in the 2 minutes (it has a timer) that it runs it does better than the 5 minutes of manual brushing I did previously. I am sold.</li>
            <li> best sonicare model if have had in 12 years</li>
            <li> It was a really good choice of mine to try out this line of product, featuring easy-clean. I had to admit it is a gift for lazy people.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my dentist.  It definitely lives up to the standard he said it would.  Keeps my teeth feeling clean and well cared for.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush works beautifully. I purchased it for my son for Christmas. I have the Sonicare healthy white for myself and this model (which is $20.00 cheaper) is much much quieter and still does the same job.</li>
            <li> I bought this for X-mas.  So far after two uses, I can tell quite a difference over my normal brushing and feels like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush, highly recommended! Great price and really feels like a professional cleaning. Hoping that this will eliminate unnecessary trips to the dentist</li>
            <li> The last sonicare toothbrush I bought Lasted two years and three months. Bought this toothbrush and it had a cosmetic defect on it.</li>
            <li> Works great. I Wish the brush was a little larger. Going to the detist today and hope to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  My teeth haven&#x27;t been this clean since I was born.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for more than 15 years - this is my favorite. Small, light, and easy to hold</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush. My dentist finally talked me into the Sonicare system and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve seen the light. My teeth do seem cleaner and healthier after just a few weeks. The first model I bought was the more expensive Healthy White model, but its extra features are superfluous. When I bought a second brush so my wife and I could each have our own, I got this model — the Easy Clean — and it&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive model. All you need is Clean mode, which is found on both.</li>
            <li> We love our sonicare brushes and would recommend this model as one of the best values in the product line.</li>
            <li> The performance is one of kind! You cant get your teeth cleaner,with out going to dentist! I just went to dentist. AOk!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this toothbrush! My teeth feel super clean after brushing. I like how it operates for 2 minutes and automatically shuts off. It comes with two different brush heads, wall charger and a travel carry case. Oh, and the instant $10.00 off coupon at checkout was a cherry on top!</li>
            <li> This model is better than the other model I used for years. It fits my hand better. I don&#x27;t have to open it up to clean inside. iIt was always disgusting to clean inside the old toothbrush, with this model you don&#x27;t find anything gross when you clean it. I am completely happy with my purchase. I wish I had changed models years ago.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL TOOTHBRUSH..ONE CHARGE LASRS A LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;FAST SHIPPING...&lt;br /&gt;SHINEY CLEAN TEETH</li>
            <li> Sonicare are great toothbrushes and have saved me $$$ in dentist bills due to the thorough cleaning it does. I had the Flexcare Plus, but never once used any of the other features. This is essentially the same brush without the bells and whistles. The UV sanitizer is a gimmick and didn&#x27;t seem to work in my opinion. I would recommend getting this and saving the $150. Cleans just the same!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over ten years.  This is my second.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Being a dental assistant, I was constantly being nagged by my boss to get a Sonic Care. So with the Christmas bonus I got, I bought this one. Great price I have to say as in the pharmacy stores they are about $100 or more. I must admit my mouth needed to get used to the sonic vibrations and this brush actually starts off slow and increases over a two week period to full strength to help with this. The &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a beeping noise but a quick break in the vibrations so you know to change quadrants. It shuts off after the two minutes are up. My teeth feel so much cleaner and my hygenist swears I will have a better checkup. I have occasional dry mouth which cause more plague buildup and I was having this problem on the inside of my front bottom teeth even though I know I brush well. I think it is also helping with my tea stains that I get from drinking so much tea.</li>
            <li> Shiny teeth, healthy gums, spend less money ( after initial investment) really these things are worth it. Buy it, use it, love it</li>
            <li> Years ago I tried electric toothbrushes; hated them. My teeth still had that scummy feel. Recently my dentist said that I was continuing to brush too hard, thus dangerously exposing my roots. She suggested an electric toothbrush. I scoffed based on past experience, but purchased the Sonicare anyway. Wow how technology has changed. Bottom line, I don&#x27;t have that scummy feel on my teeth and I no longer have the need to apply pressure to the toothbrush. The bristles feel like they are vibrating, yet they seem to push the saliva generated between the teeth. Speaking of saliva, it does generate a lot! I&#x27;m still trying to get the proper technique down where it isn&#x27;t dripping down the toothbrush handle. There&#x27;s definitely a reason why you don&#x27;t see these toothbrushes being used by characters on TV and the movies! I like this model because of the timer so that you brush your teeth for 2 minutes (30 seconds for each quadrant). I recently heard the average person brushes their teeth for only 46-47 seconds! I am looking forward to my next dental checkup to see if the staff notices a difference in the health of my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I love the philips sonicare toothbrushes.  This one&#x27;s great too! I&#x27;ll buy again, if I need to.  The product is great.</li>
            <li> My son requested this for Christmas to replace his old worn out Sonicare.  He hasn&#x27;t had a cavity since he started using Sonicare years ago.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this toothbrush that replaced an older version Sonicare. It doesn&#x27;t catch the debris like the older brush &amp; is a nice size. It leaves my mouth feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the poor reception... Radio itself is quality</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement for a ten year old Sonicare with the large head,  The smaller head is a great improvement and the replacements are so much less expensive. These are the best of the best and always receive compliments from the dentist on how clean the teeth are.</li>
            <li> I love that the brush does the work.  I love getting great checkups from my dentist (seriously!). I love that this version is so much cleaner than the older models where toothpaste and water slime leaked into the brush head.  Only negative is that it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; it&#x27;s a bit hard to hold when turned on and vibrating.  I&#x27;ll get used to it, I&#x27;m sure, but I liked the thicker base of the older model for this reason.</li>
            <li> Caused more gum recession than before I began using it.  Upon my periodontist&#x27;s advice I returned it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good when it works. The toothbrush lasts about 2 years and then stopped charging. This is the second time Sonicare toothbrush stops working after about 2 years. So, expect to buy a new one every 2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these toothbrushes for several years.  It works great - always get rave reviews on the condition of my teeth and gums from my dentist and hygienist.  It does everything the more expensive ones do for a lot less.  You can buy DiamondClean replacement heads and they will fit this toothbrush.  Much easier to clean than some.  I like the slim handle and small charging base for traveling.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. This is a great product and worth the price. I will probably buy another for myself soon.</li>
            <li> My second electric toothbrush. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, upgraded from the old e series. The head is much better and doesn&#x27;t collect gunk like the old ones. Will continue to be loyal to sonicare!</li>
            <li> Before ordering this toothbrush, I had the more expensive Sonicare Plus with the different brushing modes.  I never used the extra features and the extra buttons were too easy to accidentally push when you were using it.  And it lasted only two years before the battery would no longer charge.  I have been using this one for two months and I like this less expensive one much better. It is simple to use and the handle is slimmer and fits better in my hand.  There&#x27;s no need to pay extra to get unnecessary features.  I just hope this lasts longer than the other one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric toothbrush 3 weeks ago &amp; I love it, don&#x27;t have to pull it apart to clean which saves so much time.</li>
            <li> Great product. I feel like I just left the dentist every morning. Easy to clean, fun to use, seems durable.</li>
            <li> Stays clean; no nasty build up on the brush which was my main concern when looking for an electronic brush. Long battery life. Leaves my teeth feeling nice and clean. The timing mechanism to let you know when to change quadrants is very helpful.</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace our Sonicare toothbrush that was a predecessor to the 5300. It was a little over 6 years old. It was still working great except the battery would no longer hold a charge.  This HX6511/50 is an excellent replacement. It&#x27;s much thinner in design, holds a charge for way more than a week before needing recharging and the brush is now just the brush head. Our old Sonicare was a brush and fat base, a real waste of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing was ready to use right out of the box; came with the body, new brush head and a recharger. We read through the directions, put it on the charger overnight and then deactivated the program that gradually increases the \\&quot;power\\&quot;.  It makes a beep every 30 seconds to let us know to start brushing the next quadrant of the mouth.  It also has the two minute shut off.  No complaints at all and by using Amazon.com, we got the best deal.  I compared with Walmart, the Sonicare factory outlet and other online stores.  No one had a better price than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a reminder that there is a small gap between the bottom of the toothbrush and the top of the toothbrush body.  I thought I had not placed the brush on correctly, but then re-read the directions and it indicates the gap is intentional.  Probably so we can rinse that area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without a Sonicare toothbrush! My gums and teeth are the healthiest they&#x27;ve been since I was a child.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers may have mentioned, the Quadripacer DOES NOT BEEP.  It simply pauses before the next 30 second interval and shuts off after 2 minutes.  Why does Phillips say it beeps when it doesn&#x27;t is beyond me.  However, it does perform better than any 10 or 20 dollar unit outside of that one  mis-advertising issue.  The brush also is contoured to get in between teeth as well, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush! Highly recommended! It reaches those hard to get places and works really well! The battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s lightweight enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Had the old e-series for many years and the batteries finally wouldnt hold a charge for very long so we replaced them with the new Pro Results brushes with Li-Ion batteries. After having these for a few months they are exactly what we expected. Every time you brush you will feel like you just got a cleaning at the dentist. Battery lasts forever and the new Pro Results cleaning head is bigger and seems to clean better. This particular model is the cheapest of the new Pro Results Line that has the &amp;#34;Quad-Pacer&amp;#34; function wich makes brushing easy and brainless being that the brush signals you to switch to a new quadrant of your mouth. Awesome product at a great price with none of the bells and whistles of the more expensive models that are pointless features.</li>
            <li> This is great! Slim design makes it easy to fit in toothbrush cup. Charge lasts long enough that it doesn&#x27;t have to live on its charger. Teeth feel great!!! This is a huge improvement over my old Sonicare (that I stopped using).</li>
            <li> Had it for a few years, still going strong.</li>
            <li> Excellent job cleaning along the gums.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These were a replacement for my old electronic toothbrush and they work pretty well. They don&#x27;t vibrate as fast as I&#x27;d like but I&#x27;m not complaining, my teeth feel clean afterwards and it has a 30 second timer so that&#x27;s great as well.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I got the $200 Diamond Clean but this one does the same job for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a longtime Sonicare user, and this model suits me. I don&#x27;t need the fancy options. Works well, and holds a charge well. There is no better and easier way to keep your mouth clean and teeth healthy - no other electric toothbrush comes close to Sonicare technology.</li>
            <li> Sonic is the best. Replaced one I had for quite a while. My dentist recommends nothing but this brush.</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...it&#x27;s that simple!  They work great!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a really weak model but then I read the product info and saw there&#x27;s an easy start feature that gradually increases power over 14 uses. The people who complain about the soft brushing and immediately switch probably don&#x27;t know about this feature.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistle that I didn&#x27;t use anyway on my last one  I hope it lasts as long</li>
            <li> This is the second Sonicare I&#x27;ve gone through in 12 months.  Very frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;First one, assumed that it was because I was keeping it on the charger that ruined the battery.  Ate that mistake.  Bought another.&lt;br /&gt;Most recent one I only charged when it was low.  Died in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;I have TWO healthywhites that have been going for YEARS.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this toothbrush! I would brush too hard with a regular toothbrush. So, a friend recommended the Sonicare. I have definitely seen a change. My gums have stopped receeding, which is great! My teeth feel so clean after I use this product. I even bought it for my family&#x27;s white elephant Christmas present!</li>
            <li> Almost as good as a professional cleaning! Definitely happy with my purchase. This will surely cut down on my dental costs!</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean than my old one</li>
            <li> Great choice for a sonic electric toothbrush that cleans well and massages gums. It&#x27;s lightweight; easy to keep clean. Works well with the quad timer and holds it charge well. I leave it off the charger daily and put on the base at nights.  Cleans better than my previous Braun electric toothbrush.  I buy the extra toothbrushes from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Simple, basic does what it is supposed to without the other useless features and bulk, which makes it more affordable.</li>
            <li> The older toothbrushes had a lot of empty space in the inside and seams that would fill with water and goo and get moldy. This is much lighter, there are no areas for water to get into so it stays cleaner, and I also appreciate that the charger is smaller. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks on its first charge. My mouth also feels much cleaner with this new one than with older models of Sonicare toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love it. Thanks for the reviews before I purchased.</li>
            <li> Investing in your health is always a worthwhile venture. This actually makes me want to brush my teeth more often than the regular two times each day. I love the 30 second beeps that remind you to move to another part of your mouth to continue brushing. Your entire brush session is also timed to be 2 minutes flat so you neither waste time, nor spend too little time on your teeth. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist because I have brushed too hard over the years.  Does a great job. Dentist, hygenist, and myself all notice a difference - no longer causing major gum recession and little time in hygenist chair for cleanings. Second or third I have owned for several years now. Reason for this purchase / replacement - dropped prior one too many times on the hard floor; after last drop, no longer worked properly. Great product for those who have a tendency to over brush - prevents further receeding gum line while giving a healthy clean.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. My dentist also recommended using it. I purchased the replacement brush heads and plan to use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife and I needed a new electric toothbrush--our Braun was losing usable charge every other day.  After hours of research I settle on this model, and I&#x27;m elated (as much as one can be over a toothbrush) at my choice.  Li-ion battery promises a longer life with more time between charges.  31K vibrations/sec requires some getting used to after our Braun; it tickles the mouth (in the beginning--you get used to it) and emits a very fine mist from your mouth if its open.  My wife believes it does a better job than our Braun.  We didn&#x27;t have a top-of-the line Braun, but this is not a top-drawer Sonicare model either.  Just the charger (a little more weight would be helpful for stability while charging), the vibrating unit, and a toothbrush--bare bones, but all we need.  A great value.  I also bought the softer bristled brushes, having sensitive gums, and following the general advice of dentists and hygenists.</li>
            <li> Good quality works well the second one I owned</li>
            <li> you don&amp;#34;t need all the different speeds, this works great.  When you travel, seperate the brush from the base. Base connector is plastic and will not take alot of abuse.</li>
            <li> This is my second Sonicare - the first one lasted 5 years - and there seems to be a change for the worse in terms of quality control.  My second Sonicare started to not function properly just shy of the one year warranty and Philips was really great about sending a replacement body. The process was quick, easy, and efficient. Sadly, just a few months after receiving the replacement (which I assume was refurbished) it crapped out in the same way as the original.  The brushing &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; was greatly diminished and it made a loud noise.  I cleaned it as well as the charging stand thoroughly but to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;For $80 I expect the item to last longer than a year.  When it works, it&#x27;s a 5 star, but since the performance was so limited it gets an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; in my book.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with the Sonicare electric toothbrush.  The Sonicare was recommended by my dentist, and even he has noticed the difference in the cleaniness of my teeth and the appearance of my gums.</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old e-series brush recently died and we were looking for a replacement. Our biggest concern with the brush was the head assembly that would get gummy, moldy, and just plain gross. This brush solved that problem and more. It is slightly slimmer and the charging base seems much more sturdy. The new heads just slip over a metal bar and leaves no room for the disgusting gunk to get in there. Lasts about 2 weeks on a full charge and charges quick.</li>
            <li> Sonicare stopped working after 9 months and not exchangeable at Amazon. That makes brushing very expensive!</li>
            <li> I waited four or five months to review this product and will explain why in a moment. I upgraded from  Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush (copy and paste from order history) and was not too happy with that product. I won&#x27;t go into it too much but the head allows water inside which causes a grody sort of mildew capture area inside the brush. So, I upgraded to this one because the head seemed to be seated differently and was hoping to avoid that nasty problem altogether. The problem with THIS product--the reason for the review delay--was that the head didn&#x27;t fit quite fit flush to the handle so I worried about water getting inside. It didn&#x27;t. There is no opening for which water to escape into, so problem averted! Other than that, the handle is slimmer and more lightweight and seems to need to charge less often. I do not want to make this totally about comparing the two products, so I will say that I do love the slim handle on its own and it does a great job. I have healthy gums and clean, tartar-free/plaque-free teeth (according the my dentist, not just myself). I did not tell them I was using this, they just must think I am going nuts on my own and attacking those cavity creeps on my own. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, which does not deter from stars, is that it only stays on for two minutes. It&#x27;s okay, because you can simply push the button again, but I am not sure who is cleaning all their teeth and mouth in two minutes. Overall, great product. Does a great job. Pleased with the upgrade!</li>
            <li> As a replacement for a previous Sonicare, it has worked well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this hurt on so many levels. The vibrations were also tickling so bad I couldn&#x27;t get near my gums</li>
            <li> Great brush and I love how it automatically times itself for the right amount of recommended brushing time.  I am one who never feels like I get my teeth good enough, but the small-ish head gets back behind my back teeth better than my larger tooth brush did.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it should have a way to disable the timer that lets you know when to move to the next section.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush. I wish I had gone electric years ago. My teeth look and feel noticeably cleaner. I did research and went back and forth between various models. I thought the 30 second warning beep was silly but it turns out to be very helpful. Plus, it is more like a mute buzz then a loud beep. It helps to make your brushing more thorough. I thought two minutes was going to be a tediously long amount of time but it flies by and I usually want to go for longer. A couple of times I have even brushed twice because it just feels so good to have really clean teeth. I was also concerned when I read of people dripping water onto the base and shorting out the brush. With just a bit of attention that possibility can be totally avoided.</li>
            <li> Product is well made and is quiet compared to other Sonicare products. This is a key point because other ones are very loud. This one is a world apart in terms of noise control. Thank goodness. Ever since I started using one over 10 years ago I have never had a cavity and I consistently get problem free dental visits. Buying this product was a game changer for me. I only wish I had it when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> What can I say about Sonicare Electric Toothbrush?!?!  Priceless...</li>
            <li> Had an e-series sonicare that died about a week ago and I just couldn&#x27;t revert to manual brush. But I didn&#x27;t want to pay $100+ for a new brush either. I wanted a good vibration scrubbing brush. This easy clean is better than good. Love it. Slim. Light. Easy clean heads compared to the e-series. Timer to help keep you honest. I didn&#x27;t need the bells and whistles (ultraviolet, massage, etc). One note to make is that I opted to splurge on the diamond clean heads because I like dimension in my brush. Like the heads much better than the standard that comes with the easy clean. My husband agrees with me.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush around.</li>
            <li> We have used a Sonicare toothbrush since they came on the market--I worked in a dental office for years and saw the results!  This model is SO much easier to keep clean than the previous type with the \\&quot;gunk trapping\\&quot; brush base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Sonicare brushes for many years- I use them twice a day until the battery will no longer charge. I needed a second unit because I now travel for work, so I wanted one to keep packed in my suitcase. I would not consider purchasing a different brand. It just works to clean my teeth thoroughly, and really feels refreshing in the way it sort of massages the gums. You will not be disappointed with the purchase of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth were becoming loose and after a few weeks of using this toothbrush, almost all mobility is gone. I will never go back to regular brushing.</li>
            <li> I had a older sonic care which was bulky and use to collect paste between the brush head and base. Happy to see that both of it is fixed now. The brush is very slim but it continues to perform well like other soni care. Another good thing i like is the base and the charger have a firm connection ( small projection in the charger) so that it cannot fall off easily. Great price !!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older Sonicare model for about 3 years and when I saw the good price on this one, bought it. I really like the thinner handle. Its much easier to hold. And the heads are easier to replace. My old Sonicare didn&#x27;t have the 30-second beep as a cue to move to the next area to brush. It is a really nice feature.</li>
            <li> I like this one the best. The price is right and it has the snap on head not the screw on one. I had one that screwed on and it needed to be removed and cleaned out at least once a week. They collect moisture and toothpaste. I prefer the snap on heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t have the different settings like the higher end models, but those features are not worth the extra $40, in my opinion. My girlfriend has one. All that is really added is a quick clean mode (it just turns of at 1 min instead of 2 min, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate harder) and a pulse mode, which I don&#x27;t really get the point of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried a sonicare you should. I love mine.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush was recommended by my dentist.  The product seems to be good quality, but I can&#x27;t seem to get used to the vibration against my teeth.  Also, the first time I used it, toothpaste went everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  It cleans and works great.  It is small and takes up very little room.  It holds a charge for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Nice, simple electric toothbrush at a good price. Works well. I had the fancier version before but found that I never used all the different settings, so this toothbrush is quite adequate for my needs. Be aware that if you use too much force on the brush head, you will eventually bend the metal spindle holding the brush head to the base (and motor). This happened to my last one after about 18 months and rendered it inoperable.</li>
            <li> I use to brush my teeth once a day in the shower manually. But after buying this electric toothbrush,,,,,, I now brush twice a day and my teeth and gums feel so much better. It has changed me that much. My teeth and gums feel sooooo much cleaner. Wow,,,,,, i just love this brush. lol Now,,,,, it did take me a few days to get use to using it, but now , I can&#x27;t go without it. So glad I bought this.... :)</li>
            <li> Love that clean feeling after using Sonicare!</li>
            <li> This item broke within a year, while trying to put in a new brush.  I&#x27;ve ordered another (at great expense) because it keeps my teeth clean, but if I have to order one a year, it will get pricey.</li>
            <li> Wish it had come with a round brush.</li>
            <li> Just had my first dental cleaning since using this tooth brush. Teeth were very clean and did not require hardly any scraping. One of my favorite features is the timer that signals every 30 seconds. I feel like this feature really helps me make sure I am getting all areas thoroughly. I&#x27;m an glad I invested in this tooth brush. I had only used manual tooth brushes up until now.</li>
            <li> I like the 30 second warning and effeciency of brush; just wish the brush head was round as I was used to. Thank you</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to and the directions weren&#x27;t really clear on the washer and brush assembly to the power head.  It works great for brushing my teeth and seems to be doing a much better job for tooth brushing than the conventional tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It was a different design from my previous one, is curved and has no washers separating the pieces.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still liking it a lot though, just not loving it the same.</li>
            <li> I think my problem is that I don&#x27;t like electric toothbrushes, however I am persisting because I think it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Continuing a couple of months later....&lt;br /&gt;Now I am used to the toothbrush I really like it. The timer works very well ensuring every quadrant is brushed equally</li>
            <li> I was shopping for an electric toothbrush because my dentist recommended I try one.  My dentist even said don&#x27;t get an expensive one, any one will do.  So far it does leave a clean feeling in my mouth, but I really can&#x27;t say it cleans better until I have my next check-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer works as marketed, but I find it&#x27;s to short.  I apparently brush longer than 2 minute naturally.  It&#x27;s a neat feature, but not needed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 because it feels like it&#x27;s working.  I would give it 5/5 if I had proof my teeth are being cleaned better.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because the last one was a Sonicare and it worked very well. Also the battery lasted a very long time. ..</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush with the new slimmer, lighter design, and smaller charger. I have been using them for many years and this is my 3rd. I read many bad reviews but they must have gotten defective ones as I have never had a single problem with any of mine. My check-ups have improved and it helps with plaque and gums as one gets older.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  Cleanest my teeth have ever been, and I&#x27;ve used good quality electric toothbrushes before.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is better than the original that lasted many many years. I can feel&lt;br /&gt;the difference after each brushing, and my hygenist can measure it. I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;want all the bells and whistles, so this one filled the bill. Very pleased,&lt;br /&gt;but I will miss stripping the high power magnets from the old head.</li>
            <li> The best electronic toothbrush I&#x27;ve had......once I got used to the intense vibrations.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. This is a replacement for another Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel after using this!</li>
            <li> Got one for me and one for my husband. We couldn&#x27;t be happier! We both wish we would have bought these long ago instead of the cheap ones from the drug store. These are so quiet and just make my teeth feel amazing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful price and fast shipping. I brought this for my daughter, it was suggested to me by her dentist. My daughter loves it ans says she has never had cleaner teeth even after a cleaning from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I replaced her older sonicare model (heavy, bulky) by this uniy and she loves this new model.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job in cleaning teeth and guns..</li>
            <li> This toothbrush sucks. I bought it to replace the cheap Essence model I had, as the mold and such that was growing in between the handle and the brush head was grossing me out. Although I like the design of the Easy Clean, the battery power is incredibly weak vs. the Essence. I charged it for 24 hours and turned off the Easy-start feature to no avail. I feel I would either have to use it for 6 minutes or actually scrub in order to get my teeth clean. I returned it and spent $10 extra for Healthy White. Buy nice or buy twice.</li>
            <li> She loves this brush. Only had to charge one time in 3 months with 3 times a day use. Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast durable long lasting toothbrush, I love it, best purchase of my year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;New user mode (not so fast and rough)&lt;br /&gt;Great clean dentist feeling&lt;br /&gt;Tells u when to move to the next section of your teeth&lt;br /&gt;Fast charge that lasts now 2 weeks of 2x brushing per day&lt;br /&gt;Sanitary cap is a nice addition&lt;br /&gt;Long manufacturers warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NONE!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush at the recommendation of my dental hygienist when after measuring the pockets in my teeth found that I had several 4&#x27;s; not good as I was told that numbers 1-3 are ideal.  Anyhow, I was upset at myself when she told me that I wasn&#x27;t brushing my back teeth correctly and if the numbers went up I could be looking at periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very moment I left the dental office I drove to Target and purchased this toothbrush.  I really liked the fact that it pings after 30 seconds so you know to move on to the next quadrant of my mouth, for a full 2 minutes.  I used it every morning (obviously) and every night after flossing every day without fail for the following 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to my next visit to see if it made a difference and boy did it ever!  I got a lot of 1&#x27;s, 2&#x27;s and a few 3&#x27;s and no 4&#x27;s.  My hygienist told the dentist when he came in for the final checkup that she noted serious improvements and I even got a pat on my shoulder by my seriously handsome dentist.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I went back again last week for my next 6 month appointment (I&#x27;ve had toothbrush for one year now) and again I got very good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  The only thing I note is that while it says to replace the brush head every three months, I have to replace mine every two months becasue if I leave them on longer, they start to cut up my gums.  I mentioned this to the dentist and he did say that I may be brushing too hard and if the bristles aren&#x27;t tight enough they will act like razors and cut the gums.... easy fix.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used !</li>
            <li> ...in the Sonicare collection, this one works as well as more expensive models while being free of useless features. It clean white design also looks better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide if this toothbrush is a girl or a boy.&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that I shouldn&#x27;t try to define it with such heteronormative binaries.&lt;br /&gt;Patriarchy is so destructive, even for inanimate objects.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this brush has really opened me up to the beauty and diversity of this crazy, mixed up world we live in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this brush really made my teeth white!&lt;br /&gt;Because white is the best.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable using it and my teeth feel very well cleaned. I like the lightweight handle and easy clean feature..</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, is easy to use and well made. Well worth the cost and really makes reloading quick and easy.</li>
            <li> You are making a huge mistake if you don&#x27;t use sonicare!  My husband was constantly having interventions ( even horribly unpleasant surgery) for his gums....within  a few monts of sonicare use, all problems ceased!  I even travel with mine because I can&#x27;t stand the way my teeth feel if I don&#x27;t use it!  Get loads of kudos for my healthy gums and teeth!  I do buy some knockoff brush heads as they get expensive and it&#x27;s important to change every 3 months or sooner.  I think one brushes longer and more effectively as you can walk around the house with the danged thing buzzing away!  I also purchased a product they developed called Clarisonic and my skin is now amazing!</li>
            <li> Makes my teef and mouth reall clean and fresh. It has the nice 2 min timer letting you know it is time to stop brushing.</li>
            <li> Works well, really like the timer feature</li>
            <li> I have a Philips sonicare and it works so well that when my brother was getting some dental work I suggested he get this one. After a week my brother says he loves the Sonicare and his teeth feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Always great and much better than a manual tooth brush</li>
            <li> Easy Clean is my favorite, it is the best one of the many I have owned.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Recommended by my dentist. Much better than my old Oral-B.</li>
            <li> So much better than my old fat Sonicare.  This is nice and thin, feels good in the hand, doesn&#x27;t get all goopy and nasty under the brush stem like the older model.  Smaller charge base.  This is by far the best electric brush I have had in 20 years.  Lets just hope the cost of replacement brushes don&#x27;t make me want to pull my teeth out.  With such a simple design, you would think someone could make a cheap, generic brush replacement????</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cleaning and in the spirit of full-disclosure, this is my second Sonicare.  My first one was a bulkier Essence model and the battery finally wouldn&#x27;t retain much of a charge after several years.  I think these Sonicares are overpriced but I&#x27;m not motivated enough to change yet.  Maybe next time around if prices don&#x27;t drop, maybe not.  I would definitely not recommend going for the higher-end models unless you&#x27;re convinced the added features will be of real value to you over time.  This one is compact, accepts the high-end diamond head brushes, has the two-minute timer, and gets the same job done as all Sonicares based on my experience and research.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t collect as much gunk as older sonicare or oral b toothbrushes. Keeps a charge MUCH longer than an oral b.</li>
            <li> I had the old Phillips Sonicare brush (that I&#x27;ve used for almost 10 years).  It did work great and I loved it...except it would get nasty where the head connected to the wand. This design with the new head is much better!  It&#x27;s skinnier, a better charging base, overall better design.  All the great features you need. Don&#x27;t spend $$ on more expensive versions of basically this same toothbrush.  This is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s doing so much more for my teeth than manually brushing. I can get pay back to my molars and clean them really well. I&#x27;ll probably end up getting this for others as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> I really like this slimmer model . It is very nice to use because of being slimmer and also having the 30 second timer that tells you to brush the section of your teeth ! I have owned a  Sonicare for years and I feel there is no other electric tooth brush that can do a good job on an ex-cigar smoker&#x27;s teeth ! Give it a try and I believe you will love it , too !!!</li>
            <li> Good while it lasted, but do keep your receipt even after eight months or so because these are prone to stop working and they won&#x27;t give you anything without a receipt.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, reliable, practical, and it is quite effective. I am definitely happy with this toothbrush and i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usefull.i like it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a standard rechargeable electric toothbrush. This surpassed my expectations. I like the 30 second sounds to indicate changing your brushing area.</li>
            <li> A big improvement over the previous model I had.  Stays charged for a very long time.  Easy to tell by the light on the handle when it&#x27;s charged and when it needs to be charged.  Definitely recommend.  Price was about $30 less than in the store</li>
            <li> Wonderful electric toothbrush.  I love Sonicare!  Recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Love this product - my dentist told me to get an electric toothbrush, and he specifically recommended Sonicare. I am so happy with how my teeth feel after using it, and love how easy it is to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this newer version of the sonic toothbrush. I&#x27;m so glad they where able to make the brush head without the magnets. It makes it so much easier to keep clean, since I&#x27;m one of those people who gets a new brush head very six months.</li>
            <li> I like it, it seems to work well. Although sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t do much, and I do two cycles but maybe I was pressing to hard on my teeth with my manual toothbrush before? Great if you have braces also. Btw it works completely through vibrations, so there is no rotation of the bristles or head of toothbrush, but it is detachable and they have different styles you can use. This one comes with two.</li>
            <li> Much much better. My other Sonicare was the Advanced with the screw on top head, it would get gunky on the inside and bog down because of that. With this one, there&#x27;s no place inside for water to go. Snaps on and you&#x27;re good. I&#x27;m a weird one that loves to brush her teeth and go to the dentist. I&#x27;m 39 and I&#x27;ve never had a cavity. Part obsession, part Sonicare toothbrush to thank!</li>
            <li> My wife and I love these sonic toothbrushes.  There is a learning curve to using this item because the vibrations can be a little aggressive, but once you&#x27;ve got it down there is no going back to a standard toothbrush.  Our teeth feel SO much cleaner now.  I still use a regular toothbrush at work and I just don&#x27;t feel like it gets my teeth clean anymore after having used this toothbrush. The battery lasts an incredibly long time; over a week between charges.</li>
            <li> I love ,y toothbrush...Still working and I have had no problem with it...</li>
            <li> The Sonicare works better than my last electric tooth brush which was an Oral-B. I have only had this brush for about a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I liked my old soniccare but this new model I Evan better.</li>
            <li> Hand brush is better.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Wish it didn&#x27;t pause while working.</li>
            <li> Design flaw? I&#x27;ve had three of these electric toothbrushes in about 4 years and all have failed. The metal shaft becomes loose inside the body, it gets gradually louder as the vibrating action decreases. After a few months, lots of noise and not a lot of action. Philips replaced two of them under warranty but refused to do it a third time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not abusing this product, don&#x27;t press too hard, and have been very careful with this third unit. I have to believe this is a design flaw, that it&#x27;s known and understood by Philips, and they were just waiting out my sequential warranty period(s) to cut their losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another Sonicare and will switch to the Braun brand--which my wife has had for nearly 10 years with the same battery and no problems!</li>
            <li> I want a Japanese Gaza 🎎</li>
            <li> Teeth never felt so clean...hell it makes going to the dentist a snap.</li>
            <li> great product. timely delivery</li>
            <li> I gave up my electric toothbrush in the divorce.  Yes it was an item of interest to both parties.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on the top of the line that had all the different speeds, so I settled for this one.  It works just as well as the top of the line, just less bells and whistles.  I would forego the more expensive one - this one works great.  The head is small enough for my mouth which has been an issue and it seems to be softer bristles.  It works just as good as the other one!  2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> More than a year later of using this product, I am very satisfied with this product. The battery lasts more than two weeks on a charge and its motor is as strong as ever. Remember to change the brushes when they wear out!</li>
            <li> I used a regular hand toothbrush till my dentist recommended this. Now my teeth feel like they have been cleaned by the hygienist everyday.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for cleaning teeth and improving gums health</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare does a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Wondering where this  product has been all my life.  Does a fantastic job of cleaning your teeth.  Lightweight. The battery holds its charge for a very long time. Would highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> This Sonic brush was actually a replacement for one my husband wore out after a minimum of 10 years!  My husband prefers the Sonic brush over other toothbrushes because he feels it cleans better.  He uses it faithfully every day and is very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare Easy Clean is very basic but does a perfect job at making your teeth feel clean and look pearly white. I like to have it brush my teeth for me! I bought the Easy Clean after reading many helpful Amazon reviews. It does have the extra feature of the Quadpacer that I really like. At 30, 60, and 90 seconds, you hear a short beep and pause and you know to move to another section of your mouth. There is no travel case but I did not need one. One person commented the brush head was slim and compact compared to the Essence model. At the time, I got a good buy on extra brush heads. The only drawback to the Sonicare is the pricey brush heads. You might want to check around for good buys on this. I think Pro Results standard brush heads fit the Easy Clean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, a replacement of my Essence series, for about 2 weeks and so far I really like it!  It&#x27;s more compact style and much easier to keep clean design makes it more of a pleasure than chore to do my teeth.  I am using the normal head, though my set came with a diamond head as well.  My teeth feel nice and clean, and I find that instead of switching every other day between regular brush and sonicare, I want to use my sonicare every day. I also like the 14 day step up process. Since I have really sensitive gums, this has helped me to adapt to the new brush.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I use a Waterpik brand flosser at night- the two are making a great team so far and although I NEVER look forward to my dental cleanings, I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic that my mouth will look and feel significantly better at my next appointment!</li>
            <li> I had been using a spin brush, and my dentist recommended that I try the Sonicare.  I absolutely love it.  My teeth feel so much cleaner.  I have recommended it to several friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding new brush heads for my old Sonicare toothbrush.  They sell a new model that has an almost identical brush head that is slightly modified so they don&#x27;t fit old sonicare models (Hooray for you big business!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to my old Sonicare, this is a sIight improvement. I think this brush is a little quiter.  The brush head is modified, allowing better access to hard to reach areas.  I like the feel of the new handle (fits in my hand a little better).  Not sure of it&#x27;s longevity yet.  When you get done brushing with this brush, your teeth will be fresh from the dentist clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not happy I had to buy a new model, but I am happy with the new model.  I haven&#x27;t tried an Oral-B, so I can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I brushed twice a day for years. Now, within 3 days of buying this, my teeth are whiter than they have been in a decade. I enjoy the sensation of the brushing much more and now I LOVE brushing. Before (manually) it felt like a chore. Be sure to buy a 3-pack of the softer heads along with your order. They are superior.</li>
            <li> Made a significant difference since I switched from manual tooth brushing. Was able to use it on a 10 day vacation without charging it either. Be sure to make sure toothpaste doesn&#x27;t accumulate where the head connects to the body of the brush. I try to clean it after use and it only takes a few extra seconds.</li>
            <li> it did not work when I opened the package. Had to call  Philips and they sent me a new toothbrush .</li>
            <li> Works great, can buy replacement heads of various types and firmness right here on amazon. Unfortunately there is no standardization from the manufacturing company so you have to get into the details to make sure which alternative brush heads will work on this unit. This is a product manufacturers fault not amazons description fault. As far as brushing teeth go still an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product years ago and I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since.  My cleanings are a breeze.  This model has a smaller brush head which is easier to keep clean than the older model with the larger base at brush head attachment.  I recommend this great toothbrush for everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these toothbrushes for years and love it. Makes the teeth-cleaning process at the dentist a lot less painful and lengthy. My husband had not gone to the dentist for a couple of years and had to have two cleaning appointments to get all of the plaque off his teeth. This is a guy who doesn&#x27;t have any cavities and still doesn&#x27;t (I know...life&#x27;s not fair!). After that painful experience, he bought this toothbrush and loves it. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s curious to see how his next cleaning will be. I know it will be better because of my experience. I highly recommend this product. One note...it seems like you don&#x27;t have to use as much toothpaste to get lots of bubbles. I LOVE bubbles!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Philips Sonicare products over the years and am as satisfied with this toothbrush as the previous ones. May like it even better than my last model!</li>
            <li> First the good news. This is a great little toothbrush. The battery last forever. And to get your teeth nice and clean. Now the bad news. This thing must have a quarter horsepower motor! I think it is disintegrating my gums! If you do get it be be careful and don&#x27;t push it too hard against your gums. Seriously, it could cause real harm if you do other then put it lightly against your teeth.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a replacement for an earlier model which lasted 10 years.  So far I love it!</li>
            <li> Just like the other ones I have purchased in the past. Unfortunately, the company has not resolved the space between the brush head and the battery operated unit part which collects toothpaste and run-off. The battery seems to die on the unit after about 1 1/2 - 2 years. It does it job so I keep purchasing new ones.</li>
            <li> POS stopped working in less than 12 months under normal use.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a top of the line model I had for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am glad I got it.  Didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles the other&lt;br /&gt;model had and saved some money getting this one.&lt;br /&gt;The only tooth brush I will use!</li>
            <li> I chose whis item and when I charge it over night, the battery dies out very quickly. That&#x27;s the only problem.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting use to, but it has done an amazing cleaning job on my teeth. They look so much whiter and brighter. The teeth feel so clean. I would highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I buy this earlier? Charge lasts a long time, super streamlined, easy to clean unlike my last model, and does a really good job getting my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My gums are already pinker. I had never used a sonicaire before. It takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare tooth brushes for years and this model works great it is light weight and cleans good and clean up is easy as the brush head does not get any paste in the brush connection to the main body.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! No complaints whatsoever except when it comes to the longevity of this product. Worked flawlessly until one morning when it would just not turn on. It was less than a year old. Such a shame since it was so good for my dental health but I will be returning to a regular toothbrush because of this paperweight.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this toothbrush is great for your teeth and gums, I couldn&#x27;t use it for more than twenty seconds.  It tickles and buzzes so much, it was almost painful.  This is not a normal electric toothbrush that just cleans better.  It has a deep vibration that drove my gums and lips insane.  I gave it to my boyfriend to use as a travel brush.  He has the Sonicare Diamond and loves it.  The buzzing doesn&#x27;t bother him at all and his gums are already much healthier after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and I like the timer.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see what my dental hygienist says the next time I go in for a cleaning!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013 and it arrived well packed on 5/28/2013. This was also during a holiday weekend. I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor. I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable. I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand. (Conair Interplak). The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom. I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item. I also combined my order by purchasing 3 additional brush heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v used several different styles on Sonicare and it is simply the best toothbrush you can buy.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand, regardless of price.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfies with the job that my toothbrush does (just like this one) and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> My dentist has less and less to do since I&#x27;ve been using a Phillips sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s his own fault - he recommended it to me!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product. It did a very good job when it worked, but with a two year warranty, it should not have stopped in less than a year. Philips&#x27; customer service policy leaves a lot to be desired. Shipping is 7 to 10 business days, which we all know means at least two weeks. I had to speak with a supervisor because they were only going to send the handle, not the handle and charging base. They nor I have any idea whether it is the handle or base or both. I was told if the replacement handle wasn&#x27;t the problem to call them back and they would send a charging base. When I explained that would take a month in shipping time, I was told that was their policy. The supervisor did finally agree to send both the handle and charging base. I asked why shipping time was so long when Amazon could have a new one to me in two days, and was told that was how Philips worked. Well, after I hung up, I placed an order for an Oral-B with Amazon and it will be here in two days. Had the Oral-B before and I was very happy with it. When it died, I thought I would try a Sonicare. Not a very good decision on my part.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, but does the job. It is easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t take space, I like this slim design, it looks cool.</li>
            <li> Will change the way you look at brushing your teeth. Truly a great investment and my teeth are whiter because of it.</li>
