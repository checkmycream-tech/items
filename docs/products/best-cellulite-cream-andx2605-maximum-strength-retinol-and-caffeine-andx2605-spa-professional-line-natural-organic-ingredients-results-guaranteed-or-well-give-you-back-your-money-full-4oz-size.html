            <li>I was so happy, that I ordered their new Seaweed Mask with retinol, and feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the best combo for smoothing out and eliminating cellulite once and for all.  </li>
            <li>After a full months use, I can honestly say it does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have it!</li>
            <li>I recently ordered YouTurn&#x27;s cellulite cream (ordered on the 25th of September and received it in the mail on the 30th of September) and  consider a five-day turnaround very good service.</li>
            <li>It really feels pretty good going and absorbed great.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and experienced no adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture of the skin is also more even and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have had great experience from this product so far.</li>
            <li>Good product, saw result in neck area, not so much in hip/buttocks area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistency was somewhere between lotion and body butter, leaning toward lotion, which made it very easy to apply quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Excited :)))</li>
            <li>It was easy to put on a pair of jeans after applying it.</li>
            <li>great stuff, I will definitely order more</li>
            <li>scent was very mild.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly and I tried it almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily or sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and buy more for myself and others (great gift...;-0)</li>
            <li>It was very consistent, smooth, and very easy to apply for me.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to purchase and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I think if the company improved the over-all smell of this product it would be 5 start worthy!</li>
            <li>It really world, and there are way too many products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>This cream is mild which is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and absorbed into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I did receive this free for my review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li>The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It may be smoothly my skin.</li>
            <li>It would be great if it helped the cellulite actually go away, too.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>So smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>But this did seem to smooth the appearance of the cellulite in my backside.  </li>
            <li>water is important for flushing out toxins and keeping your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>, it went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It feels really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>Light and not sticky</li>
            <li>I like how smooth it is</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>As I said with the roller, so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Is a good product so far I used it with a wrap</li>
            <li>i am very impressed with the quantity and quality of this product for such a decent price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no scent, leaves your skin smooth (not sticky) after application, rubs in easily, and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>so the results I&#x27;ve seen aren&#x27;t huge but there is a difference, which I&#x27;m so excited about</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, its not too runny like I find alot of cellulite creams to be, it also has a decent scent to it.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on easily and soaks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the quick results.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this cream when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Friendly and helpful customer service.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Really absorbed well into my skin!</li>
            <li>The product has a mild, and pleasant scent, is a white color, and has a wide-mouthed jar, so you can get your hand into the product easily.</li>
            <li>This product is great and easy to use with or without other treatments.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference the 3rd time I used it, so it would probably deliver faster results if I had used it more often, honestly.</li>
            <li>The cream itself glides on smoothly, dries quickly and makes your skin feel silky to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product goes on clean - not greasy, not smelly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny to me, that even with all of my diet and exercise, this has been what has kind of put me over the edge as far as looking better.  </li>
            <li>I had more faith in myself to follow the directions, I would certainly try it again.</li>
            <li>I fully understand that to give the product a fair shot, it should have been applied twice daily, as directed.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this cream, so far the results are nice.</li>
            <li>After receiving the product that was very well packaged, I have used a couple times and I am already pleased.</li>
            <li>It may be to soon to have a full appreciation of its effect</li>
            <li>However, I wanted to give it a fair shot instead of writing about it after only two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this cream.</li>
            <li>No nasty smell, and the results are fast.</li>
            <li>The cream has a nice thick consistency and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The container is very attractive, although I cannot read the small print without my reading glasses!</li>
            <li>The cream is a very silky and smooth in texture, which glides on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has the slightest scent, which is fine with me, because I really don&#x27;t think there are any benefits to rubbing perfume on cellulite!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh and clean smell with no overpowering scents.  </li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly, leaving no greasy residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>Super creamy.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels silky soft and smooth, and the cottage cheese dimples seem to be melting away like magic.  </li>
            <li>Arrived super quickly.</li>
            <li>While this absorbs quickly, I still wrapped it for the recommended 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really love this cream, and highly recommend that you buy it and try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>And, I was very interested in the reviews.</li>
            <li>I received the product very fast, and have begun to use it, so we&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope that you get the same amazing results that I have experienced, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, simply return it for your money back.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, not greasy and absorbs fast into the skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I just love how soft my skin feels!  </li>
            <li>I really like that the cream goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>My skin on legs after twice using is very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This product shipped right away and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for creating such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and am already happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my skin, it&#x27;s soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>and thought its worth try</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if fighting cellulite is your goal</li>
            <li>I even wore shorts to a party last weekend and had my legs complimented by a good friend who knows me very well.</li>
            <li>worth noting:</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very pleased to say that THIS IS THE FIRST cellulite cream I have use that I CAN FINALLY SEE AND FEEL THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li>So far, I have been really pleased.</li>
            <li>And then there&#x27;s the fun part.  </li>
            <li>but so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I even wore shorts to a party last weekend and had my legs complimented by a good friend who knows me very well.</li>
            <li>, ingredients don&#x27;t sound too appealing, will review back if will see any results</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very positive results within 2 weeks time.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this one a try -- the price was right</li>
            <li>It soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li>can put your clothes on right after.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered it, directions followed, explaining that one must workout, eat right,</li>
            <li>You notice the smoothing effects right away.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and left my thighs feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my skin is remarkably smoother where i used the cream but have not yet noticed any firming results (have been using for a few days).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say I have only been using a little over a week</li>
            <li>This cream is nice and thick, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Im giving this cream four stars simply because it smells good and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The 4 ounce container and its mailing package fit easily inside my mailbox, saving me hassles or worry with a package needing to be picked up by a certain time or a package sitting outside my door waiting for me to come home.  </li>
            <li>I found the cream has a very gentle, soothing scent.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not an instant results kind of thing, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Light non greasy formula leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This is surely an item I will need to post a follow-up review on later on.</li>
            <li>Anyways, when I first put it on, I felt tingling.</li>
            <li>Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy another once this pot runs out!</li>
            <li>It did seem to work a tiny bit better than the wrap by itself.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, you have to be willing to put in work yourself.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!!</li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth; not oily, not greasy, and not staining.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li>You have to use it twice a day and rub it in pretty vigorously</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>Most people dont see them, but of course i do which makes me self-consious especially during swim suit moments.</li>
            <li>I used this product EXACTLY as instructed- rub vigorously twice a day, until I ran out.</li>
            <li>I am confident that if used regularly for a longer than 5 days it will work!</li>
            <li>And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use until I have used the whole container and plan to post pics right before my wedding.</li>
            <li>I actually see a difference in my thighs, my jeans fit better and my husband and even some family members said I look different (although they couldn&#x27;t put their finger on what it was!)  </li>
            <li>In terms of if it&#x27;s really working good, I&#x27;ll update the review after few weeks!</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this cream again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>After a few more weeks of using it, the appearance of my cellulite is mildly reduced.</li>
            <li>My skin feels a lot better as it has been very dry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with cellulite, although I do have some on my calves and upper thighs.</li>
            <li>It left a smooth skin after usibg.</li>
            <li>so I thought this might really work.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep trying until I finish the whole thing</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but thats tooo much time.  </li>
            <li>,it does not work as it advertise also very stinky.</li>
            <li>Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too</li>
            <li>I actually like the light smell it has too.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too</li>
            <li>I used the cream for two weeks straight</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>A product that really works for me.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>I am really just giving this product the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt smooth and toned after I applied.  </li>
            <li>I literally wrap myself up like a mummy with saran wrap, and go relax for about an hour to really let the cream do</li>
            <li>Thanks Stuart</li>
            <li>and I really do see a difference.</li>
            <li>Get ready summer body here</li>
            <li>Used it and didn&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very looking forward to the result</li>
            <li>Once she finishes the whole cream will update my review.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Really found this cream to work.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It is a waste of money when in fact, this is just a nice skin lotion.  </li>
            <li>It could at least have a good scent added to it instead of what it smells like.</li>
            <li>My package arrived even sooner than expected, and I really appreciated that it was sealed with plastic for a safe shipment.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle scent that is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and without not necessary components.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight difference and so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am fairly skinny but as I was getting older and from my younger years of fluctuating in weight I had cellulite on the back of my thighs and this cream has been helping it disappear, so far, the skin looks firmer and not as noticeable indentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At a fraction of other cellulite creams available, this cream is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This cream is high quality and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new to cellulite treatments.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;you turn&amp;#34; products are natural and really works for me!</li>
            <li>I was worried at first, I&#x27;ve heard of people having issues with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>most cellulite treatment is extremely over priced, smelly and does not work, i recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year.</li>
            <li>Even after just a week of using it, my skin&#x27;s texture is softer and more supple, and the cellulite is slightly less noticeable; I look forward to updating my review after continued use.    </li>
            <li>Have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have noticed more firmness and less cottage cheese look.</li>
            <li>Obviously I like this enough to buy it again :)</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly after I put them on (actually I have put on several stabs of it on the same place since I don&#x27;t think I can follow the instructions to apply the cream twice a day) and it does not leave a greasy feeling like most body lotions do.</li>
            <li>im hopong with some more time ill notice more.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li>I mainly used this cream on my thighs.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly, and manages to provide complete coverage of the areas I wanted to target on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>and I may have more to say after I use the entire jar to see what total effects I received from it.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin very soft though, which i really like.</li>
            <li>(I know it&#x27;s there, and I&#x27;m sensitive to it), but it&#x27;s much better than before when I could easily see it without trying very hard.  </li>
            <li>It is larger than your normal face cream but smaller than most body creams on the market.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very light, unlike some cellulite creams that are are really heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks since my initial review, and my recent new cellulite zone is looking much better.  </li>
            <li>I like that the container doesn&#x27;t have too much printed info on the outside cluttering it up, and it&#x27;s easy to hold, open, and access the cream.  </li>
            <li>cellulite cream, unlike the far more expensive Lancome, is delightfully smooth and just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like about this product is that is absorbs quickly into my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for it to dry before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is very close to greek yogurt and very much like the Clarins body shaping cream that I am using before I got this.</li>
            <li>Do not irritate my sensitive skin with I really like.</li>
            <li>My cellulite cream arrived the day it was suppose to and was very well packaged in a small box with plastic packaging materials to keep the product safe.</li>
            <li>The cream has a very faint and pretty smell, better than most lotions I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more firm and almost feels like I just got out of the shower after every application.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream and after using it a few times, I have seen an improvement on my cellulite.</li>
            <li>The only downside has been though it is quick to tighten skin, it is also quick to dry out skin, so I have to moisturize my hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>it is not a 100% fix, diet and exercise is the definite way to go, but this is a push in the right direction.</li>
            <li>I really like the soft skin this product gives you... can tell there is firming action as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really do enjoy this product and in this past week it really has worked!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now on a zone with some newly developed cellulite after some recent weight loss, but also plan to use it on other more damaged older zones later.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure it would after reading other peoples reviews and how it worked for them!!!</li>
            <li>It also goes a long way, so it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Although, I think if you combine this with a healthy diet and regular exercise, you will definitely notice results; only because that is what I am doing and I have seen results.</li>
            <li>(I did only one leg first</li>
            <li>The first time I spent way too much money on a Lancome product that was far too perfumed and runny.</li>
            <li>It is certainly not up to aromatic standards yet not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I noticed a slight change but it was about as what was expected as I believe healthy lifestyle changes of food and exercise is really what makes the difference.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and to me smells a little summery.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and to me smells a little summery.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my thighs, my skin feels a little tighter and my thighs look smooth.  </li>
            <li>wow i have been using this cellulite treatment for a few months now and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Having been a professional photographic model and actress, I have always valued products that will naturally enhance my sensitive skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 41 years old, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; tall and 155 lbs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell especially since you have to vigorously rub</li>
            <li>The cream reminds of old people.</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised how well this cream works.</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised how well this cream works.</li>
            <li>After applying a liberal amount to the skin, I wrapped my legs in saran wrap and just let the cream completely sink in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my stomach area and hips, the cream did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see some real improvement on my upper thighs in a month.</li>
            <li>Figured it would take a while to see complete results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to keep an eye on it, but so far, I like this cream</li>
            <li>For me, brushing helps to further stimulate the circulation in my target areas which really seem to make it work deeper into the problem zones.  </li>
            <li>I still have not gotten the  results the two young ladies on Dr. Oz&#x27;s shown within two weeks.</li>
            <li>cellulite completely.</li>
            <li>so far, I can&#x27;t wait to see results</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to give it at least three weeks :)</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say any thing at this time but after use my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>As far as reducing the cellulite appearance..haven&#x27;t seen a change at all.</li>
            <li>I have a soon to be 6 year old daughter who i love deeply, however, her 9 months inside my body gave my belly a few tiny stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>The product is not thick enough to combine w/  Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and more firm than prior to adding this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I will provide a review on my results in a few weeks and then again in the full time frame specified.</li>
            <li>I just started a new diet about one month ago and have lost about 10 pounds, my problem, however, has always been the cellulite on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li>As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li>I finally feel like I really can turn back the hands of time.  </li>
            <li>Although a thin cream, it absorbed quickly and kept dry skin mainly at bay.</li>
            <li>This is my very first attempt with any type of cellulite cream, and I&#x27;ll return with a progress update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it does not smell great either.</li>
            <li>I have used the product twice, so I cannot comment on long-term effectiveness, but so far it gets a big thumbs up, or should I say leg!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, like the directions say to</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it well with no reaction to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Skin feels tighter and smother and soft and i just use it every other day and did not wrap my skin highly recommended</li>
            <li>I neither found it pleasant, nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the older trouble zones, but they look different now.  </li>
            <li>No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice enough, and the scent is faint but not overpowering or too chemical.</li>
            <li>So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li>So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li>My results after just one jar have definitely been apparent.  </li>
            <li>This cream seemed to help with it a little, nothing drastically changed but It made my skin feel nice and soft and seemed to firm my skin up a little.</li>
            <li>Hey, anyone who is over a certain age is going to benefit from a cream that helps firm the skin.</li>
            <li>Personally i dont have a real issue with cellulite but notice a little on my thighs here and there.</li>
            <li>I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym.</li>
            <li>I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym.</li>
            <li>I live an active lifestyle and exercise 5 times per week, but still have unsightly cellulite around my thigh area.</li>

            <li> After a full months use, I can honestly say it does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have it!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered YouTurn&#x27;s cellulite cream (ordered on the 25th of September and received it in the mail on the 30th of September) and  consider a five-day turnaround very good service.</li>

            <li> I have had great experience from this product so far.</li>
            <li> Good product, saw result in neck area, not so much in hip/buttocks area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistency was somewhere between lotion and body butter, leaning toward lotion, which made it very easy to apply quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Excited :)))</li>
            <li> It was easy to put on a pair of jeans after applying it.</li>
            <li> great stuff, I will definitely order more</li>

            <li> The product arrived very quickly and I tried it almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and buy more for myself and others (great gift...;-0)</li>
            <li> It was very consistent, smooth, and very easy to apply for me.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to purchase and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I think if the company improved the over-all smell of this product it would be 5 start worthy!</li>
            <li> It really world, and there are way too many products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This cream is mild which is great for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and absorbed into my skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I did receive this free for my review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great deal.</li>
            <li> The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> It may be smoothly my skin.</li>
            <li> It would be great if it helped the cellulite actually go away, too.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> So smooth, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> But this did seem to smooth the appearance of the cellulite in my backside.  </li>
            <li> water is important for flushing out toxins and keeping your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> , it went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It feels really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> Light and not sticky</li>

            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> As I said with the roller, so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Is a good product so far I used it with a wrap</li>
            <li> i am very impressed with the quantity and quality of this product for such a decent price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no scent, leaves your skin smooth (not sticky) after application, rubs in easily, and dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> so the results I&#x27;ve seen aren&#x27;t huge but there is a difference, which I&#x27;m so excited about</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, its not too runny like I find alot of cellulite creams to be, it also has a decent scent to it.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on easily and soaks into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the quick results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this cream when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Friendly and helpful customer service.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really absorbed well into my skin!</li>
            <li> The product has a mild, and pleasant scent, is a white color, and has a wide-mouthed jar, so you can get your hand into the product easily.</li>
            <li> This product is great and easy to use with or without other treatments.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference the 3rd time I used it, so it would probably deliver faster results if I had used it more often, honestly.</li>
            <li> The cream itself glides on smoothly, dries quickly and makes your skin feel silky to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product goes on clean - not greasy, not smelly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny to me, that even with all of my diet and exercise, this has been what has kind of put me over the edge as far as looking better.  </li>
            <li> I had more faith in myself to follow the directions, I would certainly try it again.</li>
            <li> I fully understand that to give the product a fair shot, it should have been applied twice daily, as directed.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this cream, so far the results are nice.</li>
            <li> After receiving the product that was very well packaged, I have used a couple times and I am already pleased.</li>
            <li> It may be to soon to have a full appreciation of its effect</li>
            <li> However, I wanted to give it a fair shot instead of writing about it after only two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this cream.</li>
            <li> No nasty smell, and the results are fast.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice thick consistency and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The container is very attractive, although I cannot read the small print without my reading glasses!</li>
            <li> The cream is a very silky and smooth in texture, which glides on easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has the slightest scent, which is fine with me, because I really don&#x27;t think there are any benefits to rubbing perfume on cellulite!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh and clean smell with no overpowering scents.  </li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly, leaving no greasy residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Super creamy.</li>

            <li> Arrived super quickly.</li>
            <li> While this absorbs quickly, I still wrapped it for the recommended 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really love this cream, and highly recommend that you buy it and try it for yourself.</li>

            <li> I decided to give this one a try -- the price was right</li>
            <li> It soaked right into my skin.  </li>
            <li> can put your clothes on right after.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it, directions followed, explaining that one must workout, eat right,</li>
            <li> You notice the smoothing effects right away.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and left my thighs feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my skin is remarkably smoother where i used the cream but have not yet noticed any firming results (have been using for a few days).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say I have only been using a little over a week</li>
            <li> This cream is nice and thick, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Im giving this cream four stars simply because it smells good and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> The 4 ounce container and its mailing package fit easily inside my mailbox, saving me hassles or worry with a package needing to be picked up by a certain time or a package sitting outside my door waiting for me to come home.  </li>
            <li> I found the cream has a very gentle, soothing scent.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not an instant results kind of thing, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Light non greasy formula leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is surely an item I will need to post a follow-up review on later on.</li>
            <li> Anyways, when I first put it on, I felt tingling.</li>
            <li> Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy another once this pot runs out!</li>
            <li> It did seem to work a tiny bit better than the wrap by itself.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, you have to be willing to put in work yourself.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!!</li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth; not oily, not greasy, and not staining.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping thank you!</li>
            <li> You have to use it twice a day and rub it in pretty vigorously</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> Most people dont see them, but of course i do which makes me self-consious especially during swim suit moments.</li>
            <li> I used this product EXACTLY as instructed- rub vigorously twice a day, until I ran out.</li>
            <li> I am confident that if used regularly for a longer than 5 days it will work!</li>
            <li> And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until I have used the whole container and plan to post pics right before my wedding.</li>
            <li> I actually see a difference in my thighs, my jeans fit better and my husband and even some family members said I look different (although they couldn&#x27;t put their finger on what it was!)  </li>
            <li> In terms of if it&#x27;s really working good, I&#x27;ll update the review after few weeks!</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this cream again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> After a few more weeks of using it, the appearance of my cellulite is mildly reduced.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a lot better as it has been very dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with cellulite, although I do have some on my calves and upper thighs.</li>
            <li> It left a smooth skin after usibg.</li>
            <li> so I thought this might really work.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks straight</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep trying until I finish the whole thing</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but thats tooo much time.  </li>
            <li> ,it does not work as it advertise also very stinky.</li>
            <li> Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too</li>
            <li> I actually like the light smell it has too.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too</li>
            <li> I used the cream for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> A product that really works for me.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> I am really just giving this product the benefit of the doubt.</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt smooth and toned after I applied.  </li>
            <li> I literally wrap myself up like a mummy with saran wrap, and go relax for about an hour to really let the cream do</li>
            <li> Thanks Stuart</li>
            <li> and I really do see a difference.</li>
            <li> Get ready summer body here</li>
            <li> Used it and didn&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very looking forward to the result</li>
            <li> Once she finishes the whole cream will update my review.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Really found this cream to work.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money when in fact, this is just a nice skin lotion.  </li>
            <li> It could at least have a good scent added to it instead of what it smells like.</li>
            <li> My package arrived even sooner than expected, and I really appreciated that it was sealed with plastic for a safe shipment.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh and without not necessary components.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight difference and so far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am fairly skinny but as I was getting older and from my younger years of fluctuating in weight I had cellulite on the back of my thighs and this cream has been helping it disappear, so far, the skin looks firmer and not as noticeable indentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At a fraction of other cellulite creams available, this cream is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This cream is high quality and it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new to cellulite treatments.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;you turn&amp;#34; products are natural and really works for me!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first, I&#x27;ve heard of people having issues with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> most cellulite treatment is extremely over priced, smelly and does not work, i recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year.</li>
            <li> Even after just a week of using it, my skin&#x27;s texture is softer and more supple, and the cellulite is slightly less noticeable; I look forward to updating my review after continued use.    </li>
            <li> Have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have noticed more firmness and less cottage cheese look.</li>
            <li> Obviously I like this enough to buy it again :)</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly after I put them on (actually I have put on several stabs of it on the same place since I don&#x27;t think I can follow the instructions to apply the cream twice a day) and it does not leave a greasy feeling like most body lotions do.</li>
            <li> im hopong with some more time ill notice more.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area.</li>
            <li> I mainly used this cream on my thighs.</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly, and manages to provide complete coverage of the areas I wanted to target on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> and I may have more to say after I use the entire jar to see what total effects I received from it.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin very soft though, which i really like.</li>
            <li> (I know it&#x27;s there, and I&#x27;m sensitive to it), but it&#x27;s much better than before when I could easily see it without trying very hard.  </li>
            <li> It is larger than your normal face cream but smaller than most body creams on the market.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very light, unlike some cellulite creams that are are really heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since my initial review, and my recent new cellulite zone is looking much better.  </li>
            <li> I like that the container doesn&#x27;t have too much printed info on the outside cluttering it up, and it&#x27;s easy to hold, open, and access the cream.  </li>
            <li> cellulite cream, unlike the far more expensive Lancome, is delightfully smooth and just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like about this product is that is absorbs quickly into my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for it to dry before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is very close to greek yogurt and very much like the Clarins body shaping cream that I am using before I got this.</li>
            <li> Do not irritate my sensitive skin with I really like.</li>
            <li> My cellulite cream arrived the day it was suppose to and was very well packaged in a small box with plastic packaging materials to keep the product safe.</li>
            <li> The cream has a very faint and pretty smell, better than most lotions I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more firm and almost feels like I just got out of the shower after every application.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream and after using it a few times, I have seen an improvement on my cellulite.</li>
            <li> The only downside has been though it is quick to tighten skin, it is also quick to dry out skin, so I have to moisturize my hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> it is not a 100% fix, diet and exercise is the definite way to go, but this is a push in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft skin this product gives you... can tell there is firming action as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really do enjoy this product and in this past week it really has worked!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it right now on a zone with some newly developed cellulite after some recent weight loss, but also plan to use it on other more damaged older zones later.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure it would after reading other peoples reviews and how it worked for them!!!</li>
            <li> It also goes a long way, so it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Although, I think if you combine this with a healthy diet and regular exercise, you will definitely notice results; only because that is what I am doing and I have seen results.</li>
            <li> (I did only one leg first</li>
            <li> The first time I spent way too much money on a Lancome product that was far too perfumed and runny.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not up to aromatic standards yet not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight change but it was about as what was expected as I believe healthy lifestyle changes of food and exercise is really what makes the difference.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and to me smells a little summery.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and to me smells a little summery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my thighs, my skin feels a little tighter and my thighs look smooth.  </li>
            <li> wow i have been using this cellulite treatment for a few months now and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Having been a professional photographic model and actress, I have always valued products that will naturally enhance my sensitive skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; tall and 155 lbs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell especially since you have to vigorously rub</li>
            <li> The cream reminds of old people.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised how well this cream works.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised how well this cream works.</li>
            <li> After applying a liberal amount to the skin, I wrapped my legs in saran wrap and just let the cream completely sink in.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my stomach area and hips, the cream did leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see some real improvement on my upper thighs in a month.</li>
            <li> Figured it would take a while to see complete results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to keep an eye on it, but so far, I like this cream</li>
            <li> For me, brushing helps to further stimulate the circulation in my target areas which really seem to make it work deeper into the problem zones.  </li>
            <li> I still have not gotten the  results the two young ladies on Dr. Oz&#x27;s shown within two weeks.</li>
            <li> cellulite completely.</li>
            <li> so far, I can&#x27;t wait to see results</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to give it at least three weeks :)</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say any thing at this time but after use my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> As far as reducing the cellulite appearance..haven&#x27;t seen a change at all.</li>
            <li> I have a soon to be 6 year old daughter who i love deeply, however, her 9 months inside my body gave my belly a few tiny stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> The product is not thick enough to combine w/  Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and more firm than prior to adding this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I will provide a review on my results in a few weeks and then again in the full time frame specified.</li>
            <li> I just started a new diet about one month ago and have lost about 10 pounds, my problem, however, has always been the cellulite on the back of my thighs.  </li>
            <li> As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li> I finally feel like I really can turn back the hands of time.  </li>
            <li> Although a thin cream, it absorbed quickly and kept dry skin mainly at bay.</li>
            <li> This is my very first attempt with any type of cellulite cream, and I&#x27;ll return with a progress update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it does not smell great either.</li>
            <li> I have used the product twice, so I cannot comment on long-term effectiveness, but so far it gets a big thumbs up, or should I say leg!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, like the directions say to</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it well with no reaction to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter and smother and soft and i just use it every other day and did not wrap my skin highly recommended</li>
            <li> I neither found it pleasant, nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the older trouble zones, but they look different now.  </li>
            <li> No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice enough, and the scent is faint but not overpowering or too chemical.</li>
            <li> So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams.</li>
            <li> My results after just one jar have definitely been apparent.  </li>
            <li> This cream seemed to help with it a little, nothing drastically changed but It made my skin feel nice and soft and seemed to firm my skin up a little.</li>
            <li> Hey, anyone who is over a certain age is going to benefit from a cream that helps firm the skin.</li>
            <li> Personally i dont have a real issue with cellulite but notice a little on my thighs here and there.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym.</li>
            <li> I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym.</li>
            <li> I live an active lifestyle and exercise 5 times per week, but still have unsightly cellulite around my thigh area.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is thick but it goes on smooth and sinks into the skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it really brought my stretch marks and cellulite to the surface at first, but noticed after some time that it was slowly smoothing back down.</li>
            <li> I have tried the wrap version suggested on the packaging twice and applied the lotion without wrapping 2 other times and I am surprised to say that I do see a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> So far I like the cream, does not leave a greasy oily feeling like other creams/lotions.</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly how well this is going to work in the long run</li>
            <li> Could have really used a little pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> I personally apply the cream after using a dry skin brush in a circular motion for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> Using it twice a day, I don&#x27;t imagine the jar could last terribly long.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, but seems to make my legs dry out a little bit , but im not sure if that is just because its also freakin 2 degrees outside.</li>
            <li> A cellulite cream that has enough active ingredients to finally make a difference on stubborn cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I noticed a difference within the first week of using the product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it to me this long to find a product that works.</li>
            <li> Still a long way to go, but there is improvement.  </li>
            <li> Plus it gives me an excuse to chill out and relax knowing that I am doing something pro-active for myself.  </li>
            <li> I mean, let&#x27;s be real</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while, but I can definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to be try out other</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just the after effects, so I left the other leg</li>
            <li> On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (</li>
            <li> Using it every night after dry brushing.  </li>
            <li> I just keep on ordering every single time my Youturn finishes.</li>
            <li> I am seeing some small results, but of course, expect this to take a while since I have quite a bit of cellulite to clear out.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream to my recent trouble spot and my decades old trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I was left with loose skin on my stomach area which appeared quite dimply and not smooth.</li>
            <li> I did notice a little bit of reduction in the appearance of the cellulite on the back of my leg.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of the negative reviews, I still think that products work differently with different people.</li>
            <li> I am not very fond of the smell however, hence the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> The package is as expected as in the photo</li>
            <li> only takes a few minutes per thigh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do it, but I just see maybe 5 minutes being spent on rubbing it in, hoping it wont effect the outcome in the end.</li>
            <li> I must say, I didn&#x27;t have cellulite to begin with, just aged skin.</li>
            <li> Not really any difference</li>
            <li> It tightened and smoothed my skin after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> a few tips that I would personally recommend to aid with this cellulite cream is drink A LOT of water which flushes toxins and exercise.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any user who&#x27;s curious about the product.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work well and firm my trouble spots, will update in a later time to see how the long term effect is</li>
            <li> Only used 3 times on my stomach but the skin is noticeably tighter and as a result my stretch marks are a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Oh, and a little of this cream goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the results after a second jar.  </li>
            <li> I started a strict diet, I work out every other day and used this lotion as directed on the pot.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t apply during day time due to smell.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Therefore, I cannot attest to the claims that it reduces cellulite, but I can describe the other product qualities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I must say compared to the other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve purchased this one</li>
            <li> I see a small difference and have only been using a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would work without further efforts to eliminate the cause for said cellulite to begin with...</li>
            <li> I did wrap too with this cream, but still no fast result s at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it to be quite moisturizing and have been using it alone rather than with my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve applied to my other leg.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times, but I do notice a little difference in the firmness in my thighs, arms and tummy.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system).</li>
            <li> Cellulite takes active management and tons of water so using this nightly to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I wish the label was a different, it&#x27;s hard to read.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time getting rid of that stubborn cellulite that they have.</li>
            <li> Well, I just got this product, im not crazy too crazy about reviews, and lowered my expectations</li>
            <li> After i applied the cream though my skin felt tingly almost, so I&#x27;m hopeful that that is a sign of it working or at least improving my overall skin.</li>
            <li> seen this product and thought i will give it a try,&lt;br /&gt;i am in the process of losing weight, (45 down) and needed a little&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> After using it for a while, the cellulite on my thighs is less visible.</li>
            <li> but my skin does seem to be slightly smoother</li>
            <li> After 2 days of use,  I noticed a slight improvement on the appearance of cellulite in my thighs...</li>
            <li> and already my problem area is smoother and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Ordered and was delivered in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the second time in this review that I have hinted that I am not a spring chicken, but I am not quite an old hen yet either.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half my skin started to look smoother.  </li>
            <li> and I notice a slight reduction on the amount of fat around my waist as well as an improvement on the skin looks.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and my cellulite on my thigh is looking firmer.</li>
            <li> but I feel like my legs tingle a little bit after application</li>
            <li> Watching what you eat and getting even a little exercise will help in your results.</li>
            <li> and I can see less and less cellulite!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little while now.</li>
            <li> but I will update once I have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Seemed to firm up a bit, looking to try it out until it is gone to confirm.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see myself in a few months of using it.</li>
            <li> m seeing results just within a few days.</li>
            <li> but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother.</li>
            <li> I will add another review about how the product works in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Basically a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use the wrap on my legs and apply some to my stomach area as well and within just a few days I noticed my skin was smoother.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The jar is a bit expensive for the size, but a small amount of product goes a long way and will last a while.</li>
            <li> I like it, may need to use it a few months to see results..</li>
            <li> I will post a follow up in a few days as to the 3 day progress.</li>
            <li> After using the cream for a few days i already feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail a few days ago and started using it that night.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, It&#x27;s been few days since she started using it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few week.</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell attached to the cream and</li>
            <li> I am shocked at all of the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> I had very little hope but thought I would give it a try</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t really that bad to begin with</li>
            <li> Buttocks are is firm too!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> This is a relatively small amount, I am going to use it on my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple days.</li>
            <li> I do find that 30 minutes to massage it in as it reccommends is a bit excessive, unless I have nothing else to do then</li>
            <li> I think I have noticed smoother skin, but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see how my legs look in a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2X a day for the past week</li>
            <li> I totally wasted my money purchasing this!</li>
            <li> Not sure it works yet</li>
            <li> Will use to the end but not sure I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hard sell</li>
            <li> Honestly, i do not expect it to make my cellulite disappear, but hoping i will see some results.</li>
            <li> I can already see changes, though small, it&#x27;s a start!</li>
            <li> And then I tried it on my not so subtle legs and thighs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 10 other Cellulite Creams that have claimed to work wonders over the past 5 years, and every time I&#x27;ve been equally disappointed each time never seeing results.</li>
            <li> Therefore I am disappointed with this product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for cellulite and smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> You Turn Cellulite Cream claims to be a&amp;#34;cellulite reducing slimming and toning cream.&amp;#34;  I have been using this once a day on my thigh/bottom area for approximately two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The cream doesnt smell badly like other creams i have used.</li>
            <li> It helps firm the area and reduces the appearance of the ugly stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams in the past and they would smell horrible or be too greasy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had expensive creams from a spa and all of them tingle after application.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this product would work</li>
            <li> Since all of their products have a satisfaction money back guarantee, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose except those nasty lumps and bumps.  </li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY skeptical whether this product did anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry</li>
            <li> Follow the directions on the jar and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to have anything happen, so when I saw a reduction in my cellulite I was - honestly - shocked!</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed with the results</li>
            <li> and when I looked in the dressing room mirror with horrible fluorescent lighting my thighs looked a lot smoother.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Try it now before summer! Great for thighs and tummy. Buttocks are is firm too!</li>
            <li> I liked the cream a lot.It left a smooth skin after usibg. Very light and awesome one.I got it in exchange of reviews.I will update more after using it for some days.I hope it will give good result after continued usage</li>
            <li> If this actually had retinol in it, there would likely be some sort of tingling sensation when applied after a shower.  It is a waste of money when in fact, this is just a nice skin lotion.  Nothing more.  I have had expensive creams from a spa and all of them tingle after application.  This is nothing more than a body cream in a jar.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but I noticed a difference within the first week of using the product.  My skin was smoother, and felt more tone.  I use it twice a day and I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar after 3 weeks.  I love the feel of my skin, it&#x27;s soft and moisturized.  I will definitely be purchasing another jar.  I&#x27;m anxious to see the results after a second jar.  Highly recommend.  Drink lots of water, too.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing . Seems to be working . My thighs feel tighter and a lot softer ! Great product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product which will my second time purchasing it. Obviously I like this enough to buy it again :) Personally i dont have a real issue with cellulite but notice a little on my thighs here and there. This cream seemed to help with it a little, nothing drastically changed but It made my skin feel nice and soft and seemed to firm my skin up a little. Honestly, I love trying all types of body creams and lotions and was happy I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week now so I have not seen results yet. Honestly, i do not expect it to make my cellulite disappear, but hoping i will see some results. It does leave my skin very soft though, which i really like. *I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Light non greasy formula leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. After only a week I can already see and feel a difference in my cellulite appearance on my thighs!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, delivered all it promised</li>
            <li> I wish the label was a different, it&#x27;s hard to read. But otherwise  awesome!</li>
            <li> I think this might be working but I have been drinking alot of water?</li>
            <li> This was surprisingly effective! I didn&#x27;t expect to have anything happen, so when I saw a reduction in my cellulite I was - honestly - shocked! It also goes a long way, so it was worth the money.  I was really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t really that bad to begin with so I thought this might really work. I&#x27;m 41 years old, 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; tall and 155 lbs. This didn&#x27;t do anything for me! I started a strict diet, I work out every other day and used this lotion as directed on the pot. Nothing changed! Too bad! Could have really used a little pick-me-up!</li>
            <li> Got my jar today! It is larger than your normal face cream but smaller than most body creams on the market. I have stretch marks on my thighs from losing weight and I was hoping to take care of it The texture of the cream is very close to greek yogurt and very much like the Clarins body shaping cream that I am using before I got this. The smell has a scent of ginger in it. It is certainly not up to aromatic standards yet not unpleasant. The cream absorbs quickly after I put them on (actually I have put on several stabs of it on the same place since I don&#x27;t think I can follow the instructions to apply the cream twice a day) and it does not leave a greasy feeling like most body lotions do. Since this is only day one, I am going to give it some time and see how it works on my stretch marks. I will repo if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Although a thin cream, it absorbed quickly and kept dry skin mainly at bay. I noticed a slight change but it was about as what was expected as I believe healthy lifestyle changes of food and exercise is really what makes the difference.</li>
            <li> Great cellulite cream excited to see results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for cellulite and smells horrible. It could at least have a good scent added to it instead of what it smells like. I have been using it for 3 weeks and don&#x27;t see or feel any difference yet.</li>
            <li> I do not think this worked at all for me! I used it for 3 weeks straight and I didn&#x27;t see much results. I am going to keep trying until I finish the whole thing but I doubt it will work. I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a slight smell to it. I don&#x27;t really like the smell especially since you have to vigorously rub so afterwards your hands will smell like it. I always have to wash my hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just received the cream. This is surely an item I will need to post a follow-up review on later on. The smell is kind of meh. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it does not smell great either. The cream reminds of old people. Anyways, when I first put it on, I felt tingling. This leads me to believe that something is working. In 30 days, I&#x27;ll post a follow up review to see if results show.</li>
            <li> I love this cream I can&#x27;t believe it to me this long to find a product that works. Thank you for creating such an amazing product. Now I&#x27;m satisfied and can wear shorts again.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting with cellulite for years. I live an active lifestyle and exercise 5 times per week, but still have unsightly cellulite around my thigh area. I have avoided wearing bathing suits and shorts because of my cellulite. I receive this awesome cellulite cream from YouTurn at a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to give my honest feedback!&lt;br /&gt;YouTurn Cellulite Cream is a medium consistency, white cream. It has a very nice, light scent. It soaks into the skin and dries rather quickly, leaving no greasy residue on the skin. It leaves my skin feeling nice, smooth and refreshed. After using it for a while, the cellulite on my thighs is less visible. I continue to use this product daily for maximum results. This cream is mild which is great for my sensitive skin.  I have not experienced any irritation whatsoever. At a fraction of other cellulite creams available, this cream is definitely worth it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Received this today in the mail. I applied after getting out of the shower. It has a pleasant smell and left my thighs feeling soft. I am not sure exactly how well this is going to work in the long run but I will update once I have been using it for a few weeks. So far so good. Happy with the consistancy of the lotion. It easily absorbed into my skin. Hopefully that means it is working! I did receive this free for my review.</li>
            <li> After a full months use, I can honestly say it does work. It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle and you must stay vigilant but it did help alot. I still have some cellulite left but it did make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Just started using this cream. So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams. Looking forward to continued use and results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!! After only two days of use, I can see and feel a difference!!! Will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> I had cellulite for  couple years and tried many solutions that didn&#x27;t do anything,After trying the  best cellulite treatment  Youturn for a couple of times already,and the results are just fantastic I just keep on ordering every single time my Youturn finishes.</li>
            <li> The holy grail of cellulite cream. Awesome stuff put this on legs butt and stomach and wrapped at night. Gone within a week love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream twice a day as the directions say and massage for about 5 minutes.  Yes the directions say 30 mins but thats tooo much time.  I like the product havent seen a big difference but my skin does seem to be slightly smoother im hopong with some more time ill notice more.</li>
            <li> Seemed to firm up a bit, looking to try it out until it is gone to confirm. I am not very fond of the smell however, hence the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I bought this product after reading all good reviews! and thought its worth try so I did but I was very disappointed with the results,it does not work as it advertise also very stinky. I can&#x27;t apply during day time due to smell.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Super creamy. Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this cream. I use this mainly on my thighs and butt area. I apply the cream twice a day at morning and night.  The smell is light and to me smells a little summery. I was actually really surprised how well this cream works. I used it one day and then went clothes shopping and when I looked in the dressing room mirror with horrible fluorescent lighting my thighs looked a lot smoother. I have also been exercising more so I think in combination with a toning regime this helps reduce the appearance of cellulite and make your skin firmer. The formula is not sticky or greasy either which I like. Aside from the firming benefits the cream is really moisturizing too so I don&#x27;t need to use an additional lotion on top of this cream. I think this cream is definitely worth a try if you are trying to show off all of the hard work you have put in at the gym. Or, if you just want smoother, firmer skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft skin this product gives you... can tell there is firming action as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for body wraps as I prepare for my upcoming wedding this summer.  I am happy with the results.  I actually like the light smell it has too.  I will continue to use until I have used the whole container and plan to post pics right before my wedding.</li>
            <li> I used this on my legs and stomach after two pregnancies.  My skin feels a lot better as it has been very dry.  I&#x27;m very excited to see the continuing results!</li>
            <li> This product is great and easy to use with or without other treatments. Arrived on time and packaged perfectly!</li>

            <li> Amazing cream! I love the consistence and smell. It&#x27;s very fresh and without not necessary components. Love the quality of this cream. My skin on legs after twice using is very smooth and soft. For sure I will practice using every day and we&#x27;ll see what will happen. I feel that it will be one of my the best &#x27;must -have&#x27; cosmetics :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times, but I do notice a little difference in the firmness in my thighs, arms and tummy. I&#x27;m definitely gonna keep using it. Can&#x27;t wait to see myself in a few months of using it. It goes on very smoothly, does not leave any greasy or sticky feel. It really feels pretty good going and absorbed great.</li>
            <li> :) this worked wonderfully I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any woman who has cottage cheese on the thighs!  I&#x27;ve used this for a month with excellent results!  Just in time for summer :)</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this cellulite cream. I&#x27;ve only had it for a little while, but I can definitely see a difference in my skin. This product arrived the day after I ordered it. The cream itself is thick but it goes on smooth and sinks into the skin. It didn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like most creams and lotions do. It was easy to put on a pair of jeans after applying it. I mainly used this cream on my thighs. After applying a liberal amount to the skin, I wrapped my legs in saran wrap and just let the cream completely sink in. After using it only a couple of times, I see an improvement in my cellulite and especially my skin. My skin feels tighter and a lot smoother. If you&#x27;re looking to get rid of cellulite, this product is a great way to start!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> works great!! saw a difference in about two weeks!!</li>
            <li> Im seeing results just within a few days. Massage the area in circular motion</li>
            <li> The package is as expected as in the photo so its a good thing... :-)  After 2 days of use,  I noticed a slight improvement on the appearance of cellulite in my thighs... I put it once a day only or before I sleep...</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really world, and there are way too many products that don&#x27;t work! This one is great! I&#x27;m so excited to have it!</li>
            <li> As a long time Amazon customer, this is first and only product I&#x27;ve ever reviewed. I&#x27;ve purchased several cellulite products over the years, however, this is only product that is working for me. I was searching for a product with caffeine and seaweed (mentioned on Dr Oz) and stumbled onto this one. And, I was very interested in the reviews. Thank you, Body Merry! In the evening, I apply after shower and massage in with the Finulite Smoothing Massager. Just a few minutes for each thigh and use the dry brushing technique, massaging/stroking upward toward heart (for lymphatic system). only takes a few minutes per thigh. On day three, I noticed that my skin wasn&#x27;t as dry and felt tighter (no way I thought) but after approximately 2 weeks I started noticing that my skin was not only tighter but smoother. I will not question the results. I&#x27;m amazed. No product I&#x27;ve used in past has EVER produced results this quickly. Or produced results...period! I find the menthol quite pleasant and it tingles and dissipates within 30 minutes or so. Just yesterday, I ordered 4 jars and will give 2 to younger family members as Christmas gifts. Will be interesting to see if they experience similar results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see how two younger women respond to this product. BTW - I have not been compensated for this review.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for two weeks straight I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my stomach area and hips, the cream did leave my skin soft. I&#x27;m going to try it again this time after i apply it i will saran wrap my stomach and thigh area.</li>
            <li> It feels good.  Whether it works or not remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> wow i have been using this cellulite treatment for a few months now and have noticed a huge difference. i am very impressed with the quantity and quality of this product for such a decent price. most cellulite treatment is extremely over priced, smelly and does not work, i recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> This cream is nice and thick, and smells lovely. Shipping was fast as well. I&#x27;ve used this for two days and can already tell a difference in the firmness of my skin where I&#x27;ve applied it! I will most likely buy another once this pot runs out!</li>
            <li> I just received and started using this product. It smells good and not sticky as others indicated in their reviews.  I am using this product on my stomach and thighs as those are the two areas that need some tightening. Hoping that adding this to my daily exercise will help tone up.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively small amount, I am going to use it on my legs so I am going to see if it works well. I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes.</li>
            <li> Actually works, used it and saw results within 2 weeks. Will continue  to use and buy more. Excited :)))</li>
            <li> I love this cream!  It&#x27;s such a great deal. Follow the directions on the jar and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry but I haven&#x27;t seen any&lt;br /&gt;difference and I&#x27;ve been faithfully&lt;br /&gt;using the product and exercising.&lt;br /&gt;But I will keep trying!! Thankyou</li>
            <li> A product that really works for me. Reasonable price too. I used this about twice a week with a massager.  I could see a difference the 3rd time I used it, so it would probably deliver faster results if I had used it more often, honestly. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if fighting cellulite is your goal</li>
            <li> great stuff, I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week now and I have been using it as directed, twice a day and rubbing vigorously and then wrapping the area. I&#x27;ve actually seen results! Now it&#x27;s only been a week so the results I&#x27;ve seen aren&#x27;t huge but there is a difference, which I&#x27;m so excited about and I will continue to use until the jar is empty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of product, for me I do my arms and thighs. So for my arms I use about a nickel to quarter size amount and rub in vigorously and then wrap my arm with plastic wrap, I usually only wrap once a day at night. I do use this product twice a day. Now for my thighs I use about a silver dollar size amount on each leg and rub vigorously and then wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really do enjoy this product and in this past week it really has worked! So I will continue to use until gone and I will update with photos so you can see my transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for review for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> It  is OK. Good thing  I did not sped a lot of money on it. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this product with a wrap. It did seem to work a tiny bit better than the wrap by itself. Before wrapping my legs I slathered on this product and left it overnight. I did notice a little bit of reduction in the appearance of the cellulite on the back of my leg. I was given a discount on this product in return for honest feedback. I am hoping with continued use of this product I will notice more improvement.</li>
            <li> The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly. And it absorbs almost immediately. I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year. And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely. It wasn&#x27;t at all tacky to the touch and allowed me to get dressed immediately without rubbing off on my clothing. I used it for two weeks on my upper arms and legs, wrapping the legs as directed for 30 minutes. My skin was definitely smoother after the treatment. I even wore shorts to a party last weekend and had my legs complimented by a good friend who knows me very well. Still, it&#x27;s no substitution for old-fashioned diet and exercise. But it is the perfect</li>
            <li> I am really just giving this product the benefit of the doubt. I fully understand that to give the product a fair shot, it should have been applied twice daily, as directed. Not once or twice weekly, as remembered. Therefore, I cannot attest to the claims that it reduces cellulite, but I can describe the other product qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was very mild. I neither found it pleasant, nor unpleasant. It&#x27;s consistency was somewhere between lotion and body butter, leaning toward lotion, which made it very easy to apply quickly and evenly. I recommend that you treat one area at a time. The container is smaller than I was expecting and I think that even if I had followed the application frequency as instructed, I would have run out before achieving the desired results because I was applying the product to my thighs, butt cheeks, and tummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting: I have extremely sensitive skin and experienced no adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had more faith in myself to follow the directions, I would certainly try it again.</li>
            <li> I feel it make me happy,by continue it useing. It may be smoothly my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t to sure about this cream when I first got it. I&#x27;ve used about 10 other Cellulite Creams that have claimed to work wonders over the past 5 years, and every time I&#x27;ve been equally disappointed each time never seeing results. But I&#x27;m very pleased to say that THIS IS THE FIRST cellulite cream I have use that I CAN FINALLY SEE AND FEEL THE RESULTS! I&#x27;m very happy to say I have only been using a little over a week and already my problem area is smoother and less noticeable. HOWEVER, you have to be willing to put in work yourself. With a good diet and exercise plan, you too can be on a way to a smoother you! I&#x27;m so glad I found this product, it works above and beyond my expectations. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. It works great, has formed me up!!</li>
            <li> The cream is not too greasy, which is a good thing. Not a big fan of the smell. In terms of if it&#x27;s really working good, I&#x27;ll update the review after few weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using YouTurn cream for about a week now, &amp; I&#x27;m truly happy with the results. I can already see changes, though small, it&#x27;s a start! As with all products you can&#x27;t expect it to work over-night, it&#x27;s not a miracle formula but it IS a formula that WORKS! My skin feels smoother and more firm than prior to adding this to my daily routine. The cream itself glides on smoothly, dries quickly and makes your skin feel silky to the touch. The ONLY reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of the smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t smell good either. I think if the company improved the over-all smell of this product it would be 5 start worthy!</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month and I saw no results, It was a waist of money. I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past couple days. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used this cream for 9 days.  It smells nice and absorbed into my skin quickly.  I have been using this on my thighs, my skin feels a little tighter and my thighs look smooth.  I will continue to use this cream, so far the results are nice.</li>
            <li> Makes skin really soft and can tell there is some firming as well... going to continue to use because i think its gonna be really good!</li>
            <li> Ordered and was delivered in less than 3 days. I liked that the product didn&#x27;t have a perfume smell. It was very easy to apply to my skin.  My skin actually felt smooth and toned after I applied.  I just started using it and will revisit my review to talk about the end results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a huge problem with cellulite, although I do have some on my calves and upper thighs. Hey, anyone who is over a certain age is going to benefit from a cream that helps firm the skin. This is only the second time that I have purchased cellulite lotion or cream. The first time I spent way too much money on a Lancome product that was far too perfumed and runny. I decided to give this one a try -- the price was right and I liked the description. The product arrived very quickly and I tried it almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cellulite cream, unlike the far more expensive Lancome, is delightfully smooth and just the right consistency. It has the slightest scent, which is fine with me, because I really don&#x27;t think there are any benefits to rubbing perfume on cellulite! The container is very attractive, although I cannot read the small print without my reading glasses! Yes, this is the second time in this review that I have hinted that I am not a spring chicken, but I am not quite an old hen yet either. I like the way the cream rubs in without leaving an oily or sticky residue. I have used the product twice, so I cannot comment on long-term effectiveness, but so far it gets a big thumbs up, or should I say leg!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 days now and I love the result. My cellulite in my thighs are started to look smaller and the bumps are now started to disappear. I have never seen a product like this.</li>
            <li> I received the product very fast, and have begun to use it, so we&#x27;ll see! The packaging is nice enough, and the scent is faint but not overpowering or too chemical. it feels like it moisturizes as well. i&#x27;ll keep using it and will revisit this review in a couple weeks with results!</li>
            <li> Very smooth buying experience.  Friendly and helpful customer service.  This product shipped right away and arrived quickly.  The 4 ounce container and its mailing package fit easily inside my mailbox, saving me hassles or worry with a package needing to be picked up by a certain time or a package sitting outside my door waiting for me to come home.  I like that the container doesn&#x27;t have too much printed info on the outside cluttering it up, and it&#x27;s easy to hold, open, and access the cream.  I found the cream has a very gentle, soothing scent.  It was very consistent, smooth, and very easy to apply for me.  It soaked right into my skin.  It feels soft and smooth; not oily, not greasy, and not staining.  I&#x27;m using it right now on a zone with some newly developed cellulite after some recent weight loss, but also plan to use it on other more damaged older zones later.  I&#x27;m hoping this product can help with my skin&#x27;s appearance.  It would be great if it helped the cellulite actually go away, too. :)  This is my very first attempt with any type of cellulite cream, and I&#x27;ll return with a progress update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 WK UPDATE: Everyone&#x27;s different, so I&#x27;m just sharing what I&#x27;ve done and what I see.  The cream does have some texture to it, feels like maybe beads or flakes, but they melt away when applied to skin.  Nothing flakes off later.  I applied the cream to my recent trouble spot and my decades old trouble spots.  I did not do wraps, and I haven&#x27;t used a cellulite brush.  I&#x27;m very new to cellulite treatments.  What I do almost every day now with the cream is rebound on a trampoline.  It&#x27;s been two weeks since my initial review, and my recent new cellulite zone is looking much better.  I have some bumps left I can see if I try to look for it (I know it&#x27;s there, and I&#x27;m sensitive to it), but it&#x27;s much better than before when I could easily see it without trying very hard.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the older trouble zones, but they look different now.  Not as good as the newer zone, but the skin looks tighter.  Still a long way to go, but there is improvement.  Good stuff! :)</li>
            <li> I give it a 10 awesome !!!!</li>
            <li> Cream had shards of fiberglass in it.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me.  In addition, I use it on my neck under my chin.  It has helped to tighten my skin under the chin.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I&#x27;m going to take pictures of my legs to see the before and after.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good product, saw result in neck area, not so much in hip/buttocks area. will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Using it every night after dry brushing.  Time will tell.  Good consistency, not sticky, absorbs quickly.  Leaves skin smooth and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t work for me.  I saw no change at all.</li>
            <li> I like the silky feel of the lotion, but I have not noticed any change to the cellulite on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer, I did receive a discount for trying this product and giving a truthful review. I had nothing to lose,... Except cellulite. After receiving the product that was very well packaged, I have used a couple times and I am already pleased. I am happy to say that even in humid (84%) weather it does not feel sticky. My skin absorbed it well with no reaction to harsh chemicals. Not a strong smell attached to the cream and it feels so smooth! I look forward to keeping this part of my youthful regime. Thank you</li>
            <li> I recently received the cellulite cream and I must say compared to the other cellulite creams I&#x27;ve purchased this one smells good and has a better consistency than any of the others. It&#x27;s not greasy, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands oily or sticky at all. So far I&#x27;m very pleased. I will provide a review on my results in a few weeks and then again in the full time frame specified. Feeling very good about this product!</li>
            <li> I notice  some improvement in the appearance of cellulite in about 10 days of use. Good product, but not miracle as I was hoping for! :)</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t tell a difference at  all.</li>
            <li> My cellulite cream arrived the day it was suppose to and was very well packaged in a small box with plastic packaging materials to keep the product safe. The creme itself had a plastic seal on it so I knew it had not been tampered with and an inside cover after I pulled the lid off providing extra protection and freshness. The creme has a good consistency and absorbs well into the skin. Very eager to see the results once I have been using it for a few weeks.  I will add another review about how the product works in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still experimenting using the plastic wrap &#x27;technique&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I just got the cream and have been using it for just a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly. The texture of the cream is good. When I rub it into my skin, it isn&#x27;t oily. This was an issue for me. You can&#x27;t be sure just from reading the description. It is easy to apply and is absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to see some real improvement on my upper thighs in a month. I&#x27;ll come back to update my review on four weeks to report my results.</li>
            <li> Used this product before.  It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference by the product within the time I used it. Maybe over a period of several months I will start to notice.</li>
            <li> Great product.  After about a week and a half my skin started to look smoother.  Keep in mind it is not a 100% fix, diet and exercise is the definite way to go, but this is a push in the right direction.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing a Dr. Oz show that showed that Retinol and Caffeine helps reduce cellulite. I noticed my skin was smoother and softer within a couple of days of using this product. It goes on easy, not greasy and absorbs fast into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 2 months now and I have seen a decrease in the appearance of the cellulite on my thighs. I will continue to use the product. The cream is smooth, non sticky, non odorous and goes on very nice.</li>
            <li> These creams... they just don&#x27;t work. Even temporarily. It&#x27;s all about toning and losing a LOT of your fat to reduce.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything. I use it as directed with plastic wrap! Totally shame! Do not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my Wife, she love it and I &#x27;m Happy for that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Noticed a difference immediately. It is more successful if used with wrapping device as well.</li>
            <li> As I said with the roller, so far so good.  Figured it would take a while to see complete results.</li>
            <li> Just started using this cream. So far I like that it does not irritate my sensitive skin, No oily or greasy feeling like other lotions or creams. Looking forward to continued use and results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  My skin feels better after two days of using it. Just in two days I can see the difference on my skin. I use it twice a day. Once after the shower in the morning and once before bed. I&#x27;ll be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> I just started a new diet about one month ago and have lost about 10 pounds, my problem, however, has always been the cellulite on the back of my thighs.  I was skeptical that this product would work but thought, what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try.  So far, I have been really pleased. I actually see a difference in my thighs, my jeans fit better and my husband and even some family members said I look different (although they couldn&#x27;t put their finger on what it was!)  It&#x27;s funny to me, that even with all of my diet and exercise, this has been what has kind of put me over the edge as far as looking better.  I&#x27;ll continue to keep an eye on it, but so far, I like this cream and I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like it says</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly.  I put some on and it is not greasy at all can put your clothes on right after.  Great products will get it again</li>
            <li> I honestly love this! I do find that 30 minutes to massage it in as it reccommends is a bit excessive, unless I have nothing else to do then I&#x27;ll do it, but I just see maybe 5 minutes being spent on rubbing it in, hoping it wont effect the outcome in the end. It goes on nicely, its not too runny like I find alot of cellulite creams to be, it also has a decent scent to it. It absorbs quickly, but seems to make my legs dry out a little bit , but im not sure if that is just because its also freakin 2 degrees outside. I love the caffieene in it as well because I&#x27;m sure its just a placebo effect but I feel like my legs tingle a little bit after application, do I love this cream? Yes. Do I recommend it? Heck yes, Does it work? I sure hope so, it&#x27;s not an instant results kind of thing, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I really love this cream, and highly recommend that you buy it and try it for yourself. My package arrived even sooner than expected, and I really appreciated that it was sealed with plastic for a safe shipment.  It arrived in perfect condition, and upon opening the jar, I was impressed that it has a very pleasant, yet subtle scent.  And then I tried it on my not so subtle legs and thighs.  Having been a professional photographic model and actress, I have always valued products that will naturally enhance my sensitive skin without irritation.  And this cream exceeded my expectations!  I personally apply the cream after using a dry skin brush in a circular motion for several minutes.  For me, brushing helps to further stimulate the circulation in my target areas which really seem to make it work deeper into the problem zones.  And then there&#x27;s the fun part.  I literally wrap myself up like a mummy with saran wrap, and go relax for about an hour to really let the cream do it&#x27;s thing.  And I can honestly say that it&#x27;s been working like a charm.  Plus it gives me an excuse to chill out and relax knowing that I am doing something pro-active for myself.  My results after just one jar have definitely been apparent.  My skin feels silky soft and smooth, and the cottage cheese dimples seem to be melting away like magic.  I&#x27;m SO impressed!  So happy that I have found a product line that does what it says it will do for a change.  Since all of their products have a satisfaction money back guarantee, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose except those nasty lumps and bumps.  I sincerely hope that you get the same amazing results that I have experienced, but if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, simply return it for your money back.  If your results are anything like mine, you are in for a very pleasant surprise.  I was so happy, that I ordered their new Seaweed Mask with retinol, and feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the best combo for smoothing out and eliminating cellulite once and for all.  I will beposting another glowing review for the Seaweed Mask as well.  I finally feel like I really can turn back the hands of time.  &amp;#34;you turn&amp;#34; products are natural and really works for me! And now, it&#x27;s you(r) turn!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all!!!! I thought for sure it would after reading other peoples reviews and how it worked for them!!! This product is costly with no results</li>
            <li> Works great if you wrap with plastic overnight!</li>
            <li> I think this product is working and I like it.</li>
            <li> The cream has a nice thick consistency and pleasant smell. It is best used after shower and then wrap the area with a plastic wrap to seal it in. I see a small difference and have only been using a couple of days. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week. Shipping was fast and the product has a nice scent.  This product is very easy to use.  I am seeing some small results, but of course, expect this to take a while since I have quite a bit of cellulite to clear out.</li>
            <li> So smooth, not sticky at all. Really absorbed well into my skin! Can&#x27;t wait to see results!</li>
            <li> You Turn Cellulite Cream claims to be a&amp;#34;cellulite reducing slimming and toning cream.&amp;#34;  I have been using this once a day on my thigh/bottom area for approximately two weeks.  I think I have noticed smoother skin, but I&#x27;m not totally sure.  My husband says he doesn&#x27;t notice it.  Anyway, product suggests that you use it in conjunction with plastic wrap and I will try that and see.  I must say, I didn&#x27;t have cellulite to begin with, just aged skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cream goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. The smell is pleasant as well. Can&#x27;t wait to see how feel the produce works.</li>
            <li> There has been a visual difference in the appearance of my stomach area. I had gastric bypass surgery 6 years ago and lost 100 pounds. I always had worked out and carried my weight well but was overweight. I was left with loose skin on my stomach area which appeared quite dimply and not smooth. Since I started using the cellulite cream I have noticed that my skin is starting to have a smoother appearance this is with using it twice a day. I have not done the saran wrap with it just massaging it into the area. It has only been two weeks since I started at this point.</li>
            <li> This cream is high quality and it really works. I&#x27;ve had very positive results within 2 weeks time. Watching what you eat and getting even a little exercise will help in your results. I will be purchasing more today. Oh, and a little of this cream goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> It does leave a tingling feeling to give the impression that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;. It did give my skin a taut and smoother appearance, but still cellulite. When I ordered it, directions followed, explaining that one must workout, eat right, etc., which actually defeats the purpose of the cream. It s a great moisturizer and keeps the skin smooth, but don&#x27;t expect noticeable results unless you&#x27;re doing squats, lunges, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 3 months.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried and now I can add my daughter and good friend to that opinion. I&#x27;m a hard sell but this product does it!! We all got results and I only use it once a day instead of two. I use it on my upper arms and on my granny waves and my daughter on her thighs...both receiving noticable results.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I just had a baby and I can already see a difference! I recommend this product to others. Must try it!</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this product! Its very light and fresh. It feels really nice on your legs, almost cooling. The texture is very light, unlike some cellulite creams that are are really heavy and greasy. You notice the smoothing effects right away. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few days and am already happy with the results. I cannot wait to see how my legs look in a few weeks! I&#x27;m definitely going to be try out other You Turn products.</li>
            <li> Did not see any evidence of results. Basically a waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 4 weeks and I notice a slight reduction on the amount of fat around my waist as well as an improvement on the skin looks.  It may be to soon to have a full appreciation of its effect but so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and so far I am pleased. I use the wrap on my legs and apply some to my stomach area as well and within just a few days I noticed my skin was smoother. However, I wanted to give it a fair shot instead of writing about it after only two uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the negative reviews, I still think that products work differently with different people. Although, I think if you combine this with a healthy diet and regular exercise, you will definitely notice results; only because that is what I am doing and I have seen results. Not sure how well it would work without further efforts to eliminate the cause for said cellulite to begin with...but it&#x27;s a compliment to any healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> The YouTurn cream goes on so smoothly and evenly. And it absorbs almost immediately. I live in a very humid climate and used this product at the hottest time of the year. And it STILL absorbed quickly and completely. It wasn&#x27;t at all tacky to the touch and allowed me to get dressed immediately without rubbing off on my clothing. I used it for two weeks on my upper arms and legs, wrapping the legs as directed for 30 minutes. My skin was definitely smoother after the treatment. I even wore shorts to a party last weekend and had my legs complimented by a good friend who knows me very well. Still, it&#x27;s no substitution for old-fashioned diet and exercise. But it is the perfect complement to a healthy routine!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly as promised, very pleased.  I ordered this product a few weeks ago. I did not see any results initially however, I must say that my skin is appearing tighter and the dimpling smoother.  I still have not gotten the  results the two young ladies on Dr. Oz&#x27;s shown within two weeks. I will continue using the product for 3 months and return with an update.  Thanks Stuart</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter and smother and soft and i just use it every other day and did not wrap my skin highly recommended</li>
            <li> Arrived super quickly. The jar was well packaged. The cream is a very silky and smooth in texture, which glides on easily and absorbs quickly. The jar is a bit expensive for the size, but a small amount of product goes a long way and will last a while. Even after just a week of using it, my skin&#x27;s texture is softer and more supple, and the cellulite is slightly less noticeable; I look forward to updating my review after continued use.    **UPDATE** After a few more weeks of using it, the appearance of my cellulite is mildly reduced. The texture of the skin is also more even and smooth. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I like it, may need to use it a few months to see results..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping thank you! Can&#x27;t wait to start using this :)</li>
            <li> This stuff works but won&#x27;t get rid of it cellulite completely. It helps firm the area and reduces the appearance of the ugly stuff. This is a cosmetic product, not a cure. So this is good to use while making an effort to workout and truly get rid of cellulite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 2X a day for the past week and I can see less and less cellulite! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is no &amp;#34;miracle cream&amp;#34;- I mean, let&#x27;s be real those don&#x27;t exist.  But this did seem to smooth the appearance of the cellulite in my backside.  I never tried it with the saran wrap, but I did use it with exercise and the results were noticeable.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me, no changes, but I only used for a week. I did wrap too with this cream, but still no fast result s at all!</li>
            <li> Worked good.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> i love this cream. along with water and exercise i have actually seen an improvement in my cellulite. water is important for flushing out toxins and keeping your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Well, I just got this product, im not crazy too crazy about reviews, and lowered my expectations, ingredients don&#x27;t sound too appealing, will review back if will see any results</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  At all.  I am shocked at all of the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for me. You have to use it twice a day and rub it in pretty vigorously but I definitely saw results.</li>
            <li> no visable differences noted&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Been using it a couple of days and my legs already feel smoother. Very happy with it so far, I can&#x27;t wait to see results</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY skeptical whether this product did anything. I had very little hope but thought I would give it a try and I really do see a difference. I have tried the wrap version suggested on the packaging twice and applied the lotion without wrapping 2 other times and I am surprised to say that I do see a noticeable difference. It really does work! I am fairly skinny but as I was getting older and from my younger years of fluctuating in weight I had cellulite on the back of my thighs and this cream has been helping it disappear, so far, the skin looks firmer and not as noticeable indentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent, leaves your skin smooth (not sticky) after application, rubs in easily, and dries fairly quickly. I would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> i will definitely order again! I use on my tummy and arms and have seen a difference. Smooths out my skin. Thankyou!</li>
            <li> Product goes on clean - not greasy, not smelly. I will post a follow up in a few days as to the 3 day progress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for one week so I&#x27;ll update later as of now it made my areas softer but still have cellulite so I&#x27;m going to give it at least three weeks :)</li>
            <li> The product is not thick enough to combine w/  Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage.</li>
            <li> Huge Joke!!!! I totally wasted my money purchasing this!</li>
            <li> So far I like the cream, does not leave a greasy oily feeling like other creams/lotions. Do not irritate my sensitive skin with I really like. Looking forward to continue use and end results.</li>
            <li> After using the cream for a few days i already feel a difference in my skin. I have a soon to be 6 year old daughter who i love deeply, however, her 9 months inside my body gave my belly a few tiny stretchmarks. Most people dont see them, but of course i do which makes me self-consious especially during swim suit moments. Using this cream has tightened my skin around midriff and i can only imagine the results to come!!! Get ready summer body here I come!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today. It has a pleasant smell and a nice texture. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far, like the directions say to, it went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. Using it twice a day, I don&#x27;t imagine the jar could last terribly long. I will update after I&#x27;ve used it a while longer.</li>
            <li> Not really any difference</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Within a week, I was seeing results. But as the follow up literature suggests, exercise and diet matter too. I would definitely recommend this product and buy more for myself and others (great gift...;-0)</li>
            <li> I have had great experience from this product so far. It was easy to purchase and arrived quickly! The container seals well and is great for traveling (mine gets thrown around my gym bag quite a bit and hasn&#x27;t leaked or had an issue yet!). The cream has a very faint and pretty smell, better than most lotions I&#x27;ve found. It applies in a very smooth fashion and leaves no greasy residue. I&#x27;ve also found it to be quite moisturizing and have been using it alone rather than with my other moisturizers. I will give it a couple weeks to work it&#x27;s magic and update my review based on those results!</li>
            <li> Used it and didn&#x27;t really see any difference</li>
            <li> I recently ordered YouTurn&#x27;s cellulite cream (ordered on the 25th of September and received it in the mail on the 30th of September) and  consider a five-day turnaround very good service. The cream goes on smoothly, and manages to provide complete coverage of the areas I wanted to target on the back of my legs. After a 10-day trial, I found the product to work fairly well. It is more efficient if you use it twice a day and cover the area of application with saran wrap. The product has a mild, and pleasant scent, is a white color, and has a wide-mouthed jar, so you can get your hand into the product easily. Overall, I rate this product with 5-stars and I may have more to say after I use the entire jar to see what total effects I received from it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream in hopes that it would help reduce some of the cellulite that I have on the back of my thighs. I have noticed a slight difference and so far I am very pleased with the results. The cream is very smooth and goes on effortlessly. Another thing I really like about this product is that is absorbs quickly into my skin, so I don&#x27;t have to wait forever for it to dry before getting dressed. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is having a hard time getting rid of that stubborn cellulite that they have.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. I need to give the product time to work but I bought it because it contains caffeine and retinol. I plan on using this twice a day along with a healthier diet and excercise.  There was a bonus with this purchase- Rapid Cellulite Reduction Secrets&amp;#34;  eBook and I liked that it is also made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Is a good product so far I used it with a wrap and it seems to work well and firm my trouble spots, will update in a later time to see how the long term effect is</li>
            <li> I love this product! It feels really smooth on the skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks and I already can tell the difference.  My skin feels tight and my cellulite on my thigh is looking firmer. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail a few days ago and started using it that night. I am really excited to see the changes in my thighs!! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Not sure it works yet but I&#x27;m very looking forward to the result</li>
            <li> A cellulite cream that has enough active ingredients to finally make a difference on stubborn cellulite.  The retinol and caffeine are excellent! Cellulite takes active management and tons of water so using this nightly to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I just use 3/4 days so I can&#x27;t say any thing at this time but after use my skin so soft. I hope It will be work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results. feels tingly on the skin. will update after 4 uses</li>
            <li> Awesome cream! It tightened and smoothed my skin after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, It&#x27;s been few days since she started using it but she forgets to use it regularly,Still there seems to be some progress.Once she finishes the whole cream will update my review.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on easily and soaks into your skin quickly.  It has a fresh and clean smell with no overpowering scents.  I have noticed my skin feels tighter and I have been using this for 15 days.  I can look at my skin and tell a difference.  I will certainly buy this cream again and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference used for 3 weeks and nothing.</li>
            <li> This is really good it works!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product did not work at at.  It also contained clumps of a white sticky substance.  I will not reorder nor would I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Real nice on the skin. Light and not sticky</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to drink lots of water! And follow directions!  While this absorbs quickly, I still wrapped it for the recommended 30 minutes.  (I did only one leg first so I could compare)  What I noticed immediately...was the smoothness of my skin.  I thought maybe it was just the after effects, so I left the other leg un-touched for 2 days to see the difference.  It works!  I just love how soft my skin feels!  Since then I&#x27;ve applied to my other leg.  My skin feels more firm and almost feels like I just got out of the shower after every application.  I&#x27;m very happy.  I was worried at first, I&#x27;ve heard of people having issues with sensitive skin.  no issues here!</li>
            <li> There is a visible reduction of cellulite using this product! The cream feels great on my skin and absorbs well. It has a subtle scent that is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Liking the results didn&#x27;t think I would like product but just gave it a five star review</li>
            <li> I personally did not see a difference whatsoever in my cellulite. Therefore I am disappointed with this product especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Great! The cream doesnt smell badly like other creams i have used. I have already seen a difference on the back of my legs. I cant wait to try it in the form of a wrap. The cream made my legs very soft and i am thrilled to have found something that helps with those stubborn &#x27;dents&#x27; on my legs!!  I would recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I used this product EXACTLY as instructed- rub vigorously twice a day, until I ran out. I HAD ZERO results. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Instead, eat healthy and work out.</li>
            <li> Im giving this cream four stars simply because it smells good and makes my skin soft. As far as reducing the cellulite appearance..haven&#x27;t seen a change at all. I work out four days a week and use this...not helping. Guess I gotta deal with it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this as recommended but see no results yet. Will use to the end but not sure I will buy again. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, going for more!</li>
            <li> a few tips that I would personally recommend to aid with this cellulite cream is drink A LOT of water which flushes toxins and exercise. I love this cream and after using it a few times, I have seen an improvement on my cellulite. I would recommend this to any user who&#x27;s curious about the product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this cream. No nasty smell, and the results are fast. The only downside has been though it is quick to tighten skin, it is also quick to dry out skin, so I have to moisturize my hands afterwards. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the quick results.</li>
            <li> Only used 3 times on my stomach but the skin is noticeably tighter and as a result my stretch marks are a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great product and works just fine...</li>
            <li> Really found this cream to work. Have been using it for almost 2 weeks and have noticed more firmness and less cottage cheese look. Gives it an extra boost if you use a wrap as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a little while now. I like how smooth it is and it I can already see the difference. I have tried other creams in the past and they would smell horrible or be too greasy for my skin. This one has worked very well and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using it. So far I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. Will update in a few week.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have only used it 5 days and I can already feel a difference! My skin is smoother and has better color...I am using it twice a day and notice some decrease in cellulite already! I am confident that if used regularly for a longer than 5 days it will work! I plan on using this product till the lumpscqnd bumps go away! :)</li>
            <li> I use this and a regular hair brush Daily. It works wonders! Put the cream on then brush the spot with cellulite and you&#x27;ll see improvement within time :) good luck!</li>
            <li> i got this at discounted price.. it was okay for me ..thanks</li>
            <li> great product. seen this product and thought i will give it a try,&lt;br /&gt;i am in the process of losing weight, (45 down) and needed a little&lt;br /&gt;help on my cellulite, so i ordered this product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;this soaks in well and i can feel a difference in my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;i would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it really brought my stretch marks and cellulite to the surface at first, but noticed after some time that it was slowly smoothing back down. I also liked the smell, I am going to continue using to see if it can reduce my stretch marks/cellulite even more! :)</li>
            <li> When i opened the container i instantly felt like i was in a spa! Not only does this cream smell wonderful but it has a soothing effect to it. I did notice that my skin is remarkably smoother where i used the cream but have not yet noticed any firming results (have been using for a few days). After i applied the cream though my skin felt tingly almost, so I&#x27;m hopeful that that is a sign of it working or at least improving my overall skin. Either way I&#x27;m happy with the way it smells and love the smoothness/softness of my skin!</li>
