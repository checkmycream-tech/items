            <li>I use this mostly to make home made laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>I got the citrus one, because I thought it smelled better than all the rest.</li>

            <li>I like most of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>One of my favorite soaps in the world.</li>
            <li>We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>They leave me feeling very clean, rinse off nicely, and my skin is quite smooth for that of a person my age.</li>
            <li>While Dr Bronnner clearly didn&#x27;t know Jesus Christ or who he was, he sure knew how to make a good soap without using chemicals!</li>
            <li>no soapy residue, smells nice leaves your skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This scent is nice &amp; mild.</li>
            <li>This is a great, very gentile Castile soap that is free of chemicals.</li>
            <li>and I feel really clean!</li>
            <li>good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean and it has good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I love the light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li>...cleans well for being so easy on skin..</li>
            <li>Has all the same great benefits as the peppermint soap except this one bears a lovely citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild citrus scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the citrus orange because of the way it smells, but all the different varieties are just as great.</li>
            <li>I liked these soaps at first, but then they made my skin itch.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is not overpowering but mild and lovely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is fairly mild, a light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering like most soaps today.</li>
            <li>I really believe that my skin is as nice as it is because of always showering with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It took a while for me to find this unadulterated soap, and now I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li>Actually, I enjoy all their &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re all natural products and fair trade.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them, but their ingredients look fascinating and natural.</li>
            <li>These bars smell fantastic and the soap leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Probably not everyone&#x27;s skin will work with Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but judging by the reviews, most who try it love it and now the company has a new convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cleans as well as the peppermint Castile soap, but does not leave that fresh smell!</li>
            <li>but do not expect any significant citrus odor or &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love this soap for baths----good lather, no fake chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP LEAVES SKIN SQUEAKY CLEAN WITHOUT A LOT OF CHEMICALS....</li>
            <li>Nice light scent, all natural organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (lemony), and is oh so soft!</li>
            <li>This brand will always be a \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; when I want something special.</li>
            <li>YOU ALL need to just purchase this right now!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s about 75 words right!?</li>
            <li>They are so mild and environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>wonderful, natural smelling scents, moderately priced, non stripping and provide one with a fresh, clean feeling unlike the Dove brand or</li>
            <li>It seems to be lasting a good while too.</li>
            <li>i guess that part is kinda cool as an added on bonus</li>
            <li>A bit on the pricey side, but liked the natural feel of the soap, unlike the harsher types of soaps</li>
            <li>We have been using this soap for our whole family for almost two years and we still love it.  </li>
            <li>Clean well and rinses quickly.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all&lt;br /&gt;soap lathers up quickly and makes your shower experience a pleasant one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin filmy, and the smell is invigorating yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Better for my skin than most commercial soaps.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly when they said it would.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t order more because of the high price and the drying of my skin.</li>
            <li>Not only is it very refreshing in the shower</li>
            <li>This soap is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>THIS SOAP IS GREAT, YOU ARE MISSING OUT</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice.</li>
            <li>This is a soft citrus scent and it is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this natural soap.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap, it made my family chime out being so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>you just love natural soap).</li>
            <li>It lathers just fine without giving my skin that squeaky clean feeling that requires you to spread lotion all over to try to replace your natural oils.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals like sulfates, it smells amazing, and it leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Sudsy just enough, the fresh smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, the origins help me sleep well at night - love this soap.</li>
            <li>The Magic Soaps do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The soaps have a natural ingredients for its scent, and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>I normally use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint hemp liquid soap (which is also great); my wife started using this as a cheaper alternative to a similar Lush brand bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It has a very gentle citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>candy!:)Amazon offers this in bulk and free shipping</li>
            <li>I use castile soap for of my personal soap needs and have tried most scents.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I look young again!!!!  </li>
            <li>I usually can&#x27;t stand any scents, but this is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy more in the future repeatedly.</li>
            <li>Never let us down once.  : )  Thank you!</li>
            <li>The standard “supermarket” soaps are too stripping, often have too many chemicals in them, smell like laundry detergent, don&#x27;t last very long or don&#x27;t give you a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to breakouts, you might enjoy using this natural soap, as it is incredibly mild on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am on a soap kick right now, and if left to my own devices, I would buy enough to build a house with.</li>
            <li>Certainly makes traveling a breeze too.  </li>
            <li>NOt sure, but a definite improvement in our skin for tone and softness and the best part is it is all natural on our bodies.  </li>
            <li>It lasts really well.</li>
            <li>It did not have much fragrance</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as much of citrus as it used to, as others have noted.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to purchase the liquid version from amazon today which I have never tried.</li>
            <li>HAHA;</li>
            <li>so I am recommending it to anyone that wants to go organic.</li>
            <li>when i travel and use the hotel soap i can really tell the difference, my skin is alot drier and itchier using hotel soap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and nourishing, you can use it on your body and your face.</li>
            <li>It is not a harsh soap like most of the commercial soaps you would find in the supermarket.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some other soaps that claim to be pure, but I reacted to most of them.</li>
            <li>Much better in my view  than other grocery offerings.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size bar not orange in color but more like an off white to a slight yellow,  that has lasted longer</li>
            <li>I love this and the other variety soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning with out leaving a residue feeling behind on my skin or stripping my skin of all its natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly scented soaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It produces a very refreshing scent that it not overwhelming and a soft, clean lather that does not leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li>Never actually felt this clean after a shower, it suds up like crazy and really really cleans my skin, also comes from a great company that supports labeling GMO.</li>
            <li>I only buy this bar soap from Amazon when it is sold much cheaper than my local stores and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I see the prices on these soaps, and I am surprised at how much sellers are charging, plus shipping.</li>
            <li>So many years wasted using chemically engineered garbage (I&#x27;m talking to you Lever 2000).</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of bar soaps are right in the middle in every way...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m getting to the age where my once oily skin is becoming well, less oily.  </li>
            <li>Expensive but very nice soap</li>
            <li>I hesitate to buy soap online because I&#x27;ve gotten some before that was stale, but these bars are nice and fresh and the price is comparable to what I pay in health food stores - when I can find it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soap with only pure &amp; organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>You could be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s in early 2004, my skin has stay cleared up and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really cuts back on bug bites.  </li>
            <li>I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li>I use them for myself and my 5 yr old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Maybe our old chemical soap broght them out?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately for Amazon, my local store has a very low sale price on this bar soap right now.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a ton of soaps, I&#x27;m a 30 year old male, this soap is awesome...beats the hell out of everything @</li>
            <li>tried different scents and thus far I like citrus orange scent</li>
            <li>She loves this soap and has not gone back to the Lush bar since the switch.</li>
            <li>Even if I shower twice a day it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the bars last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>However, I can walk into the Kroger down the street right now and pay $2.99 a bar individually.  </li>
            <li>My skin was very sensitive to the commercial-grade oil stripping agents used in standard soaps, which left me itchy and my skin always flaky.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years now, mostly because I try to avoid harsh scents and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price seemed a bit high compared to the liquid but the soap&#x27;s bar stays hard, it lasts, and lathers really well</li>
            <li>Even the ones I get are as if the insect couldn&#x27;t deal with it long enough to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>I buy these soaps because I have sensitive skin, and the different scents go a long way toward variety.</li>
            <li>problem is that Amazon.com has not been offering any from them; only from other resellers who charge a lot for shipping and/or have high prices.  </li>

            <li> One of my favorite soaps in the world.</li>
            <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> They leave me feeling very clean, rinse off nicely, and my skin is quite smooth for that of a person my age.</li>
            <li> While Dr Bronnner clearly didn&#x27;t know Jesus Christ or who he was, he sure knew how to make a good soap without using chemicals!</li>

            <li> The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li> ...cleans well for being so easy on skin..</li>
            <li> Has all the same great benefits as the peppermint soap except this one bears a lovely citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild citrus scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the citrus orange because of the way it smells, but all the different varieties are just as great.</li>
            <li> I liked these soaps at first, but then they made my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not overpowering but mild and lovely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is fairly mild, a light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering like most soaps today.</li>
            <li> I really believe that my skin is as nice as it is because of always showering with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li> I like that they&#x27;re all natural products and fair trade.  </li>

            <li> These bars smell fantastic and the soap leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Probably not everyone&#x27;s skin will work with Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but judging by the reviews, most who try it love it and now the company has a new convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans as well as the peppermint Castile soap, but does not leave that fresh smell!</li>
            <li> but do not expect any significant citrus odor or &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for baths----good lather, no fake chemical fragrance.</li>

            <li> YOU ALL need to just purchase this right now!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s about 75 words right!?</li>
            <li> They are so mild and environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> wonderful, natural smelling scents, moderately priced, non stripping and provide one with a fresh, clean feeling unlike the Dove brand or</li>
            <li> It seems to be lasting a good while too.</li>
            <li> i guess that part is kinda cool as an added on bonus</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricey side, but liked the natural feel of the soap, unlike the harsher types of soaps</li>
            <li> We have been using this soap for our whole family for almost two years and we still love it.  </li>
            <li> Clean well and rinses quickly.  </li>

            <li> Better for my skin than most commercial soaps.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly when they said it would.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t order more because of the high price and the drying of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only is it very refreshing in the shower</li>
            <li> This soap is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP IS GREAT, YOU ARE MISSING OUT</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice.</li>
            <li> This is a soft citrus scent and it is lovely.</li>
            <li> I love this natural soap.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap, it made my family chime out being so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> you just love natural soap).</li>
            <li> It lathers just fine without giving my skin that squeaky clean feeling that requires you to spread lotion all over to try to replace your natural oils.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals like sulfates, it smells amazing, and it leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Sudsy just enough, the fresh smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, the origins help me sleep well at night - love this soap.</li>
            <li> The Magic Soaps do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The soaps have a natural ingredients for its scent, and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I normally use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint hemp liquid soap (which is also great); my wife started using this as a cheaper alternative to a similar Lush brand bar of soap.</li>
            <li> It has a very gentle citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying more of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> candy!:)Amazon offers this in bulk and free shipping</li>
            <li> I use castile soap for of my personal soap needs and have tried most scents.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I look young again!!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t stand any scents, but this is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy more in the future repeatedly.</li>
            <li> Never let us down once.  : )  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The standard “supermarket” soaps are too stripping, often have too many chemicals in them, smell like laundry detergent, don&#x27;t last very long or don&#x27;t give you a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to breakouts, you might enjoy using this natural soap, as it is incredibly mild on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am on a soap kick right now, and if left to my own devices, I would buy enough to build a house with.</li>
            <li> Certainly makes traveling a breeze too.  </li>
            <li> NOt sure, but a definite improvement in our skin for tone and softness and the best part is it is all natural on our bodies.  </li>
            <li> It lasts really well.</li>
            <li> It did not have much fragrance</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as much of citrus as it used to, as others have noted.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to purchase the liquid version from amazon today which I have never tried.</li>
            <li> HAHA;</li>
            <li> so I am recommending it to anyone that wants to go organic.</li>
            <li> when i travel and use the hotel soap i can really tell the difference, my skin is alot drier and itchier using hotel soap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and nourishing, you can use it on your body and your face.</li>
            <li> It is not a harsh soap like most of the commercial soaps you would find in the supermarket.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other soaps that claim to be pure, but I reacted to most of them.</li>
            <li> Much better in my view  than other grocery offerings.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size bar not orange in color but more like an off white to a slight yellow,  that has lasted longer</li>
            <li> I love this and the other variety soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning with out leaving a residue feeling behind on my skin or stripping my skin of all its natural oils.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly scented soaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It produces a very refreshing scent that it not overwhelming and a soft, clean lather that does not leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li> Never actually felt this clean after a shower, it suds up like crazy and really really cleans my skin, also comes from a great company that supports labeling GMO.</li>
            <li> I only buy this bar soap from Amazon when it is sold much cheaper than my local stores and with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I see the prices on these soaps, and I am surprised at how much sellers are charging, plus shipping.</li>
            <li> So many years wasted using chemically engineered garbage (I&#x27;m talking to you Lever 2000).</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of bar soaps are right in the middle in every way...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m getting to the age where my once oily skin is becoming well, less oily.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but very nice soap</li>
            <li> I hesitate to buy soap online because I&#x27;ve gotten some before that was stale, but these bars are nice and fresh and the price is comparable to what I pay in health food stores - when I can find it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap with only pure &amp; organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> You could be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s in early 2004, my skin has stay cleared up and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really cuts back on bug bites.  </li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li> I use them for myself and my 5 yr old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Maybe our old chemical soap broght them out?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately for Amazon, my local store has a very low sale price on this bar soap right now.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of soaps, I&#x27;m a 30 year old male, this soap is awesome...beats the hell out of everything @</li>
            <li> tried different scents and thus far I like citrus orange scent</li>
            <li> She loves this soap and has not gone back to the Lush bar since the switch.</li>
            <li> Even if I shower twice a day it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the bars last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> However, I can walk into the Kroger down the street right now and pay $2.99 a bar individually.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very sensitive to the commercial-grade oil stripping agents used in standard soaps, which left me itchy and my skin always flaky.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years now, mostly because I try to avoid harsh scents and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price seemed a bit high compared to the liquid but the soap&#x27;s bar stays hard, it lasts, and lathers really well</li>
            <li> Even the ones I get are as if the insect couldn&#x27;t deal with it long enough to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> I buy these soaps because I have sensitive skin, and the different scents go a long way toward variety.</li>
            <li> problem is that Amazon.com has not been offering any from them; only from other resellers who charge a lot for shipping and/or have high prices.  </li>
            <li> Pure soap with no additives and hidden ingredients that would make your skin feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I live in a three person household and this six pack was enough to last us a little over three months.</li>
            <li> Until you try a really high quality soap you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate using the bar soap in the winter - I tend to get very dry skin in the winter months, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps don&#x27;t dry my skin out like regular soaps.  </li>
            <li> I have bought the other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps in the past but the Citrus Orange really wakes me up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> just that they are used to the fruitier same of other non-natural soaps...</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get itchy and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair clipped with no guard, and a single bar of Bronner&#x27;s citrus is all I need in the shower - even for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about average, and longer than moisturizing soaps, such as Caress and Dove.</li>
            <li> I just went down to my local health food store and they had all of the \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The chemical/animal based soaps (think Dove, Ivory, etc) dry out my skin so it feels rough and breaks out.  </li>
            <li> I spent $5.59 per bar, on sale.</li>
            <li> Try once, then you won&#x27;t use other soaps.</li>
            <li> ( Other non chemical soaps leave)&lt;br /&gt;Mild</li>
            <li> kids not too crazy about the smell though (not bad)</li>
            <li> It is a decent product, but it seems the manufacturer is keeping costs down by cutting back on aromatic oils.  </li>
            <li> either reek with too much perfume or are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Cleans just as well as the other scents but this is vigorating in the morning!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> I recommend black soap if you have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> One bar lasted for less than a week of showers for 2 people.</li>
            <li> This can do it all, a little on the hair, then the pits, then rest of parts.  </li>
            <li> A little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Amazon, but in this case for me, it&#x27;s not the least expensive route.  </li>
            <li> heavy moisturizing soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I buy this soap in 6-packs every few weeks.</li>
            <li> After using this soap for a few months, my skin literally glows.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s For a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the ingredient entitled organic coconut, is a shady way to hide the fact that they make sodium laureth sulfate from coconut oil, and it&#x27;s no better than other sulfates.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s certainly not the highest price I&#x27;ve paid to not smell like a hobo.</li>
            <li> Very little citrus scent.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with that because it&#x27;s lacking all of the nasty chemicals of mass produced bars of soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more dryness.</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Mint liquid soap because it is pH balanced, but my husband was picking this up for me while traveling</li>
            <li> No more body washes now.  </li>
            <li> No better or worse than any other soap.</li>
            <li> I hate artificial fragrances, and I make all of my own cleaning and beauty products.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST DON&#x27;T TRY IT.</li>
            <li> and I have missed using it lately.</li>
            <li> Suds like crazy using a wet wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it dried my skin out WAY to much, disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BAD SKIN ISSUES, AND LIKE THIS SOAP.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I AM GETTING IN TO USING ALL ORGANIC PRODUCTS.... AMAZON IS THE BEST PRICE FOR MOST ITEMS.... THIS SOAP LEAVES SKIN SQUEAKY CLEAN WITHOUT A LOT OF CHEMICALS....WE LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> I have bought the other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps in the past but the Citrus Orange really wakes me up in the morning.  Cleans just as well as the other scents but this is vigorating in the morning! Kudos!</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Bronners Castile soaps for years and have found the product to be an excellent soap for use in the shower.  It is not a harsh soap like most of the commercial soaps you would find in the supermarket.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP IS GREAT, YOU ARE MISSING OUT IF YOU AT LEAST DON&#x27;T TRY IT.</li>
            <li> This soap is my new favorite. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals like sulfates, it smells amazing, and it leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft. The scent reminds me of an orange creamsicle. Citrus and sweetness. I use it to wash my face and body. My skin is just beautiful now! No blemishes, no redness, just perfection. I love it. It seems to be lasting a good while too.</li>
            <li> This soap, like many others have stated is quite simply...outstanding.  However, I can walk into the Kroger down the street right now and pay $2.99 a bar individually.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Amazon, but in this case for me, it&#x27;s not the least expensive route.  You might look in your local grocery store&#x27;s organics section to see if these soaps are there and check the prices.  You could be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bonner&#x27;s bar soaps, what more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a lot actually. I can never go back to using non-organic, chemical/animal based bar soaps ever again.  The chemical/animal based soaps (think Dove, Ivory, etc) dry out my skin so it feels rough and breaks out.  Ever since I started using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s in early 2004, my skin has stay cleared up and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that Amazon.com has not been offering any from them; only from other resellers who charge a lot for shipping and/or have high prices.  I only buy this bar soap from Amazon when it is sold much cheaper than my local stores and with free shipping.  Otherwise, I buy one or two bars at a time from my local retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for Amazon, my local store has a very low sale price on this bar soap right now.  I just purchased a six month supply of this bar soap.</li>
            <li> Really cuts back on bug bites.  Even the ones I get are as if the insect couldn&#x27;t deal with it long enough to complete the job.  Before this soap I was a bug magnet.  It might be that Lever 2000 deoderant soap I used to use may have attracted them.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft. Lathers enough, even in well water that is not softened. Lasts about average, and longer than moisturizing soaps, such as Caress and Dove.</li>
            <li> I buy these soaps because I have sensitive skin, and the different scents go a long way toward variety.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of soaps, I&#x27;m a 30 year old male, this soap is awesome...beats the hell out of everything @ the stores...plus it has hemp i guess that part is kinda cool as an added on bonus...cleans well for being so easy on skin..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried different scents and thus far I like citrus orange scent the best&lt;br /&gt;I litterally use this soap bar on my hair ~ toe.. hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all&lt;br /&gt;soap lathers up quickly and makes your shower experience a pleasant one.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers better than any soap I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; lasts longer too. This scent is nice &amp; mild. I kinda wish it was a bit stronger. But it&#x27;s all good. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap.  Smells great and is clean and free of chemicals and toxic ingredients.  I&#x27;ve tried several different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Use it to wash body, hair, even face. Great product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Tried this once @ a friend&#x27;s house &amp; I love this soap! Not only is it very refreshing in the shower but it&#x27;s scent makes the entire bathroom smell nice. Has all the same great benefits as the peppermint soap except this one bears a lovely citrus scent. Will certainly buy more in the future repeatedly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this citrus scent. I hate artificial fragrances, and I make all of my own cleaning and beauty products. This is a soft citrus scent and it is lovely. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used this soap to make homemade powder laundry detergent and I love the smell!  The detergent works just as well as store bought liquid ones.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure-Castile Soap is the only solution for wanting the best soap on the market! Pure soap with no additives and hidden ingredients that would make your skin feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> It causes my skin to break out. It must be one of the ingredients. I recommend black soap if you have acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricey side, but liked the natural feel of the soap, unlike the harsher types of soaps</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a good lather, and smells good. I&#x27;m going to take a guess here, because the ingredients don&#x27;t say sodium laureth sulfate. I&#x27;m guessing that the ingredient entitled organic coconut, is a shady way to hide the fact that they make sodium laureth sulfate from coconut oil, and it&#x27;s no better than other sulfates. I had initially given this product five stars, but I will lower it to three, for possible deception.</li>
            <li> Has a great fragrance and feels good to use.  Works well as a hair soap also followed with an apple cider vinegar rinse for conditioning.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap for dishes, bathing, whatever. Nice light scent, all natural organic ingredients. I usually can&#x27;t stand any scents, but this is pleasant. I hesitate to buy soap online because I&#x27;ve gotten some before that was stale, but these bars are nice and fresh and the price is comparable to what I pay in health food stores - when I can find it. It lasts really well. One bar will do my dishes for a month. (Only 2 people, so we wash by hand.)</li>
            <li> This soap smells wonderful! I live in a three person household and this six pack was enough to last us a little over three months.</li>
            <li> Probably not everyone&#x27;s skin will work with Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but judging by the reviews, most who try it love it and now the company has a new convert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a soap person... always have been. The standard “supermarket” soaps are too stripping, often have too many chemicals in them, smell like laundry detergent, don&#x27;t last very long or don&#x27;t give you a nice clean feeling. The fancier soaps (Le Ocitane, CrabTree &amp; Evelyn, The Body Shop, etc.) either reek with too much perfume or are too expensive. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of bar soaps are right in the middle in every way... wonderful, natural smelling scents, moderately priced, non stripping and provide one with a fresh, clean feeling unlike the Dove brand or heavy moisturizing soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are year-round soaps that may be used in every season producing the same results. I love them! I use them for myself and my 5 yr old.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever made, and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> It did not have much fragrance I prefer the peppermint soap! It cleans as well as the peppermint Castile soap, but does not leave that fresh smell!</li>
            <li> Sudsy just enough, the fresh smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering, the origins help me sleep well at night - love this soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap but do not expect any significant citrus odor or &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years now, mostly because I try to avoid harsh scents and chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly mild, a light citrus smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering like most soaps today. It forms a good lather, and washes off easily. If you have sensitive skin, or are prone to breakouts, you might enjoy using this natural soap, as it is incredibly mild on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have to say it&#x27;s one of the nicer soaps out there, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing. My only complaint is that it is a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s certainly not the highest price I&#x27;ve paid to not smell like a hobo.</li>
            <li> These bars lather well and are a welcome alternative to the plastic bottle of their liquid soap, which I use for housecleaning.  If you want Big Chemical out of your life, these are for you. All the scents are nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This can do it all, a little on the hair, then the pits, then rest of parts.  Simplifies my shower experience.  Can be used as toothpaste too in pinch.</li>
            <li> These soaps (in any scent) are a staple of my shower and body skin care routine.  I&#x27;m 48 so I&#x27;m getting to the age where my once oily skin is becoming well, less oily.  The Magic Soaps do not dry out my skin. They leave me feeling very clean, rinse off nicely, and my skin is quite smooth for that of a person my age. I really believe that my skin is as nice as it is because of always showering with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  I also like that the scent is pleasant and fresh but not overpowering.  I think this is the best soap ever and I buy them in lots of 6 from Amazon so that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap does what it is supposed to do, it cleans.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans. Rinses off. No residue.&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li> Used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap in coincident when I went to Gym. It is mind. Try once, then you won&#x27;t use other soaps.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap, I honestly can&#x27;t stand to use anything else. It has a very mild citrus scent. I like the Almond scent too but of all this is my favorite. So many years wasted using chemically engineered garbage (I&#x27;m talking to you Lever 2000). Until you try a really high quality soap you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap in 6-packs every few weeks. It smells, lathers, and cleans perfectly. My skin was very sensitive to the commercial-grade oil stripping agents used in standard soaps, which left me itchy and my skin always flaky. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has taken care of that problem perfectly. It lathers just fine without giving my skin that squeaky clean feeling that requires you to spread lotion all over to try to replace your natural oils. I would and have recommended this soap to everyone. I don&#x27;t smell like a stinky hippy, but my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> We have been using this soap for our whole family for almost two years and we still love it.  It does a great job cleaning with out leaving a residue feeling behind on my skin or stripping my skin of all its natural oils.  I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> These bars smell fantastic and the soap leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed. I normally use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint hemp liquid soap (which is also great); my wife started using this as a cheaper alternative to a similar Lush brand bar of soap. She loves this soap and has not gone back to the Lush bar since the switch.</li>
            <li> smelled wonderful and works great</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to find this unadulterated soap, and now I use it exclusively. I&#x27;ve tried some other soaps that claim to be pure, but I reacted to most of them. I&#x27;ll continue to use this one. It has a very gentle citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> We love Bronner soaps and this is one of our stand-bys.</li>
            <li> I love this natural soap. No horrible chemicals or parabens. Has a nice light citrus smell and works great! J</li>
            <li> Expensive but very nice soap</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap, it made my family chime out being so soft and moisturized. I will definitely be trying more of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Great for making home made laundry soap!  Fragrance is not overpowering but mild and lovely.</li>
            <li> Good soap but it doesn&#x27;t smell quite as much of citrus as it used to, as others have noted.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap ever and I have missed using it lately. It smells so awesome and lathers wonderfully. It&#x27;s wrapped in paper so we can recycle! :) Best of all it&#x27;s CERTIFIED ORGANIC! No junk ingredients! You can do all sorts of stuff with the liquid version of this however I have not tried yet. I am getting ready to purchase the liquid version from amazon today which I have never tried. The size of the soap is very nice and it is a beautiful piece of soap(don&#x27;t you just love natural soap). AHHH I could go on and on about how much I am in love with this soap . YOU ALL need to just purchase this right now! I bet the peppermint smells nice, try some of that! You will smell like you just ate candy!:)Amazon offers this in bulk and free shipping so don&#x27;t you dare go buying or looking anyplace else because it is the best deal. Trust me! I LOVE amazon!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about 75 words right!? HAHA;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use products with natural ingredients.  I&#x27;ve used several of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and have never been disappointed.  The soaps have a natural ingredients for its scent, and it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!  It&#x27;s mild, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin filmy, and the smell is invigorating yet not overpowering.  A little on the pricey side but I&#x27;m ok with that because it&#x27;s lacking all of the nasty chemicals of mass produced bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I really like this soap. This is the first time I have ever used an organic soap and am pleasantly surprised how good this product is. It has a nice orange scent without being over powering, you won&#x27;t be smelling like an orange. It is a nice size bar not orange in color but more like an off white to a slight yellow,  that has lasted longer then I thought it would. It lathers up really nice so you do not need to use a lot of it during each shower. Each bar has lasted about a month for me. So why did I only give it a four star rating? Since it is not a deodorant soap, I have to say that because I tend to perspire a lot when at work my underarms tend to become more ripe if I don&#x27;t use a deodorant after showering. So after a shower I always use a deodorant and I am good to go. I will definitely be purchasing this soap again so I am recommending it to anyone that wants to go organic.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of orange in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this line of soaps. They do help clear up my skin, and many of them smell wonderful. Not the citrus version, though. A tad medicinal. Very little citrus scent.</li>
            <li> After using this soap for a few months, my skin literally glows. No more dryness. When I use it to shave my legs there&#x27;s  no razor burn!</li>
            <li> no soapy residue, smells nice leaves your skin feeling clean. when i travel and use the hotel soap i can really tell the difference, my skin is alot drier and itchier using hotel soap</li>
            <li> Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps are always good quality. I appreciate being able to find organic soaps that don&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I use Bronner&#x27;s a lot, and this is nice, but the scent is on the skimpy side. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  My skin has never been better.  I use it for everything (washing, shaving and shampoo in a pinch)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. It washes. No better or worse than any other soap. It does dry my skin out but it smells Amazing.  Love the smell. I won&#x27;t order more because of the high price and the drying of my skin.</li>
            <li> A very good soap with a very clean feel to it post shower. Much better in my view  than other grocery offerings. Glad I purchased it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this soap for me for Christmas, and I absolutely love it! It smells amazing (lemony), and is oh so soft! I am always satisfied with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing soap ever created.  It&#x27;s great on your body and your hair.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  love all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soaps but this one smells divine!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and I feel really clean!</li>
            <li> Good Stuff - I tried the orange, very happy.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product but doesn&#x27;t last long. One bar lasted for less than a week of showers for 2 people.</li>
            <li> it dried my skin out WAY to much, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great in the creation of laundry detergent-mild scent.</li>
            <li> Suds like crazy using a wet wash cloth.  Clean well and rinses quickly.  Great smell and texture on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great soap and great company! There are so many toxic products on the market that contain all sorts of chemicals and toxins for your body! But not with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap products. All organic ingredients and leaves your skin feeling and smelling great!</li>
            <li> Lemon scent is short lived and soon smells of regular castille soap.</li>
            <li> I have bought several types of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps and this is the best.  Light scent, but very pleasant.  Even if I shower twice a day it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the bars last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I need to shout the praises of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, but I will add my voice to the chorus. This is a great, very gentile Castile soap that is free of chemicals. It&#x27;s so gentle and nourishing, you can use it on your body and your face. My favorite is the citrus orange because of the way it smells, but all the different varieties are just as great.</li>
            <li> Great quality in the correct size.  Better for my skin than most commercial soaps.  Arrived quickly when they said it would.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are wonderful.  I like that they&#x27;re all natural products and fair trade.  I especially appreciate using the bar soap in the winter - I tend to get very dry skin in the winter months, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps don&#x27;t dry my skin out like regular soaps.  Plus the smells are great!</li>
            <li> I use this mostly to make home made laundry detergent. Nice scent and I like the natural stuff. Try it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap with only pure &amp; organic ingredients. I heard about Dr Bronner&#x27;s products &amp; decided to order the soap. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> best soap ever! Must own</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, lotions, hair products etc. and will for years to come.  Never let us down once.  : )  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Lathers up well..kids not too crazy about the smell though (not bad) just that they are used to the fruitier same of other non-natural soaps...glad we got them for them!</li>
            <li> I see the prices on these soaps, and I am surprised at how much sellers are charging, plus shipping. I just went down to my local health food store and they had all of the \\&quot;flavors\\&quot;. I spent $5.59 per bar, on sale. I got the citrus one, because I thought it smelled better than all the rest. I haven&#x27;t opened it yet. I also bought some South of France soaps, which were on the same display case. I haven&#x27;t tried them, but their ingredients look fascinating and natural. I am on a soap kick right now, and if left to my own devices, I would buy enough to build a house with. They would only find me after it rained for awhile. Looking forward to trying this soap, which I know has a great reputation.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this citrus soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.he gets a headache when around perfume , cologne&lt;br /&gt;and highly scented soaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; or laundry detergents..on people&#x27;s clothes ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the soap he likes and it lathers well..</li>
            <li> I like castile soap. Bronner supports American-grown industrial hemp oil, which is currently banned, because industrial hemp is bunched up with &amp;#34;marijuana&amp;#34; as a controlled drug. Industrial grade hemp is not a &amp;#34;drug quality&amp;#34; crop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best price I have found for this product. I plan on buying more &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; soon.</li>
            <li> Never actually felt this clean after a shower, it suds up like crazy and really really cleans my skin, also comes from a great company that supports labeling GMO.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the 1st time. I usually use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Mint liquid soap because it is pH balanced, but my husband was picking this up for me while traveling and I didn&#x27;t want him to have the hassle of a liquid soap. The price seemed a bit high compared to the liquid but the soap&#x27;s bar stays hard, it lasts, and lathers really well (my husband uses it for shaving). For me I like a stronger smell to wake me up in the morning. Will always buy Dr. Bronners but if I have to buy a bar - I will try another next time and gradually get an assortment of all.</li>
            <li> I love bronners  soaps.  I don&#x27;t get itchy and dry skin. Since I started using it my skin has cleared up And it  does not itch anymore. and it does not leave a soapy residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use castile soap for of my personal soap needs and have tried most scents. This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BAD SKIN ISSUES, AND LIKE THIS SOAP.  tHIS WAS REINFORCED BY A SECOND-OPINION DERMATOLOGIST WHO SAID SHE LOVED THIS SOAP.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product, but it seems the manufacturer is keeping costs down by cutting back on aromatic oils.  It does not compare to their liquid soaps as they are 5 stars (in my opinion) all the way.</li>
            <li> Buy this and save your skin!!!..  I look young again!!!!  It smells wonderful and is healthy for you.  My skin feels great</li>
            <li> Yummy smell!  Good value for the money.  Long-lasting products!  This brand will always be a \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; when I want something special.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent, it cleans my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t appear to leave any residue or make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap!  THe smell of oranges is refreshing and whatever is in it has faded my mother&#x27;s and my age spots on our arms!  WE cannot believe it but our arms and skintone look amazingly better than before we used the soap.  Maybe our old chemical soap broght them out?  Maybe this one takes them away?  NOt sure, but a definite improvement in our skin for tone and softness and the best part is it is all natural on our bodies.  I have ordered this soap for a year now.  THink I am up to 5 or 6 reorders.  I have it in all of the bathrooms for handsoap and by the tubs for bathing.  Great stuff!!  THis is also the cheapest price that I have found.</li>
            <li> I grated this and made laundry soap out of it. The smell is fresh and clean and it has good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I was worried about ordering here and not liking the smell but it&#x27;s as good as everyone says.  I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the peppermint but I love the citrus.  Foams up great on a mesh pouf ball but rinses out easily.  No more body washes now.  I can just use these bars.</li>
            <li> I liked these soaps at first, but then they made my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Lathers (even without Laural sulfate)  :-)&lt;br /&gt;No filmy residue.( Other non chemical soaps leave)&lt;br /&gt;Mild sent. (No asthma reaction)&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s For a few years. Great quality.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the citrus on my clothes. Works excellent as part of my homemade laundry detergent. I like that it&#x27;s sold as a six pack</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> I keep my hair clipped with no guard, and a single bar of Bronner&#x27;s citrus is all I need in the shower - even for my hair.  Certainly makes traveling a breeze too.  Love everything about this company from the weird messaging, eco-everything, and quality products.  Also use their liquid soap in foam dispensers all around the house.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It produces a very refreshing scent that it not overwhelming and a soft, clean lather that does not leave the skin dry.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bronners bar soaps. I use this for everything.</li>
            <li> While Dr Bronnner clearly didn&#x27;t know Jesus Christ or who he was, he sure knew how to make a good soap without using chemicals!</li>
            <li> Great natiral soap. I like most of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> One of my favorite soaps in the world.</li>
            <li> I love this and the other variety soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great soap: at $25 bucks for 6 bars I find it pricey. Good soap however, family likes it.</li>
            <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps.  They are so mild and environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only soap I use now. Actually, I enjoy all their &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for baths----good lather, no fake chemical fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in my laundry detergent. I love the light citrus scent.</li>
