            <li> I use to not be a fan of Victoria Secret&#x27;s scented products, because I&#x27;m a little against smelling like I&#x27;ve just walked out of a French Bordeaux.  </li>
            <li> This is the only secret fantasies scent I can stand.</li>
            <li> It does not matter when we go to our local Victoria&#x60;s Secret store they are always old out of this product - very annoying.</li>
            <li> And Victoria Secret&#x27;s has done the Mango scent like no one else could.</li>

            <li> I use to not be a fan of Victoria Secret&#x27;s scented products, because I&#x27;m a little against smelling like I&#x27;ve just walked out of a French Bordeaux.  However when they came out with the Fantasy products, they had a hit on their hands. I don&#x27;t like all of them, but that is simply because I am adverse to strong smells, especially flowery ones. I love the Mango Temptation products. And Victoria Secret&#x27;s has done the Mango scent like no one else could.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but still a nice smell. I love the Endless Love one.</li>
            <li> Fragrance smells so good. Perfect for everyday use. Item arrived on time. Great price.</li>

            <li> I love this fragrance.. my first time buying this fragrance and I very satisfied..&lt;br /&gt;Plus fast delivery and yes! it is an original product.</li>
            <li> this is a lovely fragrance light and sweet i love spraying this on when im going to my bed at nights</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how smell</li>
            <li> Personally my favorite VS body spray and it came even sooner than the estimated date.</li>
            <li> Came on time &amp; smells great!</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRICE-VALUE RATIO .. MY PURCHASE WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s broke and doesn&#x27;t spay</li>
            <li> My aunt bought me this for Christmas and because I don&#x27;t care for mangoes, I threw it in the back of my closet. Fast forward seven months and I ran out of my former favorite scent and needed to use this in a pinch. And I&#x27;ll be! It smells soooooo good, it just took the lead for my favorite scent. I get complimented on it every single time I leave the house!</li>
            <li> This Body Mist has a wonderful smell to it.My wife loves the scent she loves  to wear Victoria&#x27;s Secret Body Mist but this has a really fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance because I bought some LoveSpell a while back and it turns out my husband hates it (psha!) so I bought this because I knew he liked mangoes.  It does smell mango-y, but there is a heavier smell in there somewhere (it smells a bit floral, but I don&#x27;t know what it is).  So just a heads up, it&#x27;s good, but it&#x27;s not entirely fruity.  I can smell about 80% mango, and about 20% something flowery.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend &amp; she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Clean and fruity but not overly sweet and cloying like some perfumes tend to be. This is the only secret fantasies scent I can stand. The rest smell like pungent hydrogen peroxide and I find it odd that alcohol is the first ingredient in their perfumes.</li>
            <li> I loved the fruity smell but was pissed when I got it in the mail and tryed to spray it and the cap was broke! Got it really quick though and overall a good scent</li>
            <li> excelente recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> Not my favorite and the scent vanishes. My husband likes it though which explains the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance because a coworker of mine had and I loved loved loved the smell.  I have gotten so many compliements when I go places because the smell is so fresh and clean.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering the Pure Seduction....my mistake.... but this one is nice too.</li>
