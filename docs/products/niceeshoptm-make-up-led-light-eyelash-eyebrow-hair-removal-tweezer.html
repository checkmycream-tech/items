            <li>Great quality, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just would have been nice to know when it would get here.</li>
            <li>I bought one from Revlon and an Ulta brand, but they weren&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>But it  nice to have.</li>
            <li>Nice tool</li>

            <li>Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works well and its very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent quality tool, arrived more quickly than anticipated, and FABULOUS price.</li>
            <li>went in garbage right away!!!</li>
            <li>So, my own hands were more helpful.</li>
            <li>Great Product - worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was so cheap b/c</li>
            <li>This tool makes putting on falsies so easy!</li>
            <li>Easy grip and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I would have paid much more for this, so I am very happy, pleasantly surprised and can&#x27;t wait to be a pro at this.</li>
            <li>Unlike your fingers, which block your view, and tweezers, which can poke your eyelid if you are not careful, this tool delivers a strip lash perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really liked this easy technique to get my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Does the job -- at $1 and change, it&#x27;s about the quality of metal you&#x27;d expect (cheap), but it works!</li>
            <li>Love this applicator was going to get it from Mac but Mac was 17$</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to place the lash</li>
            <li>and it does it so much more safely.</li>
            <li>I love being a girl.</li>
            <li>So much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li>No poking my eyes..  :-)</li>
            <li>I still love and use it.</li>
            <li>but im glad it came.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging too.</li>
            <li>More power and more inventions like this.</li>
            <li>Most websites and beauty supply stores sell them for $5 or more.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li>This eyelash applicator tool works much better than the one I already had.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>MAYBE WITH TIME :)</li>
            <li>Ok I guess..</li>
            <li>I would never be able to put on my individuals without it...</li>
            <li>I ain&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s the eyelashes</li>
            <li>Love it and makes applying falsies easier.</li>
            <li>This works 100X better for me than trying to get my lashes on in one fell swoop using an applicator like this product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its OKAY, I happen to have a tilted head tweezer that did the job as well as this &amp;#34;Special shape&amp;#34; Its helpful for lash beginners</li>
            <li>(whenever I use my fingers, I end up removing most of the glue and then end up with the lashes on my fingers).  </li>
            <li>i had to reorder more  for my clients</li>
            <li>I though this product was lost on the way, but gladly it arrived.</li>
            <li>The product is ok.  </li>
            <li>My advice, just spend a couple more dollars and go with some where else</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more for $1.00.</li>
            <li>When I finally get the hang of the application, this is the perfect accessory.</li>
            <li>The applicator holds more of the strip than the tweezers which allows for easier line up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is an ok product a lot more durable than it looks on here</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>better than a plastic one that cames in a kit.</li>
            <li>Easy to use great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>This product was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good for your eyelash if you are a first timer like me ..</li>
            <li>makes my eyelashes go on perfect every single time!</li>
            <li>This tool is good for someone without much eyelash applying experience.</li>
            <li>Nice love that it is stainless steel</li>
            <li>So easy to apply falsies...</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and the metal doesn&#x27;t stick to the glue as easily as plastic applicators.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to store in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>And makes it so easy to apply falsies</li>
            <li>The grip of the handle and the curve of the applicator make it so easy to apply lashes.</li>
            <li>Should have steady hands though and patience and experience with wearing eyelashes for this tool to be good.</li>
            <li>best thing to use when you area beginner, it helps push your eyelashes down when they are in the way.</li>
            <li>This product solved my problem; it&#x27;s extremely easy to use and cheap.  </li>
            <li>But a very good tool for loose just learning to apply the lashes .</li>
            <li>as il, good came early, can easily apply lahes</li>
            <li>Tried today for first time, very easy to use to get superclose to lashline without glue on fingers.</li>

            <li>only at amazon... so happy...</li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was more like a plastic item that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use much.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>very durable, exactly as described, and weighty, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would but its good quality.</li>
            <li>so well worth it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice tool for putting on lashes, it holds the lash, and can be used to meld your lashes to the new lashes.  </li>
            <li>I liked it applied the eyelashes well, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was I wasn&#x27;t able to track the purchase.</li>
            <li>i ever spent lol</li>
            <li>This item was actually really cool.</li>
            <li>I love the quality, the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>so i ended up spending twice as many for twice as much as I planed.</li>
            <li>Need good eye sight and deterity to make the device apply properly</li>
            <li>Cool for 99 cents.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are prettier and more symmetrical now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Works good, but regular tweezers will get the job done as well.</li>
            <li>Basically this tool is very helpful and easy to use, keeps fingers from messing up makeup and hassle free to apply lashes.</li>
            <li>This would be a great item for beginner lash wearers who aren&#x27;t ready for needle nose tweezers next to their eyes.</li>
            <li>Same as using tweezers but more safe</li>
            <li>Makes applying lashes fast and easy .</li>
            <li>It was really easy to use and it gripped on to the eyelashes really well.</li>
            <li>Makes it pretty much fool proof :)</li>
            <li>This really helps in applying the lashes and the end helps with keeping the ends to the glue!!</li>
            <li>Ive never used these before always regular tweezers but these with the curve help alot more!</li>
            <li>Great Little gadget.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>Helpful and useful.</li>
            <li>When you get the hang of things you will be using the edges to apply them and I love it also because I smash my lashes and the fakes lashes together giving it a natural look also.</li>
            <li>But it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It did take forever to arrive but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The seller is nice, replied me the next day I sent my concern of the shipment.  </li>
            <li>i think its worth the buy .</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for putting on false eyelashes evenly.</li>
            <li>right where  they need to be</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m right handed.</li>
            <li>so the lash falls right out.</li>
            <li>and they will stick your falsies right off after placing them on your eye.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, clean, no flaws.</li>
            <li>This is my new friend!!!</li>
            <li>Makes putting on eyelashes so much easier !</li>
            <li>It grips the eyelashes better than my fingers can when applying individual lashes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but just looking at them, I can tell they will most likely work.</li>
            <li>Perfect for putting on fake eyelashes</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a higher tech product.</li>
            <li>perfect tool for fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li>She loves wearing fake lashes, but struggles finding that perfect placement.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice , but really helps, especially if you are in a hurry, like most of us.</li>
            <li>I have found that tweezers really are the best for applying fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li>a little cheap, but good enough for the reaon I bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy because the small ends helps get closer to the lid than the ones that are supposed to cover the full lash as all eyes are different.</li>
            <li>It took so long, more than 20 days to receive it.</li>
            <li>To me, it would seem that tweezers work just as good if not better, and under $1</li>
            <li>I live in the United States, so these took a while to arrive, but they were totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a few more, because this is GENIUS!</li>
            <li>Ready for dressing up and being prepared</li>
            <li>The angle of it makes appling the lashes soooo much easier.</li>
            <li>Very helful.</li>
            <li>really helps make it easer to get lashes on.</li>
            <li>easiest is to use your fingers to get the lashes on straight-</li>
            <li>Very helpful for beginners</li>
            <li>it should come in a case so it doesn&#x27;t get lost so fast..</li>
            <li>i dont really know how to use it ...</li>
            <li>so I can see very well.</li>
            <li>this applicator helps out so much, and my fingers aren&#x27;t in the way.</li>
            <li>thanks to this item</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what I expected from this tool.</li>
            <li>These made eye lash application so much easier for me.</li>
            <li>Very use when applying lashes the strip not the singles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well-made too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply eyelash glue (not too much) to the lash.</li>
            <li>It makes applying eyelashes so much easier.</li>
            <li>It really helps when it comes to putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>Every one I know wants one now..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The shipment really bothered me.</li>
            <li>really helps.</li>
            <li>I will let you know when I get the knack of the whole process.</li>
            <li>Perfect for applying artificial lashes</li>
            <li>This applicator made the process much easier during my learning stage.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, but it does take some time to get used to.  </li>
            <li>Great tool for false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Great for applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Great for using with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Very handy,  really make putting on false eyelashes easier and quicker</li>
            <li>However, when I ordered this I thought it would be better than using my fingers and some tweezers due to the shape.</li>
            <li>Just take decent care of them</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This tiny tool has made eyelash application SO much easier!!</li>
            <li>Great beauty tool every woman should have (if wearing fake lashes).</li>
            <li>I like wearing false eyelashes on my regular weekend nights out and this applicator really does a great job in making my life easier.</li>
            <li>Does a good job but completely unnecessary when applying eyelashes in my opinion</li>
            <li>Since my right arm is spastic, I have to use my left hand to do stuff like this.</li>
            <li>She said that it takes the pain in butt, slide it to the left, nope to the right and stick the corner landing out of it.</li>
            <li>Tried it with my new lashes and it helped a lot getting them on since I have nails.</li>
            <li>I am new wearing eyelashes and these helps out and saves time.</li>
            <li>It is wide enough to grip nearly half of the lash length greatly improving my grip over tweezers.</li>
            <li>It works great on helping to add on your false eye lashes on, im a beginner too and its simple to use</li>
            <li>This really helps position the lashes, but I would like them better if the placement end was a little smaller.</li>
            <li>&amp; I usually use needle nose tweezers &amp; wanted to see if this would be more helpful.</li>
            <li>Received it two weeks early!</li>
            <li>Just as good as the high end, expensive pieces.</li>
            <li>Came really quick than i expected</li>
            <li>It is perfectly clear that you will have a wait to receive this item.......</li>
            <li>can do the same with any tweezers really</li>
            <li>Arrived way early.</li>
            <li>This definitely works well and allows you to put the eyelashes on much easier.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she should had said this was one of the more useful gifts that I bought her.</li>
            <li>For the price and postage paid no less - it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li>I think this will work very well putting on eye lashes and for other item that need to be held steady.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new to putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li>it kinda makes it hard to direct the lashes in the inner and outer corners because it is not as precise as tweasers</li>
            <li>I love this clamp to place the false eyelashes</li>
            <li>I love this false lash tool.</li>
            <li>I like it better than trying to apply false lashes with tweezers.</li>
            <li>this little tool helps put the eye lashes right where they need to be.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I can actually see where I&#x27;m placing my false lashes now..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sturdy piece and easy to use, and totally necessary if you&#x27;re planning on applying fake lashes on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal won&#x27;t rust either, so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about upkeep.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are not as long (no where near) as they once were.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re useless if you wear very natural falsies like me as it is too easy to accidentally get glue on these</li>
            <li>-30 seconds for the glue to set a little bit... then proceed to apply the lash, first from the outer corner of the eye, then the middle, then the inner eye.</li>

            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Great quality, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just would have been nice to know when it would get here.</li>
            <li> I bought one from Revlon and an Ulta brand, but they weren&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li> But it  nice to have.</li>
            <li> Nice tool</li>
            <li> where can u find this kind of stuff?</li>
            <li> It will help get them on nicely.</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works well and its very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality tool, arrived more quickly than anticipated, and FABULOUS price.</li>
            <li> went in garbage right away!!!</li>
            <li> So, my own hands were more helpful.</li>
            <li> Great Product - worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good thing it was so cheap b/c</li>
            <li> This tool makes putting on falsies so easy!</li>
            <li> Easy grip and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I would have paid much more for this, so I am very happy, pleasantly surprised and can&#x27;t wait to be a pro at this.</li>
            <li> Unlike your fingers, which block your view, and tweezers, which can poke your eyelid if you are not careful, this tool delivers a strip lash perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this easy technique to get my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Does the job -- at $1 and change, it&#x27;s about the quality of metal you&#x27;d expect (cheap), but it works!</li>
            <li> Love this applicator was going to get it from Mac but Mac was 17$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to place the lash</li>
            <li> and it does it so much more safely.</li>
            <li> I love being a girl.</li>
            <li> So much better than tweezers.</li>
            <li> No poking my eyes..  :-)</li>
            <li> I still love and use it.</li>
            <li> but im glad it came.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging too.</li>
            <li> More power and more inventions like this.</li>
            <li> Most websites and beauty supply stores sell them for $5 or more.</li>
            <li> I should have ordered more.</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator tool works much better than the one I already had.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> MAYBE WITH TIME :)</li>
            <li> Ok I guess..</li>
            <li> I would never be able to put on my individuals without it...</li>
            <li> I ain&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s the eyelashes</li>
            <li> Love it and makes applying falsies easier.</li>
            <li> This works 100X better for me than trying to get my lashes on in one fell swoop using an applicator like this product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its OKAY, I happen to have a tilted head tweezer that did the job as well as this &amp;#34;Special shape&amp;#34; Its helpful for lash beginners</li>
            <li> (whenever I use my fingers, I end up removing most of the glue and then end up with the lashes on my fingers).  </li>
            <li> i had to reorder more  for my clients</li>
            <li> I though this product was lost on the way, but gladly it arrived.</li>
            <li> The product is ok.  </li>
            <li> My advice, just spend a couple more dollars and go with some where else</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for anything more for $1.00.</li>
            <li> When I finally get the hang of the application, this is the perfect accessory.</li>
            <li> The applicator holds more of the strip than the tweezers which allows for easier line up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this is an ok product a lot more durable than it looks on here</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> better than a plastic one that cames in a kit.</li>
            <li> Easy to use great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product was pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good for your eyelash if you are a first timer like me ..</li>
            <li> makes my eyelashes go on perfect every single time!</li>
            <li> This tool is good for someone without much eyelash applying experience.</li>
            <li> Nice love that it is stainless steel</li>
            <li> So easy to apply falsies...</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and the metal doesn&#x27;t stick to the glue as easily as plastic applicators.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and easy to store in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> And makes it so easy to apply falsies</li>
            <li> The grip of the handle and the curve of the applicator make it so easy to apply lashes.</li>
            <li> Should have steady hands though and patience and experience with wearing eyelashes for this tool to be good.</li>
            <li> best thing to use when you area beginner, it helps push your eyelashes down when they are in the way.</li>
            <li> This product solved my problem; it&#x27;s extremely easy to use and cheap.  </li>
            <li> But a very good tool for loose just learning to apply the lashes .</li>
            <li> as il, good came early, can easily apply lahes</li>
            <li> Tried today for first time, very easy to use to get superclose to lashline without glue on fingers.</li>
            <li> This little gadget is great!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and is the perfect weight - not too heavy and cumbersome.</li>

            <li> + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> only at amazon... so happy...</li>
            <li> its cheap</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was more like a plastic item that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use much.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> very durable, exactly as described, and weighty, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would but its good quality.</li>
            <li> so well worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool for putting on lashes, it holds the lash, and can be used to meld your lashes to the new lashes.  </li>
            <li> I liked it applied the eyelashes well, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was I wasn&#x27;t able to track the purchase.</li>
            <li> i ever spent lol</li>
            <li> This item was actually really cool.</li>
            <li> I love the quality, the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> so i ended up spending twice as many for twice as much as I planed.</li>
            <li> Need good eye sight and deterity to make the device apply properly</li>
            <li> Cool for 99 cents.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are prettier and more symmetrical now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Works good, but regular tweezers will get the job done as well.</li>
            <li> Basically this tool is very helpful and easy to use, keeps fingers from messing up makeup and hassle free to apply lashes.</li>
            <li> This would be a great item for beginner lash wearers who aren&#x27;t ready for needle nose tweezers next to their eyes.</li>
            <li> Same as using tweezers but more safe</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes fast and easy .</li>
            <li> It was really easy to use and it gripped on to the eyelashes really well.</li>
            <li> Makes it pretty much fool proof :)</li>
            <li> This really helps in applying the lashes and the end helps with keeping the ends to the glue!!</li>
            <li> Ive never used these before always regular tweezers but these with the curve help alot more!</li>
            <li> Great Little gadget.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li> Helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> When you get the hang of things you will be using the edges to apply them and I love it also because I smash my lashes and the fakes lashes together giving it a natural look also.</li>
            <li> But it was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It did take forever to arrive but it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The seller is nice, replied me the next day I sent my concern of the shipment.  </li>
            <li> i think its worth the buy .</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for putting on false eyelashes evenly.</li>
            <li> right where  they need to be</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m right handed.</li>
            <li> so the lash falls right out.</li>
            <li> and they will stick your falsies right off after placing them on your eye.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, clean, no flaws.</li>
            <li> This is my new friend!!!</li>
            <li> Makes putting on eyelashes so much easier !</li>
            <li> It grips the eyelashes better than my fingers can when applying individual lashes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but just looking at them, I can tell they will most likely work.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a higher tech product.</li>
            <li> perfect tool for fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li> She loves wearing fake lashes, but struggles finding that perfect placement.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice , but really helps, especially if you are in a hurry, like most of us.</li>
            <li> I have found that tweezers really are the best for applying fake eyelashes.</li>
            <li> a little cheap, but good enough for the reaon I bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy because the small ends helps get closer to the lid than the ones that are supposed to cover the full lash as all eyes are different.</li>
            <li> It took so long, more than 20 days to receive it.</li>
            <li> To me, it would seem that tweezers work just as good if not better, and under $1</li>
            <li> I live in the United States, so these took a while to arrive, but they were totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a few more, because this is GENIUS!</li>
            <li> Ready for dressing up and being prepared</li>
            <li> The angle of it makes appling the lashes soooo much easier.</li>
            <li> Very helful.</li>
            <li> really helps make it easer to get lashes on.</li>
            <li> easiest is to use your fingers to get the lashes on straight-</li>
            <li> Very helpful for beginners</li>
            <li> it should come in a case so it doesn&#x27;t get lost so fast..</li>
            <li> i dont really know how to use it ...</li>
            <li> so I can see very well.</li>
            <li> this applicator helps out so much, and my fingers aren&#x27;t in the way.</li>
            <li> thanks to this item</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what I expected from this tool.</li>
            <li> These made eye lash application so much easier for me.</li>
            <li> Very use when applying lashes the strip not the singles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-made too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply eyelash glue (not too much) to the lash.</li>
            <li> It makes applying eyelashes so much easier.</li>
            <li> It really helps when it comes to putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> Every one I know wants one now..</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The shipment really bothered me.</li>
            <li> really helps.</li>
            <li> I will let you know when I get the knack of the whole process.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying artificial lashes</li>
            <li> This applicator made the process much easier during my learning stage.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, but it does take some time to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Great tool for false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great for applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Great for using with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Very handy,  really make putting on false eyelashes easier and quicker</li>
            <li> However, when I ordered this I thought it would be better than using my fingers and some tweezers due to the shape.</li>
            <li> Just take decent care of them</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This tiny tool has made eyelash application SO much easier!!</li>
            <li> Great beauty tool every woman should have (if wearing fake lashes).</li>
            <li> I like wearing false eyelashes on my regular weekend nights out and this applicator really does a great job in making my life easier.</li>
            <li> Does a good job but completely unnecessary when applying eyelashes in my opinion</li>
            <li> Since my right arm is spastic, I have to use my left hand to do stuff like this.</li>
            <li> She said that it takes the pain in butt, slide it to the left, nope to the right and stick the corner landing out of it.</li>
            <li> Tried it with my new lashes and it helped a lot getting them on since I have nails.</li>
            <li> I am new wearing eyelashes and these helps out and saves time.</li>
            <li> It is wide enough to grip nearly half of the lash length greatly improving my grip over tweezers.</li>
            <li> It works great on helping to add on your false eye lashes on, im a beginner too and its simple to use</li>
            <li> This really helps position the lashes, but I would like them better if the placement end was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> &amp; I usually use needle nose tweezers &amp; wanted to see if this would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Received it two weeks early!</li>
            <li> Just as good as the high end, expensive pieces.</li>
            <li> Came really quick than i expected</li>
            <li> It is perfectly clear that you will have a wait to receive this item.......</li>
            <li> can do the same with any tweezers really</li>
            <li> Arrived way early.</li>
            <li> This definitely works well and allows you to put the eyelashes on much easier.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she should had said this was one of the more useful gifts that I bought her.</li>
            <li> For the price and postage paid no less - it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I think this will work very well putting on eye lashes and for other item that need to be held steady.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new to putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it kinda makes it hard to direct the lashes in the inner and outer corners because it is not as precise as tweasers</li>
            <li> I love this clamp to place the false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love this false lash tool.</li>
            <li> I like it better than trying to apply false lashes with tweezers.</li>
            <li> this little tool helps put the eye lashes right where they need to be.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I can actually see where I&#x27;m placing my false lashes now..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy piece and easy to use, and totally necessary if you&#x27;re planning on applying fake lashes on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal won&#x27;t rust either, so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about upkeep.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are not as long (no where near) as they once were.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re useless if you wear very natural falsies like me as it is too easy to accidentally get glue on these</li>
            <li> -30 seconds for the glue to set a little bit... then proceed to apply the lash, first from the outer corner of the eye, then the middle, then the inner eye.</li>
            <li> It also took a little longer than normal to get it since it came from over seas (about 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> daily, so cutting time on makeup is one of my favorite solution.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsier than I thought it would be, it&#x27;s not firm like tweezers, but it does provide a barrier between your hands and your clients&#x27; eyes and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> This is very bulky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> a little awkward to use  I have to use the regular kind  </li>
            <li> I wish I had of purchased one of these long ago.</li>
            <li> I purchased it, as a makeup artist, to use on clients to avoid poking anyone with my long nails.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship, but I was prepared for that.</li>
            <li> Very thin and cheaply made</li>
            <li> This item is scratched all over and you can tell it is not new</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the stainless steel us as little slippery.</li>
            <li> I then use the tweezers to put down the inner &amp; outer corners.</li>
            <li> Helps press the lashes down to help with sticking and drying for longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must half for placing eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> The product does not hold the lashes tight enough.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be using them everyday.</li>
            <li> No real grip.</li>
            <li> be careful and check the amount, it automatically went to 2</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> I got this way sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s heavy duty, especially for .99 cents.</li>
            <li> total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Really helps when applying false lashes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little long but expected.</li>
            <li> Although I must admit, tweezers do the same thing except I was afraid of poking my eye out ;-).</li>
            <li> I am so used to using tweezers so this tool was pretty much useless to me.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d recommend using needle nose tweezers instead, if one was to choose one or the other.</li>
            <li> Regular tweezers work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Really helps when applying fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product, only the fact that&#x27;s its made applying my falsies a hell of a lot easier!</li>
            <li> Also the end can be used to pat down the lash.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can use these to tamp down the lashes instead of using your fingers</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little like using tweezers--in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> It might work for other people but not for me!</li>
            <li> And this little gadget is so, so helpful.  </li>

            <li> I wear eyelashes everyday</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t t know how to apply them and always have trouble ..</li>

            <li> I will never again try to apply false lashes without this little tool.</li>
            <li> I bought them to late cause</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> can not figure out how it works for me but i like it</li>
            <li> Ready for dressing up and being prepared</li>
            <li> I will never again try to apply false lashes without this little tool. It is wonderful and allows me to get close enough to apply lashes perfectly every time.  Unlike your fingers, which block your view, and tweezers, which can poke your eyelid if you are not careful, this tool delivers a strip lash perfectly. It is very easy to use. I bought two.</li>
            <li> Metal is nice and good grip.</li>
            <li> This item was actually really cool. The angle of it makes appling the lashes soooo much easier. It&#x27;s worth every penny**</li>
            <li> Estoy aprendiendo a usarlo. LOL</li>
            <li> highly recommended. Recieved today 12/02/2014</li>
            <li> This would be a great item for beginner lash wearers who aren&#x27;t ready for needle nose tweezers next to their eyes. However, when I ordered this I thought it would be better than using my fingers and some tweezers due to the shape. I am so used to using tweezers so this tool was pretty much useless to me. But the tool is well crafted and I would recommend this for beginners.</li>
            <li> If you wear false lashes , this is a must have item ! Makes applying lashes fast and easy .</li>
            <li> I love the item it works great and i would recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Does make my life so much easier because I&#x27;m horrible at applying eyelashes but these makes it wayyyyyy easier. If your horrible at applying like myself do purchase. Does take awhile but worth the wait !!!!!</li>
            <li> Does the job -- at $1 and change, it&#x27;s about the quality of metal you&#x27;d expect (cheap), but it works!</li>
            <li> this little tool helps put the eye lashes right where they need to be. ill be buying another one</li>
            <li> I love this clamp to place the false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Having difficulty using this, but it may just take some practice!</li>

            <li> Great quality, and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t quite work with these....</li>
            <li> Great tool for false eyelashes. Great price!</li>
            <li> Very helful. I love it!</li>
            <li> They work great! I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Works great, just what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Really helps when applying fake lashes.  It&#x27;s a sturdy piece and easy to use, and totally necessary if you&#x27;re planning on applying fake lashes on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal won&#x27;t rust either, so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about upkeep.  Just take decent care of them and they will last forever.</li>
            <li> really helps make it easer to get lashes on.</li>
            <li> Worthless!! - can&#x27;t figure out the purpose- easiest is to use your fingers to get the lashes on straight- went in garbage right away!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Tried it with my new lashes and it helped a lot getting them on since I have nails. Will definitely be using them everyday.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if this was necessary. I wasn&#x27;t so skillful. So, my own hands were more helpful.</li>
            <li> Still cannot get strip lashes on with these.  I need practice.  These make it easy to hold the lashes with a good grip!  I&#x27;ll keep trying, and we shall see.  I know it is my eyesight.  Not the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add to this review later.</li>
            <li> Great Little gadget. Takes some practice , but really helps, especially if you are in a hurry, like most of us.</li>
            <li> Very good for trying to put on eyelashes as a beginner.</li>
            <li> Very handy,  really make putting on false eyelashes easier and quicker</li>
            <li> This product was pretty good. The grip its wonderful. The awesome part about it is that the eyelashes stay on tighter because of the niceEshop extension tool. Loved it!</li>
            <li> This is very bulky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for beginners</li>
            <li> The tool is very small and I was unable to find any use for it.  Also came without any instructions and the ship time was very slow snd delayed.</li>
            <li> Nice love that it is stainless steel</li>
            <li> great for putting on my eyelashes. I am new wearing eyelashes and these helps out and saves time.</li>
            <li> I love the quality, the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> very durable, exactly as described, and weighty, I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would but its good quality.</li>
            <li> not well put together. The product does not hold the lashes tight enough.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality.  No real grip.</li>
            <li> it should come in a case so it doesn&#x27;t get lost so fast..;p</li>
            <li> Does the job and is the perfect weight - not too heavy and cumbersome. It is wide enough to grip nearly half of the lash length greatly improving my grip over tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> Love this applicator was going to get it from Mac but Mac was 17$ and I got mines for 2$ shipping took about 3 weeks but it&#x27;s perfect for applying lashes .</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I ordered this tool.  I was able to apply my lashes flawlessly this weekend.</li>
            <li> Does a good job but completely unnecessary when applying eyelashes in my opinion</li>
            <li> Pass on this item.  is as described and maybe it&#x27;s operator error but I can&#x27;t get the hang of this and wind up using my fingers and tweezers instead.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tool for putting on lashes, it holds the lash, and can be used to meld your lashes to the new lashes.  Good product.  Also the end can be used to pat down the lash.</li>
            <li> My lashes are not as long (no where near) as they once were.  Also not as thick.  So applying faux lashes is a necessity.  And this little gadget is so, so helpful.  I&#x27;m able to place the lash right where  they need to be and it does it so much more safely.</li>
            <li> be careful and check the amount, it automatically went to 2 so i ended up spending twice as many for twice as much as I planed.</li>
            <li> Very thin and cheaply made</li>
            <li> These things are a must-have if you wear eyelashes a lot. Especially if you have nails. Should have steady hands though and patience and experience with wearing eyelashes for this tool to be good.</li>
            <li> Really hard for me to use this</li>
            <li> This tiny tool has made eyelash application SO much easier!!</li>
            <li> This works great.  I wish I had of purchased one of these long ago.</li>
            <li> I recently Purchased for a friend that was looking for them for quite some time. She swears by it for applying fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> My wife has difficulty using this product. Need good eye sight and deterity to make the device apply properly</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase, it arrived today and I can&#x27;t wait to try this out. It fits comfortable in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on my lashes.  Prefer this over the tweezers.</li>
            <li> Makes putting on eyelashes so much easier ! I recommend this if you are just starting out with lashes or even if you are a pro!</li>
            <li> i love this! makes my eyelashes go on perfect every single time! best dollar i ever spent lol i reccomend</li>
            <li> It just like the picture.</li>
            <li> This really helps in applying the lashes and the end helps with keeping the ends to the glue!! Never have to use my fingers again!</li>
            <li> its alright. can do the same with any tweezers really</li>
            <li> This little gadget is great! I have MS and I&#x27;m right handed. I love wearing my fake lashes. Since my right arm is spastic, I have to use my left hand to do stuff like this. Works like a charm!! I love being a girl. It&#x27;s wonderful to be vain.</li>
            <li> i dont really know how to use it ... im still getting the hang of it but I will order again if I need to</li>
            <li> I liked it applied the eyelashes well, the only thing i didn&#x27;t like was I wasn&#x27;t able to track the purchase. I don&#x27;t mind the time it took to get here. Just would have been nice to know when it would get here. Then again I like getting surprises in snail mail, over all I gave it 4 stars. Great product, does the job, affordable. Tracking was just the only problem, but not that big of a deal to me.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have put my eyelashes on with out this little tool.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very cute gadget!! So easy to apply falsies... What a breeeeeze!!! So much better than tweezers. No poking my eyes..  :-)</li>
            <li> It grips the eyelashes better than my fingers can when applying individual lashes. Although I would rather have one with rubber tips instead of metal.</li>
            <li> Cool for 99 cents. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and the metal doesn&#x27;t stick to the glue as easily as plastic applicators. I&#x27;m happy because the small ends helps get closer to the lid than the ones that are supposed to cover the full lash as all eyes are different.</li>
            <li> This tool makes putting on falsies so easy!</li>
            <li> To me, it would seem that tweezers work just as good if not better, and under $1</li>
            <li> I love this false lash tool. I bought one from Revlon and an Ulta brand, but they weren&#x27;t as nice. The only negative is that the stainless steel us as little slippery. I wish there were finger grips on these. I still love and use it. It also took a little longer than normal to get it since it came from over seas (about 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, clean, no flaws. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but just looking at them, I can tell they will most likely work.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my kit. I dont likoevusing my fingers to apply eyelashes so I was loking for a way and i came across this. Came really quick than i expected but im glad it came. I love the packaging too.</li>
            <li> In theory should work, but too rigid and don&#x27;t meet precisely enough to grasp eyelash.</li>
            <li> It works really really good!</li>
            <li> I wear eyelashes everyday &amp; I usually use needle nose tweezers &amp; wanted to see if this would be more helpful. While it is def helpful in ways I can&#x27;t use it solely. I use it to place my eyelashes &amp; it keeps my hand out of the way so I can see very well. I then use the tweezers to put down the inner &amp; outer corners. I must use the two though &amp; not just this tool. Bummed about that. I hate but have to say, I&#x27;d recommend using needle nose tweezers instead, if one was to choose one or the other.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are prettier and more symmetrical now thanks to this product. More power and more inventions like this.</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> The part where the eyelash is placed is so small it&#x27;s a little like using tweezers--in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I can actually see where I&#x27;m placing my false lashes now.. this applicator helps out so much, and my fingers aren&#x27;t in the way. I recommend this to anyone whom uses falsies daily.. And it&#x27;s at a great low price!</li>
            <li> I  am still learning  how  to  use this  utensil. But it  nice to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try out fake eyelashes, but i could never apply them... thanks to this item i finally figured it out!</li>
            <li> Helpful and useful. Good idea and excellent purchase. 5 star seller. HIGHLY recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice tool but it doesn&#x27;t really do the job. My eyelashes come out more perfect without them.</li>
            <li> Basically this tool is very helpful and easy to use, keeps fingers from messing up makeup and hassle free to apply lashes. great for the price.</li>
            <li> as il, good came early, can easily apply lahes</li>
            <li> These little tool makes it easy to handle the false eyelashes without using pointy and dangerous tweezers or fumbling with your fingers.</li>
            <li> best thing to use when you area beginner, it helps push your eyelashes down when they are in the way. When you get the hang of things you will be using the edges to apply them and I love it also because I smash my lashes and the fakes lashes together giving it a natural look also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what I expected from this tool. I purchased it, as a makeup artist, to use on clients to avoid poking anyone with my long nails. And for sanitation purposes. It&#x27;s a little flimsier than I thought it would be, it&#x27;s not firm like tweezers, but it does provide a barrier between your hands and your clients&#x27; eyes and serves its purpose. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price from this seller! Most websites and beauty supply stores sell them for $5 or more.</li>
            <li> These are great and sturdy!</li>
            <li> I should have ordered more. This is so easy to use. Especially if you just started using falsies. I recomend it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator tool works much better than the one I already had.  It is easy to use and easy to store in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Wierd!! I didn&#x27;t like how uneven it is...</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with applying my eye lashes and this little device helps me a lot...!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price! But it does take a while to get here (I&#x27;m from Ohio). But it was well worth the wait. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for putting on false eyelashes evenly. I will tell all my friends about this product. Love it</li>
            <li> These made eye lash application so much easier for me. I donut know what I would do with out them now.</li>
            <li> Very use when applying lashes the strip not the singles.</li>
            <li> Great buy and product love it</li>
            <li> Eh. Tweezers do a good job too. SORRY!</li>
            <li> it kinda makes it hard to direct the lashes in the inner and outer corners because it is not as precise as tweasers</li>
            <li> It works great on helping to add on your false eye lashes on, im a beginner too and its simple to use</li>
            <li> I like the tweezers. Very easy to use. Shipping was a little long but expected. I bought them to late cause now I don&#x27;t even need them.</li>
            <li> Good design and well made.</li>
            <li> Made applying eyelashes 10X easier</li>
            <li> I thought these would work a lot better than my tweezers...but they dont!  I was very disappointed but it is what it is!  It might work for other people but not for me!</li>
            <li> Awesome Eyelash Tool. Easy to use. I give the Seller a Five Star Rating. Well priced, deliver on time and securely packed.</li>
            <li> nothing special....disappointed</li>
            <li> HARD TO USE... MAYBE WITH TIME :)</li>
            <li> a little cheap, but good enough for the reaon I bought</li>
            <li> Still getting use to it.. Ok I guess.. A little to soon to tell</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> I would never be able to put on my individuals without it...</li>
            <li> Perfect for putting on fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Makes putting on lashes so easy!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product, its easier to apply your falsies with this tool, oppose to using tweezers.</li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t seem to get these buggers to stick to my eyelids...</li>
            <li> I got this way sooner than I expected. For the price it&#x27;s a bargain. It truly is helpful in applying eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Regular tweezers work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Answer for putting on False Eyelashes!!!!!! I have ordered 2 or 3 just in case I lose!</li>
            <li> very handy if you aren&#x27;t good with applying falsies</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me put on lashes any easier than using regular tweezers or my hands but it was cheep so OH WELL!</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator is great. It was really easy to use and it gripped on to the eyelashes really well. I was comfortable putting it around my eyes, so that was awesome.</li>
            <li> I like wearing false eyelashes on my regular weekend nights out and this applicator really does a great job in making my life easier. It works well and its very easy to use. It&#x27;s very well-made too. It&#x27;s for keeps!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a good grip. I ain&#x27;t sure if it&#x27;s the eyelashes</li>
            <li> It did take forever to arrive but it was totally worth it. Love it and makes applying falsies easier.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t Get The Hang Of Using These.</li>
            <li> Mine were uneven and did not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, ladies... I have found that tweezers really are the best for applying fake eyelashes. These types of applicators have only ever complicated the process for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FALSIE TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply eyelash glue (not too much) to the lash. Wait 15-30 seconds for the glue to set a little bit... then proceed to apply the lash, first from the outer corner of the eye, then the middle, then the inner eye. This works 100X better for me than trying to get my lashes on in one fell swoop using an applicator like this product I am reviewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This item is scratched all over and you can tell it is not new</li>
            <li> I think this will work very well putting on eye lashes and for other item that need to be held steady.</li>
            <li> Great Product - worth the wait. It makes applying eyelashes so much easier. For the price and postage paid no less - it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Ive never used these before always regular tweezers but these with the curve help alot more! Cuts on applying time.</li>
            <li> It really helps when it comes to putting on eyelashes. Great tool! Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is new to putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> Arrived way early. Lines up perfectly to grasp eyelashes. Perfect shape. Great tool.</li>
            <li> Great item to put on the falses..but i still alr&lt;br /&gt;Ternate from this one to a plucker...</li>
            <li> Definitely a must half for placing eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;No need spending all that money&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the cheapest one you can find</li>
            <li> Its OKAY, I happen to have a tilted head tweezer that did the job as well as this &amp;#34;Special shape&amp;#34; Its helpful for lash beginners</li>
            <li> Every one I know wants one now.. I got tired of all my other options  for putting in my lashes.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> The end that&#x27;s supposed to hold the lashes doesn&#x27;t even touch when you squeeze it shut so the lash falls right out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking me time to get use to using this but I do find that it works well.</li>
            <li> Works good, but regular tweezers will get the job done as well.</li>
            <li> I lost my eyelashes to chemotherapy and have been trying to use false ones. These actually helped me place the eyelashes quite well. I had been using pointy tweezers, but these won&#x27;t poke your eye out. Plus, you can use these to tamp down the lashes instead of using your fingers (whenever I use my fingers, I end up removing most of the glue and then end up with the lashes on my fingers).  These are inexpensive and are good quality. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone. I live in the United States, so these took a while to arrive, but they were totally worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator is great!  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The reason I bought it because I have been using a tweezers, clipper, or my hand to put on [[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC false eyelashes]].  Tweezers and clippers are kinda dangerous when use close to my eyes.  Hands are a little messy and hard to use.  My works require wearing [[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC false eyelashes]] daily, so cutting time on makeup is one of my favorite solution.  This product solved my problem; it&#x27;s extremely easy to use and cheap.  Shipping might take 3-4 weeks to arrive, so please be patient!  I bought this applicator to use with my false eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00QDUX1UC False Eyelashes - 70 Pairs in 7 Different Styles Allows You to Select Your Look From Natural to Dramatic! + FREE Bonuses]]</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll.......especially for the price point!!</li>
            <li> affordable and awesome for the price.. where can u find this kind of stuff? only at amazon... so happy...</li>
            <li> hard to use on false eye lashes</li>
            <li> This really helps position the lashes, but I would like them better if the placement end was a little smaller.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality tool, arrived more quickly than anticipated, and FABULOUS price. Tried today for first time, very easy to use to get superclose to lashline without glue on fingers. I am ordering a few more, because this is GENIUS!</li>
            <li> best device  i had to reorder more  for my clients</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a higher tech product. I was thinking it was more like a plastic item that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use much. Well, it&#x27;s heavy duty, especially for .99 cents. Out of three different product from China(shipping to Georgia, USA) it was the last to come in, but inside it&#x27;s estimated time. I like it! Thanks.</li>
            <li> What a view in the picture is what came to me I really liked this easy technique to get my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product arrived at my post box yesterday. It took so long, more than 20 days to receive it. I though this product was lost on the way, but gladly it arrived. The seller is nice, replied me the next day I sent my concern of the shipment.  The quality of this product is good. I havent tried it yet, but I have a good feeling of it. Overall, I will give 4 stars. The shipment really bothered me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work... Very uncomfortable to use...</li>
            <li> its very good for placing your eyelashes. really helps. i think its worth the buy . arrived after a month but i wasn&#x27;t in a hurry. like a big tweezer.</li>
            <li> The product is ok.  The packaging it came in did not match the product, which leaves me wondering what type of place this comes from.  Also the shippind took over a month.  My advice, just spend a couple more dollars and go with some where else</li>
            <li> It is perfectly clear that you will have a wait to receive this item.......so can&#x27;t complain about that at all. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more for $1.00. When I finally get the hang of the application, this is the perfect accessory. At least I am not endangering my eyes with tweezers. I would have paid much more for this, so I am very happy, pleasantly surprised and can&#x27;t wait to be a pro at this. I will let you know when I get the knack of the whole process. You have nothing to lose but a dollar, with a tweezers you could lose an eye.</li>
            <li> Great for applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> perfect tool for fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li> Great tool for eyelash application!</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying artificial lashes</li>
            <li> Came before 6/15 but I find this hard to use or atleast I&#x27;m not having any luck wit it</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes easier! Easy to use. Wish they had it in a different color.</li>
            <li> This tool is good for someone without much eyelash applying experience. It will help get them on nicely. I haven&#x27;t tried it, as I have a a lot of experience in that department. Don&#x27;t know why I ordered. Maybe one day it will come in handy!</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Works great!</li>
            <li> VERY Good Quality for the price!! Heavy duty and everything! Easy grip and gets the job done! Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This item was great for the price and I received it much earlier than promised. I found an almost exact match at sephora.com and theirs was $12!!!!!  This is an incredible deal and an amazing product for falsies.</li>
            <li> Really helps when applying false lashes.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just as described.</li>
            <li> Great for using with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Received it two weeks early! Just as described!</li>
            <li> total waste of money. Good thing it was so cheap b/c it didn&#x27;t serve it&#x27;s purpose at all.</li>
            <li> I have recently started wearing strip false eyelashes and I could not get the hang of putting them on. This applicator made the process much easier during my learning stage.  It is like training wheels on a bike and the price could not be beat. Although I must admit, tweezers do the same thing except I was afraid of poking my eye out ;-). The applicator holds more of the strip than the tweezers which allows for easier line up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for the beginner false eyelash wearer.</li>
            <li> This item works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I like it better than trying to apply false lashes with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a little difficult to use . But a very good tool for loose just learning to apply the lashes . Great price and well made .</li>
            <li> I love this! This helps me get my lashes on and to stay on. This is my new friend!!!</li>
            <li> this is an ok product a lot more durable than it looks on here</li>
            <li> Does the job nicely. Great price. Took a long time to ship, but I was prepared for that.</li>
            <li> these work no better than a pair of tweezers . not worth the money</li>
            <li> great quality. i use it often.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the high end, expensive pieces. Took about 2 weeks for delivery but so well worth it!</li>
            <li> i received it and it was broken</li>
            <li> Good for your eyelash if you are a first timer like me .. Good job</li>
            <li> Love it. Good quality. And makes it so easy to apply falsies</li>
            <li> a little awkward to use  I have to use the regular kind  thought id try it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these, they SUCK! They&#x27;re useless if you wear very natural falsies like me as it is too easy to accidentally get glue on these and they will stick your falsies right off after placing them on your eye.</li>
            <li> Very useful. Helps press the lashes down to help with sticking and drying for longer lasting results.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool. Same as using tweezers but more safe so u don&#x27;t poke yourself in the eye. Took  awhile to get here tho</li>
            <li> These are very nice and handy for a newbie lash user like me.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but it does take some time to get used to.  But it is def. better than a plastic one that cames in a kit.</li>
            <li> How can one not love these!! The grip of the handle and the curve of the applicator make it so easy to apply lashes. The price is ridiculously low.</li>
            <li> Great beauty tool every woman should have (if wearing fake lashes). It&#x27;s a product must and will save you time and energy putting the lashes on. So convenient.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me that this was one of the best gifts that I bought her for Christmas...hugh? The money, Coach bag, etc and THIS was a great gift? Needless to say, she should had said this was one of the more useful gifts that I bought her. She loves wearing fake lashes, but struggles finding that perfect placement. She said that it takes the pain in butt, slide it to the left, nope to the right and stick the corner landing out of it.</li>
            <li> This item is great ..its cheap and it helps you apply your eyelashes ...I don&#x27;t t know how to apply them and always have trouble ..but this eyelash applyer is awesome</li>
            <li> This definitely works well and allows you to put the eyelashes on much easier.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying falsies. Makes it pretty much fool proof :)</li>
            <li> bottom line.... i will never wear lashes without it, and once u purchase youll see why.</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product, only the fact that&#x27;s its made applying my falsies a hell of a lot easier! I literally feel so lost whenever I misplace it and try applying them without it. Must buy!</li>
