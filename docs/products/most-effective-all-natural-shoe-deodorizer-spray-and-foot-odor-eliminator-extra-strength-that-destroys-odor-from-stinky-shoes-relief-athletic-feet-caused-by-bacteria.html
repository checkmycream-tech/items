            <li>I have received this product free in turn for my review of their product.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely write reviews, that says a lot about this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week (since I received it) and it has worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>and I can significantly feel the difference in smell.</li>
            <li>Actually was never able to fine anything and this honestly is the best!</li>
            <li>Honestly I was surprised</li>
            <li>Okay, straight up.</li>
            <li>My opinions and sensitive nose are my own.</li>
            <li>However this review will be unbiased despite not having paid full price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have deducted a full star, but there&#x27;s no 4.5 rating, if there was it would be 4.5.</li>
            <li>I spray it directly into my shoes and on my feet, and honestly, it makes my feet feel refreshed and my shoes smell fresher.</li>
            <li>Rocky Mountain Essentials is also a great company and will absolutely reach out to you if you are anything less than satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li>his feet and shoes sndbite helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>The Natural Shoe Deodorizer &amp; Foot Deodorant is great because it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I have a shoe cabinet where shoes just get tossed inside, rarely does anything get aired out and suffice to say it doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for kids playing outside or for those whose feet sweat a lot, especially during the hot summer months.</li>

            <li>And Feel fresh</li>
            <li>But with the temperatures near 100 here we sure did need this.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh minty smell.</li>
            <li>I like this much better than others on the market because of the scent and it not being natural.</li>
            <li>But it did tame it, so I&#x27;m still very pleased, and would comfortably recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks For The Promotion, I Really Love This Natural Show Deodorizer, My Feet</li>
            <li>, I Didn&#x27;t Regret Buying It , Definitely I Will Recommend This Product...:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had smelly feet which makes me very self conscience but after using this spray I&#x27;m not afraid to take my shoes off in front my friends anymore.</li>
            <li>It has a really minty smell which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>

            <li>The natural oils really take care of off smells.  </li>
            <li>It deodorizes quickly and you&#x27;re left with the light smell of mint and other essential oils.  </li>
            <li>So far the spray has lasted through the night and all day today.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something all natural because of course we are talking about my child here</li>
            <li>if you you are looking for natural this is it!&lt;br /&gt;Recieved for review</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t need to be purchasing another one as frequently as you might think.</li>
            <li>As far as the scent, NO complaints.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a natural product.</li>
            <li>I bought it hoping to revitalize several pairs of older shoes that I wear barefoot and had some noticeable odor when I took them off.</li>

            <li>HUGE help with my husbands work boots and my little boys shoes!!</li>

            <li> The product came in barely protected, the shipper box was a bit banged probably due to delivery handling, however the bottle itself was also dented and probably had minor leakage as the box smelled like the product&#x27;s spray as soon as I opened it.</li>

            <li> and like other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It became less smelly and sweaty.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is a push down sprayer in a plastic bottle, just push down and spray a few times.</li>
            <li> We have used it a couple times already and just put a few squirts in each shoe.</li>
            <li> The shoes do not really allow any air in the shoes and with the way they are made and insulated, it often caused problems with a bad odor being left behind in his shoes.</li>
            <li> My husbands smelly feet and shoes are no more!!</li>

            <li> Love this product works for any kind of shoes tennis dress shoes and even flip flops. My husband works outside and when he takes his shoes off he sprays his feet and shoes sndbite helps tremendously. I used this product st s discount rate and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It keeps my shoes smelling fresh and not sweaty.</li>
            <li> Thanks For The Promotion, I Really Love This Natural Show Deodorizer, My Feet Smell So Good And Feel fresh, I Didn&#x27;t Regret Buying It , Definitely I Will Recommend This Product...:)</li>
            <li> I have received this product free in turn for my review of their product.  I received this yesterday and sprayed all my shoes as well and used it on my feet, my husbands feet, even the baby wanted it on his feet.  It smells so good just like a peppermint stick.  So far the spray has lasted through the night and all day today.  But with the temperatures near 100 here we sure did need this.</li>
            <li> Works very well. My son is an athlete so his shoes smell a lot. This definitely made a difference.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I like the fresh minty smell.</li>
            <li> was so happy with this product.  from the 1st spray on my tennis shoes odor was gone.  will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product really works!! I bought it hoping to revitalize several pairs of older shoes that I wear barefoot and had some noticeable odor when I took them off. After spraying the inner soles with this spray, the odor is completely gone! It&#x27;s so nice to be able to wear these favorite pairs of shoes again without worrying when I take them off now. Very happy I tried this!</li>
            <li> HUGE help with my husbands work boots and my little boys shoes!! My husband has specific shoes that he has to wear for work. The shoes do not really allow any air in the shoes and with the way they are made and insulated, it often caused problems with a bad odor being left behind in his shoes. This product was amazing. We have used it a couple times already and just put a few squirts in each shoe. I couldn&#x27;t imagine what a difference these could have made!</li>
            <li> amazzing stuff!! Smells so good and works so well.. even on old shoes! My child had the stinkiest feet ever!! I have been looking for something all natural because of course we are talking about my child here and I dont want to expose her to unnatural substances. if you you are looking for natural this is it!&lt;br /&gt;Recieved for review</li>
            <li> Wow, first use and I was hooked. Product really works, and got rid of the smell in my dress shoes.  Honestly I was surprised and I rarely write reviews, that says a lot about this product!</li>
            <li> Do your feet smell like roses and lavender? Probably not. If you&#x27;re like most of us humans, sometimes you&#x27;re feet get a little funky by the end of the day, am I right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of options out there to alleviate this issue, but the majority of the brands you&#x27;ve commonly used involve harsh chemicals (YUCK!). The Natural Shoe Deodorizer &amp; Foot Deodorant is great because it&#x27;s ALL NATURAL. You can spray it all over your feet and shoes without worrying about potential mutations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant (think minty, peppermint, eucalyptus, etc.) and like other reviewers have mentioned, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you got some funky feet, make sure to give this product a try. The bottle may seem small, but a little goes a long way so you won&#x27;t need to be purchasing another one as frequently as you might think. Rocky Mountain Essentials is also a great company and will absolutely reach out to you if you are anything less than satisfied with their product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Okay, straight up. As far as the scent, NO complaints. It&#x27;s fresh without being obtrusive, and I really liked it after it had faded a bit. It worked really well as a deodorizer as well, and oh my goodness, does it feel wonderful on sore, sweaty feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: it wasn&#x27;t quite up to full-blown summer feet reek. But it did tame it, so I&#x27;m still very pleased, and would comfortably recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and sensitive nose are my own.</li>
            <li> Getting it out of the way, I received this product as part of a promotion, and paid barely anything for it. However this review will be unbiased despite not having paid full price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely the best part of this product is the ingredients. It smells natural for one, and everything about it is just pleasant. I have a shoe cabinet where shoes just get tossed inside, rarely does anything get aired out and suffice to say it doesn&#x27;t smell nice. Using this there was an immediate and lasting effect, it smells fresher and definitely does it&#x27;s intended job. Honestly would continue to use this product as it just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would&#x27;ve been 5 star had I receive my product in perfect condition. The product came in barely protected, the shipper box was a bit banged probably due to delivery handling, however the bottle itself was also dented and probably had minor leakage as the box smelled like the product&#x27;s spray as soon as I opened it. I wouldn&#x27;t have deducted a full star, but there&#x27;s no 4.5 rating, if there was it would be 4.5.</li>
            <li> Awesome!! my husband and son have the stinkiest feet! They started using this and it has really helped with their foot odor. It has a nice peppermint smell to it. I recommend this foot deodorizer!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product!!  Perfect for cross country feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past week (since I received it) and it has worked wonderfully.  The natural oils really take care of off smells.  It deodorizes quickly and you&#x27;re left with the light smell of mint and other essential oils.  No foot odor to complain about anymore.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion for an honest opinion. This is all natural and the scent is a pleasant peppermint that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. This is perfect for kids playing outside or for those whose feet sweat a lot, especially during the hot summer months. I spray it directly into my shoes and on my feet, and honestly, it makes my feet feel refreshed and my shoes smell fresher. The spray bottle is a push down sprayer in a plastic bottle, just push down and spray a few times. I like this much better than others on the market because of the scent and it not being natural. This has tea tree oil, peppermint oil, thyme, flowerleaf. Thank you for making a natural product.</li>
            <li> My husbands smelly feet and shoes are no more!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I sprayed just my work shoes and after 13 hours in them, no stench!! Finally a product that works as described!!!</li>
            <li> Omg love ! Have a bottle already and actually waiting on another . Works gray for the hubby&#x27;s stinky feet . Actually was never able to fine anything and this honestly is the best!</li>
            <li> I have to try this to myself because I always wear close shoes and I feel ashamed whenever I get home and my feet would be sweaty and smelly. I have tried this the moment I got the product and it worked. It became less smelly and sweaty. So for those who have the same problem, try this product and be worry free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shoe spray for a couple of days and I can significantly feel the difference in smell. I&#x27;ve always had smelly feet which makes me very self conscience but after using this spray I&#x27;m not afraid to take my shoes off in front my friends anymore. It has a really minty smell which I love!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!</li>
            <li> It does the work but it takes some time, I will the smell was a bit different, maybe softer.</li>
