            <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance so my husband has been using it for years just for me.  Every day when he gets out of the shower I smell it and go Mmmmm.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this hard to find product. Nothing he has tried has changed his mind. I like it too</li>
            <li> My husband wears this to work.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  This is a time-tested long time favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> This product is as great as it has always been.  Its gotten very hard to find in the brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Always the same and that is what I like.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of after-shave my husband has ever liked.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon, it can&#x27;t be found in stores other than at Christmas time.  It is an excellent product, in his view.  He began using this product way back when we were first married, and that&#x27;s been 50 years ago now!  We will continue to buy it, as it is his favorite.</li>
            <li> This product seemed different from earlier Dana purchases. Is this an authetic Dana producrt?</li>
            <li> We all wore E L back in the late sixties when I was in HS. The girls all loved it! Wearing it again brings back those old memories.</li>
            <li> DO not waste your Money on this like I did!  Despite reading many reviews that this product did not have anything like the smell or feel of the original English Leather, I decided to try it.  It actually smells BAD and is a &amp;#34;SPLASH&amp;#34;, not a cologne.  Amazon is great- Dana not so much.  I may try it on my garden plants to see if it will kill the bugs.</li>
            <li> just like it was 50 years ago..........</li>
            <li> Very fast service. Glad I was able to order this product since it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite .</li>
            <li> I have been using English Leather for many years. It is a great product. While being a manly scent it is also light and not overbearing. It is refreshing after shaving. The refreshing feeling as well as the scent lingers well into the day. For someone who does not want to over power the air around me; this is the best product out there right now. I would recommend this for any age or envirnoment. And of course my wife loves the scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for over 30 yrs he loves it and so do I.  Sadly you just cannot get it in stores any more, or at least not where I usually shop so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  Can&#x27;t explain what makes it smell so good.  It&#x27;s not strong just a gently fresh breeze for the nose.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Have used it for over 5 decades and will continue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made multiple purchased by Dana because, I love English Leather.  No reason to fix a wheel that doesn&#x27;t need fixing.  I&#x27;ll return again and again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a very long time. It lost it&#x27;s popularity but I can always find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband used this years ago and I love the fragrance so I got him this for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;He missed it too and glad its back in the cabinet.</li>
