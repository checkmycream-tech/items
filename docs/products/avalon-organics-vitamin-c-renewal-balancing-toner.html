    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Cleans great!</li>
            <li>the toner feels incredibly sticky on my skin and makes it look kind of oily, thus killing all my routine of skin cleansing!</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning the leftover residue that remains after washing.</li>
            <li>Also, the top isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>The orange scent is very appealing and wakes up my face.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this brand!</li>
            <li>Brighter, clearer, more even, and toned!</li>
            <li>this is a very good product - mild but effective probably for any skin type</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a lot of organic ingredients and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>This toner seems nice and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>I love love love their Vitamin C face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but i have gotten used to it and also feel its better after using the toner.</li>
            <li>I love it has spf in it as well.</li>
            <li>Buy multiple units of the 2 pack for the best price.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>This product smells nice, the company is a full status signer with EWG and the price</li>
            <li>I like the smell, first of all - nice and citrus-y.</li>
            <li>I still wanted something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and without alcohol so this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say try that first although it&#x27;s more on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>However, even with a clean face, this product alone causes the burning tingly feeling and redness.  </li>
            <li>Crossing my fingers that I got it cleaned off before I have to deal with a full blown reaction that will take weeks to recover from.</li>
            <li>Moreover it makes my skin look kind of red for 5-10min after I put it on.</li>
            <li>It just kind of pops open like a shampoo bottle</li>
            <li>It works on my skin type, you would like it too and the price is right.</li>
            <li>is right.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>My Face Potent and Pure facial toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling u, so much money and for what?</li>
            <li>Avalon Organics Vitamin C toner just produces a gentle tingle.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well; I don&#x27;t even need much (if any) moisturizer after using the toner.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>and I really like this toner because it picks up dirt without drying my skin out.  </li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable for the product.  </li>
            <li>Simple old but good dickinsons witch hazel toner for 5 bucks made my skin feel like I&#x27;m a queen, and this one is such a bummer.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job as far as evening out my skin tone and restoring the balance of moisture in my skin (since I usually use cleansers for acne) without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am a new customer to this brand and will forever purchase!</li>
            <li>I usually prefer Kiss My Face toners but bought this at a local drug store where my favorite wasn&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my face was normal again</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, its combination skin but apparently this toner works better on dry skin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pity cuz it has so much good elements inside, like green tea, aloe, etc, but maybe that&#x27;s where the problem lies...</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for about a month now, and really see a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s little vitamin c serums on here that are fine.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t even that sensitive</li>
            <li>I thought it was just my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Let me just start off by saying I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Even natural products like this can cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>I knew almost immediatly that this stuff wasn&#x27;t gentle enough for my face.</li>
            <li>With proper use, morning and night, it lightens up liver spots on my hands very noticeably.  </li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for this.</li>
            <li>I agree with a previous reviewer, if you have sensitive skin look elsewhere or just stick with the tried and true Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>A little harsh at first, then it got better.</li>
            <li>My face instantly became red and hot after using this product.</li>
            <li>Usually the larger quantities you purchase the more you save.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought maybe it was my other face products that were reacting with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen such fast results from any other skin care product before, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>

            <li> I think I will just stick with the very expensive Kiss</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ugly head.</li>
            <li> Stupidly I passed it to a friend (cautioning her but telling her to give it a try) - her reaction was the worst.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, like it&#x27;s spoiled.</li>

            <li> I ordered this toner and was waiting impatiently to get it as I saw it&#x27;s packed with goodness ingredients, so I was hoping it would make my skin feel moisturized and refreshed, like the toner is supposed to do. What a big disappoinment! the toner feels incredibly sticky on my skin and makes it look kind of oily, thus killing all my routine of skin cleansing! Moreover it makes my skin look kind of red for 5-10min after I put it on. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, its combination skin but apparently this toner works better on dry skin... I&#x27;m telling u, so much money and for what? Simple old but good dickinsons witch hazel toner for 5 bucks made my skin feel like I&#x27;m a queen, and this one is such a bummer. It&#x27;s a pity cuz it has so much good elements inside, like green tea, aloe, etc, but maybe that&#x27;s where the problem lies...</li>
            <li> A little harsh at first, then it got better.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive. Other toners and astringents usually make my skin burn and get really red. Avalon Organics Vitamin C toner just produces a gentle tingle. Smells great! Cleans great! Moisturizes very well; I don&#x27;t even need much (if any) moisturizer after using the toner. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This product smells nice but the burning and redness is very very uncomfortable.  It leaves a sticky feeling on the skin.  I love love love their Vitamin C face cleanser.  I have been using it for years with no problems and thought I would give this a try.  At first, I thought maybe it was my other face products that were reacting with it.  However, even with a clean face, this product alone causes the burning tingly feeling and redness.  Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer Kiss My Face toners but bought this at a local drug store where my favorite wasn&#x27;t available. I still wanted something \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and without alcohol so this fit the bill. I like the smell, first of all - nice and citrus-y. It seems to do a good job as far as evening out my skin tone and restoring the balance of moisture in my skin (since I usually use cleansers for acne) without causing breakouts. I have two minor complaints; one is that it does make my face feel a little slimey/sticky. Once it dries completely it&#x27;s not too bad, though. Also, the top isn&#x27;t the best. It just kind of pops open like a shampoo bottle and I always seem to pour out way too much, which unfortunately means you run out sooner. Overall I would recommend it but, again, it&#x27;s definitely not my first choice!</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t even that sensitive and I haven&#x27;t came across anything that makes me break out besides this toner. I tried it since it&#x27;s vitamin c and also organic. It&#x27;s slimy and sticky. Feels terrible on the skin and also left me with a patchy rash through out my face. I instantly washed it off and slept it off so by morning my face was normal again ( I have no acne on my face, just got this for aging) I tried it 3 seperate times and it was the same every time.  Just money wasted. There&#x27;s little vitamin c serums on here that are fine. Bigger percentage too. I&#x27;d say try that first although it&#x27;s more on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> This is the only toner I will use. I love the fact that it has a lot of organic ingredients and it smells so good. The orange scent is very appealing and wakes up my face. Does a great job cleaning the leftover residue that remains after washing. Very gentle and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using these organic avalon face products my face has been clearer. I havent gotten pimples at all. the moisturizer is a different texture but i have gotten used to it and also feel its better after using the toner. I love it has spf in it as well. I like wearing that on my face every day.</li>
            <li> It works on my skin type, you would like it too and the price is right. Love it! highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My face instantly became red and hot after using this product. I thought it was just my sensitive skin so I gave it to my son, same result. Stupidly I passed it to a friend (cautioning her but telling her to give it a try) - her reaction was the worst. She had to do cold compresses all evening to reduce swelling and redness.</li>
            <li> I applied on my face and it was the most terrible feeling, my face was more than red  it looks as a tomatoe with a  burning sensation. I was so scared that i had  to washed off my face with cold water. Also it causes rash.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! I am a new customer to this brand and will forever purchase! I have only been using this for about a month now, and really see a difference in my skin! Brighter, clearer, more even, and toned! Even my neck seems firmer! Really. I&#x27;ve never seen such fast results from any other skin care product before, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I am prone to breakouts, only since menopause, and this product is giving my skin a fountain of youth! Stumbled on this brand totally by accident. They should advertize!</li>
            <li> this is a very good product - mild but effective probably for any skin type</li>
            <li> Let me just start off by saying I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Even natural products like this can cause a reaction. I knew almost immediatly that this stuff wasn&#x27;t gentle enough for my face. Within a few minutes I could tell something was up when that weird not quite burning sensation reared it&#x27;s ugly head. Crossing my fingers that I got it cleaned off before I have to deal with a full blown reaction that will take weeks to recover from. This product smells nice, the company is a full status signer with EWG and the price is right. However it left a sticky residue on my skin for the 5-10 minutes before I rinsed it off.     I think I will just stick with the very expensive Kiss My Face Potent and Pure facial toner. I have never had a problem with that product and it smells delicous.     I agree with a previous reviewer, if you have sensitive skin look elsewhere or just stick with the tried and true Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> On 11/22/2013 the 2 pack ended up being $9.46 per bottle while the 4 pack was listed at $11.42 per bottle.  Usually the larger quantities you purchase the more you save.  That is not the case here.  Buy multiple units of the 2 pack for the best price.  I have dry +40 skin and I really like this toner because it picks up dirt without drying my skin out.  I use Avalon Organics brand moisturizer after using this product.  I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> Normally I like this product but in this case I think I got a bad batch. It smells terrible, like it&#x27;s spoiled. I suppose that since it is an organic product, it is possible to get a bad batch, but it&#x27;s a lot of money to pour down the drain.</li>
            <li> With proper use, morning and night, it lightens up liver spots on my hands very noticeably.  The cost is reasonable for the product.  It arrives promptly, and well packed..</li>
            <li> This toner seems nice and has a nice smell.  Hope it does something for my face. I will keep using it and see.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for this. Cannot use this if you have hyper pigmentation or prone to dry skin</li>
