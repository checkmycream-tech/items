            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and thankfully have no wrinkles to speak of, so I cannot speak to the claim of it reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but I can say that this serum is the best serum hydrator I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m a bit of a skin product junkie.</li>
            <li>Excellent  for reducing fine lines around the eyes.</li>

            <li>Skin feels smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is good product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>Good elixir, not so good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My husband agrees with me that my skin is looking good.</li>
            <li>Save your money - buy a good lotion and wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and it smells so good to me</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good news for me.</li>
            <li>I stick with hyaluronic acid/aloe serums in the winter because they&#x27;re so good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is particularly good at hanging on to water.)</li>
            <li>Since adjusting to the correct amount to use, the serum dries fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your product is good,  but. . . .</li>
            <li>I was sent this product for free to try and I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
            <li>response on how good the product is.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so good.  </li>
            <li>Also the price is good for what you&#x27;re getting, imo.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser says I come from a family with good genes because I do not look 62</li>
            <li>She then asked me why my skin looked so good.  </li>
            <li>It feels good when you apply it and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product and the company.</li>
            <li>but I do see a good improvement in my skin which has increased my confidence in how I look</li>
            <li>Loved this product..</li>
            <li>good under face cream and makeup</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about where the good things stop for me and this serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our skin regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin.</li>
            <li>Great to use after cleaning the face and applying the Moroccan Rose water.</li>
            <li>My over all experience with this was good.</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to see good results as time goes by.  </li>
            <li>so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>And recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum because it also seems to be good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product is good for around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>and , I have to say I really loved what it did for my skin.</li>
            <li>, I think that is fair.</li>
            <li>I am 64 and I am not aging gracefully as some people have the good fortune of doing.  </li>
            <li>My Mother-in-law even noticed that my skin looked really good.  </li>
            <li>Good product will buy again</li>
            <li>It feels and smells good pn the skin.</li>
            <li>You will still need a good quality moisturizer also.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look good.</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li>I have read a lot about hyaluronic acid and how amazing it is supposed to be for the skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing what it has done for my hand alone, not to mention my face.</li>
            <li>Based on all the promises, I was expecting amazing results.</li>

            <li>Great for smooth skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing how my skin change..</li>

            <li>It is also cost effective</li>

            <li>Addition to original review:  My skin is feeling great.  </li>

            <li>To be fair, I wasn&#x27;t using any kind of serum before trying this product, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t happy with the way my skin looked either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and has cleared up most of my blemishes!!</li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with this new product...</li>

            <li>I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a month now and the tone of my skin is more even  and firmer.  </li>
            <li>As soon as it hits the skin and is massaged in, it becomes more of a watery consistency.</li>

            <li>I am so pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t help under my eyes in the same manner as the BEST Vitamin C Serum For Face 2015 worked.</li>
            <li>My plan is to continue using this product and give it a chance to do its magic.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I receive comments continuously.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Best feature is I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li>and I love all of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, but that&#x27;s about all it does for me.  </li>
            <li>I use a day cream on top of it, so maybe the combination irritates my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love for it to even out</li>
            <li>and I am glad</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use more than 4-5 drops.</li>
            <li>you don;t have to worry about being tossed out by TSA if you are flying :)</li>
            <li>Just when I though nothing was better than the Vitamin C serum I found this.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way the glass bottle looks and feels.</li>
            <li>This stuff will make your skin look and feel 100x better than it did before</li>
            <li>It feels nice and has a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>Love this serum..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it feels BETTER than Skincell....</li>
            <li>I love it,after two weeks of use the wrinkles on my forehead reduced by 75%,my face looks fuller and smoother.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>As recommended, I follow up with a moisturizer and it does indeed keep the moisturizer from immediately soaking in, in fact it seems like the moisturizer just sits on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more to keep you from developing more wrinkles rather than getting rid of existing ones?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching  :-)</li>
            <li>I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>This is products that I try most.</li>
            <li>I layer moisturizer over the top.</li>
            <li>I have seen a noticeable improvement in the tone of my face and how much more even it looks.</li>
            <li>I love every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But then, as is the case with most anti-aging products, there are no overnight miracles.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day most days.</li>
            <li>Best price on the net with this seller.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>So glad I did</li>
            <li>My face is clearer, brighter more youthful looking.</li>
            <li>skin much more youthful looking  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>I have had Rosea for 10 years or more on my chest.</li>
            <li>I got it for a great price and my order came in fast.</li>
            <li>Really love the texture and consistency of this product</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great product...</li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>

            <li>The serum is more gel-like than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Plus it is more moisturizing</li>
            <li>Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>Love it, can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li>I tried so many of them .This</li>
            <li>I expect this will take more time.</li>
            <li>So by adding a hyaluronic acid serum to your skincare regimen you&#x27;ll be helping whatever moisturizer you use work better by helping your skin better retain</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for the price!</li>
            <li>Love the product, just put in another order before it runs out.</li>
            <li>Wish I had before/after pics for you as I love looking at those -</li>
            <li>and you get more quantitiy.</li>
            <li>My whole body seems to need more H.A., and it&#x27;s great for more than just my face.</li>
            <li>but I really love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use moisturizer after application of this product as it is a serum and not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There has been no permanent noticeable difference on my eye areas which of course are most everybody&#x27;s concern.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>my skin is smooth after one month of using every day!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It also dose not pill when using product like makeup or moisturizers on top of it.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find out that this serum worked very well with my foundation and my sunscreen .</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was sent a free sample of this serum in order that make an informed review and my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Love the way this hydrates without feeling like you have anything on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff because it is in a colored bottle to protect the vitamin C.I have reordered this twice, I love it.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles, they didn&#x27;t magically disappear, yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>, then this serum afterwards for even more effect.  </li>
            <li>if I keep putting more on, it gets to a point where my skin is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and then it takes longer to soak in.  </li>
            <li>where my skin tone was not improving any more and with the addition of using this serum, my skin has started improving again.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use this serum with Instanaturals&#x27; emu oil, and my face has a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Both also have witch hazel within the top five ingredients...</li>
            <li>Hydrates my skin and the look and feel is so much better.  </li>
            <li>There is interesting information out there.  </li>
            <li>fabulous!</li>
            <li>I am sure I am in the minority but please stop this if your skin shows signs of drying out.</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I received this serum to review from instanatural &amp; Tomoson.com, as I&#x27;d never heard of or tried a hyaluronic acid serum before.</li>
            <li>I can personally say, this serum is GREAT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I love that it isn&#x27;t runny like a vitamin C serum is.</li>
            <li>Makes my complexion dewy and much more supple than it was before using it.</li>
            <li>This serum contains much more than Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I found this one works better for me.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s going to make me even more oily-faced.</li>
            <li>EXCEED MY  MY EXPECTATIONS---THIS PRODUCT IS BETTER THAN PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE PAID  </li>
            <li>MUCH MORE  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels more toned and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>but I love the silky feel of it on my skin so will probably buy more when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li>I really love using this serum.  </li>

            <li>B00K2O3NV2 InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Anti Aging Serum for Face - Reduces Wrinkles, Fine Lines &amp; More</li>
            <li>We really love this product and I&#x27;m excited to try more of InstaNaturals</li>
            <li>Wrinkles in my forehead are going away, my skin is very dry and this product is wonderful,  </li>
            <li>smells amazing when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li>but my face seems brighter and my skin is free of most blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Just got this product and haven&#x27;t even used it but looks like I am going to enjoy it, can tell from the good smell as that was the first thing I checked</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>One of the great product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Hyaluronic Acid Serum to be most comfortable to use and by that</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>so not really all that impressed.</li>
            <li>I am happy, I am ofcourse dealing with a 68 year old sun ravaged skin..</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>The texture is becoming softer and smoother than before.  </li>
            <li>It is light and refreshing like witch hazel, which I believe is one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy with the results thus far, I asked a girlfriend of mine to try some to see if it would work just as well for her as it did myself.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is light and moisturizing and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to put on the lotion afterwards to lock in the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; for me as if I just apply the serum, I feel like I need to reapply the serum again to keep my skin more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and it&#x27;s amazing how much my skin has improved in just a matter of days!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product so far and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>far I am quite happy with the serum</li>
            <li>I love how smooth it applies to my skin</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s one of the better Hydraulic Acid Serums available on the market because I have seen the results</li>
            <li>So far great results.</li>
            <li>There is a light smell to the product which is ok, but I&#x27;d rather there not be a smell.</li>
            <li>It is a good gentle product with no scent.</li>
            <li>However, product is very esay to apply and felt good on my face</li>
            <li>but I really feel good about the ingredients,  </li>
            <li>loved applying this under makeup and my skin really glowed.</li>
            <li>The serum is absorbed nicely through my skin</li>
            <li>it goes on good and dries fast</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in my skins texture (smoother) and a decrease in the fine lines on my face and neck!</li>
            <li>The application is easy, the scent is great and the most important, makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Feels nice and smooth going on, dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice, smooth serum, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Right after application, I can honestly feel my skin tighten up.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin, love it!</li>
            <li>anything good for the face is good for the backs of the hands, another highly visible clue to one&#x27;s real age.</li>
            <li>I used to dread it before, especially under those bright tube lights!</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve checked the ingredients first, as there is more Aloe in here than hyaluronic acid!</li>
            <li>This is the first serum I have ever tried, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Omg this serum and the other are wonderful!</li>
            <li>You have enough good things in it!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does this leave my skin glowing, it also smells SOOO good!</li>
            <li>This serum spreads easily, soaks in quickly and with my moisturizer makes my skin noticeably softer and my skin texture very fine.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It applies easily, is odorless after application and leaves no residue or shininess on the skin.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>AND LET ME  MAKE UP EASY.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I like how easy this product is to apply it does not leave a residue or film on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with the dropper.</li>
            <li>This serum is easy to apply,it leaves your skin</li>
            <li>The good thing about it is it&#x27;s non-greasy and easily spreads on your skin; however, I still have to see my brown spots lighten, which is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and my skin just drinks it in.</li>
            <li>It does not absorb easily</li>
            <li>I also like how it absorbs very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is easy to get the product out of the container because of the dropper/cover.&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the third week of using both items, my skin was feeling great, and many of my scars had faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a viscose transparent and without a smell product, goes easy and smoothy on the face an neck.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use I would and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>This has superfluous filler ingredients in place of the basics that actually make skin more attractive.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>product is great and I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.The serum is light gel that dissolves nicely into the skin without residue, the fact the product is absorbed by the skin allows you not to worry about it coming off while  you sleep.</li>
            <li>I have several InstaNatural products and find I can always rely on them for quality and great products made with many organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but by far this is the absolute BEST!</li>
            <li>First thing , the label is so attractive and its the first thing that caught my eye.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries like it is not there.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply and my wife and I have noticed an improvement in our skin after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Probably 3 times as strong</li>
            <li>Will strongly recommend.”</li>
            <li>I loved this product, made my skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I LIKED THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>I Liked very much this product&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly, and seems to be helping my complexion.</li>
            <li>Feels very light, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>You only need 3 to 4 drops and it is light and cool on apication, the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Thanks, my wife is very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wwb</li>
            <li>Into my first bottle, but loving the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It has an extra ounce in the bottle and not as runny so more for your money and better quality and good results</li>
            <li>Honestly, have been finishing up another brand first before using your product.</li>
            <li>I never knew that all natural products could be so effective!</li>
            <li>but it gets dehydrated easily, so the hyaluronic acid seemed to have solved that issue by sinking in quickly and &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34; on to any moisturizers I put on top.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it spreads on the face very easily, and it feels good, too.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable, and makes your skin nice and smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li>my fine lines around my eyes look plump  pulse</li>
            <li>but it is a fine product.</li>
            <li>I am 40 and have fine lines.</li>
            <li>Some of my fine lines under my eyes almost disappear.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>It also helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It has even the texture, faded scaring, softened fine lines.</li>
            <li>Seems fine.</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and fine lines improved</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s going to be just fine~</li>
            <li>The fine lines have seemed to have disappeared.</li>
            <li>Also helps in the fine wrinkle/crows feet department as well.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed fewer fine wrinkles and age spots are lightening within 2 wks.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin moist,diminishes fine lines ,shrinks pores....</li>
            <li>(think this is providing some immediate help with fine lines).</li>
            <li>Since hyaluronic acid is so moisturizing, it also helps with wrinkles and fine lines over time.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it might work as a healing product for blemishes or accidental fine scratches on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and some of the fine lines are practically non-visible.</li>
            <li>But in any event, this works fine</li>
            <li>It does help with fine lines and my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li>The serum helps with fine lines and skin tones too.</li>
            <li>This has made a huge&lt;br /&gt; difference in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It did seem to reduce my fine lines, but, I would have to use it a while longer to see if it would truly erase them.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Easy to use and can be worn under make up as it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is getting smoother.</li>
            <li>I think that this serum would be fine for the summer or for someone with oily skin</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it effects fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li>It has reduced the fine lines around the eyes and given my skin a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to get rid of some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>After one week of use I can see a difference in my skin tone and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I can tell the fine line</li>
            <li>I put the serum on work  Fine</li>
            <li>The serum helps lessen the appearance of fine lines by plumping up your skin.</li>
            <li>I like that this product addresses fine lines, wrinkles, and skin disclorations.</li>
            <li>Came really quickly in the post too :)</li>
            <li>Vanishes quickly and my skin texture is getting better</li>
            <li>I cannot tell this quickly if this product is doing what it claims, but I love the feel of it on my face and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>This serum just absorbs into my skin so quickly!  </li>
            <li>It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skill feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, I was happy to read the ingredients because it contained so many natural and organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they seem to really care that their customers are satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love that this product very much!</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and I love the fact that I am preventing it from aging!</li>
            <li>5 stars since it is a pure ingredient product, though more ingredients than just hyaluronic acid, but it does make my skin look and feel very smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and so far, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy, hydrated, and smooth.</li>

            <li>I have been suffering from fine lines and wrinkles since entering my 30&#x27;s, but this has made a huge difference in their appearance.  </li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid help the skin retain moisture and the helps smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly moisturizing but has done nothing for fine lines the way that the Truth Serum does.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I see anything drastic for certain, but feels nice.</li>
            <li>While it does not erase deep wrinkles I feel like it is doing a great job on fine lines.</li>
            <li>well, this is a nice product but really does nothing for fine lines &amp; wrinkles that I can tell, been using it for 4 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good product, arrived quicky and works as expected.</li>
            <li>This time it&#x27;s much thicker and very sticky on the face and hands...not happy and will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my skin seems dewier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve also seen a huge difference there as well.</li>

            <li>I was told that my face wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but that it was &amp;#34;thirsty.&amp;#34; Her explanation was that moisturizer sits on top of the skin, while hyaluronic acid is absorbed by the skin.</li>

            <li>So it is light.</li>
            <li>and I can feel it going to work on my skin as soon as I smooth it on.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with both the serums I got recently from InstaNaturals.</li>
            <li>I use a light vit E cream over the serum after it dries.</li>
            <li>It applies smooth and even</li>
            <li>I was offered this as a free product and the customer service is fantastic...</li>

            <li>The product feels nice on my skin, is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>Just turned 43 a week ago, my reaction toward the result is beyond happy because I finally find something that works after trying this and</li>
            <li>apply the serum directly to my laugh lines and forehead lines and notice those areas looking more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>i have received this product free or a discount</li>
            <li>This product mixes the best of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Green Tea.</li>
            <li>This Product is Fabulous.</li>

            <li>You definitely need to use good moisturizer over top.</li>

            <li>I think this is a good product, but could be tweaked to make it more user friendly and possible to not have the fragrance in there as well.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel better and I&#x27;ll continue using this product, the price is right, and I think it is helping.  </li>
            <li>I love the dropper type, it gives you the right amount to put in your face.</li>
            <li>BUT (yes, you knew that was coming, right? :-)</li>
            <li>With many other products that I tried I did not get what I was looking for but with this product it was great from the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This has been added to my daily routine, love it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these products (brand) before but this is my favorite, light and easy to apply, I love how good it feels after applying it, non greasy or heavy, but light and hydrated.</li>
            <li>First of all love the fact that is cruelty free, is completely natural and smell really good.</li>

            <li>and I appreciate how my face feels so smooth and clean after the application.</li>
            <li>IT IS EASY TO ABSORBS QUICKLY AND</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  </li>

            <li>Love this product, very nourishing and refreshing with good instant results.</li>
            <li>Love the price and the very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought his brand because it contains a  higher percentage of hyalurinic acid than many others.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping to an EU country was quick and easy with a tracking sytem to see when it was going to be delivered.</li>
            <li>Sure glad I got out of my comfort zone and tried something new.</li>
            <li>This is especially great for me since I have combination skin and can be very oily in some places yet still have dry spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>At first I bought just for myself but since it makes my skin look so much better</li>
            <li>I think on younger skin, it would definitely be successful.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m applying this once a day and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Really great stuff I feel like it helped fade my acne scars not completely yet</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I saw it was suggested along with the skin rollers.  </li>
            <li>I think this is not only a great product, but also very reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li>My skin is combination and acne prone, and I&#x27;ve seen a significant amount of improvement in the condition of my skin after using this serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what your product does for me.  </li>
            <li>But this one wins them all!</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement in my skin after 3 weeks of use, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I have heard of hyaluronic acid for its anti-wrinkle properties and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those were my 5 original reasons for trying InstaNaturals HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize my opinion of the InstraNaturals HA serum, this is an excellent quality serum, it has all the ingredients of my usual HA.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize my opinion of the InstraNaturals HA serum, this is an excellent quality serum, it has all the ingredients of my usual HA.</li>
            <li>So excited.</li>
            <li>So far my husband and are very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li>my skin fell in love the first time i used the serum.</li>
            <li>my skin feels great all day long.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of its natural ingredients and have to say I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I was given a significant discount to review this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results of this product so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and subject to autoimmune rashes on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I have ordered other brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum before and this product by far has been the best.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not going to get rich marketing this way, but they are going to make a lot of people a whole lot more comfortable inside their skins.</li>
            <li>And the blend of ingredients are pure which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean, renewed, and youthful.</li>
            <li>but I liked a similar product with vitamin C in addition, better</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several HA and Vitamin C products and this one is by far the best bang for the buck!</li>
            <li>, i put this on after my face clean and i also use this on my neck, i use it morning nd night</li>
            <li>got it because its supposedly oil free and read in articles that its a good way for mixed and oily skin to be moisturized-</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the way this serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel really silky.</li>
            <li>the customer service are very thoughtful and I would definitely try more of their products and strongly recommend this if you are looking for a natural healthy moisturizer and even more protection for your skin.</li>
            <li>What also sold me was more positive  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and can tell that my skin is responding in a positive way to the healthy moisture that is being added.</li>
            <li>This skin care line had an overwhelming amount of positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>The price was great, the bottle is made of dark, sturdy glass, and the dropper is easy to use, so the packaging is all around fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is very light and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>The bottle comes with a built-in dropper to easily get the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>A good way to test this is to apply a generous amount to the top of one hand and leave the other one without.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it some more time, but so far I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li>I got this product and was iffy about it due to reviews most witch were good</li>
            <li>LIKE EVERYONE IS SAYING.STILL LOOKING FOR THAT SPECIAL CREAM</li>
            <li>While I can certainly tell that my skin is more hydrated, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done anything for wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>I have read many articles on the benefits of a serum with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin C in a pure form.  </li>
            <li>Guess I have been doing it right!</li>
            <li>The price is right also!</li>
            <li>- This is important because using the right serum will only help your moisturizer to be more effective.</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and rubs in and is absorbed into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one is very easy to use - and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It looks great, some redness but not much.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin is amazing clear again.  </li>
            <li>My face is much softer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting more moisturizer on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and feeling so nice.  </li>
            <li>My skin is flawless, is glowing lately.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so I love moisturizing and not dealing with greasy face during the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days now and in loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ...&amp;#34; A smooth smile crawls across the face,and I know the product is supposed to be for the face</li>
            <li>I am 69 years young &amp;amp; this serum plumps-up my skin so nicely...</li>
            <li>All I can say so far, it feels good and absorbs fast and lightly moisturized my skin</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy the whole product line.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust many creams, since they normally don&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure I would see more good things as I continue using it everyday.</li>
            <li>Is ok haven&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li>I just cannot say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li>I really love this serum as it has really helped make my skin glow.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has had much of an effect otherwise and Vitamin C serums have acted much better at soothing my combination skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reviews are fabulous and I was hopeful, but it did not diminish the appearance of smile lines and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li>It has a Light Fresh scent and is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin nicely and leaves me skin feeling soft - not greasy or oily at all.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this for 2 weeks now, and so far i really liked it</li>
            <li>I would MUCH rather use thicker, more potent serum bc by the time you need to use it, your skin can use as much help as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing and somewhat refreshing after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>They were even kind enough to send me a complimentary bottle of their Eye Gel when I told them I was planning on purchasing more of their products.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice so far.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural really is generous with their products and if you&#x27;ve read many of my reviews then you know I am truly a fan of everything I&#x27;ve tried from this company.</li>
            <li>I just want to put as much good stuff on my face as possible.</li>
            <li>After using this serum for a couple of weeks,my skin feels softer and I feel good about using it because of the vitamin C and E but especially the hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>My son, is actually starting to feel good about himself and his body again.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much improvement I can see with more time.</li>
            <li>It makes my face cool and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>The serum is light, and easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>It has really helped my skin to become balanced, glowing and look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I no longer need a moisturizer (which is cool,</li>
            <li>I would still be buying this if I hadn&#x27;t learned I could by the powdered hyaluronic acid in powder for from Bulk Supplement and make much more , much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I can put moisturizer on and have it wiped off in minutes, so it&#x27;s not likely to do me much good.  </li>
            <li>Please note that I paid full price for it</li>
            <li>Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher.</li>
            <li>A true serum.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this stuff, this is some real deal stuff</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this with the&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment and am loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I also tried the vitamin c serum, and I love it just as much as this one....</li>
            <li>Verdict is still out in regards to the true benefits.</li>
            <li>..tku so much:)</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin, absorbs well  and when used with vitamin c serum it is diminishing my brown spots especially on my hands.</li>
            <li>and there is no bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>No bad stuff in it</li>
            <li>It seems to flawlessly smooth out the texture of my skin in a very positive way.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all those people that doesn&#x27;t like to have all those chemicals on their skin...and If you use them I highly recommend to change, natural is ALWAYS better! :)</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, this works beautifully under your moisturizer, but if you have oily skin you could definitely get away with using this on its own.  </li>
            <li>There are so many other products out there on the market that make big promises but nothing that I have ever tried feels as wonderful as this serum.  </li>
            <li>When your skin is hydrated it such a vibrant and healthy look that just make you feel good.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to company that has literally, somehow, found the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; in a perfect combo of natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate the skin (I&#x27;m using this, the Vit C toner, and night cream), don&#x27;t feel heavy, great price, no gross chemicals</li>
            <li>It may look like a cumbersome regime, but it is pretty easy and quick to do.</li>
            <li>I also purchased a bottle for my mother who was happy that it didn&#x27;t make her break out (she doesn&#x27;t use serums or moisturizers on her face due to acne break outs).</li>
            <li>I have used several anti-aging serums and have found that products with higher concentrations of hyaluronic acid are the most effective for my skin.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it, it has a cooling sensation, very light sent of rose which added a nice calming effect, it doesn&#x27;t have any stickyness and as soon as it dried I was able to apply my makeup without and clumpiness, big plus!!</li>
            <li>I am a really satisfied customer and will be a loyal one to InstaNatural as long as they will continue to provide us with a great natural skin care products.</li>
            <li>Since I live in a very hot country (Dominican Republic), I need to put on my face non greasy, smooth, fresh and very light creams.  </li>
            <li>Has def become a large part of my skin care routine!!</li>
            <li>eleven o&#x27;clock is not noticeable at all, forehead is smooth, and happy smile lines around mouth are less.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my dry skin smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>It Made My Skin Feel Rejuvenated, Fresh And Clean.</li>
            <li>Love this product - goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reduced the lines on my face tremendously.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it quickly leaves my face soft and smooth and non-sticky or oily</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>the product is super diluted with water.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and can be quickly followed with a moisturizer like Instanatrual&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil, which I like to use in conjunction with this product.</li>
            <li>Reading about the most important things that our face skin needs is Vit C , pepsid, and a natural oil ( I use cocnut ), and Vit E doesnt hurt.  </li>
            <li>this product has made my skin feel super sooth and has redefined my skin texture.</li>
            <li>I even gave this and the stretch mark cream tp my pregnant friend,</li>
            <li>and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>It dissolves the vitamin c quickly</li>
            <li>I soaks in almost instantly and leaves a nice smooth feel with no greasiness or stickiness.</li>
            <li>I think they mixed with water to sell more and make more money.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Has help my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand</li>
            <li>After put it on my face, it dries quick and I can feel the tightness on my face.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The product absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or tacky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff makes my face feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years, like many women, at various prices.  </li>
            <li>, the price is decent, but it was not my favorite of them all.</li>

            <li>Pure, clean, preservative free and truly has improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>With a capacity to sustain up to a 1,000 times its weight in water, Hyluronic Acid is a great natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.&amp;#34; I really like to apply it on my face before I go to work, I don&#x27;t have to apply much, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first of this type of product I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s already become an important part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li>They need to re-think about the bottle but overall very pleased with tthe product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m well aware that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work any miracles, but it does make my skin feel smooth and brighter.  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazing so far!</li>
            <li>I recently began using Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>, that was because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent</li>
            <li>It is the very first thing I put on my face, day and night.</li>
            <li>from the very first day I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>Also, I decided to get three bottles on my very first purchase coz</li>
            <li>I will write another review later after using it for a longer period of time, but as of now I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>To be fair,  my wrinkles have been there long time....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a clear gel like serum that goes on the face easily and absorbs very quickly so you can than put on your makeup or your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>First things first what I love about this is the Ingredients, I absolutely love products that are all natural.</li>
            <li>I developed the routine of using the Hyaluronic Acid for day time use &amp; my Vitamin C serum for night time &amp; Rose-hip oil on top of each, and I must say some how the combo is working as I&#x27;ve been told multiple time by various friends how great I&#x27;m looking!!  </li>
            <li>5% HA, considering ordering a 20% HA product instead... I live in the desert, very dry even though I take very good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>The new products are way better.</li>
            <li>The skin on my right hand looked much softer and more hydrated than my right hand.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked this good, it has always been dry.</li>
            <li>The serum is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Really good for dry skin on face.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can rub it on my eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t sting or otherwise affect my eyes, which are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Recieved these for free in return for  a positive feedback</li>
            <li>so much I bought some for my daughter!!  </li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>One of the best parts is that 5 drops covers my face and I know it is going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>This is the most natural hyaluronic acid serum that absorbs quickly and does not peel.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of witch hazel, and goes on with only a slightly more viscous feel than witch hazel; it&#x27;s watery in its application.</li>
            <li>The serum itself is light, not sticky at all and quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling soft, smooth and well</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and I can even see my large pores have reduced its size.</li>
            <li>This serum is very light, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face and make sure I apply it well where I have those fine lines, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles have improved so much that a before and after picture make me smile.</li>
            <li>highly recommend a good quality Hyaluronic acid in general.</li>
            <li>Since starting using the Hyaluronic acid serum for almost two weeks, I have found that the serum is very good, in the sense that it plump up skin, especially under eye area.  </li>
            <li>It is also of a gel consistency more than a liquid making it hard to get a good squeeze out of the dropper.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth when I wake in the mornings and there has been a huge improvement in skin tone.</li>
            <li>I tried a few moisturizers and this is one of the great product that I will recommend.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my only gripe though, it&#x27;s amazing for adding moisture and plumping the skin.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Instanatural cares about its customers in a gentle way, always available for questions, informations and tips about its product.</li>
            <li>After just a few days of use, I am continuously happy with this serum.</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my stretchmarks with the stretch mark cream and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Seems to calm my skin too.</li>
            <li>and I use this everyday with great benefit.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C and green tea are great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and am starting to notice some amazing results.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use all that much though, and this bottle is HUGE, so</li>
            <li>Also my skin feels smooth and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I came across this while looking through the listings for the WattsBeauty version, and the size and price was attractive, as well as the inclusion of green tea, vitamin C, and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>This serum also has wonderful natural ingredients including Vitamin C, Vitamin E,  and Green Tea.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is by far one of my favorite skin care companies.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, absorbs well and definitely makes your skin look and feel nicer.  </li>
            <li>This one is definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I wish to get a refund and 175$ for doctor visit and also 30$ worth of medication.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and the way it absorbs into the skin without a residue.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the delivery of this product, it even came a few days early.</li>
            <li>I also use the rose hip oil daily.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Pores are clear and non-existent, skin is definitely more supple as well.</li>
            <li>Nice enough product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to value more products that are natural without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I have only used it a handful of times.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a change in any &#x27;laugh lines&#x27;</li>
            <li>So far I am a satisfied customer of this product.</li>

            <li>Hyaluronic acid is able to sustain up to 1,000 times its weight in water making it a natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great, all natural product to soften your face, this is definitely what you need to purchase.</li>

            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product.  </li>
            <li>effective moisturizer with hyaluronic acid should do the same thing</li>
            <li>It has a distinctly herby smell which I don&#x27;t care for but the results are undeniable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 yrs young and my skin looks better today than it did in my 40&#x27;ds.  </li>
            <li>I am saying okay at this point for this product because I haven&#x27;t used it as frequently as directed.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>As to effectiveness, I still cannot say since i only started using it three days ago, But overall I like it because it smells good, the price is very reasonable for it&#x27;s size &amp; I feel that since it contains all the ingredients like vitamin C ( I hope they indicate on the box how many percentage) , 5% hyaluronic acid , Vitamin E, Jojoba etc.</li>
            <li>I have used other products such as this, but this Hyaluronic acid, it is the best!!</li>
            <li>I went back to my original hyaluronic serum which is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li>This drys quickly after applying it and at first you may think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my Super C serum and it feels super moisturizing and penetrates fast.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, leaving it refreshed.</li>
            <li>Everybody tells me that I look great &amp;#34; I&#x27;m not wearing maykup anymore &amp;#34; I see that I look great even if I&#x27;m sick , this is really a miracle product that works right away!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face serum for moisturizing, age damage repair and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see a significant change on my skin apart that it&#x27;s moisturizing......</li>
            <li>must also say that the customer service is extremely fast and friendly.  </li>
            <li>and I had some questions and the replies were fast and always friendly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen that much of a difference, but I use this with a lot of different products and my skin already looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>I use it right after I use my derma roller</li>
            <li>Lines and wrinkles are being reduced right before my eyes.</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Saw a difference in my pore size right away.</li>
            <li>Applicator dropper gives you just the right amount of product to use, no wasting .</li>
            <li>Also, the price is always right</li>
            <li>It does plump my skin/wrinkles right away.</li>
            <li>I like to put it on right after I have cleaned my face</li>
            <li>I use this serum right after washing my face.</li>
            <li>However, there is always hope, right?</li>
            <li>his guests don&#x27;t always get it right -- not for every person anyway.</li>
            <li>I could start using it right away.  </li>
            <li>It tightens and smoothes in all the right places.</li>
            <li>After it soaks in (which is really right away)</li>
            <li>Received this product in the mail right away.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to have to pass on finishing this bottle for right now.</li>
            <li>and my skin soaks it right up.  </li>
            <li>It seems to start working right away.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing positive change!  </li>
            <li>There IS a positive difference in the way my skin looks!  </li>
            <li>I mean it goes on smoothly, soaks into my skin quickly and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed by the skin very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality product, please feel free to contact me and ask.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are diminished, less prominent, resulting in a smooth and even texture, which is exactly what I require in a HA</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving my face and neck feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have also tried several other products by this company and all are very good and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product by Insta Natural, and am sure to purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Works great yet still gentle enough on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very light, gets absorbed fast, leaves pleasant silky and clean feeling behind, and I really like its scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for those who are looking to get rid of some fine lines or even some wrinkles to be not so noticeable, the gel like consistency of it is great as well, not too watered down looking, and it gives you just the right amount of ingredients you are looking for, a little bit goes a long ways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will need a few weeks to see how effective it is at decreasing discolorations and balancing out my skin tone and decreasing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It not only softens fine lines but also leave my skin smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, I love the packaging, the blue bottle is really pretty!  </li>

            <li>First of all, I get annoyed when I go through reviews and then realize that something has been given for free or at a discount and not be able to know that as I read the review, so let me say upfront that I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, goes on easily, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>New BFF!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks, smooth, moist, soft!!!</li>
            <li>This is a really great value for Hyaluronic Acid and having it in a separate bottle allows me to use as little or as much as I feel necessary, which I like better than using products that already have Hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>Then use this acid which is a kind of thick clear gel and feels very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that it is not sticky nor heavy to the skin and feels just right for the moist bouncy skin.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the lines becoming softer looking and less defined.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in my skin and typically with anything containing vitamin c, my face glows beautifully.</li>
            <li>will look really oily after applying but it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t look any younger but face feels fine!</li>
            <li>I like it very much, it appears to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for almost 2 weeks and must say that I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>Liking this product very much.</li>
            <li>Delivery of items was very fast, hence the 2 stars, I will review stars once I receive feedback from the seller, thank you.</li>
            <li>It also is very gentle and I have not had any problems with breakouts.</li>
            <li>I no longer had big pores but smooth soft skin that actually looked great.  </li>
            <li>but I like it very much</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>However, so many companies grossly overprice their products, making it a much smarter and more cost efficient solution to just buy directly from the wholesale manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I tried the serum it didn&#x27;t seem to change very much</li>
            <li>I think it is too early to say whether I would get the desired results that other users have experienced from using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think its too early to tell if my fine line and wrinkles have diminished.</li>
            <li>also noticed the fine lines near my eyes are fading as well</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it soaks into my skin!  </li>
            <li>It smells good, a little thinner than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of use, my skin tone was noticeably more even, the dry spot were almost completely faded and my skin just felt overall more healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a bottle Carrageenan, it&#x27;s highly comedogenic, I will be suprised  if you do not get a full face of acne.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Great organic products are hard to find</li>
            <li>As always, I love my product from Insta Natural and would highly recommend purchasing from them.</li>
            <li>After using them only twice, once at night and again the next morning, I applied my makeup and it looked AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I give 5 stars because since the first moment I started using this Hialuronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t already know you should always apply serums first before anything else.  </li>
            <li>I personally have had slightly better results with another hyaluronic/vitamin c product but would use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this .. mixed with the vitamin c..</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase, and will reorder when necessary.  </li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I usually have to get periodic facials to get this kind of smooth skin.</li>
            <li>For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I wash my face and apply this serum on, follow with insta-natural moisturizer, and ready for the day!</li>
            <li>I will update later in use &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>a couple of times I&#x27;m able to get enough to apply.  </li>
            <li>My husband said he could see a difference in my skin tone almost immediately and for a husband to notice this after all the years we&#x27;ve been married</li>
            <li>but the fact that she says she is enjoying this product is enough for me to consider buying her another if she expresses that she is almost out or that she&#x27;ll have to order another bottle.</li>
            <li>So much product for the price!</li>
            <li>I still follw my normal skin routine daily, but this serum is a nice addition to my skin care</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>love Instanatural and especially this product.</li>
            <li>This serum really works!  </li>
            <li>You can feel the softness of your skin the first use.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>And though I am healthy and look younger than my age</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in my face and neck from the first week since using this product.</li>
            <li>Now my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Their Customer Service is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I received a personal email before my products arrived with instructions for use and thanking me for my purchase, and another email, after arrival asking if I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and the price was  way higher.</li>
            <li>next :)</li>
            <li>By comparing the two I like that this consistency from Insta Natural is a light serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very koindly!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change!</li>

            <li>So far it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>The product size is better for long-term use than the smaller 1 oz bottles I have been purchasing.  </li>
            <li>During hot weather I do not like layering creams on my face.  </li>

            <li>No irritation and really works to moisturize and soften lines!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product and have ordered a second bottle.  </li>
            <li>He may have thought I was wearing foundation or concealer, but I most definitely was not!</li>
            <li>My skin definitely feels more hydrated and looks radiant.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The first 2 or 3 times I put  InstaNatural</li>

            <li>importantly C&amp;E. I usually mix my own serums</li>
            <li>Love the texture of this- seems to be brightening, only had it for a couple of days, but it seems quality.  </li>
            <li>I apply it first, then a moisturizer, and my makeup.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first bottle I got was like a gel.</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid serum is my first experience in using a serum.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone!!  </li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and smooth.”</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was pleased within days of starting to use it!</li>
            <li>I am unsure if I should try it on my skin (I am a first time buyer of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start using it on the backs of my hands, where women truly show their age, first and foremost.</li>
            <li>In sum, I will repurchase in the future for sure.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it my face was on fire.</li>
            <li>I say basically the same ingredients because of course until you pay for it and receive it--you aren&#x27;t able to see ALL of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my facial skin is brighter with a more even tone.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than enough time for all of it to soak in, leaving my skin plump, hydrated and no leftover residue.  </li>
            <li>product is one of the first I&#x27;ve seen that has both moisturizing ingredients and antioxidant ingredients.</li>
            <li>First I cleanse and use a toner, then this, then add additional moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My skin is more supple and the wrinkles are minimized with daily use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so much I got some for my daughters,  sisters and mother!  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle in 3 months, I love it.</li>
            <li>no...I&#x27;m 54 and for the first time</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ordered it.</li>
            <li>I will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li>Wish it were more liquid in the bottle, ifyouwant me to send it back so that you could see for yourself, let me know.thx.</li>
            <li>I love serums for my face, and this one is definitely a winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then I like to finish with a light natural moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e been using daily as directed and it has not reduced wrinkles, not made my skin any better, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t just put on my face the first thing I find..</li>
            <li>Especially on my forehead more noticeable than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly use this product.</li>
            <li>I out this on first.</li>
            <li>Nice light product, not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything yet through...</li>
            <li>It dries instantly and my face felt really smooth!</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I am using a Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li>am a satisfied customer and will definitely order this serum again</li>
            <li>First, let me tell you what I do not like about this serum.  </li>
            <li>The first week I just thought &amp;#34;wasted</li>
            <li>Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.</li>
            <li>First of all this serum smell so good just like green tea</li>
            <li>I love this, enough said!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every morning under my moisturizer since I first got it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using it on my neck at first, but since I noticed improvement in my face I have started using it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li>The same excellent ingredients that are in my usual HA serum&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>AJ is lovely in following up on customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Such a proactive approach is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that is doing the job.</li>
            <li>I was using another well known product that I was actually quite pleased with until I tried Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty incredable.</li>
            <li>First time using a serum</li>
            <li>At First</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Would like to see the price stay low for people to really be able to buy and use as they need it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the serum for several years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it several of my friends, the ones that tried all love it.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum hasn&#x27;t created any havoc on my delicate skin which I am so happy about.</li>
            <li>And you know it works when the first thing you notice is your plump pout.</li>
            <li>First I apply a vitamin C serum</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize like intended, but the cellular rejuvenation is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have tried many similar to this</li>
            <li>After first application it was a go for me, it has been 2 weeks since I started</li>
            <li>Its only been a week and my skin already is more hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using this type of product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel and it is definitely improving the wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy/use at first.</li>
            <li>Well I have used it consistently since it was received</li>
            <li>cure.must use consistently to see a difference.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the bulb on the dropper was a bit larger, it&#x27;d have more suction?</li>
            <li>Overall, a wonderful product, which I will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li>but my skin already looks much more radiant and the pores smaller.</li>
            <li>Probably the only thing that would make it better is if it came in a pump.</li>
            <li>Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li>my face looks much more even toned, and my pores are noticeably smaller.  </li>
            <li>Now, my skin is looking firmer, smoother, wrinkles and circles have smoothed out quite a bit in this short time, and my skin has more elasticity.</li>
            <li>I also see some evening of skin tone, which I hadn&#x27;t expected but was certainly a nice benefit.  </li>
            <li>It is also thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>I also bought the anti-aging facial moisturizer, which I also love.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were a few good reasons why I chose InstaNaturals to try their HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything in this serum is found in nature and has reputations for being great remedies for a variety of skin issues - hyaluronic acid is a strong natural moisturizer, witch hazel shrinks pores, vitamin C renews skin / fades scars and aloe, green tea, jojoba oil and vitamin E are great for skin health on a few different levels.</li>
            <li>Every item i have purchased from this company has been super high quality...</li>
            <li>, if it does not feel great when placed into my hands and moved around a little then I am not usually going to this again</li>
            <li>Right away, it started to brighten my complexion and restore a radiance that, well, I pretty much never had to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company delivered in less time than expected and it arrived in perfect condition, both times I&#x27;ve purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference with fine lines, but I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used the product long enough to be able to see much in the way of results there.</li>
            <li>Both came more quickly than expected</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick serum that goes on quite well without a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>This natural hyaluronic serum goes on smoothly without any sticky residue, plumping the skin and leaving nice surface for your other skincare and makeup products.  </li>
            <li>This has helped reduce my uneven hyperpigmentation, my skin looks so much more even, my face is a bit more plump just enough to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away on my fine lines diminishing, further proof from my daughter, who I didn&#x27;t tell I was trying a new product, she asked if I had gotten Botox!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different kinds and so far, this serum is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I should say i liked the OZ pure Hyaluronic a bit better, but that is not to say this product is not good.</li>
            <li>Used alone, the serum dries to a very light finish and is ready for the next layer.  </li>
            <li>the dropper is easy to apply right to facial skin....</li>
            <li>I have large pores and most of them were visibly smaller (</li>
            <li>Other products continue to &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; amazing results.</li>
            <li>I use organic rose water toner before using any other products.</li>
            <li>I suffer from Dark circles so have been using this mostly for those....success!</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice, soil use on the day before the sunscreen and at night apply the serum retinol, I think we should have more concentration of hyaluronic acid because I see very slow results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several weeks of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>After several days of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far, results are immediate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, it did feel just like the other hyaluronic acid serums I have used - super refreshing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new beauty products and this has been my absolute favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy the same product over and over - always trying something new, but I do believe I&#x27;ve found my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that this was product was gentle enough for under the eye</li>
            <li>So far I am loving it, will post results later.</li>
            <li>but I like this better, because it&#x27;s bigger bottle and reasonable pricing</li>
            <li>This works very well, looked for the same brand for reorder :-)</li>
            <li>It feels as good as the more expensive prescription brands.</li>
            <li>This sinks right in and you can put other products or cosmetics on top without any kind of interference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the past I have tried other hyaluronic acid products because I read so many great things about them.  </li>
            <li>I got this product to review and test for free the research that i&#x27;ve done on Hyaluronic acid serum really peak my interest because it can be used for so many place on the skin, stretch marks, eczema, blemishes,new &amp; old scars, You can used it on minor cuts.</li>
            <li>I really have a very very sensible skin and this serum is helping a lot</li>
            <li>Their product goes on much smoother and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>product is easy to use, not a long drawn out regimine.</li>
            <li>Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li>i cant really see much defferent right now</li>
            <li>so this will last a long time,it has a pleasant non-intrusive smell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any positive result from this and my continuing research indicates that there&#x27;s no reason to expect any.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a positive difference</li>
            <li>I kept using it wanting to have positive results because of all the review hype.</li>
            <li>For the life of me, I can&#x27;t fathom how this stuff could have worked for all those who wrote positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using your product for more than 3 weeks and and I would like to know how long It takes to see any tangible change on my skin?</li>
            <li>Experimenting with this shows me exactly how much to put on.  </li>
            <li>It will take a long time for me to know for sure</li>
            <li>and it is moisturizing as long as you put something else on top of it to seal the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>and I pretty much feel like it is not on my face after I apply it.</li>
            <li>Instanatural&#x27;s Hydraulic Acids Serum]] is one of the better hydraulic acid serums I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>Everything everyone is saying about this product has shown to be true so far.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good, if not better.  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural&#x27;s is far superior to Cosmedica&#x27;s, at about the same price (if not cheaper).  </li>
            <li>I have used other insta natural products and loved them.  </li>
            <li>It is far more economical than &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; products that have the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Instanatural is doing a lot of things right and deserves its high ratings on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a difference and it seemed liked the bottle was watered down.</li>
            <li>As long as my skin doesn&#x27;t dry and itchy, I am okay. :)</li>
            <li>This Company contacted me personally and asked me how I liked their product, that if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, they would give me a total refund without even sending the bottle back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t deliver the same results, this product is thicker, takes more time to sunk in, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel the same, it is good, but not as I expected.</li>
            <li>Actually I wasn&#x27;t nearly impressed with this one as i was with other products similar to this one.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely and has a slight tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product  works wonders post chemical peel and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li>, slight rose scent.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to give it time to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The serum comes in an attractive dark blue glass bottle and a dropper lid.</li>
            <li>The serum is a clear cloudy gel like formula that absorbs quickly into the face and neck.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Skin is smoother and no irritation, which is rare because my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>it leaves it really soft after applying it, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised on how quickly I noticed a tighter shrinking of the pore holes and a luminous look to my skin...</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and is not dry</li>
            <li>The upside (unlike most products similar) is the amount is twice the normal.</li>
            <li>, it dries quickly, it works well with my moisturizer, and makeup , most of all it really does make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed a difference in skin tone and firmness, not dramatic</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, seems a bit thick at first but glides on easily, and dries completely.</li>
            <li>I like the serum, but need to use it for a certain time to see the result.</li>
            <li>Stick with a pure grade Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>so that was pure Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>Large sized bottle for the money.  </li>
            <li>We All Have Large Amounts Of Spaces Between Our Skin Cells, Where It Provides Moisture, Firmness And Suppleness To Our Skin.</li>
            <li>If I slept on  wrinkle, I had a large mark on my skin that stayed almost all day.</li>
            <li>I couldn’t really tell if it affected my skin, but the end result (when I combined it with a moisturizer) was positive, so it wouldn’t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>Love how this soaks in fast and helps relieve dry skin (and lips).  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels soothed and soft, the serum absorbs really fast and although you feel tightening your skin is super moisturized.</li>
            <li>If the positive reviews are genuine then I must conclude I belong to a different species whose skin does not respond to this concoction.</li>
            <li>Apparently it is medically a good and positive substance, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative side affects.</li>
            <li>Will update after using second bottle if I see any difference in the appearance of my fine</li>
            <li>The fine lines are not so noticeable, I also use it on my neck and upper chest area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and started noticing fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles are finally disappearing!</li>
            <li>After several uses my fine lines appear to have blurred out.</li>
            <li>I used the Inst Hyaluronic Acid Serum to try to get rid of some of the fine lines that have started to pop up the last couple years.</li>
            <li>It has diminished some fine lines that were starting to bug me!  </li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid Serum works for both the larger and fine wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li>She has lots of wrinkles and this product will defiantly reduce the fine lines and deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This stuff helps clear skin fast!!</li>
            <li>It is too early to say if it is reducing fine lines or wrinkles, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regarding the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement, however, it&#x27;s only been two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have been conscious of good skin care from seeing seeing my father put on Oilay when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a huge 2 fl oz/60 ml bottle that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge change in my overall skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>

            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid serum is working very well.  </li>

            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>Since I also take H A in a capsule or as a free powder, and use a derma needle thing occasionally, I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s what.</li>
            <li>So, I thank you so much for taking the time and your effort.</li>
            <li>It really plumped out my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s making my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and nourishing.</li>
            <li>And this Serum really reduced wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ALL their products!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a change yet.</li>
            <li>so I really can;t see a difference yet</li>
            <li>, also I don;t really know how much</li>
            <li>I really can see results by using this for 2 weeks and have already ordered another</li>
            <li>It softens my skin and leaves it hydrated the whole day.</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and my moisturizer sinks in better since using it.</li>
            <li>so I know what real wrinkles look like.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact that it dries fast, and it doesn&#x27;t irritare my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>Its not watery,  its much thicker.  </li>
            <li>AJ - thanks for contacting me</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I use it under my daily moisturizer with SPF, and my face seems to glow and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!  </li>
            <li>Now I know that my 55 year old laugh lines are not going to disappear</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Thanks AJ</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing will need this for winter.</li>
            <li>and I notice my skin looks so much brighter, healthier looking, plump, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>SO I CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY.</li>
            <li>My face already looking very well.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is also very generously sized.</li>
            <li>Solution is sticky and causes my face to shine too much under makeup.</li>
            <li>This serum has really helped with these changes.  </li>
            <li>Got this product for the areas I didn&#x27;t want injected and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>My wife has really seen a difference in her face.  </li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t seen much reduction in wrinkles, but likes how this makes her skin feel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind which is great.  </li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid serum has really helped with the bags and discolor under my eyes.</li>
            <li>is just very slipery feel.</li>
            <li>Really cannot see any difference.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really see any improvement of the skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use that much in one application</li>
            <li>The formula is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much softer the skin is after using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My skin feels absolutely baby-soft.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in my face and eyes.</li>
            <li>Have to say this serum is really working.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s helping much with my hyper pigmentation though.</li>
            <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start.</li>
            <li>After two months my skin is smoother, tighter, and much brighter and glowing.  </li>
            <li>Really like this, I have ordered 2 times and plan on ordering again when I am out</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>Granted, at my age of 68, I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I do have under eye bags and some darkening under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li>but I can say that much of the dryness has gone.</li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to with this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for hydrating your skin!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am using the serum and find it goes on well and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li>This comes in a very generous sizes bottle and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped my self image.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It s too soon to tell if this product is really working, however its not worsening my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, I really wanted to rid face of these problem areas.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin tone and skin texture.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin look and feel better/younger.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t find any improvement.  </li>
            <li>My skin began to break out and this has really cleared it up...</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>However, my skin FEELS younger, firmer, fresher and that is important to me.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way my face feels and looks</li>
            <li>The website said the way to rectify the situation was to make sure your face was wet when the product was applied so that the acid could lock the moisture in.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re fortunate, inside is an intact, blue glass bottle a stopper.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum...</li>
            <li>I really do see a difference.</li>
            <li>I whole heartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has a thicker consistency, which makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It dries fast not sticky at all</li>
            <li>but this seems to be much improved.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and I believe that i I actually had any noticeble wrinkles they would be gone.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really need it, and so I used it once to see how well it can be used and would there be any types of problems.</li>
            <li>When I ran to the mirror, I noticed the laugh lines nearly gone when I&#x27;m not laughing or smiling and the darkness under my eyes improved dramatically.</li>
            <li>AND I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE  VERY</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I find that my face feels much smoother and has an improved glow.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I really like how it works.</li>
            <li>I really like the serum</li>
            <li>It really helps plump up the skin around my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet)</li>
            <li>i would really recommend and i have also told some about it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it.</li>
            <li>It is clear, odorless and is easily absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I really feel like it&#x27;s improving the look and feel of the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced , also.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product started working from day one.</li>
            <li>My face is so much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have age spots, but adore this for making my skin plump and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Then I went through my bottle so fast.</li>
            <li>this was a real surprise to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin feels very solt.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Now, to be real.....</li>
            <li>It really helps my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Although it contains Hyaluronic Acid I did not find it to be very moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li>But the price is so reasonable, you&#x27;ll want to keep expanding the areas where you use it</li>
            <li>The company was very gracious about the situation.</li>
            <li>And Was Really Curious To Find Out More About This Beauty Product.</li>
            <li>I really like all the aditional ingredients that are added to help your skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t leave the house much.</li>
            <li>It really helps my skin to retain moisture</li>
            <li>Its worth a shot for the moisturizing benefits alone, anti-aging would just be an added bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very drying no change in skin</li>
            <li>She highly recommends it!</li>
            <li>Get the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum instead, it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>I tried this brand since I went through the 1 oz so fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have very oily skin, and still prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I really have no discernible wrinkles</li>
            <li>Bought this product to use in conjunction with a vitamin c serum to really add a glow and air-brushed texture to mt skin...</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks much smoother and feels firmer.  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating at all</li>
            <li>I find that Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>I am very lined around</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in the wrinkle area....</li>
            <li>I really like that it is paraben-free and alcohol-free, so</li>
            <li>However, it was packed very well</li>
            <li>Feels really moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell any difference after having used this for a month, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin in any way.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve seen any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>What a relief it is to find something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>plus it really helps with my under eye puffiness in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>thanks for letting me review In exchange for product</li>
            <li>I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li>- they recommend to gently pat the product on your skin and let it absorb.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really do feel like the serum has been helping beat winter skin.</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>I have found this product to be very helpful on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 33 and need to really fix the damage to my skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do much, but I have noticed quite an improvement in the blotchy spots on my face....</li>
            <li>I guess the damage is just too much for any cream or serum to help with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Guess my skin is just too damaged and wrinkled for anything to help much.</li>
            <li>I suppose, I&#x27;m expecting too much and too soon.</li>
            <li>I think these types of products take weeks at 2 times a day usage to show any real progress.</li>
            <li>A nurse that looked 10 years younger for her age because of her smooth skin recommends the product and purchases it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Very noticeable results since I&#x27;ve started using hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this serum and all of their products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a reasonable price which is another incentive.  </li>
            <li>but this product really delivers.</li>
            <li>and you get twice as much product (2 oz) in comparison to Skinceuticals (1 oz).</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend buying this to add that moisture</li>
            <li>Thank you so much am so going to keep ordering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li>Has a very convenient dropper so you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love that there is only a light scent to geranium essential oil, no heavy perfume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I love the formula so far.</li>
            <li>I have never until now used a product that did not make some kind of noticeable difference when you put it on your skin whether good or bad, this one does neither</li>
            <li>This is a nice blend of several different serums.</li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old woman and starting to notice more lines, puffiness, and a bit of a gobble neck.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural is my FAVORITE skin care company Thank you for keeping this 54year young skin YOUNGER</li>
            <li>Finally, at this age I realize what it is like to have clear skin and feel confident about my looks...</li>
            <li>I have tried several serums and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It contains many beneficial ingredients, and a 5% hyaluronic acid, which is pretty high compared to other products in the market.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a cool gel and sinks in IMMEDIATELY, so you have to work quickly to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>Strange but TRUE!  </li>
            <li>you are interested in a vegan, cruelty-free product, there are limited choices available.</li>
            <li>the texture is just right as far as the thickness  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and just takes a couple drops each application so this bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>It is now very soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>The serum is thick, easy to apply and you can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I like how this serum is slightly thicker and it goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin with more wrinkles than I can count, but the serum has increased the moisture and it feels softer.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t tighten up my skin like the other hyaluronic acid does.</li>
            <li>but it seems that my skin has gone back to its original texture before I started using this after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>when I did  not used any other lotion on top of it.  </li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li>Plus, you get so much more of it than what other sellers offer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic Acid products that have worked better.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;ve used this going on 3 months and just noticed the other day that my chest looks sooo much better.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get the sticky feeling that many other serums gives you.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected!</li>
            <li>I am also using other  products from this company and love them all.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li>I love the other benefits I get with this serum.</li>
            <li>Its not watery like most other brands</li>
            <li>and my skin just feels better, probably due to the aloe and all the moisturizers in this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered many other brands at all price ranges.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me tell you that I am obsessed with anti aging products, lol.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a film or odor and does not dry my skin out or make it oily.</li>
            <li>I have reviewed 6 hyaluronic serums in the past year and this with every other instanatural product was by far the best.</li>
            <li>I like your product VERY much and have nearly used my 1st bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries which is very fast, I immediately feel my skin tightening and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>They really have the customer at heart and I highly recommend them and their product.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight difference, its still kind of early.</li>
            <li>My skin has a tendency to act up with certain products, so I am always nervous using new products.  </li>
            <li>and when I wear make up on top, normally with other products I would get an oily t-zone</li>
            <li>It seems like the dark circles under my eyes are already better.</li>
            <li>I have used for a couple of weeks now, the only result is that my face is full with pimples.</li>
            <li>I just love the fact that it gets rid of the puffiness under my eyes and diminshes my dark circles.</li>
            <li>am 62 having celebrated my birthday last month.  </li>
            <li>Grunge rock was in, tanning was cool and acne was a bigger worry than wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>There are much more expensive products on the market that are not even near as nice as this.  </li>
            <li>so I use it more than an average person would.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 years old and have taken care of myself pretty well.  </li>
            <li>gave me lively skin , got lots of compliment , Thank You !</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that even though its packed with powerful ingredients its did not make my skin look red or flaky as some other serums I have used before have done .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than this, it&#x27;s clear, and goes on the face nicely and dries to a clear finish.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t really prevented new acne spots</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m 62 and my new  high school students thought I was in my 40s!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m less oily than I was before I started using it &amp; have gotten so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a slight scent that I love.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for several more weeks (on my face and upper neck) and continue to monitor the results.</li>
            <li>I am older but I can see still see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li>It probably works the same, but it sure doesn’t feel the same!</li>
            <li>It seems like a decent product.</li>
            <li>This absorbs incredibly quickly, and you can immediately feel the different in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>Being a older woman I am conerned what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a bit more fluid/liquid than it actually is, but no big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks, and I notice improvement in the area around my mouth particularly.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more Insta-natural face care products in the future</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li>and it is bigger and more affordable than the one I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>I had been using Instanaturals facial toner with adequate results but when I tried their moisturizing serum immediately after, I was blown away by its tightening effects.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li>Mainly took out some of the redness on my chest - which I assume is sun damage (at my age - 60+).</li>
            <li>but I tried it any way the product has improved my skin texture decently</li>
            <li>feel this Serum penetrate deep and quickly giving to my skin the balance and moisture that I need without the grime and shine.</li>
            <li>Once I use it on a regular basis, I will come back and write a more thorough review.  </li>
            <li>I started the serum with realistic expectations and hopes of smoother, more even and less pigmentation.</li>
            <li>It was a major concern for me because most Vit C serums contain 20% and my sensitive skin simply cant handle it.</li>
            <li>I really like that its all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, because I have pretty sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything when you apply it.</li>
            <li>The first week, when I applied only this (for testing purposes) after showering, it really didn’t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>The first hyalauric acid serum was like a gel, so I was quite surprised the new one was so watery.</li>
            <li>When I recived it, I was pleased to find that it was in a glass bottle as opposed to WattsBeauty&#x27;s plastic squirt bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face, and patted it dry, then used about a large pea-sized drop on my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The serum is more like a gel with the right consistency (not too watery nor too thick).</li>
            <li>two benefits of hyaluronic acid that are highly sought after.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>

            <li>I love this product, I only used it a few days and can clearly see a huge difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, shipping is usually high on those websites.</li>

            <li>/&gt;i would highly recommend this if you have age spots or discoloring&lt;br /&gt;ive</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>Not only are the products amazing but the follow up and customer service is unmatched with any other company that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old, and I find this works better than any other product I have used, and I have used a lot.</li>
            <li>There have been several times where I had to apply more because it dried too quick.</li>
            <li>: Item was packaged in it&#x27;s own separate box (see pic) inside of larger box containing other items.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do feel like the original price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s discounted right now.</li>
            <li>I used hyaluronic in oral use for arthritic pain and it works wonders, so I&#x27;m giving the serum a little more time...</li>
            <li>i just need a little more time to see how my wrinkles do...</li>
            <li>With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  </li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>Bought a second one after the first got over!</li>
            <li>Not long, but so far my skin does feel softer and my overall skin tone is looking much more even.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old!!</li>
            <li>I am going to wait a little while before trying any more of the products</li>
            <li>my neck area appears somewhat better, I have to use it further to really tell, skin is loose still.</li>
            <li>It is a gel consistency and soaks in very quickly without leaving my face feeling sticky like other products.</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C products before with the Hyaluronic acid, but this one was too strong.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son has been using a little for his pimples and they are completely gone, truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the best smelling, but it wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li>It holds in moisture very well and offers additional help with the vitamins C &amp; E. Recommend.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel soft, but I don&#x27;t really see a visible improvement in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, rosacea, and have found this product to be gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>watery substance, not thick and creamy like I am used to in a serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit early to see much improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>I feel I&#x27;m too young to really notice any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I really like the effects so far.</li>
            <li>But so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>so far i really like it  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes for Dry &amp; Mature skin - helps with the lack of elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines</li>
            <li>Moisturizes for Dry &amp; Mature skin - helps with the lack of elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines</li>
            <li>Needless to say this is working great.</li>
            <li>I would have to agree, I feel that it is quite firming, and is also gentle on my sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Its soft,  crows feet are disappearing so fast, and everyone says my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li>My age spots have faded considerably, but what I really like is how it changed the texture of my skin without feeling at all sticky.  </li>
            <li>It appears that this formula is packed with all gentle, natural ingredients in addition to hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, like witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I am 86 years old and this serum has made my face so much smoother</li>
            <li>far, I do not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very well, makes the skin so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, come on time, works well, everything that I expected.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product</li>
            <li>Thus far I haven&#x27;t noticed too much improvement.  </li>
            <li>face seems slightly more youthful and definitely softer to me, and my skin is definitely worn from being a professional gardener&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I put it on after washing my face, before my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>Maybe after a few more weeks I will see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a few weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I applied twice a day after I washed and toned my skin normally.</li>
            <li>I love the vitamin c, green tea, and jojoba oil combined with the hyaluronic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Youth hyaluronic acid before and that is DEF worth the extra money!  </li>
            <li>I feel that is has been worth trying I&#x27;ll have another review for you later.</li>
            <li>I want to contact seller to see why and ask if normal,  </li>
            <li>Might be normal but</li>
            <li>I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Insta-Natural’s Hyaluronic with Vitamin C and Vitamin E.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>but I could honestly say this has taken at least 5 years off my chest</li>
            <li>so I am also unsure if the smell is the normal for this product)?</li>
            <li>After I slide it on to my face, neck and decolletage, I wait a few moments, and then apply my favorite Vitamin A Retinol Cream.</li>
            <li>, two blemishes on my face healed faster than normal.  </li>
            <li>Impurities are coming out of my skin stays smooth and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>I apply this every morning and evening, as directed, and have seen such success with improving my skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the dropper vial extended all the way to the bottom of the bottle, eliminating any waste.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that there are no chemicals or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>It definitely gave my skin a fresh and dewy appearance, without making it look greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>the ingredients were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed miracles, per se, but the smaller pores, fading scars and calmer skin is worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel that my skin is softer and more firm in 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Once absorbed, the product is not sticky and does leave my skin smooth, soft and firm.  </li>
            <li>Thick but not greasy and absorbs into skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Not oily or greasy like you would think it would be, and my skin just drinks it up like it was the only thing it has seen this good in a long long time!</li>
            <li>This is mych better for less money!</li>
            <li>I did get several tiny zits the first week of using it, but they went away and I am pregnant</li>
            <li>Regular moisturizers tend to help the dry spots, but clog my pores in the more oily areas.  </li>
            <li>start off my skincare routine by cleansing my skin 2x/day with Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, followed by Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Witch Hazel Toner, then follow it up with this product.</li>
            <li>I really love how this product goes on thin and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>That said, this is definitely a very competitively priced, compared to other products with similar ingredients, and I love InstaNatural as a company.</li>
            <li>To me it feels like nothing more than plain Aloe-</li>
            <li>Now my skin bounces right back like a teenager!</li>
            <li>The serum is too think on my facial skin,my skin isn&#x27;t soft or smooth feeling, not soft to my touch, it does do a good job on my hands, the skin is thinner on my hands than on my face has a thick dermis.</li>
            <li>and it really does hydrate like no other!  </li>
            <li>so it goes on easily and cools down the skin after treatment too.</li>
            <li>The product goes a long way &amp; even though I&#x27;ve been using it a short time, my face seems to be brighter, lines not so prominent &amp; adult breakouts stopped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, we were without A/C for an extended period of time (due to a lack of available parts) and the temps in our home almost reached 100 degrees at one point.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to serums, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always hesitant about using something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new user with premature aging from alot of sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new cleansing and moisturizing line</li>
            <li>This month I will be trying out new stuff from them.</li>
            <li>like me, you are new to the concept of applying a liquidy gel and then moisturizing, give it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated, smooth and toned after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>The dark areas under my eyes are diminishing, fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has no smell, it seems to be working well on all areas except for the deep wrinkles around my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Up until now I have only used one brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum (HA), and I have been very pleased with my results, but this time when I came close to finishing my usual brand, I thought that I would try another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so most of my time is spent outside in the elements &amp;</li>
            <li>I reordered some more today......&amp; believe me I was so tired of trying everything with golden promises &amp; no results.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy residue on the surface of my skin as so many other products have done in the past.  </li>
            <li>but it does leave my skin very soft</li>
            <li>Although I definitely need to use moisturizer after I use this (before bed, after washing my face), the product is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with a touch of Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was worried about it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>the skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li>When I apply this serum it  leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Started using this on my hands, they were looking very old.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re a lazy type, this serum is super easy to use and actually works.  </li>
            <li>I plan on saving the pretty colbolt blue bottle!!!</li>
            <li>Apparently my skin really needed this as it soaks it in so well</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty big deal when it comes to getting presents for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to lighten my dark spots &amp; smooth of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic in a bottle can do after a few months of use!</li>
            <li>Instantly after first use, I notice my skin was brighter, it feels like I just used a whitening mask for 20 mins.</li>
            <li>KEEP MY FACE SOFT AND MOISTURE ALL DAY!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for over two weeks now and am starting to see results, real results!</li>
            <li>After using this product every day for the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed even more change.  </li>
            <li>I have had dark circles all my life and after using this, I have seen fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just too old for repairs at this point!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve not been able to use it consistently due to a break out totally unrelated to this product (I have rosacea which has decided to flare).  </li>
            <li>After trying Insta natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid I will never do that again!</li>
            <li>The first bottle seemed to do something to my skin but not the second one.</li>
            <li>and I the fine lines seem less.</li>
            <li>my face feels exactly the same as when I&#x27;ve used organic Aloe on my face.  </li>
            <li>I followed all directions listed on the product which were pretty simple.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, I am conscious of the crow&#x27;s feet &amp; laugh lines, along with a loosening of my jaw line.</li>
            <li>I use the Vitamin C Serum sold by same company first</li>
            <li>So if you are vegan or interested in using cruelty-free products, you should definitely give this a chance.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it helps to erase wrinkles - but maybe iust prevents from having more.</li>
            <li>Definite decrease in lines including deep ones around my mouth, firmer skin even on my neck and upper lids and spots and pores look a lot better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 10 days so far, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any real changes, but the reviews say at least two or more weeks.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First, does it break me out and second, does it irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how this hydrates without feeling heavy!</li>
            <li>Had too many other ingredients and not enough of the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s The Exact Opposite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting more than usual compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>first being vegan with no animal testing and second it does plump up the skin...</li>
            <li>face feels firmer and the fine lines around my mouth seem to be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are almost completely gone and I&#x27;m hopeful that they will stay gone!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Personally, I like that it comes in the colored bottle because it blocks sunlight, and many substances break down due to light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the action of other skincare products, and it&#x27;s so far been fine to use under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While there&#x27;s still some residual moisture in my skin, I put a little over a full dropper of serum in my hand and gently pat this all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality serum and comes in a large blue glass bottle, which speaks to the quality and care of the company in protecting the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always cautious about trying out new creams, serums and lotions because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle was half filled.</li>
            <li>Although not a fan of the dropper, would prefer a pump the product goes on easily and dries in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>However, I now suspect the seal was broken, as the plastic wrap around the top literally fell off when I first handled it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more Insta Natural products and I am anxiously waiting to use them.  </li>
            <li>Well first of all this this review is kind of useless.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have high hopes of much improvement in my 63 year old facial skin with sun damage.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be helping with sun spots a little, and some fine lines</li>
            <li>My 68-year-old skin feels soft and supple with very few wrinkles, and I hope this regimen keeps it that way for many years.</li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes are significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li>it really gives me an instant moisture, I am really new on skin care</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but it really seems to be improving the discoloration from too much sun.</li>
            <li>The texture out of the bottle is a little on the thick side making it feel more like a gel, but it glides on my face easily.</li>
            <li>My skin not only looks more radiant and plump, but it&#x27;s noticeably less oily.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased a different brand that I think worked better.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and soft and my ( ) are less visible</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, but seems very lite and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>I have treated my face regularly over the past few years for spots and they continue to come more and more every summer on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In the dry heat environment is just the right product.</li>
            <li>I have few fine lines but need help around mouth and eyes</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning under my face cream which I mixed with a bit of emu oil, and at night under pure emu oil on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>My skin just soaked this stuff up - I am not sure if that&#x27;s normal, or if I am that much in need of hydration, but I barely got the chance to rub it in before it all was absorbed!  </li>
            <li>As a large molecule, it doesn&#x27;t permeate deep into the skin, but instead stays near the surface where it moisturizes the skin surface</li>
            <li>My facial pores appear to be smaller and the wrinkles and fine lines are definitely minimized.  </li>
            <li>OK, but the product is stock in the bottle, vey hard to take out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>:) I bet those are really hard to remove.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about InstaNaturals&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the bottle is twice the size for the same price of other hyaluronic serums on the market right now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick yet dries quick and has made my skin look that much better than the other leading brand.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The serum also dries without a residue which is great because I have hated &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; since I was a baby, or so I&#x27;m told, so the smooth feeling of the serum is a must for me, and this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT IS A CLEAR COLORED SERUM</li>
            <li>It helped clear my skin tho</li>
            <li>I happened to quit taking H.A. about then, unfortunately, and over the following years I began to notice that my skin wasn&#x27;t so great looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li>Now I need to go see a dermatologist to clear it</li>
            <li>and I had to take antihistamine tablets and steroid ointment to clear it up.</li>
            <li>product packs a punch in the form of a clear gel.</li>
            <li>There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li>This is a product that really does what it claims to do, plus it is natural, they never test on animals, and I have had terrific results with this!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and my skin is clear again.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Has kept my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Insta Natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum without a clue as to what &amp;#34;hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; even was.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>It helps to smooth and tighten a few of the wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I do think it helps my 65 year old</li>
            <li>so far altho</li>
            <li>If you can give me some insight into what I should be expecting as far as results that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This bottle is twice as much as I use to purchase and about the same price.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin soft.</li>
            <li>bought for myself  see no difference so far</li>
            <li>using just for about a week and the result is visible, my skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>if your ambient air is damp, it will absorb water from the air and give you a soft, hydrated layer over your skin.</li>
            <li>Not too drying for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t gotten rashes or reactions to the product, even though my skin is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>She recently commented on how much she is liking it and says that her skin is tighter and the lines are smoothing out.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>93 year old mother</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old.</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I am early in my use.</li>
            <li>My face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; felt soft, and were visibly moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old &amp; avoiding surgery, etc.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt as soft and hydrated as it does using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li>Just used twice so far</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is acne prone.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old</li>
            <li>Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li>I dont see any difference in my skin, since my skin is sensitive I did not get any adverse reactions</li>
            <li>I decided to try Insta Natural brand.</li>
            <li>so far i do not see any improvement</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 51 year old guy and</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the darkness but not as much in the puffiness yet.</li>
            <li>Too early to say for just 8 days I&#x27;m using , I will continue to use after a month</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum really works I have been using it for several months</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Another added bonus is that it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It is also not expensive and lasts a long time considering how often I use it and am including my hands and face....</li>
            <li>soft moistured hydrated  with natural ingredients  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a week now, and so far, I like the results I am getting.</li>
            <li>I try to take as much care of it as much as possible.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen any marked improvements in my wrinkles but the product does make my skin feel softer and gives it a heathier look which i like</li>
            <li>I rub it in some, then let it soak in naturally.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I am not getting sensitivity or redness from this.</li>
            <li>and I feel my face looks brighter, smoother, and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I think I would have gone directly to the product had it been listed by it&#x27;s usefulness.  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have oddly sensitive skin, so I gave this a one night trial test.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, or everyone with sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Everyday use makes your skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li>I credit the Hyaluromic Acid Serum and both the Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin lotion and richer face cream (for night).  </li>
            <li>My typically sensitive skin loves this too.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than facial lift.</li>
            <li>and I still look like a 50 year old woman.  </li>
            <li>This serum makes your face feel firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks and feel it is too early to access results.  </li>
            <li>The second bottle was very runny.</li>
            <li>As a 75 year old woman, I thought I was too old for anything to work.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin is supple and soft.</li>
            <li>My face looks alive again&lt;</li>
            <li>but so far I do not have any issues.</li>
            <li>My complexion has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li>and I like all the natural extras that are added with this item.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy formula that makes skin so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews and doing a  price comparison (twice as much product for about the same price)</li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Your skin naturally contains hyaluronic acid, but the amount decreases with age.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;ve def got some sun damage on both face/chest and just thought my chest was too far gone.  </li>
            <li>I like the way my skin feels, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>but i had not seen any disadvantages to using this product so far.</li>
            <li>During this time I tried everything (natural products) and nothing seemed to help my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li>No heavy face residue.</li>
            <li>Prior to this combo, I was using very pricey Dr Perricone and Lancome products.</li>
            <li>Since I am eighty, I am probably to old to judge</li>
            <li>Additionally, Insta Natural&#x27;s product does not contain alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>Not so desirable, and seems counter-productive to the HA action.</li>
            <li>so far i like it.</li>
            <li>As far as helping for wrinkles its too soon to tell as I&#x27;ve not used it but about two weeks and not everyday.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 50 years old, I mention this for people to have an idea.</li>
            <li>I admit I was surprised to read all of the ingredients in one bottle.</li>
            <li>, I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far I have used it for about a week and my face is noticeably softer.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my face looks too young..</li>
            <li>NATURAL  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, just soft.</li>
            <li>There are no harsh smells associated with thia serum and alll of the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li>Within one application of this product, my skin was hydrated, and soft.</li>
            <li>For the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working effectively so far.</li>
            <li>I tried the InstaNatural Premium Hydration Hyaluronic Acid Serum Professional Formula.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>When I stumbled upon Insta Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li>At All Or Pull Any Of  Your Natural Beauty</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Is A Naturally Occurring Substance Found In The Skin.</li>
            <li>You only need about a pea sized amount for your whole face, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, it was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li>When applied it really tightens up my facial and neck line skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 71years old and women age 50 and up</li>
            <li>This product has reversed the hands of time and given me a reminder how young my mom once looked like.</li>
            <li>The serum melts into the skin leaving it soft and</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised at the results...</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and hydrated after using it.  </li>
            <li>skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell</li>
            <li>the manufacturer&#x27;s website, this identical product is available for a few dollars at the 2oz size.</li>
            <li>do really like this product, and would recommend it to a friend or relative.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say something here about avoiding the problem by not getting old</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t really like is the texture and</li>
            <li>I use this interchangablely with the insta natural vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin naturally</li>
            <li>I no longer have flaking issues around old acne scars and my skin looks &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;, but not in an oily way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft and supple after one week of use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far it seems like its making my skin softer.</li>
            <li>This is the winner by far.</li>
            <li>Still early to see results</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>This makes your face look radiant and young ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a close tie between those two products for me so far.  </li>
            <li>So soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and tighter, I&#x27;ll order again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li>Really like this product and will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>Only been using the product a few days, but am satisfied with the results I am seeing.</li>
            <li>After only a few days of use, my skin feels more moisturized and somehow fuller.</li>
            <li>This product feels good on my face and leaves no residue, stickiness, or uncomfortable build up.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is thick enough to be used on his own</li>
            <li>BUT, much more slowly then advertised.</li>
            <li>Slowly, but sure working</li>
            <li>Slowly but surely, my face is regaining the glow it used to have.</li>
            <li>Major improvement after 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li>It smells fine compared to other oils and such that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have some fine lines on the left side of my face from smoking and probably also due to the relentless California sun.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long to notice a different in fading age spots, but it makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been following the directions provided: washing, toning, applying the serum then using my usual oil over the top and WOW!</li>
            <li>It is way better than other serums that are more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I let it dry first and also use a moisturizer over the serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting this serum on my face, neck, and chest at night before bed and never really noticed significant differences until about the 2nd week I&#x27;d been using this.</li>
            <li>That being said, this serum does contain some powerful ingredients found in other skin products, and it didn’t irritate my skin or anything when I tried it (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Paired with the night cream that&#x27;s all the regimen you need, I&#x27;ll be super young fast little lines are getting even smaller</li>
            <li>I love the consistency is thick, feels more potent &amp; less scary than &#x27;acid&#x27;</li>
            <li>However I have been pretty rough on my hands over 58 years and one can expect only so much improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really excited about this product and have even recommended it to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li>it would be that it feels kind of thick and sticky at first, but that feeling goes away in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, making sure yo follow directions and putting the serum on the neck area along with the jaw lone up yo behind the ears.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that because this is fast absorbing you have to work really quickly</li>
            <li>What I think makes this product so special is the way that the bottle has an applicator dropper allowing me to do a lot with just a little</li>
            <li>Then about a week into it, I was putting on makeup, and where I usually put on my cover up on, my forehead where I have some fine wrinkle lines, I didn&#x27;t have to put on any cover up, and didn&#x27;t even think about it until, I got to the doctors office.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the wrinkles, but my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li>I have never been more disappointed and believe me I wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li>I have already ordered a second bottle although there is still a lot left in the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Recently I used this on my sunburned skin with thw skin brightening lotIon instead of my usual banana boat sun lotion on and the results were way better.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and I have been using this product twice a day since the middle of DEC, 2014 with no negative effects.  </li>
            <li>You can feel it actually working, as it dries it tightens slightly to reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to my friends &amp; clients, it actually works and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>I recently started using the serum so its to early to comment about wrinkles and finelines but onething which I noticed serum dry up very quickly and get dry skin feeling after use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying this serum and making it a part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li>This is such an high quality product.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I purchased had a broken syringe tip, but Instanatural was quick to replace it with a brand new item.  </li>
            <li>This winter my skin has been very dry and flaky but after a few days of using it has plumped back up and is nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li>That in itself is a major plus to me!</li>
            <li>This serum glides on and drys quickly but does not give you that tight feeling .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a short time but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I am over 40 years old and barely have any visible lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, and my skin tone has definitely evened out some, and overall looks smoother, so I really do like it so far.</li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid  Serum is helpful, but it is not as much as I would need this soon, perhaps long time use because of my advance age.</li>
            <li>It really works to keep my face hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li>that for so long, and the seller deserves another five stars by showing me how much they care for their customers.</li>
            <li>I do not normally need to use facial products as I rarely have skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>The main difference was that InstaNatural came in a 2 ounce bottle while the other brand came in a one ounce bottle (for more or less the same price).</li>
            <li>I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li>I like all the other ingredients in the serum, especially the vitamin C and green tea, which when applied topically are known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>A little bit of the light gel is enough to cover all the face.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried to buy similar products in stores before, but the prices are very high, even with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>However, the serum did make my skin feel as if it were burning the first several times I used it which I was assured was normal  by other Hyaluronic acid users and it has never bothered me again.</li>
            <li>But as someone who is 44 and trying to avoid the signs of age, I&#x27;m open to learning about new beauty products.</li>
            <li>I live in an area with very low humidity.</li>
            <li>It is a new Holy Grail product that is currently being added as a requirement in my skin care.</li>
            <li>I had purchased two other products from this company that I like very much.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with some dry spots.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have a very pronounced T-Zone where my face is oily on/around my nose, up and across my forehead, but dry everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also I doesn&#x27;t dry my skin so much if I forget to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I only have used it for a week, too early to evaluate completely.</li>
            <li>more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really wish to have the same one from last year.</li>
            <li>So, this comment shouldn&#x27;t be an absolute for someone else younger or who has different skin.</li>
            <li>,can&#x27;t see how much serum is actually in that blue bottle</li>
            <li>The ingredients are clearly defined, the packaging is basic and sealed, and this company offers it with Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li>I see that the red blotches on my face are much lighter if not totally gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated and it is absorbed quickly, no greasy or sticky</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s thick but applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and it did not give any messy residue.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The added green tea feature of this serum makes your face and neck feel SUPER refreshed after you put it on, as does the vitamin C.</li>
            <li>and it certainly has helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, prone to redness especially in the cheek area (not rosacea).</li>
            <li>I liked this serum and the price was generous, but given all the beneficial ingredients I really was disappointed to find it had witch hazel in a very high concentration.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was double the amount and was a better deal compared to a similar item I&#x27;d purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>My facial pores are smaller and less fine lines.</li>
            <li>In the mean time I&#x27;m putting vitamin A&amp;D to help with this issue as I do love the overall results!</li>
            <li>This product need a greater concentration of Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid, I prefer using a 100% product, with at least a 25% Vitamin C product!</li>
            <li>But once I start putting the serum every day before makeup, I started to see the difference my skin was much smoother and my puffiness was less than I normally have.</li>
            <li>My (old) normal routine was wash, pat dry, and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and tight.</li>
            <li>, it smells nice and a little goes a long way, I have only been using it for a short time, so I have not noticed any big changes.</li>
            <li>Our skins&#x27; texture and tone has improved significantly and we have noticed a brighter complexion only after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This is a full 2oz for the same price as other very similar products.</li>
            <li>The Insta Naturals Vitamin C serum is nice and smell like citrus, it is however also a very thick serum, I will be using it from today!  </li>
            <li>it is very good and does not cause any make up base to peel off....</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Have been using it for about a month, I used to have a very dry skin specially my forehead, now it feels soft and my small lines and facial skin looks much healthier , I have rosacea and it has also help to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a few changes to my facial skin, less dry in the morning when I first apply and those lines around my mouth are better as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week of use as well, the wrinkles on her forehead were almost non-existent and her skin also looked generally</li>
            <li>Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li>Really have not used this product long enough to see how well it works..</li>
            <li>The creases around my eyes were reduced and I was surprised to see my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the first week, there was a noticeable reduction in my pore size and even dark marks which I wasn’t expecting at all.</li>
            <li>I would go back to my old routine- Philosophy</li>
            <li>essential oil by Young Living</li>
            <li>I apply it once, directly after washing my face, daily.  </li>
            <li>Tiny lines around my eyes and lips are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a reviewer, aside from the fact I spend too much of my day ordering anything that looks remotely beneficial from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on trying&lt;br /&gt;beauty products that just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>My face still feels soft and I like the overall smoothness.</li>
            <li>The protective barrier around my sinus area was (is) completely removed leaving my skin red with a burning sensation for 4 months.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the low price of this serum.  </li>
            <li>HYALURONIC IN THE NEAR FUTURE--</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin plumped, soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>The deep lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m turning 50 yes old next month</li>
            <li>Some improvement is noticed, but not enough time has passed to offer complete review</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old, but if you saw me you would guess a younger age--maybe 50 something.  </li>
            <li>must say though that I have developed a drying up of my skin just below my lips just above either side of chin (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve recommended it to five friends and 4 are using it regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back in a month or two if this helped at all with my on-and-off adult acne.</li>
            <li>and I think this is the main reason my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried a few products with hyaluronic acid in it, they have a distinct medicated scent but the added ingredients in this product gives it an additional hint of floral.</li>
            <li>I have changed up my skincare routine many times over the years, and this is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The thing is, my skin has gone from mixed to surprisingly dry in certain spots.  </li>
            <li>First the oil cleaned, shrank down and emptied my pores</li>
            <li>but would like to give it a little more time to work with the other products from your company that I purchased shortly before the serum.</li>
            <li>The serum has a lovely natural perfume (vaguely citrus) and absorbs really fast, almost like a dry oil but with no residue.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for a few weeks, appears to slightly be working, but will know more after a complete bottle.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it to help my dry skin to retain some extra moisture in the winter but the product is watered down with so much witch hazel that it actually dried me out more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of the actual permanence of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, but for the short term, it decreases the fine lines on my lower cheeks</li>
            <li>Only have had it a short time, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li>Other people started noticing something was different within the first week.  </li>
            <li>The serum is a little sticky at first but once applied to the face sinks in very well.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a second bottle although with this serum 2 ounces is obviously going to last at least 60 days or more.</li>
            <li>I do admit that due to the gel-like consistency it can be a challenge to get it into the dropper, but I find that if I gently shake the bottle then squeeze the dropper bulb</li>
            <li>The other brand was very watery.</li>
            <li>Plus price and size very affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>am a fair-skinned senior gal who spent way too many hours back in the day tanning and while I have very few wrinkles, I do have age spots and dryness and visible pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, a extremely dry state, and since I started using it</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I tested this with a small drop on the back of my right hand at night.  </li>
            <li>have been applying the serum on my face, neck &amp; decollete and it has helped reduce the appearance of my fine lines, and also helped the dark circles under my eyes less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I love it, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far, I really like this product, after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few weeks now and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27; developed red blotches and itching and thought it was just an initial reaction and would go away.</li>
            <li>This serum has no parabens, harsh chemicals, or alcohol, and most importantly, it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not satisfied, simply contact us and get a full refund.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how many other products she uses or if there is a big market for Vegan skin care</li>
            <li>The one I use at night does exactly what I want, but leaves my face a little greasy...</li>
            <li>First Off, Don&#x27;t Let that Little Word \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; Scare You.</li>
            <li>I generally have smooth skin but have noticed some rough patches and uneven tone in recent years as well as some darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use witch hazel on my skin because it has a tendency to dry my skin some, though, not excessively.</li>
            <li>My facial color is even, and minor blemishes and a new set of wrinkles are gone, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, if you have normal to dry skin definitely should use a moisturizer after using this product (or any hyaluronic acid serum).</li>
            <li>like other Hyaluronic Acid Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, I loved the little glass bottle with dropper, which made it so simple to apply the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li>It only takes 3 or 4 drops of this HA to cover my face and neck, and the InstaNaturals immediately soaked into my skin, keeping my mature and dry facial skin hydrated, and soft.</li>
            <li>The serum is very thick and clear and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serums usually offer amazing moisturizing benefits for the skin, however a lot of Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past do not deliver enough moisture to my skin and some of them even make it feel a bit dryer, so</li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes really has lightened up and the puffiness under my eyes have lessoned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 9 products (Argan Oil Hair Mask, Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum, Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles &amp; Bags, Vitamin C Facial Toner, Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer and Age- Defying Moisturizer, Hyalunoric  Acid Serum)</li>
            <li>dark spots are getting much lighter</li>
            <li>This is simply a diluted and generally inferior version of the product you thought you were getting.</li>
            <li>I had lots of dark spots on my face especially near the eye, cheek bone area.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for help with dark eye circles, but wanted to refresh my skin, plump up the lines and lighten dark spots starting to show up.  </li>
            <li>I received this in the mail earlier this week, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li>and so far I have seen some minor changes around my lips.</li>
            <li>; i don&#x27;t have enough experience with the product to provide useful feedback; please check back in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my face in the first few days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order it again to see if it keeps working as well as it did on the first round</li>
            <li>I have noticed a visible improvement in the texture of my skin within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Unequivably and without a doubt, I will be ordering this particular product as long as the company continues to sell it!!!!  </li>
            <li>Unequivably and without a doubt, I will be ordering this particular product as long as the company continues to sell it!!!!  </li>
            <li>my acne had simmered down quite a bit probably really noticed by week 2.</li>
            <li>Love,love,love this serum!!,it goes on smoothly,absorbs real fast and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I researched this and other products before I bought this particular product.  </li>
            <li>first, this moisturizing serum seemed very thick to me and I often times felt like I had applied too much of the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li>so much that I think I&#x27;ll go back to a somewhat more expensive one, but this one&#x27;s costing me!</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful introducing new products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum and other products by this company to anyone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the serum for very long, but so far my skin seems softer.  </li>
            <li>My skin has always been dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I presume this means that they use half as much HA to make the serum.</li>
            <li>Not only does it offer anti-aging benefits, like diminishing fine lines, but it can help reduce hyper-pigmentation, the appearance of dark circles, and can help soften skin to create a supple, firm look.</li>
            <li>I wash my face and wait for it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and this product really helped my skin and my dark spots...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is worth the extra step in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>It has a delicate scent and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and not to thin or too</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and not to thin or too</li>
            <li>It really plumps out and instantly rehydrates my dry dry facial skin!</li>
            <li>My face has always been dry, red, and acne prone, and every product I have tried hasn&#x27;t  cooperated with my sensitive skin until I tried this.</li>
            <li>It has a much thicker texture so I actually use less.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and acne scars and it has given me back the soft smoothness and hydrated my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for less expensive but equally as good products as Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will slow down further wrinkles and keep my skin better hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I shared my bottle with my mother  and her fine wrinkle are all gone but the deep wrinkles on the foreheads are tough to go.</li>
            <li>Thanks I will definitely continue to use this product, and it is a plus that it is less expensive than most others.</li>
            <li>so I can use as little or as much as I need.</li>
            <li>t&#x27;s has so much in that one little bottle.</li>
            <li>Other products I have used in the past have left my skin feeling oily or a filmy residue; not with instanatural, it goes on smooth and is like I&#x27;m not even wearing it.</li>
            <li>However, the little that remained was really absorbent</li>
            <li>Thank you for being real in this tough world of today, for you don&#x27;t really ever see this in today&#x27;s world anymore.</li>
            <li>It definitely was not a full bottle, about half full.</li>
            <li>My mom has helped me through all the good and bad times in my life.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and thankfully have no wrinkles to speak of, so I cannot speak to the claim of it reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but I can say that this serum is the best serum hydrator I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m a bit of a skin product junkie.</li>
            <li> Excellent  for reducing fine lines around the eyes.</li>

            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> When I use this, it smooths out the roughness, which is good for make-up application.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is good product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> Good elixir, not so good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My husband agrees with me that my skin is looking good.</li>
            <li> Save your money - buy a good lotion and wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and it smells so good to me</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good news for me.</li>
            <li> I stick with hyaluronic acid/aloe serums in the winter because they&#x27;re so good at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is particularly good at hanging on to water.)</li>
            <li> Since adjusting to the correct amount to use, the serum dries fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your product is good,  but. . . .</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free to try and I&#x27;m truly impressed.</li>
            <li> response on how good the product is.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so good.  </li>
            <li> Also the price is good for what you&#x27;re getting, imo.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser says I come from a family with good genes because I do not look 62</li>
            <li> She then asked me why my skin looked so good.  </li>
            <li> It feels good when you apply it and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product and the company.</li>
            <li> but I do see a good improvement in my skin which has increased my confidence in how I look</li>
            <li> Loved this product..</li>
            <li> good under face cream and makeup</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about where the good things stop for me and this serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our skin regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin.</li>
            <li> Great to use after cleaning the face and applying the Moroccan Rose water.</li>
            <li> My over all experience with this was good.</li>
            <li> I think I will continue to see good results as time goes by.  </li>
            <li> so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> And recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum because it also seems to be good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is good for around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> and , I have to say I really loved what it did for my skin.</li>
            <li> , I think that is fair.</li>
            <li> I am 64 and I am not aging gracefully as some people have the good fortune of doing.  </li>
            <li> My Mother-in-law even noticed that my skin looked really good.  </li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> It feels and smells good pn the skin.</li>
            <li> You will still need a good quality moisturizer also.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look good.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about hyaluronic acid and how amazing it is supposed to be for the skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing what it has done for my hand alone, not to mention my face.</li>
            <li> Based on all the promises, I was expecting amazing results.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge and truly a great value.  </li>
            <li> My face looks amazing.</li>

            <li> Great for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing how my skin change..</li>

            <li> My skin feels amazing after I  use this.</li>
            <li> The idea of putting anything title &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; on my face kind of freaked me</li>
            <li> Putting on moisturizer after the hyaluronic acid serum has absorbed into your skin is best, if you are okay with doing a 2 step process to keep your skin moisturized.</li>

            <li> It is also cost effective</li>

            <li> Addition to original review:  My skin is feeling great.  </li>

            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a month now and the tone of my skin is more even  and firmer.  </li>
            <li> As soon as it hits the skin and is massaged in, it becomes more of a watery consistency.</li>
            <li> So many of my serums tend to pill and roll up when I apply a foundation over them.</li>

            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t help under my eyes in the same manner as the BEST Vitamin C Serum For Face 2015 worked.</li>
            <li> My plan is to continue using this product and give it a chance to do its magic.  </li>
            <li> Truthfully, I receive comments continuously.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Best feature is I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li> and I love all of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, but that&#x27;s about all it does for me.  </li>
            <li> I use a day cream on top of it, so maybe the combination irritates my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love for it to even out</li>
            <li> and I am glad</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use more than 4-5 drops.</li>
            <li> you don;t have to worry about being tossed out by TSA if you are flying :)</li>
            <li> Just when I though nothing was better than the Vitamin C serum I found this.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way the glass bottle looks and feels.</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your skin look and feel 100x better than it did before</li>
            <li> It feels nice and has a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> Love this serum..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it feels BETTER than Skincell....</li>
            <li> I love it,after two weeks of use the wrinkles on my forehead reduced by 75%,my face looks fuller and smoother.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> As recommended, I follow up with a moisturizer and it does indeed keep the moisturizer from immediately soaking in, in fact it seems like the moisturizer just sits on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s more to keep you from developing more wrinkles rather than getting rid of existing ones?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching  :-)</li>
            <li> I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> This is products that I try most.</li>
            <li> I layer moisturizer over the top.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable improvement in the tone of my face and how much more even it looks.</li>
            <li> I love every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But then, as is the case with most anti-aging products, there are no overnight miracles.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day most days.</li>
            <li> Best price on the net with this seller.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So glad I did</li>
            <li> My face is clearer, brighter more youthful looking.</li>
            <li> skin much more youthful looking  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I have had Rosea for 10 years or more on my chest.</li>
            <li> I got it for a great price and my order came in fast.</li>
            <li> Really love the texture and consistency of this product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product...</li>
            <li> I love this line.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want any more grease during the day,</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial product I have used.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The serum is more gel-like than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Plus it is more moisturizing</li>
            <li> Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> I tried so many of them .This</li>
            <li> I expect this will take more time.</li>
            <li> So by adding a hyaluronic acid serum to your skincare regimen you&#x27;ll be helping whatever moisturizer you use work better by helping your skin better retain</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for the price!</li>
            <li> Love the product, just put in another order before it runs out.</li>
            <li> Wish I had before/after pics for you as I love looking at those -</li>
            <li> and you get more quantitiy.</li>
            <li> My whole body seems to need more H.A., and it&#x27;s great for more than just my face.</li>
            <li> but I really love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use moisturizer after application of this product as it is a serum and not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There has been no permanent noticeable difference on my eye areas which of course are most everybody&#x27;s concern.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> my skin is smooth after one month of using every day!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It also dose not pill when using product like makeup or moisturizers on top of it.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find out that this serum worked very well with my foundation and my sunscreen .</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was sent a free sample of this serum in order that make an informed review and my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love the way this hydrates without feeling like you have anything on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing customer service.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li> , then this serum afterwards for even more effect.  </li>
            <li> if I keep putting more on, it gets to a point where my skin is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and then it takes longer to soak in.  </li>
            <li> where my skin tone was not improving any more and with the addition of using this serum, my skin has started improving again.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and highly recommended!</li>

            <li> I can personally say, this serum is GREAT!</li>

            <li> Wrinkles in my forehead are going away, my skin is very dry and this product is wonderful,  </li>
            <li> smells amazing when it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li> but my face seems brighter and my skin is free of most blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Just got this product and haven&#x27;t even used it but looks like I am going to enjoy it, can tell from the good smell as that was the first thing I checked</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> One of the great product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Hyaluronic Acid Serum to be most comfortable to use and by that</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> so not really all that impressed.</li>
            <li> I am happy, I am ofcourse dealing with a 68 year old sun ravaged skin..</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> The texture is becoming softer and smoother than before.  </li>
            <li> It is light and refreshing like witch hazel, which I believe is one of the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy with the results thus far, I asked a girlfriend of mine to try some to see if it would work just as well for her as it did myself.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is light and moisturizing and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> Works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to put on the lotion afterwards to lock in the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; for me as if I just apply the serum, I feel like I need to reapply the serum again to keep my skin more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and it&#x27;s amazing how much my skin has improved in just a matter of days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product so far and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> far I am quite happy with the serum</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it applies to my skin</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s one of the better Hydraulic Acid Serums available on the market because I have seen the results</li>
            <li> So far great results.</li>
            <li> There is a light smell to the product which is ok, but I&#x27;d rather there not be a smell.</li>
            <li> It is a good gentle product with no scent.</li>
            <li> However, product is very esay to apply and felt good on my face</li>
            <li> but I really feel good about the ingredients,  </li>
            <li> loved applying this under makeup and my skin really glowed.</li>
            <li> The serum is absorbed nicely through my skin</li>
            <li> it goes on good and dries fast</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in my skins texture (smoother) and a decrease in the fine lines on my face and neck!</li>
            <li> The application is easy, the scent is great and the most important, makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and smooth going on, dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Nice, smooth serum, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Right after application, I can honestly feel my skin tighten up.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin, love it!</li>
            <li> anything good for the face is good for the backs of the hands, another highly visible clue to one&#x27;s real age.</li>
            <li> I used to dread it before, especially under those bright tube lights!</li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve checked the ingredients first, as there is more Aloe in here than hyaluronic acid!</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I have ever tried, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Omg this serum and the other are wonderful!</li>
            <li> You have enough good things in it!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does this leave my skin glowing, it also smells SOOO good!</li>
            <li> This serum spreads easily, soaks in quickly and with my moisturizer makes my skin noticeably softer and my skin texture very fine.  </li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It applies easily, is odorless after application and leaves no residue or shininess on the skin.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> AND LET ME  MAKE UP EASY.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I like how easy this product is to apply it does not leave a residue or film on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply with the dropper.</li>
            <li> This serum is easy to apply,it leaves your skin</li>
            <li> The good thing about it is it&#x27;s non-greasy and easily spreads on your skin; however, I still have to see my brown spots lighten, which is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and my skin just drinks it in.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb easily</li>
            <li> I also like how it absorbs very quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to get the product out of the container because of the dropper/cover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the third week of using both items, my skin was feeling great, and many of my scars had faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a viscose transparent and without a smell product, goes easy and smoothy on the face an neck.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use I would and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> This has superfluous filler ingredients in place of the basics that actually make skin more attractive.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> product is great and I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.The serum is light gel that dissolves nicely into the skin without residue, the fact the product is absorbed by the skin allows you not to worry about it coming off while  you sleep.</li>
            <li> I have several InstaNatural products and find I can always rely on them for quality and great products made with many organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but by far this is the absolute BEST!</li>
            <li> First thing , the label is so attractive and its the first thing that caught my eye.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dries like it is not there.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and my wife and I have noticed an improvement in our skin after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Probably 3 times as strong</li>
            <li> Will strongly recommend.”</li>
            <li> I loved this product, made my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I LIKED THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I Liked very much this product&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly, and seems to be helping my complexion.</li>
            <li> Feels very light, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> You only need 3 to 4 drops and it is light and cool on apication, the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Thanks, my wife is very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wwb</li>
            <li> Into my first bottle, but loving the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It has an extra ounce in the bottle and not as runny so more for your money and better quality and good results</li>
            <li> Honestly, have been finishing up another brand first before using your product.</li>
            <li> I never knew that all natural products could be so effective!</li>
            <li> but it gets dehydrated easily, so the hyaluronic acid seemed to have solved that issue by sinking in quickly and &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34; on to any moisturizers I put on top.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it spreads on the face very easily, and it feels good, too.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable, and makes your skin nice and smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li> my fine lines around my eyes look plump  pulse</li>
            <li> but it is a fine product.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and have fine lines.</li>
            <li> Some of my fine lines under my eyes almost disappear.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> It also helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It has even the texture, faded scaring, softened fine lines.</li>
            <li> Seems fine.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and fine lines improved</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s going to be just fine~</li>
            <li> The fine lines have seemed to have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Also helps in the fine wrinkle/crows feet department as well.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed fewer fine wrinkles and age spots are lightening within 2 wks.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist,diminishes fine lines ,shrinks pores....</li>
            <li> (think this is providing some immediate help with fine lines).</li>
            <li> Since hyaluronic acid is so moisturizing, it also helps with wrinkles and fine lines over time.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it might work as a healing product for blemishes or accidental fine scratches on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and some of the fine lines are practically non-visible.</li>
            <li> But in any event, this works fine</li>
            <li> It does help with fine lines and my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li> The serum helps with fine lines and skin tones too.</li>
            <li> This has made a huge&lt;br /&gt; difference in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It did seem to reduce my fine lines, but, I would have to use it a while longer to see if it would truly erase them.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Easy to use and can be worn under make up as it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is getting smoother.</li>
            <li> I think that this serum would be fine for the summer or for someone with oily skin</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it effects fine lines and discoloration.</li>
            <li> It has reduced the fine lines around the eyes and given my skin a youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to get rid of some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> After one week of use I can see a difference in my skin tone and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I can tell the fine line</li>
            <li> I put the serum on work  Fine</li>
            <li> The serum helps lessen the appearance of fine lines by plumping up your skin.</li>
            <li> I like that this product addresses fine lines, wrinkles, and skin disclorations.</li>
            <li> Came really quickly in the post too :)</li>
            <li> Vanishes quickly and my skin texture is getting better</li>
            <li> I cannot tell this quickly if this product is doing what it claims, but I love the feel of it on my face and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This serum just absorbs into my skin so quickly!  </li>
            <li> It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skill feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I was happy to read the ingredients because it contained so many natural and organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they seem to really care that their customers are satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love that this product very much!</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and I love the fact that I am preventing it from aging!</li>
            <li> 5 stars since it is a pure ingredient product, though more ingredients than just hyaluronic acid, but it does make my skin look and feel very smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and so far, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy, hydrated, and smooth.</li>

            <li> I have been suffering from fine lines and wrinkles since entering my 30&#x27;s, but this has made a huge difference in their appearance.  </li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid help the skin retain moisture and the helps smooth fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly moisturizing but has done nothing for fine lines the way that the Truth Serum does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see anything drastic for certain, but feels nice.</li>
            <li> While it does not erase deep wrinkles I feel like it is doing a great job on fine lines.</li>
            <li> well, this is a nice product but really does nothing for fine lines &amp; wrinkles that I can tell, been using it for 4 weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good product, arrived quicky and works as expected.</li>
            <li> This time it&#x27;s much thicker and very sticky on the face and hands...not happy and will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my skin seems dewier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also seen a huge difference there as well.</li>

            <li> I was told that my face wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but that it was &amp;#34;thirsty.&amp;#34; Her explanation was that moisturizer sits on top of the skin, while hyaluronic acid is absorbed by the skin.</li>

            <li> You definitely need to use good moisturizer over top.</li>

            <li> So far so good.  </li>

            <li> I think this is a good product, but could be tweaked to make it more user friendly and possible to not have the fragrance in there as well.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel better and I&#x27;ll continue using this product, the price is right, and I think it is helping.  </li>
            <li> I love the dropper type, it gives you the right amount to put in your face.</li>
            <li> BUT (yes, you knew that was coming, right? :-)</li>
            <li> With many other products that I tried I did not get what I was looking for but with this product it was great from the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love the price and the very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought his brand because it contains a  higher percentage of hyalurinic acid than many others.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping to an EU country was quick and easy with a tracking sytem to see when it was going to be delivered.</li>
            <li> Sure glad I got out of my comfort zone and tried something new.</li>
            <li> This is especially great for me since I have combination skin and can be very oily in some places yet still have dry spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> At first I bought just for myself but since it makes my skin look so much better</li>
            <li> I think on younger skin, it would definitely be successful.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m applying this once a day and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff I feel like it helped fade my acne scars not completely yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I saw it was suggested along with the skin rollers.  </li>
            <li> I think this is not only a great product, but also very reasonably priced!  </li>
            <li> My skin is combination and acne prone, and I&#x27;ve seen a significant amount of improvement in the condition of my skin after using this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what your product does for me.  </li>
            <li> But this one wins them all!</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement in my skin after 3 weeks of use, I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have heard of hyaluronic acid for its anti-wrinkle properties and was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those were my 5 original reasons for trying InstaNaturals HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize my opinion of the InstraNaturals HA serum, this is an excellent quality serum, it has all the ingredients of my usual HA.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize my opinion of the InstraNaturals HA serum, this is an excellent quality serum, it has all the ingredients of my usual HA.</li>
            <li> So excited.</li>
            <li> So far my husband and are very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> my skin fell in love the first time i used the serum.</li>
            <li> my skin feels great all day long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of its natural ingredients and have to say I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was given a significant discount to review this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this product so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and subject to autoimmune rashes on my face.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I have ordered other brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum before and this product by far has been the best.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not going to get rich marketing this way, but they are going to make a lot of people a whole lot more comfortable inside their skins.</li>
            <li> And the blend of ingredients are pure which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel clean, renewed, and youthful.</li>
            <li> but I liked a similar product with vitamin C in addition, better</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several HA and Vitamin C products and this one is by far the best bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> , i put this on after my face clean and i also use this on my neck, i use it morning nd night</li>
            <li> got it because its supposedly oil free and read in articles that its a good way for mixed and oily skin to be moisturized-</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel really silky.</li>
            <li> the customer service are very thoughtful and I would definitely try more of their products and strongly recommend this if you are looking for a natural healthy moisturizer and even more protection for your skin.</li>
            <li> What also sold me was more positive  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and can tell that my skin is responding in a positive way to the healthy moisture that is being added.</li>
            <li> This skin care line had an overwhelming amount of positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> The price was great, the bottle is made of dark, sturdy glass, and the dropper is easy to use, so the packaging is all around fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is very light and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a built-in dropper to easily get the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> A good way to test this is to apply a generous amount to the top of one hand and leave the other one without.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it some more time, but so far I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> I got this product and was iffy about it due to reviews most witch were good</li>
            <li> LIKE EVERYONE IS SAYING.STILL LOOKING FOR THAT SPECIAL CREAM</li>
            <li> While I can certainly tell that my skin is more hydrated, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done anything for wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> I have read many articles on the benefits of a serum with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin C in a pure form.  </li>
            <li> Guess I have been doing it right!</li>
            <li> The price is right also!</li>
            <li> - This is important because using the right serum will only help your moisturizer to be more effective.</li>
            <li> The serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and rubs in and is absorbed into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> This one is very easy to use - and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It looks great, some redness but not much.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin is amazing clear again.  </li>
            <li> My face is much softer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting more moisturizer on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft and feeling so nice.  </li>
            <li> My skin is flawless, is glowing lately.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so I love moisturizing and not dealing with greasy face during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days now and in loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ...&amp;#34; A smooth smile crawls across the face,and I know the product is supposed to be for the face</li>
            <li> I am 69 years young &amp;amp; this serum plumps-up my skin so nicely...</li>
            <li> All I can say so far, it feels good and absorbs fast and lightly moisturized my skin</li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy the whole product line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust many creams, since they normally don&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure I would see more good things as I continue using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Is ok haven&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li> I just cannot say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum as it has really helped make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has had much of an effect otherwise and Vitamin C serums have acted much better at soothing my combination skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reviews are fabulous and I was hopeful, but it did not diminish the appearance of smile lines and forehead lines.  </li>
            <li> It has a Light Fresh scent and is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin nicely and leaves me skin feeling soft - not greasy or oily at all.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this for 2 weeks now, and so far i really liked it</li>
            <li> I would MUCH rather use thicker, more potent serum bc by the time you need to use it, your skin can use as much help as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing and somewhat refreshing after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> They were even kind enough to send me a complimentary bottle of their Eye Gel when I told them I was planning on purchasing more of their products.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice so far.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural really is generous with their products and if you&#x27;ve read many of my reviews then you know I am truly a fan of everything I&#x27;ve tried from this company.</li>
            <li> I just want to put as much good stuff on my face as possible.</li>
            <li> After using this serum for a couple of weeks,my skin feels softer and I feel good about using it because of the vitamin C and E but especially the hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> My son, is actually starting to feel good about himself and his body again.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much improvement I can see with more time.</li>
            <li> It makes my face cool and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> The serum is light, and easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> It has really helped my skin to become balanced, glowing and look more youthful.</li>
            <li> I no longer need a moisturizer (which is cool,</li>
            <li> I would still be buying this if I hadn&#x27;t learned I could by the powdered hyaluronic acid in powder for from Bulk Supplement and make much more , much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I can put moisturizer on and have it wiped off in minutes, so it&#x27;s not likely to do me much good.  </li>
            <li> Please note that I paid full price for it</li>
            <li> Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher.</li>
            <li> A true serum.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff, this is some real deal stuff</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment and am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I also tried the vitamin c serum, and I love it just as much as this one....</li>
            <li> Verdict is still out in regards to the true benefits.</li>
            <li> ..tku so much:)</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin, absorbs well  and when used with vitamin c serum it is diminishing my brown spots especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> and there is no bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> No bad stuff in it</li>
            <li> It seems to flawlessly smooth out the texture of my skin in a very positive way.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all those people that doesn&#x27;t like to have all those chemicals on their skin...and If you use them I highly recommend to change, natural is ALWAYS better! :)</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this works beautifully under your moisturizer, but if you have oily skin you could definitely get away with using this on its own.  </li>
            <li> There are so many other products out there on the market that make big promises but nothing that I have ever tried feels as wonderful as this serum.  </li>
            <li> When your skin is hydrated it such a vibrant and healthy look that just make you feel good.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to company that has literally, somehow, found the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; in a perfect combo of natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate the skin (I&#x27;m using this, the Vit C toner, and night cream), don&#x27;t feel heavy, great price, no gross chemicals</li>
            <li> It may look like a cumbersome regime, but it is pretty easy and quick to do.</li>
            <li> I also purchased a bottle for my mother who was happy that it didn&#x27;t make her break out (she doesn&#x27;t use serums or moisturizers on her face due to acne break outs).</li>
            <li> I have used several anti-aging serums and have found that products with higher concentrations of hyaluronic acid are the most effective for my skin.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it, it has a cooling sensation, very light sent of rose which added a nice calming effect, it doesn&#x27;t have any stickyness and as soon as it dried I was able to apply my makeup without and clumpiness, big plus!!</li>
            <li> I am a really satisfied customer and will be a loyal one to InstaNatural as long as they will continue to provide us with a great natural skin care products.</li>
            <li> Since I live in a very hot country (Dominican Republic), I need to put on my face non greasy, smooth, fresh and very light creams.  </li>
            <li> Has def become a large part of my skin care routine!!</li>
            <li> eleven o&#x27;clock is not noticeable at all, forehead is smooth, and happy smile lines around mouth are less.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my dry skin smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> It Made My Skin Feel Rejuvenated, Fresh And Clean.</li>
            <li> Love this product - goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>

            <li> the product is super diluted with water.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and can be quickly followed with a moisturizer like Instanatrual&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil, which I like to use in conjunction with this product.</li>
            <li> Reading about the most important things that our face skin needs is Vit C , pepsid, and a natural oil ( I use cocnut ), and Vit E doesnt hurt.  </li>
            <li> this product has made my skin feel super sooth and has redefined my skin texture.</li>
            <li> I even gave this and the stretch mark cream tp my pregnant friend,</li>
            <li> and this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> It dissolves the vitamin c quickly</li>
            <li> I soaks in almost instantly and leaves a nice smooth feel with no greasiness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> I think they mixed with water to sell more and make more money.</li>

            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Has help my skin tremendously.</li>

            <li> This arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years, like many women, at various prices.  </li>
            <li> , the price is decent, but it was not my favorite of them all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positives: I love the cute blue bottle this comes in.  </li>
            <li> Mild nonirritating.</li>
            <li> After applying it to my face,  i would quickly rub my fingertips over the backs of my hand.  </li>

            <li> I love how it feels when I put it on, it&#x27;s so refreshing , and not greasy, which is another big plus.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was AMAZED to see a difference after only two days since I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting a huge difference for a while.</li>
            <li> using for several weeks day and night and my skin looks more softer, smoother and more</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does its job</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> I went with the 5 day treatment to see how effective the combined ingredients compared to major brands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic packaging and very high quality product!</li>
            <li> Love the natural and organic formula!!</li>
            <li> Pure, clean, preservative free and truly has improved the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> With a capacity to sustain up to a 1,000 times its weight in water, Hyluronic Acid is a great natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.&amp;#34; I really like to apply it on my face before I go to work, I don&#x27;t have to apply much, and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first of this type of product I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s already become an important part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> They need to re-think about the bottle but overall very pleased with tthe product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m well aware that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work any miracles, but it does make my skin feel smooth and brighter.  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazing so far!</li>
            <li> I recently began using Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> , that was because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent</li>
            <li> It is the very first thing I put on my face, day and night.</li>
            <li> from the very first day I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> Also, I decided to get three bottles on my very first purchase coz</li>
            <li> I will write another review later after using it for a longer period of time, but as of now I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> To be fair,  my wrinkles have been there long time....</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a clear gel like serum that goes on the face easily and absorbs very quickly so you can than put on your makeup or your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> First things first what I love about this is the Ingredients, I absolutely love products that are all natural.</li>
            <li> I developed the routine of using the Hyaluronic Acid for day time use &amp; my Vitamin C serum for night time &amp; Rose-hip oil on top of each, and I must say some how the combo is working as I&#x27;ve been told multiple time by various friends how great I&#x27;m looking!!  </li>
            <li> 5% HA, considering ordering a 20% HA product instead... I live in the desert, very dry even though I take very good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> The new products are way better.</li>
            <li> The skin on my right hand looked much softer and more hydrated than my right hand.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked this good, it has always been dry.</li>
            <li> The serum is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin on face.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can rub it on my eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t sting or otherwise affect my eyes, which are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Recieved these for free in return for  a positive feedback</li>
            <li> so much I bought some for my daughter!!  </li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> One of the best parts is that 5 drops covers my face and I know it is going to last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is the most natural hyaluronic acid serum that absorbs quickly and does not peel.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly of witch hazel, and goes on with only a slightly more viscous feel than witch hazel; it&#x27;s watery in its application.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is light, not sticky at all and quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling soft, smooth and well</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth and I can even see my large pores have reduced its size.</li>
            <li> This serum is very light, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and make sure I apply it well where I have those fine lines, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles have improved so much that a before and after picture make me smile.</li>
            <li> highly recommend a good quality Hyaluronic acid in general.</li>
            <li> Since starting using the Hyaluronic acid serum for almost two weeks, I have found that the serum is very good, in the sense that it plump up skin, especially under eye area.  </li>
            <li> It is also of a gel consistency more than a liquid making it hard to get a good squeeze out of the dropper.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth when I wake in the mornings and there has been a huge improvement in skin tone.</li>
            <li> I tried a few moisturizers and this is one of the great product that I will recommend.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only gripe though, it&#x27;s amazing for adding moisture and plumping the skin.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, Instanatural cares about its customers in a gentle way, always available for questions, informations and tips about its product.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of use, I am continuously happy with this serum.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my stretchmarks with the stretch mark cream and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Seems to calm my skin too.</li>
            <li> and I use this everyday with great benefit.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C and green tea are great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and am starting to notice some amazing results.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use all that much though, and this bottle is HUGE, so</li>
            <li> Also my skin feels smooth and ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I came across this while looking through the listings for the WattsBeauty version, and the size and price was attractive, as well as the inclusion of green tea, vitamin C, and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> This serum also has wonderful natural ingredients including Vitamin C, Vitamin E,  and Green Tea.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is by far one of my favorite skin care companies.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, absorbs well and definitely makes your skin look and feel nicer.  </li>
            <li> This one is definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I wish to get a refund and 175$ for doctor visit and also 30$ worth of medication.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and the way it absorbs into the skin without a residue.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the delivery of this product, it even came a few days early.</li>
            <li> I also use the rose hip oil daily.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Pores are clear and non-existent, skin is definitely more supple as well.</li>
            <li> Nice enough product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to value more products that are natural without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I have only used it a handful of times.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a change in any &#x27;laugh lines&#x27;</li>
            <li> So far I am a satisfied customer of this product.</li>
            <li> As a girl who honestly just loves the sun, I am constantly trying to hide my freckles and sun spots under layers of makeup.</li>

            <li> The serum gets absorbed immediately and it does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The laugh line wrinkles and firming up the jaw-line are taking a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this serum, it makes my skin soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I use this serum along with their Phytoceramide capsules and my mature skin is looking and feeling so much better.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is able to sustain up to 1,000 times its weight in water making it a natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great, all natural product to soften your face, this is definitely what you need to purchase.</li>
            <li> but with this it keeps everything in place and feels fresh.</li>

            <li> This serum has taken a few wrinkles out and has put a nice smoothness and softness to my skin that I have not had for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice BIG (2 fl oz!!)</li>
            <li> I love all of their products that I&#x27;ve tried so far so when given the chance to try another one I took advantage of the opportunity.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff - makes my skin feel smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is my favorite product I have tried thus far.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> So far, this is producing even better results than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I bought it to maybe tighten the areas of my face that have allowed my laugh, smile lines to appear deeper.</li>
            <li> Will definately continue to use as I am so pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients and</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product.  </li>
            <li> effective moisturizer with hyaluronic acid should do the same thing</li>
            <li> It has a distinctly herby smell which I don&#x27;t care for but the results are undeniable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs young and my skin looks better today than it did in my 40&#x27;ds.  </li>
            <li> I am saying okay at this point for this product because I haven&#x27;t used it as frequently as directed.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> As to effectiveness, I still cannot say since i only started using it three days ago, But overall I like it because it smells good, the price is very reasonable for it&#x27;s size &amp; I feel that since it contains all the ingredients like vitamin C ( I hope they indicate on the box how many percentage) , 5% hyaluronic acid , Vitamin E, Jojoba etc.</li>
            <li> I have used other products such as this, but this Hyaluronic acid, it is the best!!</li>
            <li> I went back to my original hyaluronic serum which is much more moisturizing</li>
            <li> This drys quickly after applying it and at first you may think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my Super C serum and it feels super moisturizing and penetrates fast.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, leaving it refreshed.</li>
            <li> Everybody tells me that I look great &amp;#34; I&#x27;m not wearing maykup anymore &amp;#34; I see that I look great even if I&#x27;m sick , this is really a miracle product that works right away!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this face serum for moisturizing, age damage repair and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a significant change on my skin apart that it&#x27;s moisturizing......</li>
            <li> must also say that the customer service is extremely fast and friendly.  </li>
            <li> and I had some questions and the replies were fast and always friendly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen that much of a difference, but I use this with a lot of different products and my skin already looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> I use it right after I use my derma roller</li>
            <li> Lines and wrinkles are being reduced right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed changes in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my pore size right away.</li>
            <li> Applicator dropper gives you just the right amount of product to use, no wasting .</li>
            <li> Also, the price is always right</li>
            <li> It does plump my skin/wrinkles right away.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on right after I have cleaned my face</li>
            <li> I use this serum right after washing my face.</li>
            <li> However, there is always hope, right?</li>
            <li> his guests don&#x27;t always get it right -- not for every person anyway.</li>
            <li> I could start using it right away.  </li>
            <li> It tightens and smoothes in all the right places.</li>
            <li> After it soaks in (which is really right away)</li>
            <li> Received this product in the mail right away.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to have to pass on finishing this bottle for right now.</li>
            <li> and my skin soaks it right up.  </li>
            <li> It seems to start working right away.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing positive change!  </li>
            <li> There IS a positive difference in the way my skin looks!  </li>
            <li> I mean it goes on smoothly, soaks into my skin quickly and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed by the skin very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> It is a high quality product, please feel free to contact me and ask.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are diminished, less prominent, resulting in a smooth and even texture, which is exactly what I require in a HA</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving my face and neck feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have also tried several other products by this company and all are very good and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product by Insta Natural, and am sure to purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works great yet still gentle enough on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very light, gets absorbed fast, leaves pleasant silky and clean feeling behind, and I really like its scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who are looking to get rid of some fine lines or even some wrinkles to be not so noticeable, the gel like consistency of it is great as well, not too watered down looking, and it gives you just the right amount of ingredients you are looking for, a little bit goes a long ways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will need a few weeks to see how effective it is at decreasing discolorations and balancing out my skin tone and decreasing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It not only softens fine lines but also leave my skin smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, I love the packaging, the blue bottle is really pretty!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a little over a week, but I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> new face primer for the new century, amazing and just when i thought i was done for here comes a product that literally saved me from sudden disaster, i lost my normal primer, honestly i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere</li>
            <li> First of all, I get annoyed when I go through reviews and then realize that something has been given for free or at a discount and not be able to know that as I read the review, so let me say upfront that I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, found other brand that had a better appearance on my skin</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and have noticed a huge difference in the way skin feels-</li>
            <li> I noticed a diffrence right away after my first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and absorb fast and it makes my skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild, gentle serum.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week , so far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Glad to have a gentle, natural, cruelty free product!  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much i&#x27;ve already bought a second bottle!</li>
            <li> This feels really nice when applied to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> was catching up and the wrinkles really bothered me, as did the larger pores, lack of elasticity, etc.  </li>
            <li> It contains hyaluronic acid along with a perfect blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C + Jojoba Oil + Green Tea.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, and  have not had a problem with this serum.</li>
            <li> I like the HA serum, it absorb super fast on my skin and does not feel gooey or sticky.</li>

            <li> It spreads really well and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its has lightened up considerably and the texture is much smoother and more refined.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid along with a perfect blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C + JoJoba Oil + Green Tree.</li>

            <li> New BFF!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks, smooth, moist, soft!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great value for Hyaluronic Acid and having it in a separate bottle allows me to use as little or as much as I feel necessary, which I like better than using products that already have Hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> Then use this acid which is a kind of thick clear gel and feels very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that it is not sticky nor heavy to the skin and feels just right for the moist bouncy skin.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the lines becoming softer looking and less defined.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in my skin and typically with anything containing vitamin c, my face glows beautifully.</li>
            <li> will look really oily after applying but it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t look any younger but face feels fine!</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it appears to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost 2 weeks and must say that I do like it very much.</li>
            <li> Liking this product very much.</li>
            <li> Delivery of items was very fast, hence the 2 stars, I will review stars once I receive feedback from the seller, thank you.</li>
            <li> It also is very gentle and I have not had any problems with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I no longer had big pores but smooth soft skin that actually looked great.  </li>
            <li> but I like it very much</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> However, so many companies grossly overprice their products, making it a much smarter and more cost efficient solution to just buy directly from the wholesale manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried the serum it didn&#x27;t seem to change very much</li>
            <li> I think it is too early to say whether I would get the desired results that other users have experienced from using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think its too early to tell if my fine line and wrinkles have diminished.</li>
            <li> also noticed the fine lines near my eyes are fading as well</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it soaks into my skin!  </li>
            <li> It smells good, a little thinner than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of use, my skin tone was noticeably more even, the dry spot were almost completely faded and my skin just felt overall more healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a bottle Carrageenan, it&#x27;s highly comedogenic, I will be suprised  if you do not get a full face of acne.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Great organic products are hard to find</li>
            <li> As always, I love my product from Insta Natural and would highly recommend purchasing from them.</li>
            <li> After using them only twice, once at night and again the next morning, I applied my makeup and it looked AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars because since the first moment I started using this Hialuronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t already know you should always apply serums first before anything else.  </li>
            <li> I personally have had slightly better results with another hyaluronic/vitamin c product but would use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this .. mixed with the vitamin c..</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase, and will reorder when necessary.  </li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I usually have to get periodic facials to get this kind of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I wash my face and apply this serum on, follow with insta-natural moisturizer, and ready for the day!</li>
            <li> I will update later in use &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> a couple of times I&#x27;m able to get enough to apply.  </li>
            <li> My husband said he could see a difference in my skin tone almost immediately and for a husband to notice this after all the years we&#x27;ve been married</li>
            <li> but the fact that she says she is enjoying this product is enough for me to consider buying her another if she expresses that she is almost out or that she&#x27;ll have to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> So much product for the price!</li>
            <li> I still follw my normal skin routine daily, but this serum is a nice addition to my skin care</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> love Instanatural and especially this product.</li>
            <li> This serum really works!  </li>
            <li> You can feel the softness of your skin the first use.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> And though I am healthy and look younger than my age</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in my face and neck from the first week since using this product.</li>
            <li> Now my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Their Customer Service is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I received a personal email before my products arrived with instructions for use and thanking me for my purchase, and another email, after arrival asking if I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and the price was  way higher.</li>
            <li> next :)</li>
            <li> By comparing the two I like that this consistency from Insta Natural is a light serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very koindly!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change!</li>
            <li> My complexion is getting better after only a week of use.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> The product size is better for long-term use than the smaller 1 oz bottles I have been purchasing.  </li>
            <li> During hot weather I do not like layering creams on my face.  </li>
            <li> Really notice a change in the appearance of my skin after 2 days, now 1 week after it help!</li>
            <li> use daily 2 times a day love it</li>
            <li> I have many and while I am a fan of alot of different ones, this one is one of my go to&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much more of a lotion type person and this is definitely a serum.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum on spring last year and fell in love .</li>
            <li> I really love this product ~ a must use for younger, tighter skin!</li>
            <li> First.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this skin care line</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier after the first week.</li>
            <li> I want to say that I did NOT do this at first.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> So far is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Goes on silky not oily, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> No irritation and really works to moisturize and soften lines!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product and have ordered a second bottle.  </li>
            <li> He may have thought I was wearing foundation or concealer, but I most definitely was not!</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels more hydrated and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The first 2 or 3 times I put  InstaNatural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep using for more results.</li>
            <li> importantly C&amp;E. I usually mix my own serums</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this- seems to be brightening, only had it for a couple of days, but it seems quality.  </li>
            <li> I apply it first, then a moisturizer, and my makeup.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first bottle I got was like a gel.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum is my first experience in using a serum.</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone!!  </li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and smooth.”</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was pleased within days of starting to use it!</li>
            <li> I am unsure if I should try it on my skin (I am a first time buyer of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start using it on the backs of my hands, where women truly show their age, first and foremost.</li>
            <li> In sum, I will repurchase in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it my face was on fire.</li>
            <li> I say basically the same ingredients because of course until you pay for it and receive it--you aren&#x27;t able to see ALL of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my facial skin is brighter with a more even tone.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than enough time for all of it to soak in, leaving my skin plump, hydrated and no leftover residue.  </li>
            <li> product is one of the first I&#x27;ve seen that has both moisturizing ingredients and antioxidant ingredients.</li>
            <li> First I cleanse and use a toner, then this, then add additional moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My skin is more supple and the wrinkles are minimized with daily use.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so much I got some for my daughters,  sisters and mother!  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle in 3 months, I love it.</li>
            <li> no...I&#x27;m 54 and for the first time</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li> Wish it were more liquid in the bottle, ifyouwant me to send it back so that you could see for yourself, let me know.thx.</li>
            <li> I love serums for my face, and this one is definitely a winner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then I like to finish with a light natural moisturizer after using this.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using daily as directed and it has not reduced wrinkles, not made my skin any better, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t just put on my face the first thing I find..</li>
            <li> Especially on my forehead more noticeable than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t exactly use this product.</li>
            <li> I out this on first.</li>
            <li> Nice light product, not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything yet through...</li>
            <li> It dries instantly and my face felt really smooth!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I am using a Hyaluronic Serum</li>
            <li> am a satisfied customer and will definitely order this serum again</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you what I do not like about this serum.  </li>
            <li> The first week I just thought &amp;#34;wasted</li>
            <li> Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> First of all this serum smell so good just like green tea</li>
            <li> I love this, enough said!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning under my moisturizer since I first got it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using it on my neck at first, but since I noticed improvement in my face I have started using it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> The same excellent ingredients that are in my usual HA serum&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> AJ is lovely in following up on customer satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Such a proactive approach is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that is doing the job.</li>
            <li> I was using another well known product that I was actually quite pleased with until I tried Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty incredable.</li>
            <li> First time using a serum</li>
            <li> At First</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Would like to see the price stay low for people to really be able to buy and use as they need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the serum for several years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it several of my friends, the ones that tried all love it.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum hasn&#x27;t created any havoc on my delicate skin which I am so happy about.</li>
            <li> And you know it works when the first thing you notice is your plump pout.</li>
            <li> First I apply a vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize like intended, but the cellular rejuvenation is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar to this</li>
            <li> After first application it was a go for me, it has been 2 weeks since I started</li>
            <li> Its only been a week and my skin already is more hydrated and glowing.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this type of product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and it is definitely improving the wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy/use at first.</li>
            <li> Well I have used it consistently since it was received</li>
            <li> cure.must use consistently to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Maybe if the bulb on the dropper was a bit larger, it&#x27;d have more suction?</li>
            <li> Overall, a wonderful product, which I will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> but my skin already looks much more radiant and the pores smaller.</li>
            <li> Probably the only thing that would make it better is if it came in a pump.</li>
            <li> Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li> my face looks much more even toned, and my pores are noticeably smaller.  </li>
            <li> Now, my skin is looking firmer, smoother, wrinkles and circles have smoothed out quite a bit in this short time, and my skin has more elasticity.</li>
            <li> I also see some evening of skin tone, which I hadn&#x27;t expected but was certainly a nice benefit.  </li>
            <li> It is also thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> I also bought the anti-aging facial moisturizer, which I also love.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were a few good reasons why I chose InstaNaturals to try their HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything in this serum is found in nature and has reputations for being great remedies for a variety of skin issues - hyaluronic acid is a strong natural moisturizer, witch hazel shrinks pores, vitamin C renews skin / fades scars and aloe, green tea, jojoba oil and vitamin E are great for skin health on a few different levels.</li>
            <li> Every item i have purchased from this company has been super high quality...</li>
            <li> , if it does not feel great when placed into my hands and moved around a little then I am not usually going to this again</li>
            <li> Right away, it started to brighten my complexion and restore a radiance that, well, I pretty much never had to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company delivered in less time than expected and it arrived in perfect condition, both times I&#x27;ve purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference with fine lines, but I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used the product long enough to be able to see much in the way of results there.</li>
            <li> Both came more quickly than expected</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick serum that goes on quite well without a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> This natural hyaluronic serum goes on smoothly without any sticky residue, plumping the skin and leaving nice surface for your other skincare and makeup products.  </li>
            <li> This has helped reduce my uneven hyperpigmentation, my skin looks so much more even, my face is a bit more plump just enough to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away on my fine lines diminishing, further proof from my daughter, who I didn&#x27;t tell I was trying a new product, she asked if I had gotten Botox!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different kinds and so far, this serum is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I should say i liked the OZ pure Hyaluronic a bit better, but that is not to say this product is not good.</li>
            <li> Used alone, the serum dries to a very light finish and is ready for the next layer.  </li>
            <li> the dropper is easy to apply right to facial skin....</li>
            <li> I have large pores and most of them were visibly smaller (</li>
            <li> Other products continue to &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use organic rose water toner before using any other products.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Dark circles so have been using this mostly for those....success!</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice, soil use on the day before the sunscreen and at night apply the serum retinol, I think we should have more concentration of hyaluronic acid because I see very slow results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several weeks of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> After several days of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far, results are immediate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, it did feel just like the other hyaluronic acid serums I have used - super refreshing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new beauty products and this has been my absolute favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy the same product over and over - always trying something new, but I do believe I&#x27;ve found my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that this was product was gentle enough for under the eye</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it, will post results later.</li>
            <li> but I like this better, because it&#x27;s bigger bottle and reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> This works very well, looked for the same brand for reorder :-)</li>
            <li> It feels as good as the more expensive prescription brands.</li>
            <li> This sinks right in and you can put other products or cosmetics on top without any kind of interference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried other hyaluronic acid products because I read so many great things about them.  </li>
            <li> I got this product to review and test for free the research that i&#x27;ve done on Hyaluronic acid serum really peak my interest because it can be used for so many place on the skin, stretch marks, eczema, blemishes,new &amp; old scars, You can used it on minor cuts.</li>
            <li> I really have a very very sensible skin and this serum is helping a lot</li>
            <li> Their product goes on much smoother and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use, not a long drawn out regimine.</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft!</li>
            <li> i cant really see much defferent right now</li>
            <li> so this will last a long time,it has a pleasant non-intrusive smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive result from this and my continuing research indicates that there&#x27;s no reason to expect any.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a positive difference</li>
            <li> I kept using it wanting to have positive results because of all the review hype.</li>
            <li> For the life of me, I can&#x27;t fathom how this stuff could have worked for all those who wrote positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for more than 3 weeks and and I would like to know how long It takes to see any tangible change on my skin?</li>
            <li> Experimenting with this shows me exactly how much to put on.  </li>
            <li> It will take a long time for me to know for sure</li>
            <li> and it is moisturizing as long as you put something else on top of it to seal the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> and I pretty much feel like it is not on my face after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Instanatural&#x27;s Hydraulic Acids Serum]] is one of the better hydraulic acid serums I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> Everything everyone is saying about this product has shown to be true so far.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good, if not better.  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural&#x27;s is far superior to Cosmedica&#x27;s, at about the same price (if not cheaper).  </li>
            <li> I have used other insta natural products and loved them.  </li>
            <li> It is far more economical than &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; products that have the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Instanatural is doing a lot of things right and deserves its high ratings on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and it seemed liked the bottle was watered down.</li>
            <li> As long as my skin doesn&#x27;t dry and itchy, I am okay. :)</li>
            <li> This Company contacted me personally and asked me how I liked their product, that if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, they would give me a total refund without even sending the bottle back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t deliver the same results, this product is thicker, takes more time to sunk in, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel the same, it is good, but not as I expected.</li>
            <li> Actually I wasn&#x27;t nearly impressed with this one as i was with other products similar to this one.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely and has a slight tightening effect.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product  works wonders post chemical peel and makes it super soft.</li>
            <li> , slight rose scent.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to give it time to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The serum comes in an attractive dark blue glass bottle and a dropper lid.</li>
            <li> The serum is a clear cloudy gel like formula that absorbs quickly into the face and neck.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother and no irritation, which is rare because my skin is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> it leaves it really soft after applying it, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised on how quickly I noticed a tighter shrinking of the pore holes and a luminous look to my skin...</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and is not dry</li>
            <li> The upside (unlike most products similar) is the amount is twice the normal.</li>
            <li> , it dries quickly, it works well with my moisturizer, and makeup , most of all it really does make wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in skin tone and firmness, not dramatic</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, seems a bit thick at first but glides on easily, and dries completely.</li>
            <li> I like the serum, but need to use it for a certain time to see the result.</li>
            <li> Stick with a pure grade Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> so that was pure Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Large sized bottle for the money.  </li>
            <li> We All Have Large Amounts Of Spaces Between Our Skin Cells, Where It Provides Moisture, Firmness And Suppleness To Our Skin.</li>
            <li> If I slept on  wrinkle, I had a large mark on my skin that stayed almost all day.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t really tell if it affected my skin, but the end result (when I combined it with a moisturizer) was positive, so it wouldn’t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> Love how this soaks in fast and helps relieve dry skin (and lips).  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels soothed and soft, the serum absorbs really fast and although you feel tightening your skin is super moisturized.</li>
            <li> If the positive reviews are genuine then I must conclude I belong to a different species whose skin does not respond to this concoction.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is medically a good and positive substance, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative side affects.</li>
            <li> Will update after using second bottle if I see any difference in the appearance of my fine</li>
            <li> The fine lines are not so noticeable, I also use it on my neck and upper chest area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and started noticing fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles are finally disappearing!</li>
            <li> After several uses my fine lines appear to have blurred out.</li>
            <li> I used the Inst Hyaluronic Acid Serum to try to get rid of some of the fine lines that have started to pop up the last couple years.</li>
            <li> It has diminished some fine lines that were starting to bug me!  </li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum works for both the larger and fine wrinkle lines.</li>
            <li> She has lots of wrinkles and this product will defiantly reduce the fine lines and deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps clear skin fast!!</li>
            <li> It is too early to say if it is reducing fine lines or wrinkles, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regarding the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement, however, it&#x27;s only been two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been conscious of good skin care from seeing seeing my father put on Oilay when I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a huge 2 fl oz/60 ml bottle that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge change in my overall skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to see how much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid serum is working very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like the insta-natural products.</li>

            <li> I appreciate the reasonable price</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Since I also take H A in a capsule or as a free powder, and use a derma needle thing occasionally, I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s what.</li>
            <li> So, I thank you so much for taking the time and your effort.</li>
            <li> It really plumped out my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s making my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and nourishing.</li>
            <li> And this Serum really reduced wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ALL their products!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a change yet.</li>
            <li> so I really can;t see a difference yet</li>
            <li> , also I don;t really know how much</li>
            <li> I really can see results by using this for 2 weeks and have already ordered another</li>
            <li> It softens my skin and leaves it hydrated the whole day.</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and my moisturizer sinks in better since using it.</li>
            <li> so I know what real wrinkles look like.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it dries fast, and it doesn&#x27;t irritare my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> Its not watery,  its much thicker.  </li>
            <li> AJ - thanks for contacting me</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> I use it under my daily moisturizer with SPF, and my face seems to glow and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone!  </li>
            <li> Now I know that my 55 year old laugh lines are not going to disappear</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Thanks AJ</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing will need this for winter.</li>
            <li> and I notice my skin looks so much brighter, healthier looking, plump, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> SO I CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY.</li>
            <li> My face already looking very well.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is also very generously sized.</li>
            <li> Solution is sticky and causes my face to shine too much under makeup.</li>
            <li> This serum has really helped with these changes.  </li>
            <li> Got this product for the areas I didn&#x27;t want injected and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> My wife has really seen a difference in her face.  </li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t seen much reduction in wrinkles, but likes how this makes her skin feel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind which is great.  </li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum has really helped with the bags and discolor under my eyes.</li>
            <li> is just very slipery feel.</li>
            <li> Really cannot see any difference.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really see any improvement of the skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that much in one application</li>
            <li> The formula is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much softer the skin is after using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My skin feels absolutely baby-soft.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in my face and eyes.</li>
            <li> Have to say this serum is really working.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s helping much with my hyper pigmentation though.</li>
            <li> Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start.</li>
            <li> After two months my skin is smoother, tighter, and much brighter and glowing.  </li>
            <li> Really like this, I have ordered 2 times and plan on ordering again when I am out</li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Granted, at my age of 68, I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I do have under eye bags and some darkening under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> my skin is much improved.</li>
            <li> but I can say that much of the dryness has gone.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to with this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for hydrating your skin!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am using the serum and find it goes on well and soaks in fast.  </li>
            <li> This comes in a very generous sizes bottle and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped my self image.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It s too soon to tell if this product is really working, however its not worsening my skin</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , I really wanted to rid face of these problem areas.</li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin tone and skin texture.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin look and feel better/younger.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t find any improvement.  </li>
            <li> My skin began to break out and this has really cleared it up...</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> However, my skin FEELS younger, firmer, fresher and that is important to me.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way my face feels and looks</li>
            <li> The website said the way to rectify the situation was to make sure your face was wet when the product was applied so that the acid could lock the moisture in.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fortunate, inside is an intact, blue glass bottle a stopper.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum...</li>
            <li> I really do see a difference.</li>
            <li> I whole heartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It has a thicker consistency, which makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It dries fast not sticky at all</li>
            <li> but this seems to be much improved.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and I believe that i I actually had any noticeble wrinkles they would be gone.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really need it, and so I used it once to see how well it can be used and would there be any types of problems.</li>
            <li> When I ran to the mirror, I noticed the laugh lines nearly gone when I&#x27;m not laughing or smiling and the darkness under my eyes improved dramatically.</li>
            <li> AND I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE  VERY</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I find that my face feels much smoother and has an improved glow.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I really like how it works.</li>
            <li> I really like the serum</li>
            <li> It really helps plump up the skin around my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet)</li>
            <li> i would really recommend and i have also told some about it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it.</li>
            <li> It is clear, odorless and is easily absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I really feel like it&#x27;s improving the look and feel of the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced , also.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product started working from day one.</li>
            <li> My face is so much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have age spots, but adore this for making my skin plump and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Then I went through my bottle so fast.</li>
            <li> this was a real surprise to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin feels very solt.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Now, to be real.....</li>
            <li> It really helps my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Although it contains Hyaluronic Acid I did not find it to be very moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> But the price is so reasonable, you&#x27;ll want to keep expanding the areas where you use it</li>
            <li> The company was very gracious about the situation.</li>
            <li> And Was Really Curious To Find Out More About This Beauty Product.</li>
            <li> I really like all the aditional ingredients that are added to help your skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t leave the house much.</li>
            <li> It really helps my skin to retain moisture</li>
            <li> Its worth a shot for the moisturizing benefits alone, anti-aging would just be an added bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very drying no change in skin</li>
            <li> She highly recommends it!</li>
            <li> Get the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum instead, it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand since I went through the 1 oz so fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have very oily skin, and still prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I really have no discernible wrinkles</li>
            <li> Bought this product to use in conjunction with a vitamin c serum to really add a glow and air-brushed texture to mt skin...</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks much smoother and feels firmer.  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating at all</li>
            <li> I find that Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product...</li>
            <li> I am very lined around</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in the wrinkle area....</li>
            <li> I really like that it is paraben-free and alcohol-free, so</li>
            <li> However, it was packed very well</li>
            <li> Feels really moisturizing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell any difference after having used this for a month, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin in any way.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve seen any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> What a relief it is to find something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> plus it really helps with my under eye puffiness in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> thanks for letting me review In exchange for product</li>
            <li> I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li> - they recommend to gently pat the product on your skin and let it absorb.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really do feel like the serum has been helping beat winter skin.</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be very helpful on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 33 and need to really fix the damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do much, but I have noticed quite an improvement in the blotchy spots on my face....</li>
            <li> I guess the damage is just too much for any cream or serum to help with the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Guess my skin is just too damaged and wrinkled for anything to help much.</li>
            <li> I suppose, I&#x27;m expecting too much and too soon.</li>
            <li> I think these types of products take weeks at 2 times a day usage to show any real progress.</li>
            <li> A nurse that looked 10 years younger for her age because of her smooth skin recommends the product and purchases it from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Very noticeable results since I&#x27;ve started using hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this serum and all of their products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a reasonable price which is another incentive.  </li>
            <li> but this product really delivers.</li>
            <li> and you get twice as much product (2 oz) in comparison to Skinceuticals (1 oz).</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend buying this to add that moisture</li>
            <li> Thank you so much am so going to keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> Has a very convenient dropper so you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love that there is only a light scent to geranium essential oil, no heavy perfume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I love the formula so far.</li>
            <li> I have never until now used a product that did not make some kind of noticeable difference when you put it on your skin whether good or bad, this one does neither</li>
            <li> This is a nice blend of several different serums.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman and starting to notice more lines, puffiness, and a bit of a gobble neck.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural is my FAVORITE skin care company Thank you for keeping this 54year young skin YOUNGER</li>
            <li> Finally, at this age I realize what it is like to have clear skin and feel confident about my looks...</li>
            <li> I have tried several serums and so far this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It contains many beneficial ingredients, and a 5% hyaluronic acid, which is pretty high compared to other products in the market.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a cool gel and sinks in IMMEDIATELY, so you have to work quickly to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> Strange but TRUE!  </li>
            <li> you are interested in a vegan, cruelty-free product, there are limited choices available.</li>
            <li> the texture is just right as far as the thickness  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and just takes a couple drops each application so this bottle has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> It is now very soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> The serum is thick, easy to apply and you can see results very quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  </li>
            <li> I like how this serum is slightly thicker and it goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin with more wrinkles than I can count, but the serum has increased the moisture and it feels softer.  </li>
            <li> This product is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t tighten up my skin like the other hyaluronic acid does.</li>
            <li> but it seems that my skin has gone back to its original texture before I started using this after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> when I did  not used any other lotion on top of it.  </li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li> Plus, you get so much more of it than what other sellers offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic Acid products that have worked better.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;ve used this going on 3 months and just noticed the other day that my chest looks sooo much better.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get the sticky feeling that many other serums gives you.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected!</li>
            <li> I am also using other  products from this company and love them all.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I love the other benefits I get with this serum.</li>
            <li> Its not watery like most other brands</li>
            <li> and my skin just feels better, probably due to the aloe and all the moisturizers in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many other brands at all price ranges.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you that I am obsessed with anti aging products, lol.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a film or odor and does not dry my skin out or make it oily.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed 6 hyaluronic serums in the past year and this with every other instanatural product was by far the best.</li>
            <li> I like your product VERY much and have nearly used my 1st bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries which is very fast, I immediately feel my skin tightening and incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> They really have the customer at heart and I highly recommend them and their product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight difference, its still kind of early.</li>
            <li> My skin has a tendency to act up with certain products, so I am always nervous using new products.  </li>
            <li> and when I wear make up on top, normally with other products I would get an oily t-zone</li>
            <li> It seems like the dark circles under my eyes are already better.</li>
            <li> I have used for a couple of weeks now, the only result is that my face is full with pimples.</li>
            <li> I just love the fact that it gets rid of the puffiness under my eyes and diminshes my dark circles.</li>
            <li> am 62 having celebrated my birthday last month.  </li>
            <li> Grunge rock was in, tanning was cool and acne was a bigger worry than wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> There are much more expensive products on the market that are not even near as nice as this.  </li>
            <li> so I use it more than an average person would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old and have taken care of myself pretty well.  </li>
            <li> gave me lively skin , got lots of compliment , Thank You !</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that even though its packed with powerful ingredients its did not make my skin look red or flaky as some other serums I have used before have done .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than this, it&#x27;s clear, and goes on the face nicely and dries to a clear finish.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t really prevented new acne spots</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m 62 and my new  high school students thought I was in my 40s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less oily than I was before I started using it &amp; have gotten so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent that I love.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for several more weeks (on my face and upper neck) and continue to monitor the results.</li>
            <li> I am older but I can see still see and feel a difference.  </li>
            <li> It probably works the same, but it sure doesn’t feel the same!</li>
            <li> It seems like a decent product.</li>
            <li> This absorbs incredibly quickly, and you can immediately feel the different in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> Being a older woman I am conerned what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a bit more fluid/liquid than it actually is, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks, and I notice improvement in the area around my mouth particularly.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more Insta-natural face care products in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li> and it is bigger and more affordable than the one I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I had been using Instanaturals facial toner with adequate results but when I tried their moisturizing serum immediately after, I was blown away by its tightening effects.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li> Mainly took out some of the redness on my chest - which I assume is sun damage (at my age - 60+).</li>
            <li> but I tried it any way the product has improved my skin texture decently</li>
            <li> feel this Serum penetrate deep and quickly giving to my skin the balance and moisture that I need without the grime and shine.</li>
            <li> Once I use it on a regular basis, I will come back and write a more thorough review.  </li>
            <li> I started the serum with realistic expectations and hopes of smoother, more even and less pigmentation.</li>
            <li> It was a major concern for me because most Vit C serums contain 20% and my sensitive skin simply cant handle it.</li>
            <li> I really like that its all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, because I have pretty sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything when you apply it.</li>
            <li> The first week, when I applied only this (for testing purposes) after showering, it really didn’t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> The first hyalauric acid serum was like a gel, so I was quite surprised the new one was so watery.</li>
            <li> When I recived it, I was pleased to find that it was in a glass bottle as opposed to WattsBeauty&#x27;s plastic squirt bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face, and patted it dry, then used about a large pea-sized drop on my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum is more like a gel with the right consistency (not too watery nor too thick).</li>
            <li> two benefits of hyaluronic acid that are highly sought after.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I love this product, I only used it a few days and can clearly see a huge difference with my skin.  </li>
            <li> However, shipping is usually high on those websites.</li>

            <li> and I had high hopes</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Not only are the products amazing but the follow up and customer service is unmatched with any other company that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old, and I find this works better than any other product I have used, and I have used a lot.</li>
            <li> There have been several times where I had to apply more because it dried too quick.</li>
            <li> : Item was packaged in it&#x27;s own separate box (see pic) inside of larger box containing other items.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do feel like the original price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s discounted right now.</li>
            <li> I used hyaluronic in oral use for arthritic pain and it works wonders, so I&#x27;m giving the serum a little more time...</li>
            <li> i just need a little more time to see how my wrinkles do...</li>
            <li> With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  </li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> Bought a second one after the first got over!</li>
            <li> Not long, but so far my skin does feel softer and my overall skin tone is looking much more even.&lt;br /&gt;Thus</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old!!</li>
            <li> I am going to wait a little while before trying any more of the products</li>
            <li> my neck area appears somewhat better, I have to use it further to really tell, skin is loose still.</li>
            <li> It is a gel consistency and soaks in very quickly without leaving my face feeling sticky like other products.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C products before with the Hyaluronic acid, but this one was too strong.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son has been using a little for his pimples and they are completely gone, truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the best smelling, but it wasn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> It holds in moisture very well and offers additional help with the vitamins C &amp; E. Recommend.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel soft, but I don&#x27;t really see a visible improvement in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, rosacea, and have found this product to be gentle and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> watery substance, not thick and creamy like I am used to in a serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit early to see much improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> I feel I&#x27;m too young to really notice any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I really like the effects so far.</li>
            <li> But so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> so far i really like it  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes for Dry &amp; Mature skin - helps with the lack of elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines</li>
            <li> Moisturizes for Dry &amp; Mature skin - helps with the lack of elasticity, wrinkles, and fine lines</li>
            <li> Needless to say this is working great.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree, I feel that it is quite firming, and is also gentle on my sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> Its soft,  crows feet are disappearing so fast, and everyone says my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li> My age spots have faded considerably, but what I really like is how it changed the texture of my skin without feeling at all sticky.  </li>
            <li> It appears that this formula is packed with all gentle, natural ingredients in addition to hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, like witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I am 86 years old and this serum has made my face so much smoother</li>
            <li> far, I do not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well, makes the skin so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, come on time, works well, everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product</li>
            <li> Thus far I haven&#x27;t noticed too much improvement.  </li>
            <li> face seems slightly more youthful and definitely softer to me, and my skin is definitely worn from being a professional gardener&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I put it on after washing my face, before my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> Maybe after a few more weeks I will see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I applied twice a day after I washed and toned my skin normally.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin c, green tea, and jojoba oil combined with the hyaluronic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Youth hyaluronic acid before and that is DEF worth the extra money!  </li>
            <li> I feel that is has been worth trying I&#x27;ll have another review for you later.</li>
            <li> I want to contact seller to see why and ask if normal,  </li>
            <li> Might be normal but</li>
            <li> I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Insta-Natural’s Hyaluronic with Vitamin C and Vitamin E.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> but I could honestly say this has taken at least 5 years off my chest</li>
            <li> so I am also unsure if the smell is the normal for this product)?</li>
            <li> After I slide it on to my face, neck and decolletage, I wait a few moments, and then apply my favorite Vitamin A Retinol Cream.</li>
            <li> , two blemishes on my face healed faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> Impurities are coming out of my skin stays smooth and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> I apply this every morning and evening, as directed, and have seen such success with improving my skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the dropper vial extended all the way to the bottom of the bottle, eliminating any waste.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that there are no chemicals or harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> It definitely gave my skin a fresh and dewy appearance, without making it look greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> the ingredients were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed miracles, per se, but the smaller pores, fading scars and calmer skin is worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel that my skin is softer and more firm in 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Once absorbed, the product is not sticky and does leave my skin smooth, soft and firm.  </li>
            <li> Thick but not greasy and absorbs into skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Not oily or greasy like you would think it would be, and my skin just drinks it up like it was the only thing it has seen this good in a long long time!</li>
            <li> This is mych better for less money!</li>
            <li> I did get several tiny zits the first week of using it, but they went away and I am pregnant</li>
            <li> Regular moisturizers tend to help the dry spots, but clog my pores in the more oily areas.  </li>
            <li> start off my skincare routine by cleansing my skin 2x/day with Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, followed by Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Witch Hazel Toner, then follow it up with this product.</li>
            <li> I really love how this product goes on thin and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> That said, this is definitely a very competitively priced, compared to other products with similar ingredients, and I love InstaNatural as a company.</li>
            <li> To me it feels like nothing more than plain Aloe-</li>
            <li> Now my skin bounces right back like a teenager!</li>
            <li> The serum is too think on my facial skin,my skin isn&#x27;t soft or smooth feeling, not soft to my touch, it does do a good job on my hands, the skin is thinner on my hands than on my face has a thick dermis.</li>
            <li> and it really does hydrate like no other!  </li>
            <li> so it goes on easily and cools down the skin after treatment too.</li>
            <li> The product goes a long way &amp; even though I&#x27;ve been using it a short time, my face seems to be brighter, lines not so prominent &amp; adult breakouts stopped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, we were without A/C for an extended period of time (due to a lack of available parts) and the temps in our home almost reached 100 degrees at one point.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to serums, I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always hesitant about using something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new user with premature aging from alot of sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new cleansing and moisturizing line</li>
            <li> This month I will be trying out new stuff from them.</li>
            <li> like me, you are new to the concept of applying a liquidy gel and then moisturizing, give it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very hydrated, smooth and toned after a few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> The dark areas under my eyes are diminishing, fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has no smell, it seems to be working well on all areas except for the deep wrinkles around my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Up until now I have only used one brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum (HA), and I have been very pleased with my results, but this time when I came close to finishing my usual brand, I thought that I would try another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so most of my time is spent outside in the elements &amp;</li>
            <li> I reordered some more today......&amp; believe me I was so tired of trying everything with golden promises &amp; no results.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy residue on the surface of my skin as so many other products have done in the past.  </li>
            <li> but it does leave my skin very soft</li>
            <li> Although I definitely need to use moisturizer after I use this (before bed, after washing my face), the product is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my skin felt very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with a touch of Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was worried about it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> the skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft.</li>
            <li> When I apply this serum it  leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Started using this on my hands, they were looking very old.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re a lazy type, this serum is super easy to use and actually works.  </li>
            <li> I plan on saving the pretty colbolt blue bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Apparently my skin really needed this as it soaks it in so well</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty big deal when it comes to getting presents for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to lighten my dark spots &amp; smooth of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic in a bottle can do after a few months of use!</li>
            <li> Instantly after first use, I notice my skin was brighter, it feels like I just used a whitening mask for 20 mins.</li>
            <li> KEEP MY FACE SOFT AND MOISTURE ALL DAY!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for over two weeks now and am starting to see results, real results!</li>
            <li> After using this product every day for the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed even more change.  </li>
            <li> I have had dark circles all my life and after using this, I have seen fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just too old for repairs at this point!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve not been able to use it consistently due to a break out totally unrelated to this product (I have rosacea which has decided to flare).  </li>
            <li> After trying Insta natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid I will never do that again!</li>
            <li> The first bottle seemed to do something to my skin but not the second one.</li>
            <li> and I the fine lines seem less.</li>
            <li> my face feels exactly the same as when I&#x27;ve used organic Aloe on my face.  </li>
            <li> I followed all directions listed on the product which were pretty simple.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, I am conscious of the crow&#x27;s feet &amp; laugh lines, along with a loosening of my jaw line.</li>
            <li> I use the Vitamin C Serum sold by same company first</li>
            <li> So if you are vegan or interested in using cruelty-free products, you should definitely give this a chance.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps to erase wrinkles - but maybe iust prevents from having more.</li>
            <li> Definite decrease in lines including deep ones around my mouth, firmer skin even on my neck and upper lids and spots and pores look a lot better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 10 days so far, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any real changes, but the reviews say at least two or more weeks.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First, does it break me out and second, does it irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how this hydrates without feeling heavy!</li>
            <li> Had too many other ingredients and not enough of the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s The Exact Opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more than usual compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> first being vegan with no animal testing and second it does plump up the skin...</li>
            <li> face feels firmer and the fine lines around my mouth seem to be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are almost completely gone and I&#x27;m hopeful that they will stay gone!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Personally, I like that it comes in the colored bottle because it blocks sunlight, and many substances break down due to light.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the action of other skincare products, and it&#x27;s so far been fine to use under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While there&#x27;s still some residual moisture in my skin, I put a little over a full dropper of serum in my hand and gently pat this all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality serum and comes in a large blue glass bottle, which speaks to the quality and care of the company in protecting the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious about trying out new creams, serums and lotions because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half filled.</li>
            <li> Although not a fan of the dropper, would prefer a pump the product goes on easily and dries in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> However, I now suspect the seal was broken, as the plastic wrap around the top literally fell off when I first handled it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more Insta Natural products and I am anxiously waiting to use them.  </li>
            <li> Well first of all this this review is kind of useless.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have high hopes of much improvement in my 63 year old facial skin with sun damage.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be helping with sun spots a little, and some fine lines</li>
            <li> My 68-year-old skin feels soft and supple with very few wrinkles, and I hope this regimen keeps it that way for many years.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes are significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li> it really gives me an instant moisture, I am really new on skin care</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but it really seems to be improving the discoloration from too much sun.</li>
            <li> The texture out of the bottle is a little on the thick side making it feel more like a gel, but it glides on my face easily.</li>
            <li> My skin not only looks more radiant and plump, but it&#x27;s noticeably less oily.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a different brand that I think worked better.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and soft and my ( ) are less visible</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, but seems very lite and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and tight.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> I have treated my face regularly over the past few years for spots and they continue to come more and more every summer on my face and chest.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> In the dry heat environment is just the right product.</li>
            <li> I have few fine lines but need help around mouth and eyes</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning under my face cream which I mixed with a bit of emu oil, and at night under pure emu oil on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My skin just soaked this stuff up - I am not sure if that&#x27;s normal, or if I am that much in need of hydration, but I barely got the chance to rub it in before it all was absorbed!  </li>
            <li> As a large molecule, it doesn&#x27;t permeate deep into the skin, but instead stays near the surface where it moisturizes the skin surface</li>
            <li> My facial pores appear to be smaller and the wrinkles and fine lines are definitely minimized.  </li>
            <li> OK, but the product is stock in the bottle, vey hard to take out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> :) I bet those are really hard to remove.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about InstaNaturals&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the bottle is twice the size for the same price of other hyaluronic serums on the market right now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick yet dries quick and has made my skin look that much better than the other leading brand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> The serum also dries without a residue which is great because I have hated &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; since I was a baby, or so I&#x27;m told, so the smooth feeling of the serum is a must for me, and this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> IT IS A CLEAR COLORED SERUM</li>
            <li> It helped clear my skin tho</li>
            <li> I happened to quit taking H.A. about then, unfortunately, and over the following years I began to notice that my skin wasn&#x27;t so great looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li> Now I need to go see a dermatologist to clear it</li>
            <li> and I had to take antihistamine tablets and steroid ointment to clear it up.</li>
            <li> product packs a punch in the form of a clear gel.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking.</li>
            <li> This is a product that really does what it claims to do, plus it is natural, they never test on animals, and I have had terrific results with this!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and my skin is clear again.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Has kept my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Insta Natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum without a clue as to what &amp;#34;hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; even was.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> It helps to smooth and tighten a few of the wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I do think it helps my 65 year old</li>
            <li> so far altho</li>
            <li> If you can give me some insight into what I should be expecting as far as results that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> This bottle is twice as much as I use to purchase and about the same price.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin soft.</li>
            <li> bought for myself  see no difference so far</li>
            <li> using just for about a week and the result is visible, my skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> if your ambient air is damp, it will absorb water from the air and give you a soft, hydrated layer over your skin.</li>
            <li> Not too drying for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t gotten rashes or reactions to the product, even though my skin is fairly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> She recently commented on how much she is liking it and says that her skin is tighter and the lines are smoothing out.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> 93 year old mother</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am early in my use.</li>
            <li> My face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; felt soft, and were visibly moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old &amp; avoiding surgery, etc.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt as soft and hydrated as it does using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> Just used twice so far</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is acne prone.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 years old</li>
            <li> Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> I dont see any difference in my skin, since my skin is sensitive I did not get any adverse reactions</li>
            <li> I decided to try Insta Natural brand.</li>
            <li> so far i do not see any improvement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 51 year old guy and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the darkness but not as much in the puffiness yet.</li>
            <li> Too early to say for just 8 days I&#x27;m using , I will continue to use after a month</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum really works I have been using it for several months</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Another added bonus is that it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It is also not expensive and lasts a long time considering how often I use it and am including my hands and face....</li>
            <li> soft moistured hydrated  with natural ingredients  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week now, and so far, I like the results I am getting.</li>
            <li> I try to take as much care of it as much as possible.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any marked improvements in my wrinkles but the product does make my skin feel softer and gives it a heathier look which i like</li>
            <li> I rub it in some, then let it soak in naturally.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I am not getting sensitivity or redness from this.</li>
            <li> and I feel my face looks brighter, smoother, and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I think I would have gone directly to the product had it been listed by it&#x27;s usefulness.  </li>
            <li> So far, I like it and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have oddly sensitive skin, so I gave this a one night trial test.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, or everyone with sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Everyday use makes your skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> I credit the Hyaluromic Acid Serum and both the Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin lotion and richer face cream (for night).  </li>
            <li> My typically sensitive skin loves this too.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than facial lift.</li>
            <li> and I still look like a 50 year old woman.  </li>
            <li> This serum makes your face feel firm and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks and feel it is too early to access results.  </li>
            <li> The second bottle was very runny.</li>
            <li> As a 75 year old woman, I thought I was too old for anything to work.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is supple and soft.</li>
            <li> My face looks alive again&lt;</li>
            <li> but so far I do not have any issues.</li>
            <li> My complexion has improved considerably.  </li>
            <li> and I like all the natural extras that are added with this item.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy formula that makes skin so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews and doing a  price comparison (twice as much product for about the same price)</li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Your skin naturally contains hyaluronic acid, but the amount decreases with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;ve def got some sun damage on both face/chest and just thought my chest was too far gone.  </li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> but i had not seen any disadvantages to using this product so far.</li>
            <li> During this time I tried everything (natural products) and nothing seemed to help my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li> No heavy face residue.</li>
            <li> Prior to this combo, I was using very pricey Dr Perricone and Lancome products.</li>
            <li> Since I am eighty, I am probably to old to judge</li>
            <li> Additionally, Insta Natural&#x27;s product does not contain alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so far.</li>
            <li> Not so desirable, and seems counter-productive to the HA action.</li>
            <li> so far i like it.</li>
            <li> As far as helping for wrinkles its too soon to tell as I&#x27;ve not used it but about two weeks and not everyday.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 50 years old, I mention this for people to have an idea.</li>
            <li> I admit I was surprised to read all of the ingredients in one bottle.</li>
            <li> , I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for about a week and my face is noticeably softer.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my face looks too young..</li>
            <li> NATURAL  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, just soft.</li>
            <li> There are no harsh smells associated with thia serum and alll of the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> Within one application of this product, my skin was hydrated, and soft.</li>
            <li> For the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working effectively so far.</li>
            <li> I tried the InstaNatural Premium Hydration Hyaluronic Acid Serum Professional Formula.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon Insta Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li> At All Or Pull Any Of  Your Natural Beauty</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Is A Naturally Occurring Substance Found In The Skin.</li>
            <li> You only need about a pea sized amount for your whole face, so it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, it was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li> When applied it really tightens up my facial and neck line skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 71years old and women age 50 and up</li>
            <li> This product has reversed the hands of time and given me a reminder how young my mom once looked like.</li>
            <li> The serum melts into the skin leaving it soft and</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the results...</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated after using it.  </li>
            <li> skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell</li>
            <li> the manufacturer&#x27;s website, this identical product is available for a few dollars at the 2oz size.</li>
            <li> do really like this product, and would recommend it to a friend or relative.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say something here about avoiding the problem by not getting old</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t really like is the texture and</li>
            <li> I use this interchangablely with the insta natural vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin naturally</li>
            <li> I no longer have flaking issues around old acne scars and my skin looks &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;, but not in an oily way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft and supple after one week of use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far it seems like its making my skin softer.</li>
            <li> This is the winner by far.</li>
            <li> Still early to see results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> This makes your face look radiant and young ..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a close tie between those two products for me so far.  </li>
            <li> So soft to touch.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and tighter, I&#x27;ll order again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and will definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Only been using the product a few days, but am satisfied with the results I am seeing.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of use, my skin feels more moisturized and somehow fuller.</li>
            <li> This product feels good on my face and leaves no residue, stickiness, or uncomfortable build up.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is thick enough to be used on his own</li>
            <li> BUT, much more slowly then advertised.</li>
            <li> Slowly, but sure working</li>
            <li> Slowly but surely, my face is regaining the glow it used to have.</li>
            <li> Major improvement after 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> It smells fine compared to other oils and such that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have some fine lines on the left side of my face from smoking and probably also due to the relentless California sun.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long to notice a different in fading age spots, but it makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following the directions provided: washing, toning, applying the serum then using my usual oil over the top and WOW!</li>
            <li> It is way better than other serums that are more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I let it dry first and also use a moisturizer over the serum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this serum on my face, neck, and chest at night before bed and never really noticed significant differences until about the 2nd week I&#x27;d been using this.</li>
            <li> That being said, this serum does contain some powerful ingredients found in other skin products, and it didn’t irritate my skin or anything when I tried it (and I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Paired with the night cream that&#x27;s all the regimen you need, I&#x27;ll be super young fast little lines are getting even smaller</li>
            <li> I love the consistency is thick, feels more potent &amp; less scary than &#x27;acid&#x27;</li>
            <li> However I have been pretty rough on my hands over 58 years and one can expect only so much improvement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really excited about this product and have even recommended it to a few of my friends.</li>
            <li> it would be that it feels kind of thick and sticky at first, but that feeling goes away in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, making sure yo follow directions and putting the serum on the neck area along with the jaw lone up yo behind the ears.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that because this is fast absorbing you have to work really quickly</li>
            <li> What I think makes this product so special is the way that the bottle has an applicator dropper allowing me to do a lot with just a little</li>
            <li> Then about a week into it, I was putting on makeup, and where I usually put on my cover up on, my forehead where I have some fine wrinkle lines, I didn&#x27;t have to put on any cover up, and didn&#x27;t even think about it until, I got to the doctors office.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the wrinkles, but my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disappointed and believe me I wanted to love it.  </li>
            <li> I have already ordered a second bottle although there is still a lot left in the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Recently I used this on my sunburned skin with thw skin brightening lotIon instead of my usual banana boat sun lotion on and the results were way better.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and I have been using this product twice a day since the middle of DEC, 2014 with no negative effects.  </li>
            <li> You can feel it actually working, as it dries it tightens slightly to reduce the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to my friends &amp; clients, it actually works and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the serum so its to early to comment about wrinkles and finelines but onething which I noticed serum dry up very quickly and get dry skin feeling after use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying this serum and making it a part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> This is such an high quality product.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased had a broken syringe tip, but Instanatural was quick to replace it with a brand new item.  </li>
            <li> This winter my skin has been very dry and flaky but after a few days of using it has plumped back up and is nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> That in itself is a major plus to me!</li>
            <li> This serum glides on and drys quickly but does not give you that tight feeling .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a short time but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 years old and barely have any visible lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, and my skin tone has definitely evened out some, and overall looks smoother, so I really do like it so far.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid  Serum is helpful, but it is not as much as I would need this soon, perhaps long time use because of my advance age.</li>
            <li> It really works to keep my face hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> that for so long, and the seller deserves another five stars by showing me how much they care for their customers.</li>
            <li> I do not normally need to use facial products as I rarely have skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> The main difference was that InstaNatural came in a 2 ounce bottle while the other brand came in a one ounce bottle (for more or less the same price).</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li> I like all the other ingredients in the serum, especially the vitamin C and green tea, which when applied topically are known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the light gel is enough to cover all the face.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried to buy similar products in stores before, but the prices are very high, even with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> However, the serum did make my skin feel as if it were burning the first several times I used it which I was assured was normal  by other Hyaluronic acid users and it has never bothered me again.</li>
            <li> But as someone who is 44 and trying to avoid the signs of age, I&#x27;m open to learning about new beauty products.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very low humidity.</li>
            <li> It is a new Holy Grail product that is currently being added as a requirement in my skin care.</li>
            <li> I had purchased two other products from this company that I like very much.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with some dry spots.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have a very pronounced T-Zone where my face is oily on/around my nose, up and across my forehead, but dry everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also I doesn&#x27;t dry my skin so much if I forget to use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I only have used it for a week, too early to evaluate completely.</li>
            <li> more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really wish to have the same one from last year.</li>
            <li> So, this comment shouldn&#x27;t be an absolute for someone else younger or who has different skin.</li>
            <li> ,can&#x27;t see how much serum is actually in that blue bottle</li>
            <li> The ingredients are clearly defined, the packaging is basic and sealed, and this company offers it with Amazon Prime.  </li>
            <li> I see that the red blotches on my face are much lighter if not totally gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated and it is absorbed quickly, no greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s thick but applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and it did not give any messy residue.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The added green tea feature of this serum makes your face and neck feel SUPER refreshed after you put it on, as does the vitamin C.</li>
            <li> and it certainly has helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, prone to redness especially in the cheek area (not rosacea).</li>
            <li> I liked this serum and the price was generous, but given all the beneficial ingredients I really was disappointed to find it had witch hazel in a very high concentration.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was double the amount and was a better deal compared to a similar item I&#x27;d purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> My facial pores are smaller and less fine lines.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I&#x27;m putting vitamin A&amp;D to help with this issue as I do love the overall results!</li>
            <li> This product need a greater concentration of Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid, I prefer using a 100% product, with at least a 25% Vitamin C product!</li>
            <li> But once I start putting the serum every day before makeup, I started to see the difference my skin was much smoother and my puffiness was less than I normally have.</li>
            <li> My (old) normal routine was wash, pat dry, and moisturize.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and tight.</li>
            <li> , it smells nice and a little goes a long way, I have only been using it for a short time, so I have not noticed any big changes.</li>
            <li> Our skins&#x27; texture and tone has improved significantly and we have noticed a brighter complexion only after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This is a full 2oz for the same price as other very similar products.</li>
            <li> The Insta Naturals Vitamin C serum is nice and smell like citrus, it is however also a very thick serum, I will be using it from today!  </li>
            <li> it is very good and does not cause any make up base to peel off....</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month, I used to have a very dry skin specially my forehead, now it feels soft and my small lines and facial skin looks much healthier , I have rosacea and it has also help to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a few changes to my facial skin, less dry in the morning when I first apply and those lines around my mouth are better as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week of use as well, the wrinkles on her forehead were almost non-existent and her skin also looked generally</li>
            <li> Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> Really have not used this product long enough to see how well it works..</li>
            <li> The creases around my eyes were reduced and I was surprised to see my pores look smaller.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the first week, there was a noticeable reduction in my pore size and even dark marks which I wasn’t expecting at all.</li>
            <li> I would go back to my old routine- Philosophy</li>
            <li> essential oil by Young Living</li>
            <li> I apply it once, directly after washing my face, daily.  </li>
            <li> Tiny lines around my eyes and lips are almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a reviewer, aside from the fact I spend too much of my day ordering anything that looks remotely beneficial from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on trying&lt;br /&gt;beauty products that just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My face still feels soft and I like the overall smoothness.</li>
            <li> The protective barrier around my sinus area was (is) completely removed leaving my skin red with a burning sensation for 4 months.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the low price of this serum.  </li>
            <li> HYALURONIC IN THE NEAR FUTURE--</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin plumped, soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> The deep lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 50 yes old next month</li>
            <li> Some improvement is noticed, but not enough time has passed to offer complete review</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old, but if you saw me you would guess a younger age--maybe 50 something.  </li>
            <li> must say though that I have developed a drying up of my skin just below my lips just above either side of chin (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve recommended it to five friends and 4 are using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back in a month or two if this helped at all with my on-and-off adult acne.</li>
            <li> and I think this is the main reason my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried a few products with hyaluronic acid in it, they have a distinct medicated scent but the added ingredients in this product gives it an additional hint of floral.</li>
            <li> I have changed up my skincare routine many times over the years, and this is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The thing is, my skin has gone from mixed to surprisingly dry in certain spots.  </li>
            <li> First the oil cleaned, shrank down and emptied my pores</li>
            <li> but would like to give it a little more time to work with the other products from your company that I purchased shortly before the serum.</li>
            <li> The serum has a lovely natural perfume (vaguely citrus) and absorbs really fast, almost like a dry oil but with no residue.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few weeks, appears to slightly be working, but will know more after a complete bottle.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it to help my dry skin to retain some extra moisture in the winter but the product is watered down with so much witch hazel that it actually dried me out more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the actual permanence of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, but for the short term, it decreases the fine lines on my lower cheeks</li>
            <li> Only have had it a short time, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li> Other people started noticing something was different within the first week.  </li>
            <li> The serum is a little sticky at first but once applied to the face sinks in very well.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a second bottle although with this serum 2 ounces is obviously going to last at least 60 days or more.</li>
            <li> I do admit that due to the gel-like consistency it can be a challenge to get it into the dropper, but I find that if I gently shake the bottle then squeeze the dropper bulb</li>
            <li> The other brand was very watery.</li>
            <li> Plus price and size very affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> am a fair-skinned senior gal who spent way too many hours back in the day tanning and while I have very few wrinkles, I do have age spots and dryness and visible pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, a extremely dry state, and since I started using it</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I tested this with a small drop on the back of my right hand at night.  </li>
            <li> have been applying the serum on my face, neck &amp; decollete and it has helped reduce the appearance of my fine lines, and also helped the dark circles under my eyes less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product, after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27; developed red blotches and itching and thought it was just an initial reaction and would go away.</li>
            <li> This serum has no parabens, harsh chemicals, or alcohol, and most importantly, it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied, simply contact us and get a full refund.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;5)  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how many other products she uses or if there is a big market for Vegan skin care</li>
            <li> The one I use at night does exactly what I want, but leaves my face a little greasy...</li>
            <li> First Off, Don&#x27;t Let that Little Word \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; Scare You.</li>
            <li> I generally have smooth skin but have noticed some rough patches and uneven tone in recent years as well as some darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use witch hazel on my skin because it has a tendency to dry my skin some, though, not excessively.</li>
            <li> My facial color is even, and minor blemishes and a new set of wrinkles are gone, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, if you have normal to dry skin definitely should use a moisturizer after using this product (or any hyaluronic acid serum).</li>
            <li> like other Hyaluronic Acid Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, I loved the little glass bottle with dropper, which made it so simple to apply the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li> It only takes 3 or 4 drops of this HA to cover my face and neck, and the InstaNaturals immediately soaked into my skin, keeping my mature and dry facial skin hydrated, and soft.</li>
            <li> The serum is very thick and clear and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serums usually offer amazing moisturizing benefits for the skin, however a lot of Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past do not deliver enough moisture to my skin and some of them even make it feel a bit dryer, so</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes really has lightened up and the puffiness under my eyes have lessoned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 9 products (Argan Oil Hair Mask, Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum, Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles &amp; Bags, Vitamin C Facial Toner, Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer and Age- Defying Moisturizer, Hyalunoric  Acid Serum)</li>
            <li> dark spots are getting much lighter</li>
            <li> This is simply a diluted and generally inferior version of the product you thought you were getting.</li>
            <li> I had lots of dark spots on my face especially near the eye, cheek bone area.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for help with dark eye circles, but wanted to refresh my skin, plump up the lines and lighten dark spots starting to show up.  </li>
            <li> I received this in the mail earlier this week, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> and so far I have seen some minor changes around my lips.</li>
            <li> ; i don&#x27;t have enough experience with the product to provide useful feedback; please check back in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face in the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order it again to see if it keeps working as well as it did on the first round</li>
            <li> I have noticed a visible improvement in the texture of my skin within the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Unequivably and without a doubt, I will be ordering this particular product as long as the company continues to sell it!!!!  </li>
            <li> Unequivably and without a doubt, I will be ordering this particular product as long as the company continues to sell it!!!!  </li>
            <li> my acne had simmered down quite a bit probably really noticed by week 2.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this serum!!,it goes on smoothly,absorbs real fast and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I researched this and other products before I bought this particular product.  </li>
            <li> first, this moisturizing serum seemed very thick to me and I often times felt like I had applied too much of the product onto my face.  </li>
            <li> so much that I think I&#x27;ll go back to a somewhat more expensive one, but this one&#x27;s costing me!</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful introducing new products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum and other products by this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum for very long, but so far my skin seems softer.  </li>
            <li> My skin has always been dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I presume this means that they use half as much HA to make the serum.</li>
            <li> Not only does it offer anti-aging benefits, like diminishing fine lines, but it can help reduce hyper-pigmentation, the appearance of dark circles, and can help soften skin to create a supple, firm look.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and wait for it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and this product really helped my skin and my dark spots...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is worth the extra step in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> It has a delicate scent and absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and not to thin or too</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and not to thin or too</li>
            <li> It really plumps out and instantly rehydrates my dry dry facial skin!</li>
            <li> My face has always been dry, red, and acne prone, and every product I have tried hasn&#x27;t  cooperated with my sensitive skin until I tried this.</li>
            <li> It has a much thicker texture so I actually use less.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and acne scars and it has given me back the soft smoothness and hydrated my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for less expensive but equally as good products as Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will slow down further wrinkles and keep my skin better hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I shared my bottle with my mother  and her fine wrinkle are all gone but the deep wrinkles on the foreheads are tough to go.</li>
            <li> Thanks I will definitely continue to use this product, and it is a plus that it is less expensive than most others.</li>
            <li> so I can use as little or as much as I need.</li>
            <li> t&#x27;s has so much in that one little bottle.</li>
            <li> Other products I have used in the past have left my skin feeling oily or a filmy residue; not with instanatural, it goes on smooth and is like I&#x27;m not even wearing it.</li>
            <li> However, the little that remained was really absorbent</li>
            <li> Thank you for being real in this tough world of today, for you don&#x27;t really ever see this in today&#x27;s world anymore.</li>
            <li> It definitely was not a full bottle, about half full.</li>
            <li> My mom has helped me through all the good and bad times in my life.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit sticky for the first 15 seconds and once is dry</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply and feels great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I&#x27;m not sure whether this serum or the night cream was responsible, but after a few days of use, I ended up with a horrible break-out and had to discontinue using both products.  </li>
            <li> a few).&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly, smells like a floral/baby powder combination, has a slight cooling effect, and over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;m actually seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like how big the size of the bottle is since you only use a little at a time it should last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> This is 2oz bottle unlike other serum, I think because it uses more since it is very thick.</li>
            <li> Been using a week and this stiff is real deal.  </li>
            <li> The other 3 brand x smell like they are sour and who wants to smell that!  </li>
            <li> My suggestion, if you can&#x27;t afford a 3-step routine, buy one at a time, you&#x27;ll see a difference, and a little really goes a long way</li>
            <li> Will be a customer for life, have since ordered other products directly from sellers website</li>
            <li> This serum did not sting my rather sensitive skin as some of the other serums I have tried do.  </li>
            <li> New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this off with a little scary fact: most Hyaluronic Acid found in medicines is derived from the combs of roosters (yuck!), but InstaNatural only uses vegan Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> This works, help them reduce your bags,  Wrinkles and fine lines,Damaged skin - sun spots, age spots, and discoloration, Dehydrated, dry, rough or flaky skin &amp; Uneven skin tone and texture!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry red patches above my upper lip that nothing has taken care of until now.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see results, but I like it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old with combination skin &amp; unfortunately I still deal with some (not bad) acne.</li>
            <li> , if you can&#x27;t afford a 3-step routine, buy one at a time, you&#x27;ll see a difference, and a little really goes a long way (this will last a LONG time), when you get a 3-step routine - you&#x27;ll want to take a before</li>
            <li> I bought this because the product that that I usually use, PURE Hyaluronic Acid, was out of stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only holding  back one star because I&#x27;ve not been using it for very long.</li>
            <li> My face is no longer red or dry, and my acne scars have actually  started to fade.</li>
            <li> The product seems to not necessarily call for make up or further moisturizer, even though the air here in Colorado is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> But I have to moisturise after using the product because it dried up fast leaving the skin dry.</li>
            <li> Its faded my dark spots and even helped with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;6) Evens out skin tone - diminish hyperpigmentation, dark pigmentation, age spots, melisma, pink/red acne scars, freckles, sun damage, and allows natural skin brighteners to penetrate</li>

            <li> Not sure yet which product is responsible for this yet,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> When I apply moisturizer over it, my skin immediately feels softer and smoother and the results seem to last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have an opinion on results</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on results because frankly I feel like I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to notice improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> (this will last a LONG time), when you get a 3-step routine - you&#x27;ll want to take a before</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet.</li>
            <li> four stars because I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to rate it a five.</li>
            <li> long  enough  </li>
            <li> long last.)  </li>
            <li> I am 42 and have suffered from acne for a long time since my teenage.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will really last you a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and almost holds its shape when I drop it into my hand.</li>
            <li> Keeping the facial skin soft, tight.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way - a small amount provided full coverage for face and entire neck - leaving my skin feeling healthier and tighter!  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry high desert area of the country so I will say my skin looks less dry and wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> I expected my face to feel a little tighter, not show wrinkles as much.  </li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about the consistency because its a little bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s not sticky and glides right onto my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just over a week and the dry patches on my skin have decreased significantly...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps, my complexion was already to the point of improvement because of use of other products such as facial masks, peels, lotions, and wearing a hat outside for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a major problem.</li>
            <li> but they are not stingy with the amount you receive, this should last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it regularly for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Also being in Utah this is amazing in the winter when the cold weather dries your skin making every one of those wrinkles stand out front and center.</li>
            <li> but I definitely noticed that this helped with my dry</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s been helping me with my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> But this time serum smell like a soap and not the same texture and it makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> It works by shrinking pours, it helped with some black heads too, and it makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> otherwise it will be dry before you have time to spread over your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this serum to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that responds negatively to chemicals, so I am always looking for affordable natural products.</li>
            <li> It has made a big difference in lightening my dark spots, evening skin tone, plumping and smoothing out skin in general.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using about half a dropper of Serum, both morning and night under my insta natural age-defying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My dry spots are practically gone, and my acne is definitely reduced.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give this a try I actually have oily and dry face skin</li>
            <li> Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I looked old and wrinkly whereas a few months before I looked 5 to 10 years younger than my age.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to last you a LONG LONG time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I really appreciate about this company is that they contact their customers via email, touching base and asking if there are any problems or questions.  </li>
            <li> product keeps my skin feel soft and hydrated all day and a little goes a long way with this stuff that I have enough to rub on my face, neck and hands with one use.</li>
            <li> I have followed the instructions which were very clear and will do a follow up review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My dropper doesn&#x27;t pick up much of anything, so I take it out, turn it upside down to access the formula, and then, from being upside down, when I try to replace the dropper, it spews out product all over the place.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t mess with my overly sensitive skin,  and</li>
            <li> I notice when I&#x27;m not drinking as much water as I should be, my laugh lines near my mouth are also pronounced and seem to be laughing when I&#x27;m not. :(  </li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive hyaluronic acid serums before but this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short period of time, and the lines are still visible, but are less noticable, and the overall texture of my skin has improved.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reached age 65, and I&#x27;d been bothered by a steady decline in my skin&#x27;s appearance for the past five years.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell of the ingredient green tea but the smell doesn’t last long and is very vaint.</li>
            <li> I have two wrinkles below my mouth by my chin and so far I have not seen even a little result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little early to see any results but after about 1 week of use, our skin feels tighter and hydrated.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, it is not as thick as the other stuff, although they have similar ingredients, aloe being the first (which is also a thickener).</li>
            <li> Firmly believing that MOISTURE is a major key in the way skin looks, any way I can retain moisture in and on the skin is one of two goals for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the argan oil, or at least you don&#x27;t feel it as much on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Since I was late doing this, I haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement on my face, but have on my legs.</li>
            <li> When I read the 5 star reviews, I was skeptical as it seemed they were overly glowing and all from people who somehow got a discount or free for writing a review.  </li>
            <li> and I just could not figure it out until I found a website that explained that for some people the acid pulled the moisture out of the skin, especially common in humid climates and it doesn&#x27;t get much more humid than East Texas.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using it at least once a day, I really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I also must tell you that the company emailed me direct to ask about my satisfaction with their product.and reassuring me that if I was not satisfied, I just needed to email back.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> How long does it take?  </li>
            <li> so I do not hvae to wait too long before applying the day or night cream.</li>
            <li> will continue this regimen with the Hyaluronic Acid and the Eye Serum, for as long as Instanatural sells it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect overnight results, but long term use truly shows visible results.</li>
            <li> a bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> , I spent a lengthy time in the tropics, but my girlfriend commented that I appeared lighter, when I should have been the opposite.</li>
            <li> The scent of it is not bothersome and the bottle seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I purchased Insta Natural&#x27;s during a promotion, and here&#x27;s what I have to say after using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing the opposite of what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have followed Cody Wren on instagram for a long time now.</li>
            <li> The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review</li>
            <li> It is the professional formula with Vitamin C, Green Tea, and JoJoBa Oil.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer and plan on using it as long as they make</li>
            <li> As long as a product is formulated with quality, beneficial ingredients, I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of hyaluronic acid and have never tried this form.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for long, but can say that I see a difference already.  </li>
            <li> I figured that since I&#x27;m not sensitive to anything on the ingredients list, so it can&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I had a long way to travel</li>
            <li> It is a thick, clear gel that is barely scented and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I plan on reviewing another one of Instanatural&#x27;s serums that has more of an oil base to it in the near future</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency and really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serum products, however I have very sensitive skin and previous products</li>
            <li> My only complaint (I&#x27;ll live with it, though) is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Puts moisture back in my face after using black African soap.</li>
            <li> bottle costs less than similar products, providing twice the amount for the same price.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed any anti-aging benefits from it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it wouldn&#x27;t show results for someone else.</li>
            <li> I find that my wrinkles are less apparent after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell about the long term results, because I am using other Vit C serum at the same time.</li>
            <li> I started with their cleansing oil for my 40 year old, sensitive, dull and acne prone skin just a few weeks ago and added this to my new routine a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I am shocked being a light brown complexion (african, irish, native american).</li>
            <li> My acne had come back in reminiscence of my teenage years, and my skin had these horrible dry patches and bright red discoloration.</li>
            <li> : Uses essential oils, aloe and witch hazel among other ingredients.</li>
            <li> looking forward to seeing long term results!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need any other creme to apply above it.</li>
            <li> You get 2 oz of product,  all the other products I was researching they only give 1oz</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a little over a week and realized that I needed to use it at night for the ultimate benefit.</li>
            <li> Works better than my expensive creams!</li>
            <li> I received on time but didn&#x27;t start using for several weeks because I had other products to use up.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is some other reviews I read claim</li>
            <li> I initially chose InstaNaturals due to their ingredients, then the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did this twice a day, and after a couple days, I saw minor improvement in the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and even skintone!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other similar serums out there.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this and am eager to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since, I do have the product, and I am not sending it back due to shipping costs and my time, I will condition to use it.  </li>
            <li> Only use this every other day, under my Argon Oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally different from other hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several other serums and never had results like with this one.  </li>
            <li> and I do not need any other facial cream over it.</li>
            <li> I apply both products after the shower, I don&#x27;t wear make up so the only other thing I apply to my skin is an SPF moisturizer and</li>
            <li> Other serums I&#x27;ve tried have been nothing but problems, but instanatural is actually correcting my problem areas</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this for a long time and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 2 months of use!</li>
            <li> serum is somewhat thicker than some of the other ones I have tried - a definite plus for application.  </li>
            <li> I used a different product before buying this one and do not feel the tightening that I felt with the other product.  </li>
            <li> I apply this before any other facial creams and its improving my skin.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have had dry spots on my face, as well as other changes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this very long, but seeing some noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I let it dry</li>
            <li> If your ambient air is dry, it will absorb water from your skin and make your skin dryer than without it.</li>
            <li> but I have to use a moisturizer over it as it does dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized all day even living in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> DRY.  </li>
            <li> then I apply the serum &amp; let it dry</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin dry.</li>
            <li> The dry skin on the corners of my mouth disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and has helped my face alot.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders in my dry winter skin</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and flaky, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and</li>
            <li> It helps my face feel moisturized and supple with out feeling dry</li>
            <li> I am combination dry</li>
            <li> I recommend using this with a moisturizer as well for those who are dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with blemishes but do have persistent dry scaly areas on my forehead and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also tended to have dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> My dry patches around my nose have also cleared up.</li>
            <li> I changed moisturizers and started having issues with dry patches.</li>
            <li> did not cause any breakouts or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so, a lot of times products will dry my skin out, so,</li>
            <li> After showering, I apply the serum, let it dry</li>
            <li> My skin had been really dry and cracking.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been overly dry (but I do put moisturizer on after it dries like the instructions suggest).</li>
            <li> Astringent properties for Oily Skin - tends to dry out the skin and reduce the size of the skin pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Astringent properties for Oily Skin - tends to dry out the skin and reduce the size of the skin pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND THEN PUT SERUM ON AND LET IT DRY</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry &amp; dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone and everyone who has dry and/or dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this when I noticed my skin was getting dry.</li>
            <li> I no longer have any dry spots.</li>
            <li> so if your skin is dry and dehydrated, this would work miracles for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, neck and even onto my chest (I&#x27;m getting old and the skin on my chest looks far worse than on my face these days).  </li>
            <li> ’s hard to tell whether or not this serum actually did anything–serums are supposed to enhance the moisturizer that you apply afterwards–so it’s difficult to know exactly how much a benefit the serum adds.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous InstaNatural products over the past few months, so my expectations were high, and I knew they would be met, but this product blew me away.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it takes longer to dry than just the HA by itself, and can leave the face feeling a bit sticky if you get heavy-handed with it.  </li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and think I see a small &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; at work here.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and puffiness).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told several of my friends and</li>
            <li> This is definitely lightening the dark circles under my eyes noticeably.</li>
            <li> My face looks overall a bit brighter with some lightening of dark spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tighter, he has no more puffiness under the eyes, and his face is baby soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my dark spots are fading and my husband&#x27;s skin texture has smoothed and his face overall is brighter...</li>
            <li> I especially like to use this under my eyes in which I have dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> For no real reason other than maybe subconsciously trying to ration my supply...</li>
            <li> I especially like that it reduces dark circles under the eyes and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Some of these reviews use the exact same words in sentences from other reviews, meaning these are fake and by the same person.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint, refreshing, citrus smell.</li>
            <li> but I run it on my stomach and loose skin</li>
            <li> You have nothing to loose</li>
            <li> I see no major difference from other hyaluronic products I have tried.</li>
            <li> this product along with several other products in this line do the job!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What is really different about this serum is that most of the time when you use a serum with Hyaluronic acid in it the face can feel dry and tight I have used serums like this and its a very uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit goes a long way  </li>
            <li> , and this should last forever - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell if it will have an effect on my dark spots but my skin texture feels like it has improved a little.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and do not like very heavy creams or oils on my face.</li>
            <li> I do have a slight tacky feel to my skin after applying these products but that is resolved once I put on my face sun screen as a finishing step in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I notice less blotchiness and have ordered a second bottle.  </li>
            <li> but I have only been using it for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I even noticed some slight improvement in the deep wrinkles I have on one side of my face.</li>
            <li> Your skin seriously glows with this stuff, wrinkles particularly around the eyes improve immediately.</li>
            <li> and she says I look no older than thirties.</li>
            <li> I apply the gel on my wet face and then let it dry for close to 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is something wrong with mine as I haven&#x27;t seen many postings about it.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely not a miracle worker, but after a few weeks of use I can see a minor difference in my frown lines.</li>
            <li> I started seeing lines disappearing and growing smaller in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have noticed slight changes, as it has only been a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean necessarily dry skin, because I am completely combination (oily/dry/normal).</li>
            <li> Not a significant notice of wrinkle reduction, but enough for me to keep using.</li>
            <li> The hydration plumps up the skin but oddly enough, seems to take away the plumped up little bag lines from under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> little sugar, no red meat, no processed foods,  </li>
            <li> I use the past tense because I am getting lines around my eyes and now have some smile lines.  </li>
            <li> Living in utah in the winter can be tough on my skin but this has helped keep it from drying out as much.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use it with other skin cares, you have to wait until it completely dry otherwise it will generate scraps.</li>
            <li> The end result is that the dry areas (which weren&#x27;t extreme but did get flaky at times) of my face are no longer an issue and my oily areas have calmed as well.</li>
            <li> However, I receive twice as much of this serum for a lot less than the price of half of the usual amount.</li>
            <li> However, I receive twice as much of this serum for a lot less than the price of half of the usual amount.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and I get really dry skin due to under skin dehydration from the disease</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other hyaluronic acid serums for the same price, but they were half the size.</li>
            <li> I have always had very dark circles around my eyes - especially under eyes.  </li>
            <li> , my face also is better - just not as noticeable as my chest as it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I was not able to use the product for long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> Caution, you only need to use a small amount because the consistency of this serum goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Most moisturizers drive me crazy because the feel of anything heavy or oily makes me want to claw my skin off.  </li>
            <li> It glides on and seems to leave my skin soft without feeling like it is coated in anything heavy.&amp;#34; The quote was used at least twice on this Amazon platform.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend putting the moisturizer on while the serum is still wet.</li>
            <li> It arrived  as expected.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> My mom tried this stuff, and a few days later she asked me to buy her another</li>
            <li> After few weeks of using it, you will actually see the results.</li>
            <li> Is is brighter, my pores appear smaller, my skin feels tighter, and the uneven blotchy spots are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost everyday since I bought it several weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> the results are not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Of course after only a few days, I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-aging benefits yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turning 40 this year and this stuff has taken a few years off my face after only a couple of weeks of use!</li>
            <li> I think though, that it causes you to sunburn faster if you don&#x27;t wear sunblock, be careful.</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks and this stuff is already showing results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It really works and I think my skin is addicted to it now.</li>
            <li> I asked my friend about it, and she explained the science behind the Korean obsession with serums and night creams, toning and the whole skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few compliments since starting using the Anti-Aging Skin serum.  </li>
            <li> bottle (sorry I need to find the name) and that one eliminated my smile wrinkles around my mouth</li>
            <li> And that was only one week using it everyday</li>
            <li> Money well spent plus you get 20z vs.1.0z</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> i added a few tiny drops of this before putting on my eye shadow and it never moved all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days</li>
            <li> I never really had acne as a teenager but something happened after I had my baby.</li>
            <li> Now I always leave my face wet and apply</li>
            <li> and it has a faint fresh scent.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles quite yet, my skin tone was starting to become uneven and splotchy.</li>
            <li> I like the way my face feels, but I have not really noticed a change in the crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I have spent  hundreds of dollars on serums and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> Well, it just happened that I had a hair appointment  a few days later.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible without the help of a dermatologist/ full-strength harsh medication.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid along with a blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C, jojoba oil, and green tea to give your skin premium hydration and benefits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious to see the results after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I have tried it for two weeks now, and plan to buy another one before my bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be 50 in a few months and just recently someone asked me if my daughter and I were sisters - given that type of feedback, I&#x27;ll keep using this!</li>
            <li> It left my skin hydrated, brightened, and firm.</li>
            <li> Yes It is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Since receiving this serum several weeks ago, I have been using it morning and night everyday.  </li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients include: Deionized Water,Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Methylsulfonylmethane, Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamin C, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Vitamin E, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin</li>
            <li> Not much scent</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this serum with 2 drops of Argan Oil by the same company, at night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product for a few weeks before actually posting this review.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even know your missing back into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide variety of hyaluronic and vitamin c serums over the course of the last few years, always looking for the fountain of youth (who is not?).  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the scent.</li>
            <li> It applies as a thick, cooling gel which has not bothered my ultra sensitive skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> I wish this product came in larger sizes although a little goes a long way - I am using it on my hands and an area on my arm that has slight dermatitis so says my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Anti-inflammatory and/or astringent properties - skin repair properties for: bringing down  redness, swelling and stinging,&lt;br /&gt;Eczema, acne, psoriasis, minor bacterial infections, cuts, and sunburn</li>
            <li> Anti-inflammatory and/or astringent properties - skin repair properties for: bringing down  redness, swelling and stinging,&lt;br /&gt;Eczema, acne, psoriasis, minor bacterial infections, cuts, and sunburn</li>
            <li> This serum is not very expensive compared with those sold behind cosmetic counters so since it works, I have no desire to shop around.  </li>
            <li> More expensive does not always mean better.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Still in debate with myself over if I like it or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having used this product for very long I am not sure what the final results are going to be.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, and I have noticed slight fading of some dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I mean this serum is made by Insta Natural</li>
            <li> Up until this, I&#x27;d only ever used plain Vitamin C Serums.</li>
            <li> If the outside atmosphere is dry, then the serum can feel a bit dry because it sucks the moisture from inside your body instead.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and luckily no redness or negative reaction to the serum.  </li>
            <li> have to say that my combination skin has felt less greasy in the T-zone, and less dry on my cheeks and chin, my hormonal acne from my cycle has lessened, and overall, my skin looks and feels less fatigued.</li>
            <li> My T-Zone is noticeably less oily and my dry zone is noticeably less dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is less blotchy and dry.</li>
            <li> After years of having horses and being in the weather, cold or hot, rain or shine, my skin is definitely damaged and wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It lasted quite a long time since you use so little.</li>
            <li> I will go back to using a previously purchased brand, as this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but my face felt dry and tight after using it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel dry and tight.</li>
            <li> As other reviews indicate, it takes very little to cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> You may have read some of my other reviews about beauty products.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used alone or with other oils/serums.</li>
            <li> Usually when I put hyaluronic acid on, then put my face cream on, I can actually feel a stretching sensation which I assume is my skin &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Only using it a few days and can already see results!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this about every other day with no issues or irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> I would like to try their other products soon.</li>
            <li> All the other serums I&#x27;ve tried show up when I layer foundation but not this brand.</li>
            <li> other than that, I truly have no objections to the product.</li>
            <li> It does take the place of cream maybe, but that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s done for me other</li>
            <li> and before I put on any other cream.  </li>
            <li> It did not magically make me look younger.  </li>
            <li> the small red spot that have started appearing on my arms and torso are going away.</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t too puffy, but I get that from other products as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other products of this nature, this one came in a 2-oz.</li>
            <li> I was not compensated in any other way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum due to reviews.</li>
            <li> (You pick the age promised by the other products).</li>
            <li> I usually put on enough Vitamin C that my skin has soaked it all up and is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;, then I put this on until my skin feels &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; - then I wait 10 minutes before putting on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past from a different company.</li>
            <li> other thing that bears mentioning: this isn&#x27;t tested on animals and none of the ingredients are derived from animals.</li>
            <li> It is used in eye surgery and to treat arthritis among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a small drop and it covers my entire face.</li>
            <li> Layer vitamin c and other anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> Got a sunburn on my arms and legs which peeled but not my face which I think was due to this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how careful you are but pulling the eye dropper in and out gets messy and you waste serum getting on all sides when you screw it back on.  </li>
            <li> I told her about this serum and then noticed other clients and stylist were listening to me.  </li>
            <li> After using this for 3 weeks, I’m not sure if it’s actually done anything for me.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for the past month for different reasons</li>
            <li> With my layering approach, I often combine a generous amount of the serum with another serum, and always on skin already wet (want to give all those HA molecules something to hold on to!)  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that claim to remove sun spots.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily yet dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> but I would hope that the packaging would take care of any extreme temperatures.</li>
            <li> and I usually apply a primer prior to its application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years, but I like to read and see how other people use</li>
            <li> I will stay with this brand over my other brand since it works just as well</li>
            <li> Use it every other day just for preventive purposes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic acid works just as well as any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is not so sticky as some other HA products.</li>
            <li> probably due ot the witch hazel).</li>
            <li> I decreasing on my skin is extremely moisturize</li>
            <li> and as always, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product on a regular basis, yet, and I&#x27;m not sure what it is supposed to do, thus the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I end up trying to get some out but end up only with a small amount and then having to grab the remails off the dropper to use.</li>
            <li> It is not a huge difference as, again, I haven&#x27;t used it for long</li>
            <li> The puffiness around and under my eyes is very minimal and I am even applying eye make-up again.  </li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients I noticed that it contained witch hazel, glycerin (which can be drying at low dew points), and very few oils.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate that it&#x27;s free of nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> The bottle is packed with active ingredients.</li>
            <li> (allow it to dry for a few minutes while brushing my teeth) and then apply a moisturizer, preferably one with retinol before bed.</li>
            <li> It is thick so a lot goes a long way, you only need a little to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I was worried as I have very sensitive skin, but I have not experienced any problems.  </li>
            <li> This product may be &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down a bit compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks and face broke out a little after 2 weeks and steadily got worse.</li>
            <li> It is certainly hydrating, but what I failed to realize is that one of the ingredients is carrageenan, which if ingested orally is a known inflammant in the body.</li>
            <li> My face used to be dull and dry, but recently I&#x27;ve been having less break outs, less acne and less scarring.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is the preference of some since the thicker serum was a little harder to dispense...</li>
            <li> I expected something a little heavier on my face as it says it&#x27;s a serum.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to put a little on</li>
            <li> I am not very successful with the dropper, so I just use the serum that is on the outside of the dropper when I pull in out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> There’s no real strong smell either,</li>
            <li> My acne scars from the previous weeks have faded faster than expected (yay for Vit C!)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who hardly notices when I cut my hair, had told me multiple times</li>
            <li> it actually instantly brightens up my complexion which I still have a hard time believing.</li>
            <li> The only reason I dropped a star for the product is because of ease of use of the dropper; I found it a bit hard to draw the serum into the pipette and it tended to goop up the mouth of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have  used this product daily for the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.  </li>
            <li> So Ill use the whole bottle and write another review.</li>
            <li> A small amout goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have puffy dark eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> My skin tone on my face is smoothing out with some lightening of dark spots on cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not patient and want faster fading of the dark spots, so will try another product to help with that.  </li>
            <li> Also has helped those dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> During this dark period I also went on vacation to two sunny destinations which caused a lot of hyper pigmentation on my face (area</li>
            <li> I wore a hat and sunscreen religiously but the reflection of the sun from the water and wind burnt my delicate and injured skin.  </li>
            <li> This product brighten the dark patches around the sinus area.</li>
            <li> However, I have not noticed a change in my dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> , I have dark spots and this are getting lighter day by day.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for at least 2 months now and I have seen improvement in my red splotches on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> But admittedly I fail to use as much as I should.</li>
            <li> Honestly do not worth $$.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> and I swear I look at least ten years</li>
            <li> Have noticed some improvement for the puffiness &amp; dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After applying it religiously to dark (brown) spots on my face and hands twice a day for three months I have noticed no change in their appearance.</li>
            <li> This serum seems to eliminate the dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Needless to say if you haven&#x27;t gathered by now, I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Help get rid of dark spots and skin dicoloration.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t make a final decision on it until I try it for at least another week.</li>
            <li> It is non irritating, also, which is a plus since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d wondered if it&#x27;d be annoying to use, but it sure isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I cant tell you how much I hate putting my makeup on top a serum and finding that it will roll off or pill off as I&#x27;m applying it.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any allergic or sensitivity-type reactions (I do have sensitive</li>
            <li> Improvement was slow but definitely noticeable once I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> The entire bottle was shattered, and the liquid was thick and gooey.</li>
            <li> I like the semi thick texture, and I like when you apply it you can actually feel your skin tighten just a bit.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is apply a thin film to experience its soft and soothing benefits.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to make my skin tight after reading other reviews of the dryness</li>
            <li> It seems watered down.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any results even down to the&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li> I noticed the puffiness around my eyelids has gone down</li>
            <li> After a week,  i was driving and the sun was beating down on my hand</li>
            <li> I will be trying other InstaNatural products from now on!</li>
            <li> This product has improved the texture and moisture level of my skin immensely over the past two weeks!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> It also seems to make the dark circles under my eyes less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I used to wake up to flakey, dry, patchy skin, but no more after using this serum.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of product for a very little bit of money, and a little of it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is a little runny.  </li>
            <li> few man-made chemicals compared to other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It has defintely plumped up my skin and made my wrinkles less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Odd smell to product.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a slight difference in about a week.</li>
            <li> If it works at all it is a better deal for the money than the big department store make up counter name brands that contain all kinds of nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> but they do appear less defined.</li>
            <li> I am elderly and have lots of wrinkles but seems they are softer and less noticable.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles seem to be getting less noticeable and acne scars are not as  severe as before.</li>
            <li> Now I do not look like I have two black eyes.</li>
            <li> Lines around my eyes and forehead are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My winkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> No more dry, flaky patches!</li>
            <li> seen results in less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased and used two bottles of another product this company made.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;m seeing less of them.</li>
            <li> have been using this about twice a day for a week and a half now.</li>
            <li> I see a slight differ already.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be working well, my skin feel less dehydrated and softer.</li>
            <li> is an addendum to my previous review.</li>
            <li> Tightened skin, less wrinkles</li>
            <li> so her initial thoughts are that &amp;#34; it seems to work&amp;#34; in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> so my skin feels less irritated.</li>
            <li> Another concern prior to using this product was my sensitive skin, I was afraid I would breakout or irritate my skin,</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredient list with a brand I previously reviewed and</li>
            <li> received this bottle, and it was leaked slightly.</li>
            <li> “I do not notice any freckles or black spot on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is a gel serum rather than the usual watery type that is harder to apply as it runs down the face.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any woman, or even man who has struggled with dry skin, dark spots or even just dull skin.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a little sketched out by any products with such a lengthy, claim-filled headline; however, I see that is the going trend for all serum sellers on Amazon (Though seriously, who started that, and when can it stop??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This year, my mid-50&#x27;s struck (hard) and it was time to call in a SWAT team of potions, facial exercises and makeup so as not to frighten small children when walking down the street.  </li>
            <li> I first heard of this product on Instagram &amp; it sounded like something I was in desperate need for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick shipping, well packaged and tightly sealed.</li>
            <li> It smooths out wrinkles, but does not make your skin feel unnaturally tight.</li>
            <li> Takes about a week of use before looking in the mirror and realizing your skin has lost that dull dry look,  and in that moment of &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to using, my skin was dull, a combination of oily with flaking dry areas along my skin and nose.</li>
            <li> where my frown lines no longer feels heavy and a little less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> They are very professional and stand behind their products and customer satisfaction!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for a little over a month and increased my vitamin C supplements also.</li>
            <li> But I want to  try this a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit is all it takes to do my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> Seems to help a little with the redness.</li>
            <li> My skin feels a little firmer &amp; smoother.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day for a little while.  </li>
            <li> than make me break out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> He has been using proactive for awhile with little results and w in 2 wks of using your product</li>
            <li> I think the formula has changed a little.</li>
            <li> I find this serum takes a little longer to absorb on my skin than other serums I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not write negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed Witch Hazel, an astringent, which made me think it would be a little drying</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a little thicker or richer texture.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling a little tighter after applying.</li>
            <li> It takes just a little to cover your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 a day along with the vitamin C concentrate and can see a decrease in the little lunes around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems to plump up the skin to diminish the look of my little lines</li>
            <li> Came in  one of those boxes that they use for books and a little bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I let this sink it and dry, then apply the eye gel all over, and my usually makeup routine!</li>
            <li> I have a bit of discoloration on my face due to hormonal imbalances, and dark circles underneath my eyes that has slowly cleared up with the aid of this serum.</li>
            <li> When I scar, acne or otherwise they are very dark and hyperpigmented.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical before purchasing it, but it has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use every day since is very thick, heavy and deeply hydrates.</li>
            <li> After a reasonable period of time using the serum as suggested, the results are disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it helps the dead skin cells peel off when I rub my face alone</li>
            <li> a harsh climate.</li>
            <li> I have a few brown spots-freckles enlarging (</li>
            <li> i have started seeing improvement its just a few days</li>
            <li> What will the results be like after a few months?????  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product just a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and after a week I think I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have gotten quite a few comments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I got it everyday</li>
            <li> I think my face actually looks worse since I started using this, so I&#x27;m sticking to my reliable coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Plan to keep using it until I think it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ll fill in the missing &amp;#34;AWESOME!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dried out anymore</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Maybe a few weeks</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I do like that it is not quite as harsh as others, I&#x27;m assuming because of the aloe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After a few applications skin looks damage, fried</li>
            <li> I started using product within a few days</li>
            <li> but they sent me another bottle, I been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> I was not fortunate.</li>
            <li> After a few days use, I got use to the amount I needed and this was no longer an</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fading out dark spots and for some reason I noticed the small skin tags on my neck are shrinking</li>
            <li> This product contains Vitamin C and E, green tea and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, there was a noticeable difference between my two hands.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks...</li>
            <li> I have been.this serum faithfully for a few weeks now and tracking my reviews.</li>
            <li> I like this aspect, because heavy products can pile up until you can scrape them off and ruin your makeup if you have to scratch your face at any time during the day.  </li>
            <li> This serum has become the heavy hitter in my arsenal.  </li>
            <li> On the cover on the front of the bottle it mentioned Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Perks of a product with Vitamin C and green tea?</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on my face for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any changes already and use it everyday</li>
            <li> Is&#x27;nt Harsh</li>
            <li> It has vitamin C, green tea, jojoba oil, aloe, witch hazel, and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also contains Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jajoba oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, I now trust it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> yet l write another review in a few weeks</li>
            <li> but some actually look worse not that I&#x27;m saying this product is at fault, just that it&#x27;s not helping.</li>
            <li> I do want to see if over time it reduces my pores and smooths the few wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I received the Instanatural Hyaluronic Serum a few weeks ago, and started using it immediately since I had run out of the WattsBeauty 100% Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> product contains Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jojoba Oil.  </li>
            <li> When I started applying this serum to my face a few times a day (I even kept it in the frig)</li>
            <li> I use a collagen moisturizer and don&#x27;t have any wrinkle on my face to start with, so I had hoped for the skin to firm up somewhat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day for a few wks.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> however, I have spent quite a few years smoking clove cigarettes, which I&#x27;m not very proud to admit.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it at night and sometimes during the day when I know I am going to be outside for a longer period of time, especially when it is really cold and/or windy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: Not a strong perfume fragrance.</li>
            <li> Maybe just the slightest lightening of some sun spots but very slight..</li>
            <li> (I get dry skin from walking my dog outside in the cold.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would use it everyday</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have barely seen any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated, but not weighed down and icky.  </li>
            <li> In comparing my usual HA serum, and InstaNaturals HA, I found that the InstraNaturals serum was just a little thinner substance than my usual HA serum.  </li>
            <li> It just smells odd to me, it&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where I live, it gets really cold in the winter</li>
            <li> Comparing it to Oz Naturals, this serum is half as thick.</li>
            <li> oz., which is less expensive than any other skin-care line at even half</li>
            <li> I certainly did not anticipate a bad reaction but no one can predict that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It has very little scent</li>
            <li> However, this product has done very little or perhaps nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> No more saggy skin around the eye area and my eyes look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed within two weeks that my small wrinkles by my eyes are fading away.</li>
            <li> Not sure of any results yet.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a few of their products lately</li>
            <li> At night I usually use grape seed oil or coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Been using it every morning for the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products in the past that contains Hyaluronic Acid in a mask version before but never tried it in a serum form.  </li>
            <li> The price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> My face and neck skin soak this up like a sponge &amp; small lines &amp; wrinkles tend to diminish or disappear almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet...</li>
            <li> I usually am worried about products causing my oiliness to increase, but this product does NOT cause that problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really sure what all the hype in the reviews is about.</li>
            <li> After the serum dries you can put your makeup on as usual.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my face and applied small amounts of the serum on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It was probably not able to improve without the nutrients it was lacking.  </li>
            <li> I feel a small amount of tightening as it dries on my skin</li>
            <li> Just like in the past my skin got drier</li>
            <li> Not at the expense of multiple angry pustules 2 days after using it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if you should wear it during day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my skin is softer and no more oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the quality.</li>
            <li> but I kept up the routine as usual.  </li>
            <li> bottle rather than the usual l oz.&lt;br /&gt;4) &amp;#34;MANUFACTURER</li>
            <li> My skin feels much more hydrated since using this product, even with the nasty winter weather rolling in!</li>
            <li> No more pores.</li>
            <li> Small scars seem to be fading and getting smoother.</li>
            <li> are in  small increments .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to see the long-term results</li>
            <li> I usually use the Neutrogena acne control lotion during the day, but kept forgetting to put it in after my hyaluronic acid &amp; then to my surprise</li>
            <li> This not only made us physically ill, but caused severe heat rash.  </li>
            <li> The serum is thick, you need just a few drops.</li>
            <li> so I usually avoid putting product on my face</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and seems to be improving the ugly dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing is creating new problems trying to correct old ones.</li>
            <li> This serum dried my skin out like unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> It is also very thick compared to other Hylauronic products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a little on the thick side (though not as thick as the Oz Naturals stuff), it does stick to the exterior of the eye dropper.</li>
            <li> Came back exhausted from an 8-day camping trip with sunburn face on 7/6 - dark circles and spots under eyes appeared like - angrily.</li>
            <li> Since I had badly abused my skin and was over 75, my expectations were low; however, the cost was minimal.  </li>
            <li> With continued use, this product has erased my dark spots and broken capillaries and leaves my skin looking plump and radiant.</li>
            <li> My skin looks less tired looking</li>
            <li> I use it after washing, applying a thin layer in my &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone and the results are less oiliness as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> I often have a hard time with what gifts to give her.</li>
            <li> Instead, it looks dull and doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a putrid smell to it that I have a hard time wanting to use this.</li>
            <li> The winter weather has been really hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it was looking dull and no glow at all.</li>
            <li> Now after 2 weeks, the crow&#x27;s feet are hardly visible.</li>
            <li> because of lack of sleep my complexion has been really dull and almost grayish.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin</li>
            <li> I sadley would not recommend this..had high hopes and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> bad for a sixty year old woman</li>
            <li> In the month I used this I have actually developed bad creases on my forehead that I have never had before.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since this summer.)  </li>
            <li> I bet everyone got at least 2 or 3 bottles in her vanity table.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not know where all these raving reviews that I read are coming from unless I somehow received a defective bottle.  </li>
            <li> I feel that they are not honest.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to get my glow back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been out in the sun lately and at a pool with chlorine.</li>
            <li> If I had to say a negative about it....</li>
            <li> I work outside and get dirty</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The serum is really thick-</li>
            <li> Thick substance</li>
            <li> This serum is thick unlike others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The serum is too thick to go through the dropper provided.  </li>
            <li> Non sticky and not to thick</li>
            <li> but i prefer something that is not so thick; however when you apply it is is quite liquid??</li>
            <li> The serum wasn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it was.  </li>
            <li> and i thick</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slightly thick and takes a moment to rub in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick, you can&#x27;t get any into the dropper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or too thick.</li>
            <li> It is too thick for the dropper.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little inconvenient other than that</li>
            <li> No more breakouts!</li>
            <li> First it dried out my face and then gave it a horrible rash on my nose and cheecks that coused peeling, and my eyes got swolen</li>
            <li> The dropper method is a little annoying because this product is so thick, but honestly it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Just one complaint is that it&#x27;s too thick and that too in a narrow mouth bottle which makes getting the gel out difficult.</li>
            <li> I use a very small quantity before my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I usually mix it with fractionated coconut oil to thin it out a bit.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed subtle improvements in my skin tone, pores and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You could say it&#x27;s serious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Haluronic Acid, but I seem to the only one having a terrible time with accessing this one by the dropper.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m 40 Hyaluronic acid serum is a serious part of my anti-aging regimen.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about maintaining your youth, then this product is a must have.</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird</li>
            <li> I am sorry to inform the company, but, this serum actually dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> My laugh lines are seriously reduced!!!!!</li>
            <li> I suspect it was used to thin it out to make it less expensive and to preserve it.  </li>
            <li> my skin was dull!</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 late I have none!</li>
            <li> Ive tried several Instanatural products and I havent been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> First of all the packaging for this product was the worst I&#x27;ve seen from Amazon.</li>
            <li> To try to get it out of the bottle is an issue, as it tooo THICK!  </li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized for so very little Hyaluronic AcidSerum!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> I used a little extra one the worst areas and am please.  </li>
            <li> It was too harsh for my skin and made my face red and puffy and my skin look absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Using it during the day, my skin looked worse than without it.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on InstaNatural for my skin care now, if you read the ingredients you will see they don&#x27;t include any unnecessary ingredients like fragrance inside.</li>
            <li> however I have not experienced this.  </li>
            <li> I guess women are never happy with beauty products.</li>
            <li> The droper inside was broken</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin, has no scent</li>
            <li> It is non irritating and seems to be hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> and It get worse.</li>
            <li> But alas, I found something that works.</li>
            <li> The product arrives in a flimsy, thin cardboard package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never put anything that caustic on my face.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> too thin this seum is not moisturizing at all  </li>
            <li> The company stands behind its products.  </li>
            <li> and I stand behind its claim that it reduces discoloration</li>
            <li> If you are not completely happy with your purchase, just contact them for a refund - no questions asked.</li>
            <li> This serum has a thin gel like quality to it.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is thin and milky opaque.</li>
            <li> And during the summer, it&#x27;s even worse.  </li>
            <li> always I looked soo tired since I use the serum</li>
            <li> The seal and cap were broken when I received it</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a month to see how it works over time, and I see it smoothing out my wrinkles, plumping up my once aging, tired skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for approximately 2 - 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Seriously, i am hooked!  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product was not good.</li>
            <li> and it has made a dramatic difference</li>
            <li> Just a week after using the Vit C serum, I could see dramatic changes in my skin colour, tone, and texture.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product, I&#x27;ve not seen any difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using this, although I am still using it.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed I will continue thank you</li>
            <li> Buy it every month to every other month!!!!!!</li>
            <li> : I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Never ever in my life i had such a horrible reaction on a beauty product!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the serum did not work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> Difficult to get out of the bottle, I haven&#x27;t found any improvements in my skin........</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum is questionable and when I put it on my face</li>
            <li> I think all the reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people tell me I look tired!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness under my eyes at all</li>
            <li> This product made me break out worse than when i was a teenager!</li>
            <li> sorry,</li>
            <li> I feel weird...</li>
            <li> Ill let you all know how that goes.</li>
            <li> Skin-care products are expensive, and sometimes I need to budget, but without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> Skin-care products are expensive, and sometimes I need to budget, but without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not</li>
            <li> Needless to say no one can stop an untiward reaction to a product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Sorry  this  hyaluronic  acid  serum  </li>
            <li> however I do find that it is a bit difficult to get it sucked up by the stopper at times, having to &amp;#34;re-dip&amp;#34; to get the serum into the littel stopper.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all those hardships have shown on my mom&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> product does not have heavy feel/oil base.</li>
            <li> Am sad about this cause it broke before I even used it.</li>
            <li> This is fake stuff does nothing for the face.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 2oz bottle of Insta Natural Hyaluronic serum and it smells nasty, like it has gone bad, even though the bottle was sealed on arrival, with plastic wrap on the cap.</li>
            <li> I am seeing dramatic results on the elbows with lightening!  </li>
            <li> I use in on my face and hands at least twice a day... as a make up base</li>
            <li> i had really hard times not to scratch them!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face brake out, it has a very thick consistency, not for me:(,</li>
            <li> made me breakout like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been caressing my face like a crazy person ever since.</li>
            <li> I also use argon oil (cold pressed) with this serum.</li>
            <li> then my skin is all dry and flaky and my makeup looks AWFUL! :(</li>
            <li> I am done with the expensive brands purchased elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I have used very expensive products.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m on Coumadin &amp; it breaks me out sooo bad</li>
            <li> /nothing on my skin or my face react a bad way</li>
            <li> It got so bad</li>
            <li> or so I got a bad rash all over my face</li>
            <li> But It Didn&#x27;t Smell Bad</li>
            <li> This serum isn&#x27;t bad....</li>
            <li> but I do understand why some people get frustrated about it.</li>
            <li> I have been getting so discouraged and frustrated.</li>
            <li> had to throw it away couldnt get over the smell :(</li>
            <li> my money on another product&amp;#34; and was truly disappointed,</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> until I began using this.  :(</li>
            <li> but again I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cost a stupid amount of money.</li>
            <li> Stupid me</li>
            <li> Hate the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this product has been worthless.</li>
            <li> This stuff has my face breaking out so bad!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> All in all for the quality and price you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Consistency is just awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved it was send professional.</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars because since the first moment I started using this Hialuronic Acid Serum I saw a bug change in my face. My skin looks glowing and is so smooth. I definetly recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Great hyaluronic serum</li>
            <li> My pores are dramatically smaller. Skin tone evening out! This is one great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for 2 months and it does work.  Very nice product and I am buying 2 more,</li>
            <li> I love this hyaluronic acid serum!  I put it on after my Super C serum and it feels super moisturizing and penetrates fast.  I do have a slight tacky feel to my skin after applying these products but that is resolved once I put on my face sun screen as a finishing step in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 weeks.  It absorbs nicely and has a slight tightening effect.  I notice less blotchiness and have ordered a second bottle.  I use an olive oil serum on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been exceedingly pleased with this serum. It goes on smoothly and dries in just a few minutes. When I apply moisturizer over it, my skin immediately feels softer and smoother and the results seem to last for quite a long time. This is the first of this type of product I&#x27;ve used and it&#x27;s already become an important part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is by far one of my favorite skin care companies.  I have tried a lot of their products so I was really happy when they sent me this serum to test out for my blog, GlamRiver.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love the packaging, the blue bottle is really pretty!  The serum itself is light, not sticky at all and quickly absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling soft, smooth and well hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already know you should always apply serums first before anything else.  So I still apply my daily moisturizer over this since it has an SPF in it but the Hyaluronic Acid Serum absorbs so well it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have a ton of product on.&lt;br /&gt;I have been applying the serum on my face, neck &amp; decollete and it has helped reduce the appearance of my fine lines, and also helped the dark circles under my eyes less noticeable.  Of course, it also helped my skin stay hydrated as well!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Still in debate with myself over if I like it or&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having used this product for very long I am not sure what the final results are going to be.  I am cautiously optimistic and like the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping, well packaged and tightly sealed.</li>
            <li> Only have had it a short time, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  Feels nice and clean going on...good product</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is a good gentle product with no scent. Has kept my skin soft. Not a significant notice of wrinkle reduction, but enough for me to keep using.</li>
            <li> I see no difference but I have only been using it for a month.  I will continue using it for two more months&lt;br /&gt;and let you know the results.  I would like to know if you have something for the neck that can reduce the&lt;br /&gt;lines.  Yours truly,  J. G.</li>
            <li> I was so positevely impressed about this product.  As soon as I tried it on, my skin immediatly got smoother and my wrinkles faded away. My skin was glowing. I used it together with the gel eyes which helped the area to be firmer.My skin feels fresh and tight. No more saggy skin around the eye area and my eyes look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy these products for my brother as well. I m sure he will be happy as much as I am.</li>
            <li> Nice product, absorbs well and definitely makes your skin look and feel nicer.  I personally have had slightly better results with another hyaluronic/vitamin c product but would use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face and hands with better results on my face.  However I have been pretty rough on my hands over 58 years and one can expect only so much improvement.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for a few weeks so I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of my facial lines but it does leave my skin very soft so I will be ordering more!  Will update after using second bottle if I see any difference in the appearance of my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Bottle update- second time ordering this and the product is not the same.  This time it&#x27;s much thicker and very sticky on the face and hands...not happy and will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Insta Natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum without a clue as to what &amp;#34;hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; even was. But as someone who is 44 and trying to avoid the signs of age, I&#x27;m open to learning about new beauty products. You may have read some of my other reviews about beauty products. I&#x27;m always cautious about trying out new creams, serums and lotions because of my sensitive skin. This one was no different - I was leery. Probably even more-so since the title contains the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34;. Sensitive skin... acid... doesn&#x27;t sound like a good combination to me. The idea of putting anything title &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; on my face kind of freaked me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity: I was wrong. It wasn&#x27;t a problem at all. I used the product without any reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Uses essential oils, aloe and witch hazel among other ingredients. It&#x27;s a vegan product, cruelty-free and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Not a strong perfume fragrance. To me, it was a cross between a lemon/citrus and witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture: It&#x27;s thick but applies easily and evenly. Only a small amount is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: My face felt refreshed after using this serum. I use a variety of products so I can&#x27;t attest to long-term effectiveness of just this one but I definitely noticed that this helped with my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in a vegan, cruelty-free product, there are limited choices available. This one is definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> I love this .. mixed with the vitamin c..I Am really starting to see results..</li>
            <li> Love this product! My skin feels and looks much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I noticed within two weeks that my small wrinkles by my eyes are fading away. I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin seems smoother</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving all the the products in this line a try... So far I am extremely happy.... It&#x27;s the same quality product as $150 bottle items for a tenth of the price... I will continue too purchase</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it appears to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks, my wife is very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wwb</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference but I have only been using it for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and love it.  It has defintely plumped up my skin and made my wrinkles less noticeable.  I have rosacea and was really worried that it would make it flare up.  I&#x27;m pleased to say that I&#x27;ve had no issues.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product, after using it for a few weeks. Although I definitely need to use moisturizer after I use this (before bed, after washing my face), the product is very gentle. I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference with fine lines, but I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used the product long enough to be able to see much in the way of results there. That said, this is definitely a very competitively priced, compared to other products with similar ingredients, and I love InstaNatural as a company. I will continue to use this product for several more weeks (on my face and upper neck) and continue to monitor the results.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I mix it with vitamin c moisturizer  my fine lines around my eyes look plump  pulse it helps the dead skin cells peel off when I rub my face alone the jaw line, the lines around my neck looks plump I will use  it for 3months  I will be ready for my Photo shot</li>
            <li> An absolutely fabulous product!! I now use InstaNatural Facial oil cleanser, the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Night Cream. These 3 products have literally changed the look, feel, and condition of my skin. The difference in my skin now is truly miraculous!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and a very good value for the price. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have an opinion on results but I&#x27;m pleased at how many good ingredients are in this product.</li>
            <li> An amazing product, your skin really apreciated this product</li>
            <li> Makes me feel wonderful soft!</li>
            <li> Works well; feel good!</li>
            <li> I use this serum at night, putting it on before I put my Insta Naturals Vitamin C Moisturizer on. This is absolutely wonderful! My skin is soft and smooth when I wake in the mornings and there has been a huge improvement in skin tone. I truly feel everyone should try this line of skin products. I recommend putting the moisturizer on while the serum is still wet.</li>
            <li> This serum is very light, fast absorbing. Has a very light smell, like roses or peonies. It&#x27;s not overbearing, very pleasant and light. It is absorbed by the skin very fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. My skin feels very hydrated, smooth and toned after a few weeks of using it. I highly recommend this serum and other products by this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not sure of any results yet.  But I enjoy trying this product to see what may become of it.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this serum!!,it goes on smoothly,absorbs real fast and a little goes a long way.At first I bought just for myself but since it makes my skin look so much better i.e smoother,brighter,my whole family( including my son and brother in law)is using this serum now.Thank you Instanatural!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with my purchase. I have two wrinkles below my mouth by my chin and so far I have not seen even a little result. I use it faithfully every day. I am always buying stuff but have not come across any help. It&#x27;s just the two lines that I want to get rid of but no results.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  It has produced a noticeable improvement in skin quality.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It doesn&#x27;t create a film, can be worn under makeup and is hydrating.  It&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product.  It helps to smooth and tighten a few of the wrinkles on my face.  I like the way it make my skin feel firmer.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase, and will reorder when necessary.  It arrived  as expected.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a short time but so far I really like it. It goes on very smoothly and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about two weeks. I have to say I do think it helps my 65 year old skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face seems slightly more youthful and definitely softer to me, and my skin is definitely worn from being a professional gardener&lt;br /&gt;in a harsh climate.</li>
            <li> I have  used this product daily for the past few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.  I would not reorder.  I since have purchased Obagi products and hopefully will see some improvement iny skin tone.</li>
            <li> i like it. easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hydrating but not as much as I would like .Great price for serum .</li>
            <li> love the moisture in my skin</li>
            <li> Very moisture, would purchase it again</li>
            <li> The serums are awesome .. A most under the creams they make your face look so good and full expression lines in 2 weeks and I can see a big difference</li>
            <li> great quality, very gentle on skin and helps even out my skin tone</li>
            <li> this is a great product. my skin feels smooth, clean and hydrated after using this. U use it before putting my face foundation. I let it dry and it protects my skin very good. it lasts a long time. I use it at night and in the morning. I love it! I&#x27;m buying it again,</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of results I was expecting but my face seems brighter and my skin is free of most blemishes.  I ordered this product and 2 others from this company and I am happy with the results so far altho I really don&#x27;t know what I was expecting to happen.  If you can give me some insight into what I should be expecting as far as results that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;Frankie Ware</li>
            <li> First it dried out my face and then gave it a horrible rash on my nose and cheecks that coused peeling, and my eyes got swolen i had really hard times not to scratch them!!! I had to visit a doctor. I wish to get a refund and 175$ for doctor visit and also 30$ worth of medication.  Never ever in my life i had such a horrible reaction on a beauty product!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent serum it helps to keep my skin smooth and also helps to exfoliate as well. Don&#x27;t be alarmed if you have some peeling skin the serum is just doing its job. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use Hyaluronic Acid Serum morning and night. This bottle is twice as much as I use to purchase and about the same price. When I was waiting in a skin doctor&#x27;s office and I overheard the nurse telling a customer &amp;#34;do not use cream that hydrates you skin on your face - use this&amp;#34; I went over later and looked at the ingredients and it had Hyaluronic Acid in it. Guess I have been doing it right!</li>
            <li> So far, so good, use it under moisturizer to help with dryness.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin soft.</li>
            <li> First thing this is a great combination. Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C told is a mixture that camt be beat. I was pleased with the lines becoming softer looking and less defined. I cant believe that my skin is starting to glow. I must face the face that I need all the help I can get. This is giving me the help I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to review and these are my thoughts and mine only</li>
            <li> Love this product - goes on smoothly and leaves skin feeling soft.  The only thing I would change is the dropper - I can&#x27;t get the product to dispense through the dropper and just wipe the edge of the dropper on my palm and then I spread it on my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Ordering another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> bought for myself  see no difference so far</li>
            <li> i like the product but its only been 2 weeks i cant really see much defferent right now</li>
            <li> Just got this product and haven&#x27;t even used it but looks like I am going to enjoy it, can tell from the good smell as that was the first thing I checked</li>
            <li> Odd smell to product. Not sure if I would use it everyday but it is a fine product.</li>
            <li> Light weight feeling and not sticky.  That plus the reasonable price makes it a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and the way it absorbs into the skin without a residue. It is a thick, clear gel that is barely scented and lightweight. I highly recommend this face serum for moisturizing, age damage repair and fine lines.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum is similar to a moisturizer, it&#x27;s also has The great thing about the this product is that it&#x27;s a serum which is gel like and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  This is especially great for me since I have combination skin and can be very oily in some places yet still have dry spots.  Regular moisturizers tend to help the dry spots, but clog my pores in the more oily areas.  Since I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum I feel like my skin is softer and and has more of a glow to it.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been moist since using it and I don&#x27;t see as many wrinkles as I used to.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so much I bought some for my daughter!!  😃</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are legitimate. Puts moisture back in my face after using black African soap. Thank you</li>
            <li> It is certainly hydrating, but what I failed to realize is that one of the ingredients is carrageenan, which if ingested orally is a known inflammant in the body. I definitely would have avoided purchasing had I known that.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It&#x27;s reduced the lines on my face tremendously.</li>
            <li> This is so hydrating.  My skin really needed an extra boost this winter and this is perfect.  I put it on after washing my face, before my normal moisturizer and I can feel the difference when I put it on.  My face is much softer and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting more moisturizer on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  First time user.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it feels sticky after I put it on. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the argan oil, or at least you don&#x27;t feel it as much on the surface of the skin. Putting on moisturizer after the hyaluronic acid serum has absorbed into your skin is best, if you are okay with doing a 2 step process to keep your skin moisturized. It smells fine compared to other oils and such that I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free to review, but this is my honest opinion about the product.</li>
            <li> A good product. However, I now suspect the seal was broken, as the plastic wrap around the top literally fell off when I first handled it. It definitely was not a full bottle, about half full. I will go back to using a previously purchased brand, as this was a waste of money. I should have returned the bottle.</li>
            <li> using just for about a week and the result is visible, my skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum, perfect for winter skin.  I usually use it at night and sometimes during the day when I know I am going to be outside for a longer period of time, especially when it is really cold and/or windy.</li>
            <li> The best anti aging product I have used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any positive result from this and my continuing research indicates that there&#x27;s no reason to expect any. All this does is absorb water. You can put it on your skin like a cosmetic. if your ambient air is damp, it will absorb water from the air and give you a soft, hydrated layer over your skin. If your ambient air is dry, it will absorb water from your skin and make your skin dryer than without it. The latter was my experience. Using it at night, I saw no difference at all. Using it during the day, my skin looked worse than without it.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.  I love it . Big Big Big difference in the elasticity of my skin</li>
            <li> I love this product and will order it again and again.  It leaves my face soft and feeling so nice.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the delivery of this product, it even came a few days early. :) this serum is wonderfully refreshing! As soon as I applied it, it has a cooling sensation, very light sent of rose which added a nice calming effect, it doesn&#x27;t have any stickyness and as soon as it dried I was able to apply my makeup without and clumpiness, big plus!! I noticed a difference right away on my fine lines diminishing, further proof from my daughter, who I didn&#x27;t tell I was trying a new product, she asked if I had gotten Botox!!! :) all I need to hear!!! Yes I will order more!! Ps the I plan on saving the pretty colbolt blue bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Great customer service, great products. I also use the rose hip oil daily. Skin has never been better. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this brand! I have been trying a few of their products lately and I want them all! I want to try all the serums and see which I like best. This one is very nice, it goes on silky and absorbs into my skin easily. I often use this after spray the vitamin c toner, before it fully dries. I let this sink it and dry, then apply the eye gel all over, and my usually makeup routine! My skin is flawless, is glowing lately. I have very oily skin, so I love moisturizing and not dealing with greasy face during the day. My skin is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely attest that this has improved the texture and tone of my skin. It feels tighter, looks younger, and is downright glowing now! I am hooked on InstaNatural for my skin care now, if you read the ingredients you will see they don&#x27;t include any unnecessary ingredients like fragrance inside. This product has no smell, or if it does it is very light and I do not notice it, I love the dropper packaging which lets me keep the product sanitary with each use. I could see using these products on my clients!</li>
            <li> very happy with product</li>
            <li> So far so good - but would like to give it a little more time to work with the other products from your company that I purchased shortly before the serum. I am 68 years old and think I see a small &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; at work here. These products are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month now and don&#x27;t see much difference.  I am 40 and have fine lines. ...I don&#x27;t see any difference in them from using this product.  I thought this was going to make my skin tight after reading other reviews of the dryness however I have not experienced this.  I use this product and don&#x27;t need extra moisturizer.  I am currently using this as my moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is a necessity for winter! I apply this after cleansing and let it get. I then apply instanatural night moisturizer. My skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I believe this product is truly making a difference.  It&#x27;s too soon to see how much of a difference. I have very sensitive, dry skin with more wrinkles than I can count, but the serum has increased the moisture and it feels softer.  After two weeks, ordered another bottle as a back-up.  Don&#x27;t want to be without it.  Plus, can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great product ! My skin looks amazing and my friends keep asking what have I done ! I&#x27;m 54 and my skin looks 20 years younger ! I use it with topical vitamin C ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bottle, I agree, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.  (I&#x27;ve used it at least once a day since this summer.)  No thanks.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really a nice product for me, hydrate and non sticky</li>
            <li> Help improve over all appearance, I used twice a day. How to get this gel-like liquid to put on your face still is a challenge?</li>
            <li> Love the product. Not too drying for mature skin. Will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> its a very good serum!</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serum products, however I have very sensitive skin and previous products I tried burned my skin.  This product is perfect for me!  I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> It works well. Makes my skin soft and smooth to the touch. It looks great, some redness but not much. It makes my moisturizer glide on and overall my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve could see a difference in 2 weeks. Some of my fine lines under my eyes almost disappear.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but my skin seems dewier. I also haven&#x27;t gotten rashes or reactions to the product, even though my skin is fairly sensitive. It&#x27;s a mild, gentle serum. I use it with the InstaNatural Vitamin C toner. I will be trying other InstaNatural products from now on!</li>
            <li> I liked this serum and the price was generous, but given all the beneficial ingredients I really was disappointed to find it had witch hazel in a very high concentration. It&#x27;s an irritant and I had to discontinue using this. I suspect it was used to thin it out to make it less expensive and to preserve it.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> packaging is nice, great service, however i don&#x27;t feel that this product moisturizes or plumps my skin, two benefits of hyaluronic acid that are highly sought after.</li>
            <li> I think it is helping, and it has been delivered in a speedy manner when I have ordered this product.</li>
            <li> To be fair,  my wrinkles have been there long time....but I&#x27;ve only used twice a day for two weeks and there is improvement.  I used hyaluronic in oral use for arthritic pain and it works wonders, so I&#x27;m giving the serum a little more time...I think on younger skin, it would definitely be successful.  I&#x27;ll get back to you ...</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Love this but I have to use a moisturizer over it as it does dry my skin. I have noticed subtle improvements in my skin tone, pores and wrinkles. At my age you can&#x27;t expect miracles but I feel this is doing a pretty good job. I even noticed some slight improvement in the deep wrinkles I have on one side of my face. A little goes a long way. I have been using for about 2 months. The price is right also!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> As with any serum, continued use is necessary to see results. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, but I love the formula so far. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s also MUCH more affordable than the department store serum I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> I noticed difference in first 24 hours!!! Definite recommendation!</li>
            <li> my skin feels so much better after trying this product! it is a huge size bottle and definitely worth the price! I use these serums in the morning and at night with my moisturizer and i am loving the difference!!!</li>
            <li> Apparently my skin really needed this as it soaks it in so well and I have noticed a slight difference in about a week. Will be re-ordering this product.</li>
            <li> very good product and great value! looking forward to seeing long term results!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in about 10 days after using this serum faithfully morning and night. I use this in conjunction with a microneedler 3x a week and a skin brush every time I cleanse. I&#x27;ve NEVER EVER had skin this smooth with any at-home product. I usually have to get periodic facials to get this kind of smooth skin. I use this at night after cleansing and in the morning before my make up. Pores are clear and non-existent, skin is definitely more supple as well. I will be buying this again and just ordered a bottle for my mom!</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturized all day even living in a dry climate.  Love it!  I find myself looking forward to apply this serum again in the evening just because it makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks.  It feels good going on, I use it under make-up,  and moisturizer and at night alone.  I have noticed a positive difference but it&#x27;s too soon to give this a 5 star..but I&#x27;m hoping that will change!  My skin does feel better and I&#x27;ll continue using this product, the price is right, and I think it is helping.  I have a few brown spots-freckles enlarging (yes, I go yearly to my dermatologist for check-ups) and I&#x27;m in hopes this product will help over time.</li>
            <li> love the serum after using for 2 to 3 days it soft and beautiful thk u</li>
            <li> I use it under my homemade facial oil in the mornings. For the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and so far, I am happy with the product. It is too early to say if it is reducing fine lines or wrinkles, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel.&lt;br /&gt;What has impressed me the most has been the follow up from the seller to insure my satisfaction-- they seem to really care that their customers are satisfied!</li>
            <li> My mom tried this stuff, and a few days later she asked me to buy her another so she doesn&#x27;t run out. That&#x27;s a pretty big deal when it comes to getting presents for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I asked her what to write for this review, and she said she &amp;#34;love, love, love, loves it!&amp;#34; It clears up her skin and gives her a glowing complexion (she&#x27;s pushing 40). It&#x27;s great to find something that she really likes :) makes it easy to be a good daughter, haha.</li>
            <li> This natural hyaluronic serum goes on smoothly without any sticky residue, plumping the skin and leaving nice surface for your other skincare and makeup products.  After using this product for one week I have noticed that the plumping effect and my skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture levels lasts longer throughout the day.  There is no sting or burning sensation, neither any redness.  I look forward to continuing use of this product and will try others in the line from InstaNaturals!</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent and there is a definite change in the texture of my skin it is smoother . The fine lines are not so noticeable, I also use it on my neck and upper chest area.It is also cost effective you get 2 ozs. so this will last a long time,it has a pleasant non-intrusive smell</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid serum is working very well.  It definitely makes my skin feel smoother.  I will need a few weeks to see how effective it is at decreasing discolorations and balancing out my skin tone and decreasing fine lines and wrinkles.  I am happy with the results so far.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have if you want to look 10 years younger.  I used it twice because I could not believe the results.  Yes, it is true.&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid will make you look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;Thx..</li>
            <li> I like your product VERY much and have nearly used my 1st bottle.  (I intend to reorder) + I have recommended it to my daughter and to&lt;br /&gt;friends.  I love the way it quickly leaves my face soft and smooth and non-sticky or oily</li>
            <li> I really like the insta-natural products. I wash my face and apply this serum on, follow with insta-natural moisturizer, and ready for the day! Face feels great!!!</li>
            <li> THis and the use of Vitamin C serum have really started to help ease my crows feet I was getting insure about!! I will update later in use &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My skin is looking years younger!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have been using the serum for a little over a month and increased my vitamin C supplements also. There is noticeable difference in my skin texture and age spots are diminishing.  My friends have noticed and are buying the serum now. I appreciate the reasonable price so I can continue to purchase the product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> i have started seeing improvement its just a few days but i like my skin texture</li>
            <li> I love it!  I have VERY sensitive skin and I have not had any issues with this product.  I do admit that due to the gel-like consistency it can be a challenge to get it into the dropper, but I find that if I gently shake the bottle then squeeze the dropper bulb a couple of times I&#x27;m able to get enough to apply.  It dries quickly and I follow it with my favorite moisturizer.  I use this on my face, neck and even onto my chest (I&#x27;m getting old and the skin on my chest looks far worse than on my face these days).  I do add an additional moisturizer around my eyes for added benefit.  My husband said he could see a difference in my skin tone almost immediately and for a husband to notice this after all the years we&#x27;ve been married, well I say that speaks for itself.  I am very pleased with the purchase and plan to continue using this product and I&#x27;m hoping to see continued improvement in my skin over time.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I use it in conjunction with rosehip seed oil and DMAE serum and find that it works wonders. It can be used alone or with other oils/serums. I use it right after I use my derma roller and it&#x27;s definitely a plus that it has MSM and Vitamin C included in the serum! Would recommend to friends and family, thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I never tried a serum before, and the was the perfect one for my skin. My face feels a lot more hydrated!</li>
            <li> This is very good for my aging skin.  It has diminished tiny wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.  Will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Everything everyone is saying about this product has shown to be true so far.  I have only been using for TWO days and I see improvement.  My skin feels tighter and softer.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will look like in a couple weeks.  I will definitely be keeping this product as part of my daily beauty routine.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft. I put it on at night, wash my face in am then put it on afterwards and my skin feels soft. I have a deep furrow between my eyebrows and that has been lessening after using it for 2 weeks. Thanks for this product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you but having a vegan sister in law and not being vegan myself I often have a hard time with what gifts to give her. When I saw this was Vegan I thought I would give it to her as a birthday present.  She recently commented on how much she is liking it and says that her skin is tighter and the lines are smoothing out. She said she applied it at night before she goes to be and is happy with how she looks getting up in the morning.  I am not sure how many other products she uses or if there is a big market for Vegan skin care but the fact that she says she is enjoying this product is enough for me to consider buying her another if she expresses that she is almost out or that she&#x27;ll have to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> I find that my wrinkles are less apparent after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wil keep on using it!</li>
            <li> I like it. It gives a nice lift. Since I also take H A in a capsule or as a free powder, and use a derma needle thing occasionally, I can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s what. But my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> My review for this is more easily summed up with pros/cons instead of my rambling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Does seem to improve skin&#x27;s elasticity&lt;br /&gt;-Provides light moisture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Not enough moisture to combat winter dryness&lt;br /&gt;-Smells like roses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a more moisturizing/better smelling product, I recommend their Vitamin  C serum instead.</li>
            <li> So much product for the price! I love hyaluronic acid for its softening effects. The bottle is packed with active ingredients. Nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t seek out &#x27;no animal testing &#x27; products but I&#x27;m delighted to know that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I love it!! I still follw my normal skin routine daily, but this serum is a nice addition to my skin care...love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually writing this review in regard to the company InstaNatural. Unfortunately, the serum did not work for my skin. However, I do not believe it has anything to do with the quality of the product. Think I just happen to be one of those people that this type of serum does not give hydrating affects. Although it did not work for me, it&#x27;s obviously very effective for many others based on the posted reviews! :) I wanted to take the time to  comment about the excellent customer service this company has provided! Emails were sent after my purchase to check on my satisfaction with the product. They were very professional and courteous, this level of customer service is top notch. It&#x27;s great to have done business with a company who&#x27;s customers are important to them. So, I thank you so much for taking the time and your effort. ;)</li>
            <li> I love using this morning and night before my moisturizer. I feel it helps make products I use absorbs better on my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used this for quite a while and its wonderful.  Will continue to order</li>
            <li> I am applying both the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Vitiman C together.  Even though it is a short time I DO see a BIG difference in my face.  I apply it in the am and put sun block which I been using for years as a moisturizer. At night I usually use grape seed oil or coconut oil.  I been doing that for about a year.  But honestly what I am doing in the am using both products together.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!  I so wish I took a picture before and you would be able to see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the product that that I usually use, PURE Hyaluronic Acid, was out of stock. This product is OK, but it doesn&#x27;t tighten up my skin like the other hyaluronic acid does. Usually when I put hyaluronic acid on, then put my face cream on, I can actually feel a stretching sensation which I assume is my skin &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ashley, blogger and creator of It&#x27;s a PAshion (www.itsapashion.com), my mom and I share this Amazon account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Instanatural and especially this product. It makes my skin feel clean, renewed, and youthful. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks, feels good and smells good. I started from the eye gel of this brand, very nice one too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Actually I feel it makes an automatic lifting. I would sure recommend it to all my friends and Wil buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It makes my skin feel so smooth and silky.  I especially notice an improvement in my neck.  This is better than any high-priced cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This serum really works!  I was looking for something to lighten my dark spots &amp; smooth of my skin.  I found it with InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product.  It really plumped out my wrinkles.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Nice enough product.  I just don&#x27;t have high hopes of much improvement in my 63 year old facial skin with sun damage.  Maybe after a few more weeks I will see a difference.  I don&#x27;t expect a miracle in a bottle.  If it works at all it is a better deal for the money than the big department store make up counter name brands that contain all kinds of nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth after it dries, but I notice no difference in the wrinkles on my face. I use it twice a day, and was hoping for more results. I have been using it or a week now.  How long does it take?  Or does it work at all?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days now and in loving it so far. I think it&#x27;s making my skin so much smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.You can feel the softness of your skin the first use.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time and works great, no issues at all, I still have wrinkles that comes with age but the serum seems to still make my skin look nice and healthy, along with vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> Great product, will definitely be back for more. Additionally, Great seller with outstanding customer service!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and nourishing. I don&#x27;t even need any other creme to apply above it. And this Serum really reduced wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really liked the product and the smell of it as well. Just one complaint is that it&#x27;s too thick and that too in a narrow mouth bottle which makes getting the gel out difficult. They need to re-think about the bottle but overall very pleased with tthe product.</li>
            <li> Used every morning before applying moisturizer, can see improvements.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum, high quality and potent ingredients and it really does hydrate like no other!  Plus it is the best value and InstaNatural is a great company that follows up with their customers and answers all questions promptly.  I highly recommend ALL their products!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a change yet. Should my face be more hydrated.  I&#x27;m not quite sure.  But I want to  try this a little longer.  Everything seems to take longer to take effect on me.  So I will let you know by the end of the summer.  If you have a chance, please let me know what I should be looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
            <li> Very hydrating! My skin felt more smooth and looked better. Just don&#x27;t use every day since is very thick, heavy and deeply hydrates.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was double the amount and was a better deal compared to a similar item I&#x27;d purchased in the past.  Honestly, I cannot tell a difference when using this product or not.  It seems watered down.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Makes pores smaller and seems to be diminishing the brown spots!  Only using it a few days and can already see results!  What will the results be like after a few months?????  Wow!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.....I sell a well known facial product.  This is mych better for less money!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.  Great value.  All natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I really can;t see a difference yet, also I don;t really know how much I should use.can you help me?Thank&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I really can see results by using this for 2 weeks and have already ordered another</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and my face has cleared up and it looks alot smoother and more hydrated. I will definitely be ordering another bottle!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
            <li> Like it. 93 year old mother and I have started using it, and I think this serum is helping. We will continue, hopping for better result. Thank you. Jarmila</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin shows a great improvement. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> One of the great product I&#x27;ve used so far. Love it! I tried a few moisturizers and this is one of the great product that I will recommend. It softens my skin and leaves it hydrated the whole day. It absorbs quickly and it did not give any messy residue. After few weeks of using it, you will actually see the results. I love the dropper type, it gives you the right amount to put in your face.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few weeks and so far so good. I know things don&#x27;t happen overnight. So Ill use the whole bottle and write another review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product just a few weeks ago. I was very happy with the price and SIZE of the product and that I got free shipping. The product goes on smooth and leaves no residue or greasy feeling. You can also apply moisturizer afterwards and make up if you&#x27;d like. It seems like the dark circles under my eyes are already better. I use this product 1-2 times a day. I also purchased a bottle for my mother who was happy that it didn&#x27;t make her break out (she doesn&#x27;t use serums or moisturizers on her face due to acne break outs). She said after one day, she thought her skin looked better.</li>
            <li> saw no difference, will not purchase again</li>
            <li> It works fine. My face feels smooth and clean when I use it. I noticed my fave has become more radiant. I don&#x27;t know if this is what&#x27;s causing it but my pimples are gone also. Yes, I will repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> love this and will buy it again..thank you</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great price &amp; great results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick I think it would &#x27;ve been better in a pump bottle instead of the dropper. That&#x27;s my only gripe though, it&#x27;s amazing for adding moisture and plumping the skin. I use it morning and night and my moisturizer sinks in better since using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my skin feels great and seems to decrease the fine lines I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old. And though I am healthy and look younger than my age I had  several wrinkles and lines that did not go with the way I feel. I have noticed a difference in my face and neck from the first week since using this product. Lines and wrinkles are being reduced right before my eyes. I also use the eye cream and use the retinol moisturizer. My skin has never looked this good, it has always been dry. Now my face is soft and smooth. I am hoping I never have to stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Love how this soaks in fast and helps relieve dry skin (and lips).  My skin is soft, and although it is not a facelift, it feels wonderful on my face and I believe it does help give a youthful glow. I am not very successful with the dropper, so I just use the serum that is on the outside of the dropper when I pull in out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes skin soft and supple. It hydrates, and brightens. It also helps with fine lines and wrinkles. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Starting fourth week of using this.  Does it take a while longer before results show?</li>
            <li> Yes will be buying again great item, but not only that wonderful PRICE!!!!;)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love the way it goes on my skin and look forward to using it every day!</li>
            <li> All I can say you feel your face firmer and is not greasy. I&#x27;ll have to keep trying the serum very satisfied with this item</li>
            <li> I am 76 and I&#x27;m well aware that this product wasn&#x27;t going to work any miracles, but it does make my skin feel smooth and brighter.  I use a very small quantity before my moisturizer.  No complaints at all, and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for 2 weeks and it does seem to help seal moisture in. I live in a dry high desert area of the country so I will say my skin looks less dry and wrinkles are less visible. I am in my early 60&#x27;s so I know what real wrinkles look like.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using it under my moisturizer I could see a difference - my skin looks &amp; feels smoother &amp; plumper. Bye bye fine lines! Within a couple weeks I could see improvement in my tone - my skin looks bright &amp; radiant. I am on my second bottle already, I&#x27;m really impressed with this serum. I&#x27;m less oily than I was before I started using it &amp; have gotten so many compliments on my skin. I highly recommend this product to my friends &amp; clients, it actually works and it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. So glad I tried it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*updating my review after 2 years*&lt;br /&gt;This product is truly a miracle in a bottle, do yourself a favor and add it to your cart. You won&#x27;t find this quality and concentration of hyaluronic acid for the price. I am over 40 years old and barely have any visible lines. With continued use, this product has erased my dark spots and broken capillaries and leaves my skin looking plump and radiant. There is no scent and it does not leave your skin looking shiny. Wears well under make up. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I am early in my use. I found it to be clean feeling and expect good results.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I give this product 10 stars. My skin feels and looks better. Seeing some improvement in forehead wrinkles. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and I like the fact that it dries fast, and it doesn&#x27;t irritare my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Right away I noticed changes in my skin.  The creases around my eyes were reduced and I was surprised to see my pores look smaller.  Other people started noticing something was different within the first week.  I have spent a lot of money on skin care products and this is by far the best value with the best results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week , so far so good. My skin is more hydrated and feels softer.</li>
            <li> LEAVES SKIN SILKY SMOOTH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Hyaluronic Acid Serum to be most comfortable to use and by that I mean it goes on smoothly, soaks into my skin quickly and feels good on my skin. Having used it for only a couple weeks, I cannot yet say how well it works but I feel encouraged and hopeful. I appreciate the quantity and discount offered, which helps greatly to make this an affordable investment. The delivery was prompt and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I applied twice a day after I washed and toned my skin normally. My face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; felt soft, and were visibly moisturized. At the end of the first week, there was a noticeable reduction in my pore size and even dark marks which I wasn’t expecting at all. It will definitely make it’s way into my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, depend on it! need it ….wish I could buy by the gallon!</li>
            <li> Love it! The product goes a long way &amp; even though I&#x27;ve been using it a short time, my face seems to be brighter, lines not so prominent &amp; adult breakouts stopped. Strange but TRUE!  I will continue to happily use this product.  I am 53 years old &amp; avoiding surgery, etc. this is a GREAT option! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Thicker than some I have used. A small amout goes a long way. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Second bottle that I&#x27;ve ordered. Seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product morning and evening for about a month.  I initially saw an improvement in texture of my skin but it seems that my skin has gone back to its original texture before I started using this after prolonged use.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is worth the extra step in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Think serum but absorbs nicEly.  Face assists brighter.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  Its not watery,  its much thicker.  Just a little bit is all it takes to do my face and neck.  Instead of 1oz, its a 2 oz bottle.  great price too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about every other day with no issues or irritation to my skin. It took about 3 weeks to see a difference on my face especially around the eye area. Looks good and I am happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> AJ - thanks for contacting me; i don&#x27;t have enough experience with the product to provide useful feedback; please check back in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best -Arti</li>
            <li> Great formula. I&#x27;ve come to value more products that are natural without all the chemicals. From my experience this has been a terrific company and their customer service and outreach is top-notch!! What also sold me was more positive  reviews I viewed on YouTube.  All in all for the quality and price you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product and I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Non greasy.  Absorbs into skin well.  Great for under name up or moisturizer.  Good price for great ingredients.  Highly recommend!  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. Plumps skin filling in lines and pores disappear. Acne on chin finally went away. Noticeable improvement in blackheads on nose as well. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I use day and night.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for almost 2 weeks and must say that I do like it very much. It has a delicate scent and absorbs quickly so I do not hvae to wait too long before applying the day or night cream. Thank you for an excellent serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum for about a month or so, and my skin does feel softer and looks brighter. I think this serum is a pretty good deal, too. If you&#x27;re new to serums, I&#x27;d recommend this one. It&#x27;s not over priced, there&#x27;s plenty of product, and it seems to work well. I plan on buying this again.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I wear it everyday and after a week I think I notice a difference. I use it under my daily moisturizer with SPF, and my face seems to glow and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Hyaluronic Acid Serum after using this companies eye gel for one week.  I can not say enough about their products. The serum is thick, easy to apply and you can see results very quickly. Fine lines seem to disappear, my skin looks luminous and the texture of my skin is better.  Not only that, but they are not stingy with the amount you receive, this should last a very long time.  Lastly, their customer service is impressive.  I received an e-mail with the instructions spelled out and they immediately replied to a question I had.</li>
            <li> This product thus far is very good and arrived on time. I use it everyday.Will give more feedback in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This company makes the best stuff! I started with their cleansing oil for my 40 year old, sensitive, dull and acne prone skin just a few weeks ago and added this to my new routine a few days ago. Folks you have to try their products! First the oil cleaned, shrank down and emptied my pores and I&#x27;m completely clear of blemishes. After massaging in the cleansing oil and removing with a warm clean washcloth I apply orange water toner then this serum. You only need 3 to 4 drops and it is light and cool on apication, the smell is very pleasant. Your skin feels soothed and soft, the serum absorbs really fast and although you feel tightening your skin is super moisturized. I apply morning and night sometimes at night I add mousturizer over the serum too. Your skin seriously glows with this stuff, wrinkles particularly around the eyes improve immediately. I can&#x27;t wait to see what this magic in a bottle can do after a few months of use!</li>
            <li> My face has never felt as soft and hydrated as it does using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  It dries almost instantly and my wrinkles are softer and I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa.  The palms of my hands are softer just from using them to apply the serum.  I highly recommend this product to everyone!  I am looking forward to using it regularly for a very long time.  There are so many other products out there on the market that make big promises but nothing that I have ever tried feels as wonderful as this serum.  Give it a try, you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in my pore size right away. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the serum, but need to use it for a certain time to see the result.</li>
            <li> Right after application, I can honestly feel my skin tighten up. I can see a difference just after using for 2-3 weeks in the appearance of my skin. It feels smoother and my pores are smaller. I am 55 years old, and I find this works better than any other product I have used, and I have used a lot. Now I know that my 55 year old laugh lines are not going to disappear but they do appear less defined. Thanks I will definitely continue to use this product, and it is a plus that it is less expensive than most others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now.  It seems to be work well, though I dont like the stickiness after it dries.  I use niacinamide over it, and then another moisturizing cream to relieve the stickiness of the both together.  I would rather use a pump than the eye dropper it comes with.</li>
            <li> I like the liquid application of this supplement.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid serum is just so popular now a day. I bet everyone got at least 2 or 3 bottles in her vanity table. I found this bottle is so great that it immediate moisturizes and soften the skin. Love the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this before the relabel and its watery.  Not enough aloe.  The first time it worked awesome now its just too watery.</li>
            <li> The oil is great and I&#x27;m using it daily with results! Thaxs!!</li>
            <li> Very please with this serum and have very good results.</li>
            <li> Just used twice so far and I&#x27;m loving the moisturizing effect!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now, and my skin tone has definitely evened out some, and overall looks smoother, so I really do like it so far. It applies easily, is odorless after application and leaves no residue or shininess on the skin.</li>
            <li> feels super nice on the skin. No funky smell like some serums have. Great ingrediants. Natural.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement and so easy to apply and feels so great.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel Great!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! I have used for a couple of weeks now, the only result is that my face is full with pimples. I never had a pimple before in my life.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.  I am older but I can see still see and feel a difference.  Will definitely order again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t recommend this product! Seems like I bought water!!! the product is super diluted with water. I would go back to my old routine- Philosophy</li>
            <li> I love this serum!!! I have sensitive skin that is acne prone.  This serum does not cause breakouts or skin irritation in any way.  I can use it only or with a moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I have very sensitive skin and there is no bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice a day for 21 days. My facial pores are smaller and less fine lines. My coworkers recently asked what I use on my face because they have seen a difference. I don&#x27;t mind aging gracefully. I have very sensitive skin and luckily no redness or negative reaction to the serum.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best hila Ronek acid that I&#x27;ve ever used. I am in the process of reordering two bottles and would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not impressed! No visible difference. Using all 3 products as instructed.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I have very oily skin and this keeps it moosturized without feeling greasy. It makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I love the hyaluronic acid serum! I have included it in my daily routine. I live in the desert and have noticed a huge difference in the way skin feels- it stays moisturized throughout the day! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this product and feel like it&#x27;s helping my skin retain moisture and look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic. I have used it for a couple of weeks now, and I can actually see a difference in the texture of my skin. Is is brighter, my pores appear smaller, my skin feels tighter, and the uneven blotchy spots are diminishing. You can feel the tightening effect as it dries on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the Youth Effect Eye Gel, and I love it. The puffiness under my eyes is decreasing, they are not as pronounced as before.&lt;br /&gt;I received a compliment from a clerk in my neighborhood pharmacy today. I had to show her my driver&#x27;s license to obtain my prescription, and she was amazed with my age versus my physical appearance. I am 61 years old and she says I look no older than thirties. I have always taken care of my skin, but this Serum adds radiance, and when you apply it, you can actually feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue this regimen with the Hyaluronic Acid and the Eye Serum, for as long as Instanatural sells it. Their Customer Service is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;I received a personal email before my products arrived with instructions for use and thanking me for my purchase, and another email, after arrival asking if I was satisfied with my purchase. My review is my reply. Thanks AJ</li>
            <li> Great serum, absorbed quickly, I honestly think its diminishing my fines, and evened out darkspots and discoloration, will repurchase!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing will need this for winter. I am currently using it over my age defying skin serum at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and started noticing fine lines on my forehead. I decided to start using this product along with an anti-aging cream...the difference has been amazing! This product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly, leaving my face and neck feeling soft. I&#x27;ve used it for almost a month and the changes are noticeable. The skin around my eyes is much better even (I&#x27;ve always had dark circles and puffiness).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve told several of my friends and my Mom is going to start using it as well!</li>
            <li> This serum is really easy to use and feels great on the skin.  I was worried as I have very sensitive skin, but I have not experienced any problems.  Have only been using it a short  time, but skin feels tighter.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic. I apply it after I wash my face before bed and in the mornings after my shower. It feels so good and easily absorbs into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it almost everyday since I bought it several weeks ago.  I can already see an improvement in my skin. My skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this for my face and hands. Makes my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> I dont see any difference in my skin, since my skin is sensitive I did not get any adverse reactions</li>
            <li> Great product. Light.  Absorbs quickly. Very muted, pleasant fragrance. This is my 2nd bottle. I use it twice a day and don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Very easy to apply, smells great &amp; keeps skin hydrated for those harsh winter months. Came really quickly in the post too :)</li>
            <li> Will use this from now on........price is wonderful for the amount.&lt;br /&gt;Can see the difference in my skin already........Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I only have used it for a week, too early to evaluate completely. It smells good, a little thinner than I&#x27;m used to. 5% HA, considering ordering a 20% HA product instead... I live in the desert, very dry even though I take very good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! and the price is amazing as well. It goes on very nicely and is NOT sticky at all. I wear it under my make up and also use it at bed time. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now and I notice my skin looks so much brighter, healthier looking, plump, and moisturized. I am definitely buying this product again. It does not clog your pores at all. I have problems with acne and I swear my acne has also improved since using this wonderful product. Shipped very quickly. You get 2 oz of product,  all the other products I was researching they only give 1oz and the price was  way higher. I&#x27;m going to try their vitamin c serum next :) and customer service is AWESOME!!! IF I COULD I&#x27;D GIVE THIS PRODUCT 10 STARS! SO HAPPY I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR ME FOR A GOOD PRICE. you do not need to spend an arm and a leg for good products!</li>
            <li> Received this n decided to use it with my infuser machine. Instantly after first use, I notice my skin was brighter, it feels like I just used a whitening mask for 20 mins. I woke up in the morning n my skin was still bright n soft n hydrated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the wrinkles, but my skin looks better overall. I have received a lot of compliments. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very low humidity. Hyaluronic helps to keep the moisture in my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple weeks, but I already notice a definate softening of the wrinkle lines around my eyes. So far I&#x27;m applying this once a day and am very pleased. This product feels good on my face and leaves no residue, stickiness, or uncomfortable build up. My skin just seems to soak it in! I think I will try morning and night this week!</li>
            <li> THE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM IS GREAT PRODUCTS.  I USE IT AT DAYTIME IT IS EASY TO ABSORBS QUICKLY AND DRY.  AND LET ME  MAKE UP EASY.  KEEP MY FACE SOFT AND MOISTURE ALL DAY!  LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum is not what I expected. It definitely makes my skin feel softer but it does nothing for the wrinkles around my eyes. I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin yet since I have started using this product.</li>
            <li> Skin seems smoother and brighter.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use, not a long drawn out regimine. Applicator dropper gives you just the right amount of product to use, no wasting . Skin feels good after use. Takes about a week of use before looking in the mirror and realizing your skin has lost that dull dry look,  and in that moment of &amp;#34;well I&#x27;ll be ...&amp;#34; A smooth smile crawls across the face,and I know the product is supposed to be for the face but I swear it made my footstep lighter!  The mirror reflects back a happy, smoother, fresher face.</li>
            <li> I NOW STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT SO I CAN&#x27;T REALLY SAY.</li>
            <li> This serum feels thicker than most, and glides over the skin like velvet. I feel that it is thick enough to be used on his own, I do not feel the need to follow with a separate moisturizer. I have not used it long enough to see results, but I like it enough to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff I feel like it helped fade my acne scars not completely yet but I still feel like it&#x27;s working hasn&#x27;t really prevented new acne spots but I still feel like it helped a lot will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for over a week, and I think my face looks brighter, smoother and more hydrated.  I use it under my moisturizer in the norning and at night. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been conscious of good skin care from seeing seeing my father put on Oilay when I was a little girl. I  have done many beauty treatments over the years. I had been using a different seller&#x27;s Hyaluronic. I decided to try Insta Natural brand. By comparing the two I like that this consistency from Insta Natural is a light serum. The other brand was very watery. I am now in love. I love the vitamin c, green tea, and jojoba oil combined with the hyaluronic. I have used very expensive products. This is a MUST have in any lady&#x27;s beauty regime. It has even the texture, faded scaring, softened fine lines. I cannot express how great my skin looks. You can be beat this price and wonderful beauty enhancement. It is a new Holy Grail product that is currently being added as a requirement in my skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hyaluronic acid before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do feel like it helps with texture of my skin. I wish it was stronger, but I do think it&#x27;s great to help maintain or improve your skin&#x27;s overall texture.</li>
            <li> The Poduct is Great!  My face already looking very well.  I have gotten quite a few comments.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very koindly!  Let me know if you have any more products.  This is just the very best.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and can be quickly followed with a moisturizer like Instanatrual&#x27;s Rosehip Seed Oil, which I like to use in conjunction with this product. The hyaluronic acid help the skin retain moisture and the helps smooth fine lines. I like that it is a medicine dropper so I can use as little or as much as I need. The bottle is also very generously sized.</li>
            <li> Great product my skin feels smooth and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff has my face breaking out so bad!  I wish I would&#x27;ve checked the ingredients first, as there is more Aloe in here than hyaluronic acid! I&#x27;ve used Youth hyaluronic acid before and that is DEF worth the extra money!  Don&#x27;t waster your time on this, especially if you have oily/acne prone skin.  Stick with a pure grade Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any change! Maybe just the slightest lightening of some sun spots but very slight.. I sadley would not recommend this..had high hopes and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see results yet. Solution is sticky and causes my face to shine too much under makeup.</li>
            <li> This product is not oily smooth and serum-like. It came out like globs of jelly. It probably works the same, but it sure doesn’t feel the same!</li>
            <li> This product is truly the best vegan Hyaluronic Acid Serum out there.  I have been suffering from fine lines and wrinkles since entering my 30&#x27;s, but this has made a huge difference in their appearance.  Also, it has improved my skin&#x27;s elasticity. I love the way my skin feels after use.  It is non irritating, also, which is a plus since my skin is sensitive. I also noticed that my face has cleared up since using it.  I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the price is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was treated to a facial a couple of months ago. I was told that my face wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; but that it was &amp;#34;thirsty.&amp;#34; Her explanation was that moisturizer sits on top of the skin, while hyaluronic acid is absorbed by the skin. Is it scientific? I don&#x27;t know. Did my skin look supple and dewy? You betcha.&lt;br /&gt;The spa had it for purchase for $50.00. I ordered it on Amazon from my car in the spa&#x27;s parking lot. I just reordered. You could say it&#x27;s serious.</li>
            <li> I do not normally need to use facial products as I rarely have skin issues.  Recently, I have had dry spots on my face, as well as other changes.  This serum has really helped with these changes.  My complexion is getting better after only a week of use.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I see no major difference from other hyaluronic products I have tried. Itworks great, it does what its suppose to. I will order again.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and light going on my skin. However, after using it twice a day for over a month, there&#x27;s no change, or noticable. Hence 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Seems fine. No miracle here, but anything I can do to help my skin is good.</li>
            <li> so far i do not see any improvement but i will keep on trying as it has been only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Ohhhh my skin is glowing. I am using it every morning!</li>
            <li> Been using it every morning for the past 2 months. On my second bottle. I&#x27;ll never use anything but this again. I&#x27;m a 51 year old guy and this stuff plumps up my skin so well! Don&#x27;t expect overnight results, but long term use truly shows visible results.</li>
            <li> I am elderly and have lots of wrinkles but seems they are softer and less noticable. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I love it! Have used similar products before .</li>
            <li> I love that this is a vegan product. It is so easy to use and I love that you can even wear it under your makeup!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece as a gift and she loves it! The price was great and the shipping was free and fast!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a hyaluronic acid for quite some time.  This one is very easy to use - and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft.  I use it underneath my moisturizer.  Highly recommend.  Addition to original review:  My skin is feeling great.  This is the best serum - I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since I got it everyday and I use it around my eyes. I have puffy dark eyes. I think I&#x27;m starting to see a change in the darkness but not as much in the puffiness yet. It may not be made for that though. I&#x27;ll continue to use this and see what happens. But I have no complaints as of yet. Great shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Too early to say for just 8 days I&#x27;m using , I will continue to use after a month the I will come back for another review.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing serum .Makes your skin glowing</li>
            <li> I love this so much, I bought two more bottles.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in my skin and typically with anything containing vitamin c, my face glows beautifully. Instead, it looks dull and doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything. I think my face actually looks worse since I started using this, so I&#x27;m sticking to my reliable coconut oil. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product ,  use sparingly but really good results.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing so far! Wrinkles seem to be getting less noticeable and acne scars are not as  severe as before.</li>
            <li> Liking this product very much. I&#x27;ll be ordering again. It holds in moisture very well and offers additional help with the vitamins C &amp; E. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.  I have had the injections so I know hyaluronic acid works.  Got this product for the areas I didn&#x27;t want injected and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get out of the bottle, I haven&#x27;t found any improvements in my skin........so not really all that impressed.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles are finally disappearing! I have been using this for over two weeks now and am starting to see results, real results! This has helped reduce my uneven hyperpigmentation, my skin looks so much more even, my face is a bit more plump just enough to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles. The dark circles under my eyes really has lightened up and the puffiness under my eyes have lessoned. Now I do not look like I have two black eyes. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for some assistance with their complexion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feels beautiful and tightening, loving it and will also repurchase, great price</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, hyaluronic Acid serums sold on Amazon. In my opinion this is the creamiest, the best working results hyaluronic acid serum sold on Amazon I am 69 years young &amp;amp; this serum plumps-up my skin so nicely...I look so much better after using it in about 1 minute. I use mositurizer after it is absorbed good...then my make-up.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This product just did not work for me. Thanks so much. I liked the way it felt on my skin but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Hydrates without being oily. Purchased a 2nd bottle for my husband.</li>
            <li> I am happy, I am ofcourse dealing with a 68 year old sun ravaged skin..but this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum for very long, but so far my skin seems softer.  I&#x27;m hoping that in another month or two I will see some difference in my neck.  It feels and smells wonderful!  I can tell there is some Rosemary in it which is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> feels great on my skin !</li>
            <li> When I rubbed this on face and neck my skin felt very soft. You will feel the differences. Everyone&#x27;s body is different  My wife used it to and she loves it and told me that it does work with her makeup too. Now she&#x27;s asked me to get her, her own bottle and I&#x27;m ordering her one too.</li>
            <li> Vanishes quickly and my skin texture is getting better I am shocked being a light brown complexion (african, irish, native american). My skin texture was like constant chill bumps but this mix with some hyaluronic acid serum was tackling that issue week after week.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight difference, its still kind of early.</li>
            <li> I like how easy this product is to apply it does not leave a residue or film on your skin.  It hydrates your skin nicely and I am waiting for the line and wrinkles to lessen.  I am happy with the results so far.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have used other products such as this, but this Hyaluronic acid, it is the best!! It is a high quality product, please feel free to contact me and ask.That&#x27;s the only way to find out. I used this non-stop for the  30 days and the results are wonderful!! I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It seems like a decent product. I have yet to see results from using it but I will give it some time and use the entire bottle</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long, but it really seems to be improving the discoloration from too much sun. Very happy with the results. Quick shipping, good information from the seller.</li>
            <li> Love this! Wil definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> Well I don&#x27;t use it but my Girlfriend says it&#x27;s not as good as promised. What can I say. I guess women are never happy with beauty products. Lol. I still think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face in the first few days.  After using this product every day for the past couple of weeks I&#x27;ve noticed even more change.  My skin is so smooth and tight.  The dark circles under my eyes are significantly reduced.  My pores are smaller and my skin glows.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or make my face feel like it has any product on once dried/absorbed.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very light, gets absorbed fast, leaves pleasant silky and clean feeling behind, and I really like its scent. I apply it twice a day, and I noticed that it works wonder for my make up: makes it easier to spread and it it goes on more evenly. Great product, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and absorbs immediately.  I think my skin looks very smooth and healthy.  Using my second order now and will continue to use this product day and night.  It was a good find and priced right.</li>
            <li> Combines well with the retinol serum.</li>
            <li> My wife has really seen a difference in her face.  She had rosacea and it has almost cleared up after using this for a month.  She hasn&#x27;t seen much reduction in wrinkles, but likes how this makes her skin feel.  Definitely will order this again!</li>
            <li> Great product reasonabl price. My skin look better than ever .</li>
            <li> I like that this serum is fragrance free and that it&#x27;s made it the USA.  That is important to me.  This product goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind which is great.  I definitely think it&#x27;s been helping me with my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very HAPPY with this serum.  I have only had it for a little over a week and realized that I needed to use it at night for the ultimate benefit. I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> The product size is better for long-term use than the smaller 1 oz bottles I have been purchasing.  This product is especially good for the lines I have under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks.  I was pleasantly surprised how quickly it soaks into my skin!  It does not leave your skin looking shiny.  During hot weather I do not like layering creams on my face.  I am using this in place of three products.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum has really helped with the bags and discolor under my eyes. It is a nice sized bottle. It is easy to apply with the dropper. It goes on easy and absorb great. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I received a sample to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 2 weeks and can see a  difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m over 70yrs of age.  I am also enjoying InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer.  I recommend that you try these products from InstaNatural.  They have a wonderful service department.</li>
            <li> Really notice a change in the appearance of my skin after 2 days, now 1 week after it help! will keep using it for better results</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen no difference</li>
            <li> I recently began using Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It is working BUT, much more slowly then advertised. the results are not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum really works I have been using it for several months, it dries quickly, it works well with my moisturizer, and makeup , most of all it really does make wrinkles less noticeable.  eleven o&#x27;clock is not noticeable at all, forehead is smooth, and happy smile lines around mouth are less.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected. I do have combination skin and I like facial product that do not leave oily feel on the skin. This product does not leave oily feel but in the same time it does not feel that I applied anything on my face.it is just very slipery feel.</li>
            <li> The droper inside was broken so it&#x27;s a little inconvenient other than that it&#x27;s O.K.</li>
            <li> Now all I use is there line of skincare and it has dramastically changed my face within  just a couple days. This is the real deal and their customer service is amazing!!!  This will be the only stuff I put on my face now and forever.</li>
            <li> Nice product with my favorite beauty item, hyaluronic acid, at an affordable price!  Vitamin C is a bonus.  Smooths, moisturizes and improves the over-all look of the skin.  The only down side is that it takes longer to dry than just the HA by itself, and can leave the face feeling a bit sticky if you get heavy-handed with it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely fabulous! The application is easy, the scent is great and the most important, makes my skin soft. It&#x27;s perfect! I recommend it. Furthermore, Instanatural cares about its customers in a gentle way, always available for questions, informations and tips about its product. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> use daily 2 times a day love it</li>
            <li> appears to be softening the lines</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who are looking to get rid of some fine lines or even some wrinkles to be not so noticeable, the gel like consistency of it is great as well, not too watered down looking, and it gives you just the right amount of ingredients you are looking for, a little bit goes a long ways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This Is My Honest Opinion!!**</li>
            <li> Lines around my eyes and forehead are much less noticeable. I am only using InstaNatural products now and they all work great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell yet if this is working but it feels good on my skin.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to look for.  Really cannot see any difference.  What should I be looking for?</li>
            <li> I use this daily in the morning, and a C/E serum at night. My 68-year-old skin feels soft and supple with very few wrinkles, and I hope this regimen keeps it that way for many years.</li>
            <li> Great price works well</li>
            <li> Love this acid serum. It&#x27;s light and absorb fast and it makes my skin clean and clear. Will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the results.  I have been using it for a few weeks.  But I don&#x27;t really see any improvement of the skin and it&#x27;s aility to retain moisture.  Nice product, goes on well and dries quickly.  But doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you that I am obsessed with anti aging products, lol. I have many and while I am a fan of alot of different ones, this one is one of my go to&#x27;s. I just love the fact that it gets rid of the puffiness under my eyes and diminshes my dark circles. I have had dark circles all my life and after using this, I have seen fantastic results. Another added bonus is that it makes my skin feel so soft. Love this!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s a good product will buy again</li>
            <li> Nice quality, but I don[&#x27;t see the moisture being drawn in to my skin like some of the more expensive versions.  Good quality, but you do get what you paid for here.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months... I just ordered/received my second bottle.... I use in on my face and hands at least twice a day... as a make up base/primer it is very good and does not cause any make up base to peel off.... I let it dry first and also use a moisturizer over the serum.  The really nice thing about this product is:  even on windburned skin, you can use it and it does not burn or cause redness....it actually seems to help quite a bit.  I think my moisturizer/hand creams are working better by using this product.  It is also not expensive and lasts a long time considering how often I use it and am including my hands and face.... it is not runny at all which I feel helps extend the products as it does not run or drip... very nice consistency.  I would like to be able to buy a 4 ounce size or even a 6 ounce size... I have also tried several other products by this company and all are very good and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I liked it on my skin and no breakouts....but I liked a similar product with vitamin C in addition, better</li>
            <li> I h Ave never used serums on my  skin,until I discovered INSTANATURAL products.U am glad I tried them my skin is so much better now.This serum is easy to apply,it leaves your skin soft moistured hydrated  with natural ingredients  that did not irritate my skin,really does not have a smell.I love IT I GAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> I use this and the bio elements cleanser and moisturizer and I love my skin again!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get into the routine of using this product. I&#x27;m much more of a lotion type person and this is definitely a serum. I knew that going in, I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lotion but it is different. I can&#x27;t comment on results because frankly I feel like I probably didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see any. If you&#x27;ve used serums before and that&#x27;s your thing then I would say this is the product for you. If you&#x27;re a lotion person like I am, you may not like this product.</li>
            <li> Only been using the product a few days, but am satisfied with the results I am seeing. I also loved getting an email from the company with additional instructions for their product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since 3 weeks now and it has done wonders. It is hydrating and effectively improves the complexion and skin tone. I would be buying it again. Love it.</li>
            <li> Lovely product! Has a light floral fragrance. I have used this for about a month and notice a softening of my lines. Works better than my expensive creams!</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff.  natural ingredients, no odor, goes on smooth, and I can put any kind of moisturizer on top after it dries.  I like the way it makes my skin feel and look and a bottle lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now and truly believe that without it my skin wouldn&#x27;t be this good.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t cost a stupid amount of money. I&#x27;m sticking with this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this serum on spring last year and fell in love . It was moisturized my skin and feel so great, so I decided to order again. But this time serum smell like a soap and not the same texture and it makes my skin dry more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really wish to have the same one from last year.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I just started using this product recently. My skin looks less tired looking and I believe I have a glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see/notice any difference at all!  I don&#x27;t think this product does anything at all.  I have never until now used a product that did not make some kind of noticeable difference when you put it on your skin whether good or bad, this one does neither, it&#x27;s as if you had put nothing on.  I have never been more disappointed and believe me I wanted to love it.  I honestly do not know where all these raving reviews that I read are coming from unless I somehow received a defective bottle.  The consistency of the serum is questionable and when I put it on my face it&#x27;s thin, has no scent so you don&#x27;t even know you have put anything on, does not make my skin look or feel hydrated or smooth in any way.  NOTHING.  I am going to request a refund and I have never done that before.</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I have ever tried, and I love it! My face has always been dry, red, and acne prone, and every product I have tried hasn&#x27;t  cooperated with my sensitive skin until I tried this. I use it every morning and night and have seen results in about 2 weeks. My face is no longer red or dry, and my acne scars have actually  started to fade. This one is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels cool on the face. I have not noticed any change in the appearance of my skin but then I have only used it for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about two weeks and I can see a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. It works well under my foundation and keeps my skin looking hydrated and dewy</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth..</li>
            <li> The serum is very light and I&#x27;ve noticed some dark spots getting lighter. I don&#x27;t feel it after it dries on my skin. I don&#x27;t use that much in one application so I think it will last a while. I would like to try their other products soon.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price! I love it! My skin looks brighter and fine lines improved</li>
            <li> this lotion is a very good moisturizer. There is no irritation and it does not make skin oily. I would recommend</li>
            <li> gave me lively skin , got lots of compliment , Thank You !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 4 different kinds and so far, this serum is my favorite!  I smells like rosebud and that means a lot to me; plus it&#x27;s thicker.  The other 3 brand x smell like they are sour and who wants to smell that!  So I will order get more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a month now and the tone of my skin is more even  and firmer.  I&#x27;ve used products in the past that contains Hyaluronic Acid in a mask version before but never tried it in a serum form.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is brighter and firmer where my frown lines no longer feels heavy and a little less noticeable.  The texture is becoming softer and smoother than before.  I highly recommend this product, making sure yo follow directions and putting the serum on the neck area along with the jaw lone up yo behind the ears.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I bought this with a derma roller and I even added a couple of drops of &amp;#34;Orange&amp;#34; essential oil by Young Living so that was pure Vitamin C. This stuff feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week now, and so far, I like the results I am getting. It is very gentle and absorbs quickly. Does not leave residue or film on the face. Will probably reorder in the future. Hope this review helps someone to decide whether or not to order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle of this serum, and I would say I&#x27;m not too impressed. The good thing about it is it&#x27;s non-greasy and easily spreads on your skin; however, I still have to see my brown spots lighten, which is the main reason I purchased it. It does make your skin feel soft, but I don&#x27;t really see a visible improvement in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I used this serum in the morning and evening after using my toner. InstaNatural suggests using it this often for the best results, but it can be used as after as you need it. The formula is very lightweight. It feels a bit like a gel, rather than a serum. As soon as it hits the skin and is massaged in, it becomes more of a watery consistency. This absorbs incredibly quickly, and you can immediately feel the different in the texture of your skin. A good way to test this is to apply a generous amount to the top of one hand and leave the other one without. Wait a few minutes and then gently feel the skin each hand. You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much softer the skin is after using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;This product can also be worn under makeup without changing the consistency of foundation, or pilling, which I appreciate! So many of my serums tend to pill and roll up when I apply a foundation over them. After just a few days of use, I am continuously happy with this serum. My skin feels absolutely baby-soft. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands as well as my face and I&#x27;ve also seen a huge difference there as well. I had some discoloration on my hands that has already started to fade! I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I didn&#x27;t see it with my own eyes. Of course after only a few days, I haven&#x27;t noticed any anti-aging benefits yet.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very pleased with this serum. I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects, no breakouts or irritation, and my skin feels softer than ever.</li>
            <li> I received my InstaNatural hyaluronic serum and after a couple days of use I noticed it was drying out my face and not living up to the expectations that I thought it would. I would appreciate a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Turning 40 this year and this stuff has taken a few years off my face after only a couple of weeks of use! I am very happy that I tried it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products (brand) before but this is my favorite, light and easy to apply, I love how good it feels after applying it, non greasy or heavy, but light and hydrated. A little bit of the light gel is enough to cover all the face. Also, the price is always right, I&#x27;ve tried to buy similar products in stores before, but the prices are very high, even with the same ingredients. Excellent product, I love this brand and the amazing costumer service.</li>
            <li> My neck looks amazing! Didn&#x27;t know it would fix this as well. Good serum</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Feel awesome on face!</li>
            <li> I had done a lot of research before deciding to purchase this. Being a older woman I am conerned what I put on my face. I try to take as much care of it as much as possible. Reading about the most important things that our face skin needs is Vit C , pepsid, and a natural oil ( I use cocnut ), and Vit E doesnt hurt.  I am close to 60 but can pass for 40 easliy. This serum is part of my  bi-weely rountine of my derma roller to bring the collagen to the surface. This serum is to sink into the pores to help with that and healing process. Keeping the facial skin soft, tight. I have had ppl ask me if ive had cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> I have started using it and like the serum as it is not sticky or greasy. I have yet to see the results as i just begun using.</li>
            <li> Product is not oily and rubs in similar to a lightweight moisturizer.  Very easy to apply and makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> perfect skin care for that scorching hot day</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Send me more. Thanks, smooth, moist, soft!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just begun using it.  I think it&#x27;s going to be just fine~</li>
            <li> Love the consistency! Love the smell! Hoping for future results!</li>
            <li> I really love this product ~ a must use for younger, tighter skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with this product.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and have noticed a difference.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used several anti-aging serums and have found that products with higher concentrations of hyaluronic acid are the most effective for my skin.  I have sensitive skin, rosacea, and have found this product to be gentle and non-irritating.  Of the hyaluronic acid serums I have tried, so far this one is the best.  The consistency and light scent are great and my complexion is smooth.  I see improvement in the color and consistency under my eyes and face overall.  It smooths out wrinkles, but does not make your skin feel unnaturally tight. I would highly recommend using a hyaluronic acid serum and highly recommend using this one.</li>
            <li> First. I love the smell. Secondly, it spreads on the face very easily, and it feels good, too. I mixed some of it into my anti-wrinkle cream, along with Vitamin E -45000 units, and retinol serum, and it works miracles. My wrinkles dissipated, and my face looks nice and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive hyaluronic acid serums before but this one works just as well. It makes my skin feel so hydrated. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product. I especially like the consistency of product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a few weeks, appears to slightly be working, but will know more after a complete bottle.  Yes, I do plan to reorder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 with skin that is prone to breakouts.  I am trying to prevent lines and wrinkles while also fighting the appearance of tiny ones starting around my eyes.  This is a good product for staying hydrated without any grease or oil!  I apply it once, directly after washing my face, daily.  My skin stays hydrated all day and appears very smooth.  As other reviews indicate, it takes very little to cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have a gentle, natural, cruelty free product!  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the serum so its to early to comment about wrinkles and finelines but onething which I noticed serum dry up very quickly and get dry skin feeling after use.</li>
            <li> This is the best line of skin care. This is my first time trying this skin care line and i love it. My skin looks healthier after the first week. I will continue to buy this line of skin care without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Working great. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great just need a drop of this stuff!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t look any younger but face feels fine!</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for several months now.  I find it very easy to apply.  The dropper is helpful in not wasting the gel.  However, I found it doesn&#x27;t get the bottom to use all the gel.  I upend the bottle and get two more weeks of applications!  I have used others and that are more expensive.  This is just as good, if not better.  I apply the gel on my wet face and then let it dry for close to 5 minutes.  Then I apply a moisturizing cream.  I use it twice daily.  Is it miraculous?  No, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I just received this serum and have been using it for a week now I&#x27;m on Coumadin &amp; it breaks me out sooo bad that I don&#x27;t want to leave my house this serum has worked wonders for me my break outs are not like they was they seem to b drying up this is a wonderful serum I wash my face first then I apply the serum &amp; let it dry &amp; then I apply my moisturizer my face feel so soft please do not stop selling this product I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was given to me for free for an honest opinion.  I have been using this product for a few weeks.  I can really see a difference in my face and eyes. It is making my skin softer and my wrinkles are going away.  I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. Lightweight, no smell.  tiny bit of stickiness. I think though, that it causes you to sunburn faster if you don&#x27;t wear sunblock, be careful.</li>
            <li> I have been using the hyaluronic acid serum for about 3 weeks. It is non irritating and seems to be hydrating my skin. I have very sensitive skin,so the fact that I have been able to use it this long is great!  I hope to continue to see good results.</li>
            <li> I like what this is doing to my skin. It makes it look brighter. I&#x27;ve noticed a more even tone as well.</li>
            <li> This product will make your skin dry. If you are going to use it with other skin cares, you have to wait until it completely dry otherwise it will generate scraps.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Can&#x27;t say I see anything drastic for certain, but feels nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid for a little over a month now and it is really fantastic. My skin just seems more luminous and hydrated. I have already ordered a second bottle although there is still a lot left in the first bottle. It goes on easily and my skin just drinks it in. My wrinkles seem softer and not as deep. I highly recommend this serum. The company is very good and does good follow through.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any marked improvements in my wrinkles but the product does make my skin feel softer and gives it a heathier look which i like, i&#x27;ve even gone without makeup which i haven&#x27;t done in years</li>
            <li> First of all, I get annoyed when I go through reviews and then realize that something has been given for free or at a discount and not be able to know that as I read the review, so let me say upfront that I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review. But I must also say that I will continue to purchase this product at full price because of the amazing results it gives me. Now read on if you&#x27;d like to hear my experience with this product over a 4 week period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have serum for anyone with skin lacking hydration. I don&#x27;t mean necessarily dry skin, because I am completely combination (oily/dry/normal). I love the feel of the serum as it goes on the skin. I apply it just after washing my face and neck and pat drying with a towel. While there&#x27;s still some residual moisture in my skin, I put a little over a full dropper of serum in my hand and gently pat this all over my face and neck. I place this everywhere, even under the eyes. I want to say that I did NOT do this at first. I wanted to make sure that this was product was gentle enough for under the eye and it truly is. The serum also dries without a residue which is great because I have hated &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; since I was a baby, or so I&#x27;m told, so the smooth feeling of the serum is a must for me, and this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, prone to redness especially in the cheek area (not rosacea). The end result is that the dry areas (which weren&#x27;t extreme but did get flaky at times) of my face are no longer an issue and my oily areas have calmed as well. The hydration plumps up the skin but oddly enough, seems to take away the plumped up little bag lines from under my eyes. I&#x27;m 42 and thankfully have no wrinkles to speak of, so I cannot speak to the claim of it reducing fine lines and wrinkles, but I can say that this serum is the best serum hydrator I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m a bit of a skin product junkie. Not to mention this comes in a nice 2 oz size (twice the size of most serums).(twice the size of most serums).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t noticed any differences after using it for 3 weeks. All I can say so far, it feels good and absorbs fast and lightly moisturized my skin when I did  not used any other lotion on top of it.  I will change the review if i see more effects.</li>
            <li> My face is a lot smoother with this serum. My winkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Have been using this serum for a month.  My skin tone on my face is smoothing out with some lightening of dark spots on cheeks.  I have always had very dark circles around my eyes - especially under eyes.  This is definitely lightening the dark circles under my eyes noticeably. My face looks overall a bit brighter with some lightening of dark spots. Also noticing plumping of the nose to mouth lines which were not real deep or anything, but they are improving and filling out anyway.  I saw another review that someone was using this on her elbows and my elbows needed help too. I am seeing dramatic results on the elbows with lightening!  I use it every night before bed on face, neck and elbows.  I rub it in some, then let it soak in naturally.  Have to say this serum is really working.  My skin is sensitive and I am not getting sensitivity or redness from this. My face is more moisturized too.  I just turned 60 and don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles. I bought this primarily for help with dark eye circles, but wanted to refresh my skin, plump up the lines and lighten dark spots starting to show up.  This serum is doing all of this for my skin!  I&#x27;m just an Amazon user that happened to  come across this serum.  I was not given a sample to review - in case folks are wondering.  I&#x27;m not patient and want faster fading of the dark spots, so will try another product to help with that.  Overall, my experience with this serum is exceptional and I will keep using/buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product!!  My skin tone  is better &amp; my products work better, too. New BFF!!!  --Deb. Age 61 Alaska USA</li>
            <li> Loving this! It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly, and seems to be helping my complexion. Definitely not a moisturizer in and of itself, so I have to follow it up with something once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the refreshed feeling it gives my skin!</li>
            <li> This serum is good but my face felt dry and tight after using it. I didn&#x27;t experience the same glow and hydration retention that I do when using my Cosmedica 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  For reference, I am in my 40s with normal-to-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wake up with calmer, smoother skin.  Don&#x27;t see that it&#x27;s helping much with my hyper pigmentation though.</li>
            <li> I feel a tingle with it.  Another great product by InstaNatural</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks now and so far I really like it. If it keeps working like it is now it&#x27;s going to be great. I&#x27;m going to order it again to see if it keeps working as well as it did on the first round I feel that is has been worth trying I&#x27;ll have another review for you later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth it. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Really works! After winter my skin did not look healthy ,hyaluronic acid helps recover</li>
            <li> Very happy with this serum thus far. It applies smooth and evenly.  I&#x27;ve been using H.A. for a couple of years and I find this one to be the best texture. And the blend of ingredients are pure which is very important to me. Great company representatives as well. They are very professional and stand behind their products and customer satisfaction!  I will return!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff works great</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue using it.  It has helped my skin drastically.  I had heard about the hyaluronic acid and when I found it offered on amazon.  I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is the most natural hyaluronic acid serum that absorbs quickly and does not peel. All the other serums I&#x27;ve tried show up when I layer foundation but not this brand. After several uses my fine lines appear to have blurred out. Which is a good sign of the purity and efficacy of this product. A+++</li>
            <li> Great hydration for the skin,absorbs quickly. Excellent customer service,love that they back their products 100%</li>
            <li> So far is fantastic. Feels nice on your skin can feel it soaking in. Looks great</li>
            <li> I  use  this  serum  twice  each  day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks and I feel my face looks brighter, smoother, and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I use with argon oil and nothing else. Pure, clean, preservative free and truly has improved the condition of my skin. I would use it all over my body if possible.  One bottle lasts about 6 weeks used twice and sometimes three times a day. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Godo product - good price - good customer service!</li>
            <li> Very good product, arrived quicky and works as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not working as I thought. I guess I&#x27;m just too old for repairs at this point! Thanks anyway.</li>
            <li> No issues at all. this product has made my skin feel super sooth and has redefined my skin texture. I love it and will continue to buy the whole product line. The only thing I wish the company would do, is list the product according to it&#x27;s usefulness.  for example, I bought the Niacinamide vitamin serum after finding out that it helps with acne.  I think I would have gone directly to the product had it been listed by it&#x27;s usefulness.  other than that, I truly have no objections to the product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It does plump my skin/wrinkles right away. And my face is looking younger and dewy. It has only been a few weeks and this stuff is already showing results. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Both came more quickly than expected so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start. Since I was late doing this, I haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement on my face, but have on my legs.Plan to keep using it until I think it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I use it daily on my stretchmarks with the stretch mark cream and the difference is amazing. Recently I used this on my sunburned skin with thw skin brightening lotIon instead of my usual banana boat sun lotion on and the results were way better. I didn&#x27;t peel or itch. I even gave this and the stretch mark cream tp my pregnant friend, that how much I love this !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a little over a week, but I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;m not sure of the actual permanence of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, but for the short term, it decreases the fine lines on my lower cheeks (I&#x27;m 72 so I have my fair share).  It also seems to make the dark circles under my eyes less noticeable.  Hopefully it will slow down further wrinkles and keep my skin better hydrated.  My skin feels softer and more resilient.  So far, I like it and will continue to use it.  I like that you get twice the amount as some of the others for sale.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I am so pleased with this serum. I just can&#x27;t say enough about it. I have only been using it for a few weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin. The price is unbelievable. I am done with the expensive brands purchased elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three months. I use it every night and morning. The results are visible. I have prone acne skin and this helps tremendously. In the dry heat environment is just the right product.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. Goes on silky not oily, and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  The fine lines have seemed to have disappeared.</li>
            <li> It has gotten so many good reviews that I was excited to try it.  I can honestly say that I have only used it a handful of times.  It seems to have a putrid smell to it that I have a hard time wanting to use this. I am not sure if there is something wrong with mine as I haven&#x27;t seen many postings about it.</li>
            <li> Use this product after your application of a good neutralizer. This will smoothen your skin and relieve the burning affect.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the results that I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I use every night..nno sticky and good results</li>
            <li> Love this!  No irritation and really works to moisturize and soften lines!</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my sensitive skin. Moisturized and brightened the skin. Applied after use of a 0.25mm derma roller, did not cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It is the first time I have used hyaluronic acid serum, and I was impressed from day one! My skin instantly felt smoother, and when I look in the mirror my facial skin looks somewhat softer. I wear it without anything else since I am retired and do not wear make-up on a daily basis any longer. The product seems to not necessarily call for make up or further moisturizer, even though the air here in Colorado is extremely dry. I am very happy with the product and shall continue to order it.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product and have ordered a second bottle.  My daughter, who was on vacation here, says she plans to order one, too, since she likes the ingredients in the serum.</li>
            <li> Actually I wasn&#x27;t nearly impressed with this one as i was with other products similar to this one.  This one didn&#x27;t help under my eyes in the same manner as the BEST Vitamin C Serum For Face 2015 worked.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on reviews.. I didnt get dissapointed. It really works and I think my skin is addicted to it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Korean Dramas for 10 years now, and over the years I&#x27;ve always heard mention of &amp;#34;serums&amp;#34;. I asked my friend about it, and she explained the science behind the Korean obsession with serums and night creams, toning and the whole skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea what I was expecting from this product, maybe it would turn me into Kim Tae Hee IDK, but when added together with a St.Ives cream I ordered to use as a night cream, this product had my face feeling softer ( I keep rubbing my face, which probably isn&#x27;t a sanitary thing to do), it&#x27;s evening out my complexion, and all together, my skin just looks marvelous. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week and a half now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Field work:Up to two weeks ago, I spent a lengthy time in the tropics, but my girlfriend commented that I appeared lighter, when I should have been the opposite. (It was the serum having evened out my skin tone hehe).&lt;br /&gt;e.g. 2: Hanging out with my friend today, he said I&#x27;ve begun to look &amp;#34;womanly&amp;#34; *rolls eyes* lol.&lt;br /&gt;Then he made the comment, while glancing at me side ways &amp;#34;Your skins looks...&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll fill in the missing &amp;#34;AWESOME!&amp;#34;. He may have thought I was wearing foundation or concealer, but I most definitely was not! I am in love with this product by Insta Natural, and am sure to purchase again in the future. My mum uses it as well, and I&#x27;m thinking of getting her the anti aging one and see how it works! 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I have oddly sensitive skin, so I gave this a one night trial test. Instead of waking up with a rash or hives, I woke up with glowing skin. So I&#x27;d say skin allergy approved (but I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, or everyone with sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Good product. It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a film or odor and does not dry my skin out or make it oily. Seems to calm my skin too. I have very sensitive skin with a touch of Rosacea. Seems to help a little with the redness.</li>
            <li> Everyday use makes your skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> Product does seem to work.  I have several age spots on my face, and they seem to be fading.  Also helps in the fine wrinkle/crows feet department as well.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product, made my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin at all. I think all the reviews are fake. I&#x27;ve had people tell me I look tired!</li>
            <li> The product works as described.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> So far I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with this product.  My skin feels a little firmer &amp; smoother.  I don&#x27;t see a change in any &#x27;laugh lines&#x27; but I&#x27;ve not been able to use it consistently due to a break out totally unrelated to this product (I have rosacea which has decided to flare).  My plan is to continue using this product and give it a chance to do its magic.  I believe it will happen... if the changes in my throat and chest area are any indication.</li>
            <li> 3 stars for now.  Just started using the product.  The serum is really thick- which is a good thing.  I usually mix it with fractionated coconut oil to thin it out a bit.  The dry skin on the corners of my mouth disappeared.  So, yay!  Will update at a later date.</li>
            <li> Since I had badly abused my skin and was over 75, my expectations were low; however, the cost was minimal.  After two months my skin is smoother, tighter, and much brighter and glowing.  The puffiness around and under my eyes is very minimal and I am even applying eye make-up again.  Truthfully, I receive comments continuously.  I am wearing a smile, feeling proud, youthful and returning to a bit of makeup after years of giving up.  I credit the Hyaluromic Acid Serum and both the Eucerin Q10 sensitive skin lotion and richer face cream (for night).  My skin has always been dry and sensitive.  It is now very soft and pretty.  No allergies or blemishes.</li>
            <li> Really like this, I have ordered 2 times and plan on ordering again when I am out</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A WHILE BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY RESULTS LIKE EVERYONE IS SAYING.STILL LOOKING FOR THAT SPECIAL CREAM AND I WILL NOT GIVE UP.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING</li>
            <li> Recieved these for free in return for  a positive feedback but I must honestly say it work great. Will keep using and update my findings</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She used Vitamin E before but likes the non oily look after on.</li>
            <li> Alternate nightly with another serum and my husband has complimented me every day. He&#x27;s noticed, that says alot. The smell is great. My typically sensitive skin loves this too. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product makes my skin feel. I have dry skin and has helped my face alot. Also has helped those dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a bottle Carrageenan, it&#x27;s highly comedogenic, I will be suprised  if you do not get a full face of acne.&lt;br /&gt;This is a total scam!!!</li>
            <li> Got this item for free. Worked wonders in my dry winter skin</li>
            <li> Purchased this with the Vitamin C Serum and I really love it. I don&#x27;t notice a strong smell. My skin feels very hydrated after using it for a week. Best feature is I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are looking smaller.</li>
            <li> Another awesome product from Insta-Natural. I&#x27;ve purchased 9 products (Argan Oil Hair Mask, Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask, Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum, Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles &amp; Bags, Vitamin C Facial Toner, Advanced Action Retinol Moisturizer and Age- Defying Moisturizer, Hyalunoric  Acid Serum) and I love all of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, but that&#x27;s about all it does for me.  I have been using it twice a day for a little while.  It does take the place of cream maybe, but that&#x27;s about all it&#x27;s done for me other than make me break out a little bit.  I use a day cream on top of it, so maybe the combination irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love for it to even out my skin tone, so I&#x27;ll continue using it and update later.</li>
            <li> I am a really satisfied customer and will be a loyal one to InstaNatural as long as they will continue to provide us with a great natural skin care products. I wasn&#x27;t fully convinced of the claim as the best Anti-Aging product. However, reading all the reviews I decided to give it a chance and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very light and you don&#x27;t have to use more than 4-5 drops. Please don&#x27;t forget to use toner. I use organic rose water toner before using any other products. The best part is it is natural and affordable and you don;t have to worry about being tossed out by TSA if you are flying :).&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t have any problem with the eye dropper system like others but I do understand why some people get frustrated about it. However, the dropper keeps it airtight and I dont have to worry about the bottle leaking in my hand bag.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it religiously twice a day after cleaning my face and dabbing some Jojoba oil after toner. So far I am a satisfied customer of this product.</li>
            <li> Very effective product.  Good for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week.  My skin feels softer. It will possibly take some time before noticeable reduction of lines.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half filled.</li>
            <li> so far so good. see some improvement. skin feels softer and smoother</li>
            <li> watery substance, not thick and creamy like I am used to in a serum.</li>
            <li> I want to return this product. It was a waste of money. I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> best vitamin c ever, just need 2 to 3 drops and not oily, been using for three weeks, like it more than Oz Naturals</li>
            <li> I used this serum for over a month and saw no difference at all. Granted, at my age of 68, I really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, but I do have under eye bags and some darkening under the eyes. I had hoped that this serum would help, but it did nothing for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described.</li>
            <li> Just when I though nothing was better than the Vitamin C serum I found this.  I like to put it on right after I have cleaned my face and before I put on any other cream.  It goes on very light and never leaves my skin feeling greasy.  I need to reorder soon.</li>
            <li> As a girl who honestly just loves the sun, I am constantly trying to hide my freckles and sun spots under layers of makeup. After trying Insta natural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid I will never do that again! This stuff actually gets rid of the spots so there is no need to cake the makeup on overtop of spots! The spots are gone! My skin isn&#x27;t dried out anymore &amp; it is actually helping with my acne problem as well! The packaging was good too and I love the way the glass bottle looks and feels. I would recommend this to any woman, or even man who has struggled with dry skin, dark spots or even just dull skin. This stuff will make your skin look and feel 100x better than it did before &amp; it&#x27;s affordable which I also like!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is working for me.  I have gotten a few compliments since starting using the Anti-Aging Skin serum.  It is much cheaper than facial lift.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell this quickly if this product is doing what it claims, but I love the feel of it on my face and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I LIKED THIS PRODUCT VERY MUCH. IT IS A CLEAR COLORED SERUM THAT I CAN USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RETINOL MOISTURIZER.  DEFINITELY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL LIKE IT STAYS MOISTURIZED THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND WILL USE IT REGULARLY.  I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I use this serum right after washing my face. It makes it feel smooth and supple. I follow it up with their Vitamin C serum . My skin definitely feels more hydrated and looks radiant.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry and flaky, but I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and my skin is much improved. No more dry, flaky patches!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this product. It feels wonderful going on the skin and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s a bit early to see much improvement in my skin but I can say that much of the dryness has gone.</li>
            <li> Great! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I feel I&#x27;m too young to really notice any &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; benefits but I believe in prevention over trying to cure after the fact. It feels nice and has a light floral scent. It feels like I&#x27;m giving my skin the vitamins and nutrient it needs. Skin feels fresh and soft throughout the day. Doesn&#x27;t break me out or anything. So I think it&#x27;d be good for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.. Thick substance but goes on ooooh so good.. Hope not to b without it..</li>
            <li> My wife says that her skin feels and looks fabulous.........so smooth. She is very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed 6 hyaluronic serums in the past year and this with every other instanatural product was by far the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this specific one is doing what it suppose to. I bought another brand prior to this one which was a 1 oz. bottle (sorry I need to find the name) and that one eliminated my smile wrinkles around my mouth but this one is not doing that. I will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> I use along with Vitamin C and appears to help with the aging process.</li>
            <li> First of all love the fact that is cruelty free, is completely natural and smell really good. I don&#x27;t trust many creams, since they normally don&#x27;t do much/nothing on my skin or my face react a bad way and It get worse. The first 2 or 3 times I put  InstaNatural I didn&#x27;t see much difference, that was because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent, one day I put it two days won&#x27;t. But once I start putting the serum every day before makeup, I started to see the difference my skin was much smoother and my puffiness was less than I normally have. And that was only one week using it everyday, I&#x27;m pretty sure I would see more good things as I continue using it everyday. I recommend this product to all those people that doesn&#x27;t like to have all those chemicals on their skin...and If you use them I highly recommend to change, natural is ALWAYS better! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot;*&lt;br /&gt;*InstaNatural send me this product to review it, but my opinions are my own.*</li>
            <li> This serum is great!  Very easy to use and works perfectly with the vitamin c powder I bought.  It dissolves the vitamin c quickly so I can have fresh vitamin c serum every day.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom to use as she researched this product extensively! She is very happy with the results she is seeing!</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this serum. It is definitely not a miracle worker, but after a few weeks of use I can see a minor difference in my frown lines. Mine lines are not deep inset lines yet, but being a contact wearer and working a computer all day I find myself always squinting and creating wrinkles between my brows. This stuff has seemed to minamize them somewhat. It doesn&#x27;t seem to overdry my skin or cause me to break out. Overall I like this product.</li>
            <li> had to throw it away couldnt get over the smell :(</li>
            <li> Only complaint is a little runny.  I want to contact seller to see why and ask if normal,  but they don&#x27;t leave option so I&#x27;ll write Amazon for assistance.  Might be normal but no one has mentioned it&#x27;s runny serum yet.  Goes on well doesn&#x27;t clog pores and feels clean.  Smells good.</li>
            <li> Perfect thank you for the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I have ordered other brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum before and this product by far has been the best. Plus, you get so much more of it than what other sellers offer. Price was good too! I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of use, my skin feels more moisturized and somehow fuller. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using for more results.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blend of several different serums. importantly C&amp;E. I usually mix my own serums -but I don&#x27;t really need to with this one.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this- seems to be brightening, only had it for a couple of days, but it seems quality.  Does not come with a pump.  It is a dropper.  Viscosity of this is just like aloe juice.</li>
            <li> Into my first bottle, but loving the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for about 4 weeks...I love it. Especially around my nose and mouth. Big difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skincell vial #29A - 1oz- 1% Hyaluronic Acid  @ $68.95 for over 10 years.  This product has 5% HA, 2 OZ...is a bit thicker( which is good- doesn&#x27;t run) and costs $15.97 for TWO oz!!!  I am VERY happy with this new product...the dropper is easy to apply right to facial skin....it feels BETTER than Skincell....I apply it first, then a moisturizer, and my makeup.  I highly recommend this for hydrating your skin!</li>
            <li> Used entire bottle.  O results. Very disappointed. However, product is very esay to apply and felt good on my face</li>
            <li> It is light and refreshing like witch hazel, which I believe is one of the ingredients.  It did not magically make me look younger.  I think it may have tightened my skin a bit, but I still have wrinkles and I still look like a 50 year old woman.  Great product though.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My face and neck skin soak this up like a sponge &amp; small lines &amp; wrinkles tend to diminish or disappear almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love it,after two weeks of use the wrinkles on my forehead reduced by 75%,my face looks fuller and smoother.Took years off my face.Love it</li>
            <li> This serum makes your face feel firm and smooth. I have been using it daily and it has worked well.</li>
            <li> It works by shrinking pours, it helped with some black heads too, and it makes my face feel soft.</li>
            <li> Is ok haven&#x27;t see much improvement but I still use it morning and night. I haven&#x27;t got any pimples or grease face though.</li>
            <li> Hydrates amazingly. I&#x27;m only 30 and I use this everyday with great benefit.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for 2 weeks, But I do see some improvement on my face,sun spots getting lighter.Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about two weeks and feel it is too early to access results.  I do like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month,I dont notice any difference ,nothing change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet...it leaves  sticky feel after its on.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My skin is brighter and softer.  I liked it so much i&#x27;ve already bought a second bottle!</li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;m satisfied with the product!  Thank you</li>
            <li> As soon as I appli, it tightens my skin. After a week, I can see some change on my skin.</li>
            <li> Neighbor asked  me &amp;#34; what cream are you using on your face?&amp;#34;  I guess that answers my question. Yes it is working.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it :)</li>
            <li> I have noticed fewer fine wrinkles and age spots are lightening within 2 wks. of use.</li>
            <li> When I read the 5 star reviews, I was skeptical as it seemed they were overly glowing and all from people who somehow got a discount or free for writing a review.  I received on time but didn&#x27;t start using for several weeks because I had other products to use up.  Now have been using once per day for a month and about 1/2 way thru the bottle.  Although not a fan of the dropper, would prefer a pump the product goes on easily and dries in a few minutes.  As recommended, I follow up with a moisturizer and it does indeed keep the moisturizer from immediately soaking in, in fact it seems like the moisturizer just sits on top of my skin. While I can certainly tell that my skin is more hydrated, I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s done anything for wrinkles yet. Maybe it&#x27;s more to keep you from developing more wrinkles rather than getting rid of existing ones?  In that case, I should have started using 30 years ago.  I may or may not reorder when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this product, I&#x27;ve not seen any difference in my complexion since I&#x27;ve been using this, although I am still using it.</li>
            <li> I have used EsterC serum for about ten years.Hyaluronic acid serum is easier to apply,quick drying and economical. Love it! I&#x27;m switching  :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried several HA and Vitamin C products and this one is by far the best bang for the buck! It&#x27;s a fabulous price and my skin is glowing and radiant I get compliments all the time. I even posted a vide review of this on my youtube channel:&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;k71JNFbYb18</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. I am sort of a collector of stream distilled flower hydro-sols and this product smells just like real, fresh rose water. I soaks in almost instantly and leaves a nice smooth feel with no greasiness or stickiness. I will continue to buy this product even if it doesn&#x27;t make me look 20 years younger. ;)</li>
            <li> Love that this product very much! Every item i have purchased from this company has been super high quality...</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated, but not weighed down and icky.  I have very oily skin with some dry spots.  I usually am worried about products causing my oiliness to increase, but this product does NOT cause that problem.  I use it morning and night and can tell that my skin is responding in a positive way to the healthy moisture that is being added.</li>
            <li> This feels really nice when applied to my dry skin. The winter weather has been really hard on my skin. When I use this, it smooths out the roughness, which is good for make-up application.</li>
            <li> I am using the serum and find it goes on well and soaks in fast.  I have the best results putting Vitamin C serum over it so that the skin stays soft and feels good.  Everyone is different in how their skin reacts. I am close to 80 and that could be a big factor how the serum goes on and feels. So, this comment shouldn&#x27;t be an absolute for someone else younger or who has different skin.</li>
            <li> This serum tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my face super soft! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing brown spots fading</li>
            <li> Helps with the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes and forehead</li>
            <li> The first bottle I got was like a gel. The second bottle was very runny. I think they mixed with water to sell more and make more money. I feel that they are not honest. The first bottle seemed to do something to my skin but not the second one. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Most wrinkle fade/removerproducts are just now worth the money. This product is wonderful! Don&#x27;t plan to ever stop using it! Tiny lines around my eyes and lips are almost completely gone. Skin feels smooth and wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is good product and I will buy it again. This is products that I try most.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night after washing my face. It is a gel consistency and soaks in very quickly without leaving my face feeling sticky like other products. I layer moisturizer over the top. I have seen a noticeable improvement in the tone of my face and how much more even it looks. While it does not erase deep wrinkles I feel like it is doing a great job on fine lines. This comes in a very generous sizes bottle and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, my skin feels tighter and is more clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a reviewer, aside from the fact I spend too much of my day ordering anything that looks remotely beneficial from Amazon. But alas, I found something that works. I love every Instanatural product I&#x27;ve tried. This product  works wonders post chemical peel and makes it super soft. Added bonus is that my skin is glowing! My boyfriend, who hardly notices when I cut my hair, had told me multiple times how nice my skin looks since I switch to instanatural products. I have no complaints. This serum isalso really good on the lips then follow with vitamin E oil for super soft kissers!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I have been using it twice a day and have definitely seen improvement in my skin would  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly. I&#x27;m using with a derma roller.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product 2 times a day morning and night and have not seen any difference in my skin tone. I am a little disappointed I will continue thank you</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about this Serum.  I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to notice improvement in my skin.  But then, as is the case with most anti-aging products, there are no overnight miracles.  Over time, I may see a difference.  This hyaluronic acid serum is my first experience in using a serum.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product that has improved my skin tone.  As a 75 year old woman, I thought I was too old for anything to work.  I was wrong.  This is a must have on my shelf of daily routine.</li>
            <li> keeps my wrinkles at bay, smooth, even skin</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and it certainly has helped my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This serum just absorbs into my skin so quickly!  My face and neck feel smoother and firmer.  And It maybe too soon to tell, but my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and lips have softened!!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It smells a little weird but I really like the effects so far.</li>
            <li> great stuff n really works! i&#x27;ll be an Insta Naturals customer again, because all their stuff is excellent!</li>
            <li> I Totally recommend this product &amp; seller. My skin is more toned, looks healthier &amp; feels so soft. I use it twice a day most days. Best price on the net with this seller.</li>
            <li> Love it Love it! I have noticed my skin is supple and soft.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum I give it 5 stars. My face looks alive again&lt;br /&gt;it was looking dull and no glow at all. I have spent so much money on trying&lt;br /&gt;beauty products that just didn&#x27;t work for me. I did not see any results even down to the&lt;br /&gt;last bit n the jar. I was so desperate to get my glow back. So I did some research on skin&lt;br /&gt;and came across this Hyaluronic Acid Serum it has all the ingredients that I had researched.&lt;br /&gt;so I decided to give it try. So glad I did My face is clearer, brighter more youthful looking. I have&lt;br /&gt;my glow back because of this product. Money well spent plus you get 20z vs.1.0z</li>
            <li> Lovely product! With no chemical plus is vegan friendly and cruelty free. I have used too many brands since 12 years old, but this brand is one of the brand which I will buy again.  Prices are more than fair, good quality.</li>
            <li> very good product so far&lt;br /&gt;makes the skin feel great -my dark spots are getting much lighter&lt;br /&gt;my skin much more youthful looking  -not bad for a sixty year old woman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I like the product however I have been using it twice a day for two weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any difference.  I use it with a Vit C product as well as an eye cream.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some results.</li>
            <li> Great product works well.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing when I put it on. I use it every morning and night. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my face.  Loving my Instanaturals</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long to notice a different in fading age spots, but it makes my skin feel super soft. I love that it is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Love it. ! It makes my skin feel so good. It does not irritate it at all. I have very sensitive skin and was worried about it.</li>
            <li> Great price and love that it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. the small red spot that have started appearing on my arms and torso are going away. I have had Rosea for 10 years or more on my chest. It got so bad I stopped wearing necklaces because it would call attention to my upper chest. This has really helped my self image. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum immediately started working on taking it away almost immediately. I will never be without this stuff. I just cannot say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long. Maybe a few weeks but so far I do not have any issues. My skin is very sensitive so I have to be careful introducing new products. My only complaint is that because this is fast absorbing you have to work really quickly otherwise it will be dry before you have time to spread over your entire face and neck. There have been several times where I had to apply more because it dried too quick.</li>
            <li> miracle cure for leather like skin!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum and I really like it. It helps moisturize my face without that greasy feeling. It has a very light feel to it and does not clog my pores. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Highly recommend to anyone!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it, will post results later.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it works. I got it for a great price and my order came in fast.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and dries quickly.  My skin feels and looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum as it has really helped make my skin glow. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and have noticed an improvement in my skin condition. My face used to be dull and dry, but recently I&#x27;ve been having less break outs, less acne and less scarring. I believe this serum helped to improve my skin condition dramatically. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this serum to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  This serum is thick unlike others I have tried.  Great value for money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it 2x a day for about a month. I noticed the puffiness around my eyelids has gone down and I the fine lines seem less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for several weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency and it dries quickly. The scent of it is not bothersome and the bottle seems to go a long way. However, the serum did make my skin feel as if it were burning the first several times I used it which I was assured was normal  by other Hyaluronic acid users and it has never bothered me again. However, while it hydrates my skin to some degree I wouldn&#x27;t say that it has had much of an effect otherwise and Vitamin C serums have acted much better at soothing my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not really sure what all the hype in the reviews is about.</li>
            <li> Really love the texture and consistency of this product my skin feels soft and smooth.”</li>
            <li> This product works at making my skin look  and me feeling good about my skin!</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully - instant softness to your skin, clearer-looking skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Loves this product! It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and us never sticky like some serums. Great value for the money. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Good elixir, not so good moisturizer. It helped clear my skin tho and I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always hesitant about using something new. This caused a bit of a reaction. Enough so that I won&#x27;t use again but I do have a friend who will welcome this product to her skin care regimen. The reason I&#x27;m posting this is because their Customer Service Department is fantastic. No questions asked, they issued me a refund when I told them it didn&#x27;t work me. That&#x27;s marvelous in my book.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product...it actually does what they say it will do!</li>
            <li> This is a nice serum. I can feel it working. No stinging just my skin soaks it up. My skin looks and feels so smooth and even. I love this line. Will be looking for more&lt;br /&gt;Of their products for continued skincare.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks. Not what I expected.  I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic Acid products that have worked better.  I do like that it is not quite as harsh as others, I&#x27;m assuming because of the aloe. My eyes aren&#x27;t too puffy, but I get that from other products as well.  To me it feels like nothing more than plain Aloe-my face feels exactly the same as when I&#x27;ve used organic Aloe on my face.  I expected my face to feel a little tighter, not show wrinkles as much.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and see if I change how I feel.  The one I use at night does exactly what I want, but leaves my face a little greasy...I have oily skin so I don&#x27;t want any more grease during the day, so was hoping this was going to do what I wanted.  So far it&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. yes it smells like roses but that&#x27;s it. It does not absorb easily and I woke up with my face covered in oil. eww. I want my money back please. My order number is: 103-8775332-8934607. thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this item. Thank you and I&#x27;ll orderr it again soon.</li>
            <li> Omg this serum and the other are wonderful! Ty</li>
            <li> Excellent product--I have rosacea and this is the best facial product I have used. My complexion has improved considerably.  I shall continue to use it twice daily. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Has help my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have been becoming more aware of my complexion changes as each birthday passes me by and looking for something to help me age gracefully-er.. I love this product!  It helps my face feel moisturized and supple with out feeling dry and it is very light and dries fast.  I put it on at night and in the morning under my make up.  I have already seen a change in my complexion, tiny lines are are going away and it seems to be evening out my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it!</li>
            <li> Ive been using it every morning and night for about 2 weeks now.  It s too soon to tell if this product is really working, however its not worsening my skin so im just gonna jeep using it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Love it! seen results in less than two weeks</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product!  Works just as well as the high priced items out there and I like all the natural extras that are added with this item.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have sensitive skin that responds negatively to chemicals, so I am always looking for affordable natural products. Non-greasy formula that makes skin so soft and hydrated. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Been using for a month now and my face is clearing up and looking younger. My 13 year old son has been using a little for his pimples and they are completely gone, truly amazing. He has been using proactive for awhile with little results and w in 2 wks of using your product his skin looks amazing. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Great product! Every time I use it I notice that my face looks cleaner and it helps a lot with dryness. The serum is more gel-like than liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, 2oz for this price is the best deal in my opinion. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C. As I  was in the process of reordering it I noticed the Insta-Natural brand serum. After reading all the reviews and doing a  price comparison (twice as much product for about the same price) I thought I would give it a try. Turns out I like it better! It has a much thicker texture so I actually use less. Plus it is more moisturizing so I don&#x27;t even use moisturizer over it. I just like the way my skin feels without the added layer on it. My makeup goes on beautifully right over the Insta-Natural serum and looks great all day. Sure glad I got out of my comfort zone and tried something new. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No noticeable impact one way or another</li>
            <li> Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid. I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Insta-Natural’s Hyaluronic with Vitamin C and Vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other products of this nature, this one came in a 2-oz. pump bottle. It has a semi-thick texture to it, and it applies evenly. I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far. You can literally feel the skin tighten after applying it. It is not sticky and absorbs nicely. The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that is the way it is. Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> new face primer for the new century, amazing and just when i thought i was done for here comes a product that literally saved me from sudden disaster, i lost my normal primer, honestly i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so i decided to use this instead on my eye lids because mine are so oily. after i washed my face i added a few tiny drops of this before putting on my eye shadow and it never moved all day! What a life saver! Not oily or greasy like you would think it would be, and my skin just drinks it up like it was the only thing it has seen this good in a long long time!</li>
            <li> After put it on my face, it dries quick and I can feel the tightness on my face.</li>
            <li> Remarkable! Keeps skin moist,diminishes fine lines ,shrinks pores.... A miracle in a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, can&#x27;t do without it.Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried so many of them .This one is the best</li>
            <li> it feels so silky..i just need a little more time to see how my wrinkles do...it does seem to hydrate well. so far so good</li>
            <li> With daily use, my skin appearance improved a lot. I feel naked if i don&#x27;t put that serum on. One bottle goes for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> The serum is too think on my facial skin,my skin isn&#x27;t soft or smooth feeling, not soft to my touch, it does do a good job on my hands, the skin is thinner on my hands than on my face has a thick dermis. Sorry it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness under my eyes at all are the frown lines on my forehead and between my eyes, I really wanted to rid face of these problem areas. my neck area appears somewhat better, I have to use it further to really tell, skin is loose still. I don&#x27; t like the thickness of the gel at all.</li>
            <li> I use this after cleansing, rose water face toning and before applying argan oil and sunscreen. It has really improved my skin tone and skin texture. Everything feels tighter and my coloring has evened out. This is a really great value for Hyaluronic Acid and having it in a separate bottle allows me to use as little or as much as I feel necessary, which I like better than using products that already have Hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the products for review free of charge. I was not compensated in any other way. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> So far so good.. I haven&#x27;t been using it long but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy skin care promises because (1) thought I&#x27;d tried them all and (2) I figure in my 60th decade of life only a face lift will help this mug. However, there is always hope, right? I ordered this serum due to reviews. Imagine my surprise when the deep lines on my cheeks actually softened after only three applications. No kidding! My embarrassing huge (years of smoking) pores have visibly tightened. Didn&#x27;t need the magnifier to see the improvement.  I love the consistency is thick, feels more potent &amp; less scary than &#x27;acid&#x27; may feel,  if that makes sense. Very gentle on my skin, love it! Will be telling all my friends about this.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  It goes on smoothly, has no smell, it seems to be working well on all areas except for the deep wrinkles around my upper lip. I expect this will take more time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I have to say I really like it for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s affordable. I&#x27;ve purchased other hyaluronic acid serums for the same price, but they were half the size. This is a full 2oz for the same price as other very similar products. More expensive does not always mean better.&lt;br /&gt;- It works. Your skin naturally contains hyaluronic acid, but the amount decreases with age. Hyaluronic acid helps your skin stay moisturized. So by adding a hyaluronic acid serum to your skincare regimen you&#x27;ll be helping whatever moisturizer you use work better by helping your skin better retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s simple. It&#x27;s a light weight formula, it&#x27;s not sticky, it dries smooth, it feels nice on your skin, it makes your skin feel supple, and it&#x27;s good for your skin at almost any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you have normal to dry skin definitely should use a moisturizer after using this product (or any hyaluronic acid serum). I have normal to oily skin and I use this serum in the morning before applying a lightweight moisturizer prior to applying any foundations, and then again after washing my face in the evening I apply this serum (allow it to dry for a few minutes while brushing my teeth) and then apply a moisturizer, preferably one with retinol before bed. In the summer I don&#x27;t always use a moisturizer during the day, so I will sometimes just go with the hyaluronic acid serum before I apply my makeup to avoid getting oily in my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly my skin looks the best it has in many years. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to make their skin look and feel better/younger. I am very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased my 2nd bottle of this and I&#x27;m still loving the results!!  Great, quality product!!&lt;br /&gt;____________________&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Instanatural LLC&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 6 days after order date&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Item was packaged in it&#x27;s own separate box (see pic) inside of larger box containing other items.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.ems. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for the price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but it felt nice</li>
            <li> Love the product, just put in another order before it runs out.</li>
            <li> After a few applications skin looks damage, fried</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle.  I am 67  and I am using the serum in conjunction with the Vitamin C serum in my daily facial care routine.  My husband agrees with me that my skin is looking good. ;)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I saw it was suggested along with the skin rollers.  I have treated my face regularly over the past few years for spots and they continue to come more and more every summer on my face and chest.  Now I have NEVER treated my chest for age spots, until now and I must say I&#x27;ve used this going on 3 months and just noticed the other day that my chest looks sooo much better.  I&#x27;m early 40&#x27;s so i&#x27;ve def got some sun damage on both face/chest and just thought my chest was too far gone.  I rarely buy the same product over and over - always trying something new, but I do believe I&#x27;ve found my favorite.  Ordering Bottle #3 now.  Highly recommend.  Wish I had before/after pics for you as I love looking at those - but I could honestly say this has taken at least 5 years off my chest, my face also is better - just not as noticeable as my chest as it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Product worked somewhat ,maybe one bottle is not  enough. I don&#x27;t like the blue bottle,can&#x27;t see how much serum is actually in that blue bottle</li>
            <li> It is a nice product. I olny used Hyaluronic serum from OZ  before, so that is my frame or reference. This is a bit lower price than that and you get more quantitiy. The cons are it is a mixture oh Hyluronic with E vitamin etc oils. I should say i liked the OZ pure Hyaluronic a bit better, but that is not to say this product is not good. It is exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased and used two bottles of another product this company made. But what I sought aftet was the extra moisturization, and decided to try the hyaluronic acid serum. I bought a hyaluronic acid years ago that worked wonders for my skin, but at $75/bottle, I couldn&#x27;t justify going to the mall for that one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hyaluronic acid serum did not bring any extra moisture to my skin. It smells strongly of witch hazel, and goes on with only a slightly more viscous feel than witch hazel; it&#x27;s watery in its application. I don&#x27;t use witch hazel on my skin because it has a tendency to dry my skin some, though, not excessively. So to me, this seemed to be counterproductive for what hyaluronic acid is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company does offer money back, which I find to be great. That&#x27;s service is what gets the third star. The product itself is only a 2-star.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing serum I am using it every night followed by  Super Youth Retinol Moisturiser. The serum is a little sticky at first but once applied to the face sinks in very well. The Retinol is nice and creamy leaves the skin feeling very soft</li>
            <li> My sister recommended that I try this product. I have only used it for one week, but it is possible that is helping lessen some hyper pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft. Also like how it feels tightened after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reached age 65, and I&#x27;d been bothered by a steady decline in my skin&#x27;s appearance for the past five years. I happened to remember that until age 60, I&#x27;d taken H.A. by capsule. People told me my skin looked great. I happened to quit taking H.A. about then, unfortunately, and over the following years I began to notice that my skin wasn&#x27;t so great looking and feeling. I thought it was just aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I began to wonder about H.A. again, and came across this serum. I was pleased within days of starting to use it! My facial color is even, and minor blemishes and a new set of wrinkles are gone, too. This time I&#x27;m going to continue with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d wondered if it&#x27;d be annoying to use, but it sure isn&#x27;t. The liquid clings to the eyedropper, doesn&#x27;t drip, and I use my fingertips to apply the serum, which feels like water when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also gone back to taking H.A. by capsule. My whole body seems to need more H.A., and it&#x27;s great for more than just my face.</li>
            <li> Serum goes on smoothly, is odorless and silky. Quick shipping. Super great customer service!! I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few days but I really love it. Make sure to use moisturizer after application of this product as it is a serum and not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum for the day and a stronger one for nights. I read their directions about using a cleanser, then a toner, then this serum, then a moisturizer. It may look like a cumbersome regime, but it is pretty easy and quick to do. I like the results. If I get acne, it goes away quicker. I&#x27;ve been out in the sun lately and at a pool with chlorine. My face still feels soft and I like the overall smoothness. So, I&#x27;m happy and will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> for the price the best I will reorder again</li>
            <li> I like the way my skin feels, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a significant change on my skin apart that it&#x27;s moisturizing......</li>
            <li> I purchased a 2oz bottle of Insta Natural Hyaluronic serum and it smells nasty, like it has gone bad, even though the bottle was sealed on arrival, with plastic wrap on the cap. I am unsure if I should try it on my skin (I am a first time buyer of this product so I am also unsure if the smell is the normal for this product)? It is also very thick compared to other Hylauronic products I have tried.  I purchased it because of the value for money and to do a comparison to Oz Naturals Hyaluronic serum which is a good product and has a nice smell to it. I would greatly appreciate some feedback from the seller on my concern. The Insta Naturals Vitamin C serum is nice and smell like citrus, it is however also a very thick serum, I will be using it from today!  Delivery of items was very fast, hence the 2 stars, I will review stars once I receive feedback from the seller, thank you.</li>
            <li> MAKES MY SKIN LOOK YOUNGER LOOKING</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge difference in my skin since using this product. I am combination dry so I do like to mix this with my moisturizer to keep me hydrated. I recommend using this with a moisturizer as well for those who are dry. It is thick so a lot goes a long way, you only need a little to get the job done. However, I do like how it makes my skin feel supple. My only concern is some other reviews I read claim this is non comdogenic which is of a concern to me as i am someone with larger pores. Will have do do research but i had not seen any disadvantages to using this product so far.</li>
            <li> For the price and the reviews, I honestly thought it was going to do significant things. (wishful thinking on my part) I followed all directions listed on the product which were pretty simple.  It won&#x27;t hurt you.  It makes your face smoother but it&#x27;s just a temporary effect.  There has been no permanent noticeable difference on my eye areas which of course are most everybody&#x27;s concern.  So my opinion is basically - it won&#x27;t hurt your face but it will hurt your wallet.  Save your money - buy a good lotion and wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Really good for all types of skin and all ages!</li>
            <li> I feel that my wrinkles are decreasing</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for more than 3 weeks and and I would like to know how long It takes to see any tangible change on my skin?</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 2 weeks and I really love it.  I have oily skin but use this product at night to help nourish without adding additional oil.  When I wake up my skin looks refreshed and supple but not oily.  It also is very gentle and I have not had any problems with breakouts. It is a great light moisturizer!  I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I started using product within a few days I have already seen a difference ....so far wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It goes on smooth and helps those crows feet around my eyes fly away. I&#x27;m getting of an age where I&#x27;m seeing lines and wrinkles. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;m seeing less of them. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. After the serum dries you can put your makeup on as usual.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Would highly recommended ....my skin is smooth after one month of using every day!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am very pleased and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used product for 8 weeks with no results.  The reviews are fabulous and I was hopeful, but it did not diminish the appearance of smile lines and forehead lines.  Oh well, on to the next thing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Instanatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about two weeks and I absolutely love it.  About five months ago I severely burnt my skin with baking soda. My skin was already over exfoliated by using Tretinoin Cream 0.025%. The protective barrier around my sinus area was (is) completely removed leaving my skin red with a burning sensation for 4 months. During this time I tried everything (natural products) and nothing seemed to help my skin retain moisture. I looked old and wrinkly whereas a few months before I looked 5 to 10 years younger than my age. During this dark period I also went on vacation to two sunny destinations which caused a lot of hyper pigmentation on my face (area w/out the skin barrier). I wore a hat and sunscreen religiously but the reflection of the sun from the water and wind burnt my delicate and injured skin.  During my search for a holy grail product I came across the Instanatural line.  I needed a moisturizer that would help maintain moisture in my parched skin and this product along with several other products in this line do the job!  The hyaluronic acid serum makes my skin brighter and supple. It evens out my skin tone and lighten the occasional pimple marks. This product brighten the dark patches around the sinus area. The serum gets absorbed immediately and it does not leave a greasy feel. I use this serum after the rose water toner and follow by the emu oil and sunscreen. I switch between the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C &amp; Feluric Acid Serum.  I hope with continue use these products will help me get rid of the deeper marks. I highly recommend the Instanatural line. The products are wonderful and so is the customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful serum for anti aging and for keeping the face exfoliated . What I love about it is that even though its packed with powerful ingredients its did not make my skin look red or flaky as some other serums I have used before have done .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear gel like serum that goes on the face easily and absorbs very quickly so you can than put on your makeup or your moisturizer. It has a Light Fresh scent and is a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is really different about this serum is that most of the time when you use a serum with Hyaluronic acid in it the face can feel dry and tight I have used serums like this and its a very uncomfortable feeling. This serum glides on and drys quickly but does not give you that tight feeling . It also dose not pill when using product like makeup or moisturizers on top of it. I cant tell you how much I hate putting my makeup on top a serum and finding that it will roll off or pill off as I&#x27;m applying it. I was so happy to find out that this serum worked very well with my foundation and my sunscreen . Always be sure and use a sunscreen when using any kind of serum with  Hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample of this serum in order that make an informed review and my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Great product I love the dispenser and the consistency, it&#x27;s like a gel and it smells so good to me kind a like Aloe, also I like how it feels on my face it really gives me an instant moisture, I am really new on skin care but I really feel good about the ingredients,  I like this company the customer service are very thoughtful and I would definitely try more of their products and strongly recommend this if you are looking for a natural healthy moisturizer and even more protection for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the way this hydrates without feeling like you have anything on your face!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing customer service. Feels like your doing business with someone local. Wish they had a larger line of products!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. No skin reactions. Feels very light, absorbs quickly. No heavy face residue.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because it is in a colored bottle to protect the vitamin C.I have reordered this twice, I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 ( shhhhh,don&#x27;t tell anyone) and I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. After I slide it on to my face, neck and decolletage, I wait a few moments, and then apply my favorite Vitamin A Retinol Cream. Prior to this combo, I was using very pricey Dr Perricone and Lancome products. The new products are way better. People stop me in stores to tell me how beautiful my skin is; my DOCTOR noticed the glow from my face; my pharmacist even told me I had beautiful skin! 3 in one day! The hyaluronic acid seeps into your skin, making it look plumper. I&#x27;m going to start using it on the backs of my hands, where women truly show their age, first and foremost.</li>
            <li> Since I am eighty, I am probably to old to judge but I really didn&#x27;t find any improvement.  I have few fine lines but need help around mouth and eyes and this just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried several hylauronic acid products, from Cosmedica, to Skinceuticals (the 0.5% and the 1% ultra moisturizing mask). I purchased Insta Natural&#x27;s during a promotion, and here&#x27;s what I have to say after using it for a few days: the product is high quality, at an affordable price. It contains many beneficial ingredients, and a 5% hyaluronic acid, which is pretty high compared to other products in the market.  I apply it after my Vitamin C in the morning, and during the day as needed.  The product absorbs quickly, leaving no residue or tacky feeling.  For this reason, I prefer it over the Skinceuticals B5 mask, which always feels sticky on my skin.  Insta Natural&#x27;s is far superior to Cosmedica&#x27;s, at about the same price (if not cheaper).  Additionally, Insta Natural&#x27;s product does not contain alcohol.  In sum, I will repurchase in the future for sure.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change to my skin, plus it smells.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. First time I tried it my face was on fire. Even after I washed it off the burning lasted for about 12 hrs.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again... I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and this product really helped my skin and my dark spots... I never really had acne as a teenager but something happened after I had my baby. My skin began to break out and this has really cleared it up... Finally something that works😀</li>
            <li> Looks and feels just like water. Do not like this at all, and would never recommend it!</li>
            <li> My (old) normal routine was wash, pat dry, and moisturize.  I began to notice that time (or wisdom?) was catching up and the wrinkles really bothered me, as did the larger pores, lack of elasticity, etc.  Looking around I noticed a lot of hype about hyaluronic acid.  I initially chose InstaNaturals due to their ingredients, then the rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as instructed, but I didn&#x27;t have toner, so I skipped that step.  I was using aloe vera &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; as moisturizer.  I did this twice a day, and after a couple days, I saw minor improvement in the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and even skintone!  The wrinkles, they didn&#x27;t magically disappear, yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks - I&#x27;m stunned!  My skin looks years younger, my under chin and neck are not saggy, the layers of bags under my eyes are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion, if you can&#x27;t afford a 3-step routine, buy one at a time, you&#x27;ll see a difference, and a little really goes a long way (this will last a LONG time), when you get a 3-step routine - you&#x27;ll want to take a before and after- I wish I did!!, this is the company to go to.  If you have questions about which trio to use, or how to apply them, etc., they will respond - they&#x27;re amazingly customer service oriented.  I&#x27;ll never buy from another company again.  This is my go-to company that has literally, somehow, found the &amp;#34;fountain of youth&amp;#34; in a perfect combo of natural ingredients that don&#x27;t irritate the skin (I&#x27;m using this, the Vit C toner, and night cream), don&#x27;t feel heavy, great price, no gross chemicals... My suggestion, if you can&#x27;t afford a 3-step routine, buy one at a time, you&#x27;ll see a difference, and a little really goes a long way (this will last a LONG time), when you get a 3-step routine - you&#x27;ll want to take a before and after- I wish I did!!</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Other products continue to &amp;#34;promise&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; amazing results. I read the reviews of a similar product, touted by TV talk show host Dr. Oz, with basically the same ingredients at a price of $99 for a 1 oz. bottle. I say basically the same ingredients because of course until you pay for it and receive it--you aren&#x27;t able to see ALL of the ingredients. Additionally, they keep your credit card information and send you recommended supplies...all for the $99 plus shipping...about every 3 weeks.  This type of scam is not for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came looking for a well reviewed product on Amazon, with essentially the same ingredients. I was impressed by SETAF&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hyaluronic Acid Serum&amp;#34; advertisement. The ingredients are clearly defined, the packaging is basic and sealed, and this company offers it with Amazon Prime.  This is where the truth comes in: IT WORKS!  I cleaned my face and applied small amounts of the serum on my face and neck. Wish I had taken &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures because after only 3 days I could definitely see results!  I&#x27;m 66 years old, and while I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles, I am conscious of the crow&#x27;s feet &amp; laugh lines, along with a loosening of my jaw line. Now after 2 weeks, the crow&#x27;s feet are hardly visible. The laugh line wrinkles and firming up the jaw-line are taking a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my facial skin is brighter with a more even tone.  I&#x27;m not going to say, &amp;#34;Wow, I can&#x27;t believe it--I look 5, 10, 20 years younger&amp;#34; (You pick the age promised by the other products). However, my skin FEELS younger, firmer, fresher and that is important to me. I just ordered a second bottle although with this serum 2 ounces is obviously going to last at least 60 days or more. I just wanted to make sure I have a good supply on hand at this great Prime price. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  Goes on smoothly, slight rose scent.  I would definitely recommend for the product itself and the price.  Very reasonable, and makes your skin nice and smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating serum, I have been using for  a month now, and I can tell the difference in my skin it feels softer and even, i put this on after my face clean and i also use this on my neck, i use it morning nd night</li>
            <li> After a week of using HAS... It&#x27;s showing some signs of improvement in my skin. Blemishes are fading away after a week.. That&#x27;s good news for me.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to inform the company, but, this serum actually dried out my skin.  I have used vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;serums over the years from Cellex C to SkinPseudicals (top expensive brands);&lt;br /&gt;So, all I gather is that it must be the hyaluronic acid in the product.  Guess I&#x27;m with the other&lt;br /&gt;lower scores that admit the same result.  It&#x27;s doing the opposite of what I expected.  Dr. Oz&lt;br /&gt;and his guests don&#x27;t always get it right -- not for every person anyway.</li>
            <li> After hearing a lot of buzz about this product, I decided to give it a try. The price was low enough that I thought it wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world if I didn&#x27;t like it.  I am so glad I purchased this.  I have never used a serum before so I don&#x27;t know how this compares to other similar serums out there. But I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  I wash my face, then use a toner, and apply this serum before my moisturizer.  It soaks into the skin nicely and leaves me skin feeling soft - not greasy or oily at all.  I definitely have noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin, and I have noticed slight fading of some dark spots on my face.  I will definitely continue to use this and am eager to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it got lost in the mail but they sent me another bottle, I been using it for a few days now and I really like the way my face feels and looks, definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> does make skin feel smooth; no odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this serum, it makes my skin soft and glowy. I will definitely tell&lt;br /&gt;my friends and family about it. thank you for such great customer service service.</li>
            <li> With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  It&#x27;s easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  My skin soaked it up and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  I use the Vitamin C Serum sold by same company first, then this serum afterwards for even more effect.  This serum is on the thicker side and the Vitamin C Serum is thinner.  This serum can be used day and night and does not interfere with makeup at all.  I can feel it soak up all of it into my skin leaving no residue, but if I keep putting more on, it gets to a point where my skin is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; and then it takes longer to soak in.  Experimenting with this shows me exactly how much to put on.  I usually put on enough Vitamin C that my skin has soaked it all up and is &amp;#34;full&amp;#34;, then I put this on until my skin feels &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; - then I wait 10 minutes before putting on makeup.  That&#x27;s more than enough time for all of it to soak in, leaving my skin plump, hydrated and no leftover residue.  It has made a big difference in lightening my dark spots, evening skin tone, plumping and smoothing out skin in general.  It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  I have oily skin and this is a great moisturizer without adding any oiliness.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  It&#x27;s definitely a great value and very easily incorporated into any skin care regime.  I use the Proactive + and this product complements it nicely.  I had gotten to a point with the Proactive + where my skin tone was not improving any more and with the addition of using this serum, my skin has started improving again.  It was probably not able to improve without the nutrients it was lacking.  This is a great product and highly recommended!lacking.  This is a great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am using this serum daily before the anti-aging moisturizer.  My skin is already showing visible results after only a week of daily use. This is a great product at a fantastic price.  You don&#x27;t need to pay huge prices to get good results and this product is as good as some of the higher priced serums.  Be sure to give it time to dry before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent serum.  The aging skin on my face feels plumper and softer. I use this serum with Instanaturals&#x27; emu oil, and my face has a healthy glow.  My only complaint (I&#x27;ll live with it, though) is the packaging.  The serum is too thick to go through the dropper provided.  You have to just sorta scoop it out.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past from a different company. This is just as good and the price is right. I am 57 and this product helps improves the overall look of my face and neck area. It was shipped in a timely manner and arrived sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for 2 weeks now, and so far i really liked it and i havent got any pimples which is really important for me, I got this product on  a discount.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. I am hispanic, but very light complected. When I scar, acne or otherwise they are very dark and hyperpigmented. This has helped to reduce the tone of the scars. Also being in Utah this is amazing in the winter when the cold weather dries your skin making every one of those wrinkles stand out front and center.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bent between 3 and 4 stars on this one. I like it because it is hyaluronic acid, and this it is very very good for skin moisture... BUT (yes, you knew that was coming, right? :-)... It is a little thin. I ordered this HA serum because it was cheaper than the brand I &amp;#34;normally&amp;#34; use, Oz Naturals. Not only was it cheaper, but the bottle is twice as big as the Oz Naturals bottle. So I ordered it, and have been using it for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the catch, however... Comparing it to Oz Naturals, this serum is half as thick. I presume this means that they use half as much HA to make the serum. I would MUCH rather use thicker, more potent serum bc by the time you need to use it, your skin can use as much help as it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the rest of the review, the serum comes in a blue glass bottle with a glass dropper. Personally, I like that it comes in the colored bottle because it blocks sunlight, and many substances break down due to light. Since it is a little on the thick side (though not as thick as the Oz Naturals stuff), it does stick to the exterior of the eye dropper. Not a big deal to me, I simply put some on my finger tips and apply. As I mentioned, it is not as thick as the other stuff, although they have similar ingredients, aloe being the first (which is also a thickener). Both also have witch hazel within the top five ingredients... Not so desirable, and seems counter-productive to the HA action.</li>
            <li> I tend to use different serums for different skin concerns. I stick with hyaluronic acid/aloe serums in the winter because they&#x27;re so good at moisturizing. (I get dry skin from walking my dog outside in the cold. Hyaluronic acid is particularly good at hanging on to water.) And then I use antioxidant serums in the summer to help protect against sun damage. Vitamin C and green tea are great for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is one of the first I&#x27;ve seen that has both moisturizing ingredients and antioxidant ingredients. So it could be used year-round if you wanted. I like that -- fewer containers cluttering up the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this about twice a day for a week and a half now. First I cleanse and use a toner, then this, then add additional moisturizer and sunscreen. I feel a small amount of tightening as it dries on my skin (think this is providing some immediate help with fine lines). Since hyaluronic acid is so moisturizing, it also helps with wrinkles and fine lines over time. I have not experienced any allergic or sensitivity-type reactions (I do have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dropper this comes with to put about 4-5 drops in the palm of one hand, then apply it to my face a bit at a time. It&#x27;s pretty thick and almost holds its shape when I drop it into my hand. However, it isn&#x27;t sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the action of other skincare products, and it&#x27;s so far been fine to use under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing that bears mentioning: this isn&#x27;t tested on animals and none of the ingredients are derived from animals. The hyaluronic acid comes from a plant source. So if you are vegan or interested in using cruelty-free products, you should definitely give this a chance. (It&#x27;s also quite affordable!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman and starting to notice more lines, puffiness, and a bit of a gobble neck.  This has made a huge difference.  I have been using it for a couple of months, and just reordered.  I use it in the morning before I put on my moisturizer and at night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Winter is coming, it&#x27;s time to HYDRO-NATE... or hibernate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently discovered this amazing brand, InstaNatural! I bought the line, so I am going to dissect each product one by one. When looking for a new skin care routine, one of the things I was concerned about, was making sure that I could return the product if I wasn&#x27;t happy with it. InstaNatural gives you a 100% lifetime guarantee that you will LOVE their products! This brand confidence, made me want to take a chance on them and I am so glad I did! I have been using these products for a week now and I can already see a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View my full review on my blog, ABQ Inspired.</li>
            <li> so far i like it. that is why i order another bottle.</li>
            <li> I had purchased two other products from this company that I like very much.  They offered to send me a bottle of this for free to try.  In the past I have tried other hyaluronic acid products because I read so many great things about them.  Every time my skin would get dryer, but I tried this anyway.  Just like in the past my skin got drier and I just could not figure it out until I found a website that explained that for some people the acid pulled the moisture out of the skin, especially common in humid climates and it doesn&#x27;t get much more humid than East Texas.  The website said the way to rectify the situation was to make sure your face was wet when the product was applied so that the acid could lock the moisture in.  Now I always leave my face wet and apply and I love it!  I am purchasing another bottle now.</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I have bought of the HA serum. I think the formula has changed a little. The serum feels thinner to me. Perhaps this is the preference of some since the thicker serum was a little harder to dispense...nonetheless, I preferred the thicker formulation.</li>
            <li> I see a slight differ already.  I&#x27;m a new user with premature aging from alot of sun exposure. It has helped with the fine lines and make my skin feel better. I use it in the morning under my moisturizer.  My make goes on nicer. I&#x27;m 53 and I wish I knew this products ingredients sooner</li>
            <li> Great product!  Hydrates my skin and the look and feel is so much better.  Customer service is incredible as well.  I highly recommend this product as well as all of their products.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out worse than when i was a teenager! If you have mixed- oily skin- stay away!&lt;br /&gt;I got it because its supposedly oil free and read in articles that its a good way for mixed and oily skin to be moisturized- Nope! Not at the expense of multiple angry pustules 2 days after using it. (Hadn&#x27;t had such a breakout in 7-8 years)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps to erase wrinkles - but maybe iust prevents from having more. But it also helps to get rid of bruises</li>
            <li> Improvement was slow but definitely noticeable once I stopped using the product. My skin is more supple and the wrinkles are minimized with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle wrinkle buster, this is not it.  However, I&#x27;ve been using this on my face, neck, and chest for about two weeks and I&#x27;m seeing positive change!  I&#x27;m very fair and subject to autoimmune rashes on my face.  Also, I have a very pronounced T-Zone where my face is oily on/around my nose, up and across my forehead, but dry everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother and this serum is evening out my skin tone.  My face is definitely firmer. My T-Zone is noticeably less oily and my dry zone is noticeably less dry.  I love that I can rub it on my eyelids and it doesn&#x27;t sting or otherwise affect my eyes, which are very sensitive. It will take a long time for me to know for sure if this protects me from the environmental impacts that age our skin.  However, I like it enough that I plan to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you Google Hyaluronic Acid and read about it&#x27;s uses. Apparently it is medically a good and positive substance, and I couldn&#x27;t find any negative side affects. There is interesting information out there.  It is used in eye surgery and to treat arthritis among other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you found this review helpful.  Please ask if you have questions.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I really like it. I use it every morning and before bed time, it has a very light texture and goes on my skin easily. Never greasy and it has a faint fresh scent. It seems to be working well, my skin feel less dehydrated and softer. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff makes my face feel smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Great product. A little goes a long way. I use a small drop and it covers my entire face. It has evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I brought this based on reviews. So far so good. Have noticed a difference in skin tone and firmness, not dramatic but my face does seem to be filling out!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product arrives in a flimsy, thin cardboard package. If you&#x27;re fortunate, inside is an intact, blue glass bottle a stopper. I was not fortunate. I lifted the edge of the cardboard box with my index finger and a sliver of glass sliced the tip. The entire bottle was shattered, and the liquid was thick and gooey. It burned the hell out of my lacerated finger. I&#x27;d never put anything that caustic on my face.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product and says the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Hyaluronic Acid for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this moisturizing serum seemed very thick to me and I often times felt like I had applied too much of the product onto my face.  After a few days use, I got use to the amount I needed and this was no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing and somewhat refreshing after cleansing.  Since adjusting to the correct amount to use, the serum dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using about half a dropper of Serum, both morning and night under my insta natural age-defying moisturizer.  I find this serum takes a little longer to absorb on my skin than other serums I have used in the past.  Once absorbed, the product is not sticky and does leave my skin smooth, soft and firm.  However, I have not noticed a change in my dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I was using another brand serum with most of the same ingredients and it was good but I like this better, because it&#x27;s bigger bottle and reasonable pricing also I doesn&#x27;t dry my skin so much if I forget to use moisturizer. I&#x27;ve had compliments lastly on my skin too.</li>
            <li> This drys quickly after applying it and at first you may think it&#x27;s working. But after one week of using it, I started developing more pimples than I have ever had in my life!!!! It clogs pores!!!</li>
            <li> I have followed Cody Wren on instagram for a long time now. She has been raving about this product! So when I gave birth to my son in February 2015, I finally caved and bought this for my hormone ravaged skin. My acne had come back in reminiscence of my teenage years, and my skin had these horrible dry patches and bright red discoloration. I would use moisturizer, but it wouldn&#x27;t even soak in! After using this product, my skin is amazing clear again.  I even put this on my stretch marks and the discoloration has faded and my skin looks tons better!</li>
            <li> Like the feel of it on your skin and its non-greasy. As far as helping for wrinkles its too soon to tell as I&#x27;ve not used it but about two weeks and not everyday. It is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 2 months and like it so much I got some for my daughters,  sisters and mother!  Definite decrease in lines including deep ones around my mouth, firmer skin even on my neck and upper lids and spots and pores look a lot better. I love this stuff and it&#x27;s easy! By the way, I&#x27;m 62 and my new  high school students thought I was in my 40s!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have barely seen any difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, my complexion was already to the point of improvement because of use of other products such as facial masks, peels, lotions, and wearing a hat outside for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color, clarity, texture, softness, suppleness, and thickness of my facial skin has not changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did notice, two blemishes on my face healed faster than normal.  Therefore, it might work as a healing product for blemishes or accidental fine scratches on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since, I do have the product, and I am not sending it back due to shipping costs and my time, I will condition to use it.  Perhaps, there is a surprise awaiting me when I finish the product; only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, PDrapala</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle in 3 months, I love it. Non sticky and not to thick it goes on smooth morning and night. Im not sure if you should wear it during day but I use with asun screen daily. Everyone thinks I wear makeup, no and everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my 30s no...I&#x27;m 54 and for the first time, I love my skin and love this product!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. This is the first time that I have ordered it. I will most likely order it again.</li>
            <li> fabulous! my skin is smoother in just one week!!</li>
            <li> I normally do not write negative reviews. This serum dried my skin out like unbelievable!  I am 67 and use atopalm mle moisturizer and cleanser. In the month I used this I have actually developed bad creases on my forehead that I have never had before. Stupid me I kept using it wanting to have positive results because of all the review hype. I am sure I am in the minority but please stop this if your skin shows signs of drying out.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and smooth going on, dries quickly.  It&#x27;s been just over a week and the dry patches on my skin have decreased significantly...I don&#x27;t have a problem with blemishes but do have persistent dry scaly areas on my forehead and around my mouth.  I&#x27;m thrilled that I can already see clearer, happier skin!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It is not sticky or greasy. It dries quickly and leaves my skin looking and feeling healthy, hydrated, and smooth.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly.  I could start using it right away.  Don&#x27;t know if there is any improvement to my skin.  It is easy to use, has a nice texture, few man-made chemicals compared to other products I&#x27;ve used. I am using this with  Vitamin C Moisturizer Cream for Face, Skin &amp; Body.</li>
            <li> I really have a very very sensible skin and this serum is helping a lot, I have dark spots and this are getting lighter day by day. Wrinkles in my forehead are going away, my skin is very dry and this product is wonderful,  it keeps my skin hydrated. I&#x27;m using it for a week and I can tell the difference, I&#x27;m 50 years old, I mention this for people to have an idea.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum...it&#x27;s fading out dark spots and for some reason I noticed the small skin tags on my neck are shrinking</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years, like many women, at various prices.  I am so please to have found &amp;#34;insta natural&amp;#34;!  This is a great product and the results showed quickly.  I use this serum along with their Phytoceramide capsules and my mature skin is looking and feeling so much better.  I think this is not only a great product, but also very reasonably priced!  I also must tell you that the company emailed me direct to ask about my satisfaction with their product.and reassuring me that if I was not satisfied, I just needed to email back. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream. I&#x27;m very pleased with both these items. I really do see a difference. My face looks brighter and some of the fine lines are practically non-visible. Better yet, the people at the company are amazing. They sent me an e-mail after I made my purchase asking for feedback. Since then, I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of corresponding with them often. They were even kind enough to send me a complimentary bottle of their Eye Gel when I told them I was planning on purchasing more of their products. Great product and great company!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it will work.. New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  But what I can say is that it feels really nice.  The texture is nice so far.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels after I use it</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles quite yet, my skin tone was starting to become uneven and splotchy. I also tended to have dry patches on my skin. I couldn&#x27;t find a moisturizer without all the junk and chemicals in it so I was happy when I got a chance to review this product. When I first opened it, I was happy to read the ingredients because it contained so many natural and organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of use, my skin tone was noticeably more even, the dry spot were almost completely faded and my skin just felt overall more healthy. I was so happy with the results thus far, I asked a girlfriend of mine to try some to see if it would work just as well for her as it did myself. After a week of use as well, the wrinkles on her forehead were almost non-existent and her skin also looked generally healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were both commenting on how the product seems to do what it claims without leaving your skin oily and gross. We would both definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it&#x27;s working.  Might take another month.</li>
            <li> Your product is good,  but. . . . To try to get it out of the bottle is an issue, as it tooo THICK!  i&#x27;m thinking its the aloe vera gel doing this?? I don&#x27;t think you need that ingredient. You have enough good things in it!  sorry, but i prefer something that is not so thick; however when you apply it is is quite liquid?? Wish it were more liquid in the bottle, ifyouwant me to send it back so that you could see for yourself, let me know.thx. d.e</li>
            <li> I have to write a follow up review to this because just started using it two days ago, I gave 4 stars to be fair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and am starting to notice some amazing results. I&#x27;ve been following the directions provided: washing, toning, applying the serum then using my usual oil over the top and WOW! I feel like I&#x27;m glowing and the quality of my skin has noticeably improved. I carry this with me everywhere I go now lol.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is way better than other serums that are more expensive.  It not only softens fine lines but also leave my skin smooth and silky.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a visible improvement in the texture of my skin within the first few weeks.  I whole heartedly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about InstaNaturals&#x27; Hyaluronic Acid Serum is the bottle is twice the size for the same price of other hyaluronic serums on the market right now. InstaNatural really is generous with their products and if you&#x27;ve read many of my reviews then you know I am truly a fan of everything I&#x27;ve tried from this company. The serum comes in an attractive dark blue glass bottle and a dropper lid. It contains hyaluronic acid along with a perfect blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C + Jojoba Oil + Green Tea. If you&#x27;ve tried a few products with hyaluronic acid in it, they have a distinct medicated scent but the added ingredients in this product gives it an additional hint of floral. The serum is a clear cloudy gel like formula that absorbs quickly into the face and neck. Hyaluronic acid is able to sustain up to 1,000 times its weight in water making it a natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> No bad stuff in it and It works great for me !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect when I received this serum to review from instanatural &amp; Tomoson.com, as I&#x27;d never heard of or tried a hyaluronic acid serum before. Up until this, I&#x27;d only ever used plain Vitamin C Serums. I can personally say, this serum is GREAT! I love serums for my face, and this one is definitely a winner.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I love that it isn&#x27;t runny like a vitamin C serum is. It has a thicker consistency, which makes it much easier to apply. You don&#x27;t have to use all that much though, and this bottle is HUGE, so it&#x27;s going to last you a LONG LONG time.&lt;br /&gt;The added green tea feature of this serum makes your face and neck feel SUPER refreshed after you put it on, as does the vitamin C. I really like that its all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, because I have pretty sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t burn or anything when you apply it. My skin is combination and acne prone, and I&#x27;ve seen a significant amount of improvement in the condition of my skin after using this serum. My dry spots are practically gone, and my acne is definitely reduced. I use this, as well as the instanatural eye cream, and then apply their moisturizer on afterward before my makeup, and my skin looks great! This is definitely a great product and whenever I run out I&#x27;m definitely buying more.&lt;br /&gt;My friend has been using it as well, and he&#x27;s seen signifcant improvement in his skin. It&#x27;s tighter, he has no more puffiness under the eyes, and his face is baby soft. If you&#x27;re looking for a great, all natural product to soften your face, this is definitely what you need to purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this serum twice a day. It really makes my dry skin smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet. But so far I really like it.  It makes my face feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide variety of hyaluronic and vitamin c serums over the course of the last few years, always looking for the fountain of youth (who is not?).  But in any event, this works fine, the price is decent, but it was not my favorite of them all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really works!!</li>
            <li> I just want to put as much good stuff on my face as possible. This serum is loaded with nourishing ingredients and is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS.  Makes my complexion dewy and much more supple than it was before using it. I tend to have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, and  have not had a problem with this serum. there is no added synthetic fragrance. just a touch of geranium essential oil. I REALLY LIKE IT. I was expecting it to be a bit more fluid/liquid than it actually is, but no big deal. The texture out of the bottle is a little on the thick side making it feel more like a gel, but it glides on my face easily. I let it sink in and then I like to finish with a light natural moisturizer after using this. I also only use it at night. fast shipping. great price. would purchase again. Thanks for making such great products!</li>
            <li> My refill arrived in the mail the day after ordering.  This works very well, looked for the same brand for reorder :-)</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with a sticky feel. Iv&#x27;e been using daily as directed and it has not reduced wrinkles, not made my skin any better, etc. If anything, it has cause some blotchy spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the low price of this serum.  This serum contains much more than Hyaluronic Acid. This bottle is 2 ounces.  This product contains Vitamin C and E, green tea and jojoba oil. I have paid for 1 ounce of just Vitamin C.  I admit I was surprised to read all of the ingredients in one bottle. After using this serum for a couple of weeks,my skin feels softer and I feel good about using it because of the vitamin C and E but especially the hyaluronic acid.  t&#x27;s has so much in that one little bottle. It is the very first thing I put on my face, day and night.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my skin is softer and no more oily skin. It dries fast not sticky at all and when I wear make up on top, normally with other products I would get an oily t-zone but with this it keeps everything in place and feels fresh. My dry patches around my nose have also cleared up. It&#x27;s fantastic! I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and can tell a difference in my skin.  It does help with fine lines and my skin looks brighter. I would definitely order again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!! Was using 180 brand but I found this one works better for me. I HIGHLY recommended this product. Lifetime user from now on...</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 days or so I got a bad rash all over my face so I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t blame it on the product but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me, I have a sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t just put on my face the first thing I find..</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for about a week and my face is noticeably softer.  I was using a different Hyaluronic Acid Serum with vitamin C but this seems to be much improved.  The texture is thicker and makes it easier to apply.  The ingredients listed Witch Hazel, an astringent, which made me think it would be a little drying but that is not the case at all.  I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> I would of liked it better if it were a pump bottle. The blue color of the bottle is very nice. Thank You!!</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I tested this with a small drop on the back of my right hand at night.  Within a few days, there was a noticeable difference between my two hands.  The skin on my right hand looked much softer and more hydrated than my right hand.  I was so sold I purchased a bottle for each my three sisters.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last month and I love how smooth and bright it makes my skin look. The best part is it absorbs quickly and you don&#x27;t get the sticky feeling that many other serums gives you. I have tried a lot of products for InstaNatural and they all seem to amaze me. I love this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a free product I received to review.</li>
            <li> made me breakout like crazy. maybe this is not for me:/</li>
            <li> its ok.. didnt see many improvements</li>
            <li> I like the HA serum, it absorb super fast on my skin and does not feel gooey or sticky. But I have to moisturise after using the product because it dried up fast leaving the skin dry. The serum helps with fine lines and skin tones too. I shared my bottle with my mother  and her fine wrinkle are all gone but the deep wrinkles on the foreheads are tough to go. May be eventually they will fade out. I would have rated the product 5 star if I didnot have to use the moisturiser above it. apart from that this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have received the product for free for testing and reviewing but the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This serum really came in handy! My face was looking pitiful! I have what I call stress wrinkles. Especially on my forehead more noticeable than anywhere else. My skin is so oily and I sweat super easy so my pores are always clogged with oil and sweat leaving my face covered with blackheads and scars from blCkheads that I&#x27;ve tried to pop. I used astringent to make sure the oily bacteria is off my face then I apply the serum. I&#x27;ve been doing this for almost a week and my face is amazingly softer and clearer than It was before I tried the serum. I still have my wrinkles but they&#x27;ve reduced a lot and I know with futher use I&#x27;ll have a model. Face soon! This was a free product used for review purposes!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of the 2 FL OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I have tried this product for at least 2 months now and I have seen improvement in my red splotches on my cheeks.  The flushed look has almost disappeared. The serum is absorbed quickly. I tried a Vitamin C oil before with hyaluronic acid before however I did not see any results. I will definitely purchased this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is the second bottle I have purchased and I am very satisfied with the results. I see that the red blotches on my face are much lighter if not totally gone. I will purchase again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel great. It tightens and smoothes in all the right places. I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t exactly use this product. It goes on smoothly and I believe that i I actually had any noticeble wrinkles they would be gone. But I don&#x27;t really need it, and so I used it once to see how well it can be used and would there be any types of problems. I do recommend this serum to anyone that feels the need to get rid of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like the way my face feels, but I have not really noticed a change in the crows feet.  I am going to give it a few more weeks, but it is making my face feel better and clearer.</li>
            <li> Great product and great company!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I just started using it a couple of weeks ago and feel like I am seeing results.</li>
            <li> Very good I use this in the day on top of sunscreen</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT....I FEEL IT WORKS ON MY FACE....HELPING TO REDUCE WRINKLES!! VERY PLEASED!!!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of product</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW - MY SKIN LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER - HYDRATED AND HEALTHY - I AM REALLY PLEASED - THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING...</li>
            <li> I like it...I feel like my face looks too young..I feel weird...but I run it on my stomach and loose skin</li>
            <li> Great Stuff, great service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 10 days so far, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any real changes, but the reviews say at least two or more weeks.  I&#x27;m excited to see what your product does for me.  The serum wasn&#x27;t as thick as I thought it was.  I expected something a little heavier on my face as it says it&#x27;s a serum.  I remain hopeful!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. If you are looking for hyaluronic acid that is thicker, this is it! Works great with microneedeling.</li>
            <li> I generally have smooth skin but have noticed some rough patches and uneven tone in recent years as well as some darkness under my eyes. I notice when I&#x27;m not drinking as much water as I should be, my laugh lines near my mouth are also pronounced and seem to be laughing when I&#x27;m not. :(  So I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help retain moisture in my skin, but having oily skin I don&#x27;t want something that&#x27;s going to make me even more oily-faced. I&#x27;ve been putting this serum on my face, neck, and chest at night before bed and never really noticed significant differences until about the 2nd week I&#x27;d been using this. One day while I was at my desk I rested my chin on my palm and my fingers touched the side of my face and wow!! It felt soooo soft and smooth! When I ran to the mirror, I noticed the laugh lines nearly gone when I&#x27;m not laughing or smiling and the darkness under my eyes improved dramatically. My face has an overall glow I haven&#x27;t seen in the mirror in some time.  I&#x27;ve been caressing my face like a crazy person ever since.</li>
            <li> EXCEED MY  MY EXPECTATIONS---THIS PRODUCT IS BETTER THAN PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE PAID  MUCH MORE  FOR THAN  THIS!!! AND I DID NOT FIND THEM TO BE  VERY EFFECTIVE--- I  PLAN TO BUY ANOTHER  INSTA  NATURAL  HYALURONIC IN THE NEAR FUTURE--PLEASE KEEP IT INSTOCK</li>
            <li> This stuff is Fantabulous!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, found other brand that had a better appearance on my skin&lt;br /&gt;Great value</li>
            <li> I have spent  hundreds of dollars on serums and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  This product made an immediate impact on my skin.  It looks and feels more toned and hydrated.  I will repurchase over and over again!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few weeks...and I love it! I have noticed a significant difference in my skins texture (smoother) and a decrease in the fine lines on my face and neck! Definitely will buy this product again!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I am always searching for the best products on the market and this serum is exactly what I needed. It leaves my skin plumped, soft and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! This has made a huge&lt;br /&gt; difference in my fine lines and wrinkles. I out this on first. Layer vitamin c and other anti-aging serum. Finish with moisturizer. Major improvement after 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> Much better than expected!</li>
            <li> Really good! Was delivered on time !&lt;br /&gt;Good deal! Bought a second one after the first got over!*****</li>
            <li> Only had this a week so can&#x27;t tell if there will be lasting effects but I love the silky feel of it on my skin so will probably buy more when this bottle is finished. I bought his brand because it contains a  higher percentage of hyalurinic acid than many others.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping to an EU country was quick and easy with a tracking sytem to see when it was going to be delivered.</li>
            <li> Nice light product, not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything yet through...</li>
            <li> I love using serums and this one is awesome. Use this before you use your moisturizer. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> The product is working well to keep my face and neck hydrated. Got a sunburn on my arms and legs which peeled but not my face which I think was due to this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other insta natural products and loved them.  This one was not as effective as others.</li>
            <li> I really love using this serum.  It keeps my face smooth and moisturized and does not break me out.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I loved InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid, the serum is easy to apply and my skin is visible better, the appearance, the texture and elasticity improves a lot. It&#x27;s incredible how fast it works. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I got another product from this company and was not too happy with it  the company keep sending me email to ask about my experience :) well I reply by telling them that I did not like it! They immediately responded to me and ask how to make me happy! Wow! Really? What a great customer service! So I choose this product and being on a lots of medication my skin was dull! Trust me wen I say I have every cream under the sun for my skin! But this one wins them all! Everybody tells me that I look great &amp;#34; I&#x27;m not wearing maykup anymore &amp;#34; I see that I look great even if I&#x27;m sick , this is really a miracle product that works right away! Thank you insta natural for taking great care of me and sending me this product for free! I loooove it, I&#x27;m addicted to it. I&#x27;m so happy with the result that I will stick with you forever.</li>
            <li> I received my product on time, I&#x27;ve just started using it, and I love the way my skin feels, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The formula feels very rich and there is no scent. I also like how it absorbs very quickly into the skin. I find that my face feels much smoother and has an improved glow. I will definitely keep using the serum. I&#x27;ve been applying it in the morning and evening. My skin runs oily, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy or oily after, which is a plus! I have yet to try it without a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided this complimentary for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Got it for free... It feels very nice when you put it on. It feels as good as the more expensive prescription brands. It will take time to see if it has the same effect</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. It is gentle enough for my very sensitive skin. Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I really like how it works. The lines are not as noticeable as they was</li>
            <li> Only use this every other day, under my Argon Oil.  I like it so far, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I got this serum last October. I started useing it today. It&#x27;s very thick. When I pulled out the dropper, some of the serum was sticking on like gel. It&#x27;s totally different from other hyaluronic acid serum. I try to shake it well. It&#x27;s getting thinner. I&#x27;m not sure the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum for about 2 weeks but I can already see a difference. It goes on smooth and dries quickly. My skin feels softer and it does seem to be evening my skin tone and giving me a smoother look. I do have to compliment the company for the thank you email along with instructions and the follow up email. I will leave another comment in another month and let you know of any changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving this serum! I was sent this product for free to try and I&#x27;m truly impressed. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning under my moisturizer for extra hydration. It plumps up my skin and makes it look great. It sinks right into my skin and works well under makeup. Definitely something to try if you have dehydrated skin. The only thing I&#x27;m not a huge fan of is the scent. It just smells odd to me, it&#x27;s hard to describe.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was a little unsure about the consistency because its a little bit thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, but it&#x27;s not sticky and glides right onto my face. It dries instantly and my face felt really smooth!</li>
            <li> I have not had time enough to write about this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is like an aqua gel, and it is softer than I thought. Good!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks and I must say, I am seeing a noticeable difference in the texture and coloration of my skin.  To be fair, I wasn&#x27;t using any kind of serum before trying this product, but I certainly wasn&#x27;t happy with the way my skin looked either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fair-skinned senior gal who spent way too many hours back in the day tanning and while I have very few wrinkles, I do have age spots and dryness and visible pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum does not feel sticky and absorbs wonderfully and I do tend to slather it on at night and apply it sparingly in the morning. There IS a positive difference in the way my skin looks!  I have been looking for a new cleansing and moisturizing line and I do believe I have found it and the prices are so affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also say that the customer service is extremely fast and friendly.  I was offered this product to review and I had some questions and the replies were fast and always friendly.  That in itself is a major plus to me!</li>
            <li> This product may be &amp;#34;watered&amp;#34; down a bit compared to other products. They dont list the percentage of Vitaminc C on the bottle and when I asked customer service they could not answer, they just sent me a &amp;#34;canned&amp;#34; response on how good the product is.&lt;br /&gt;How else are they able to sell a 2oz bottle for the price of a 1oz?&lt;br /&gt;Does feel ok on the skin with no smell.  They advertised a pump but its a dropper.  I will continue to use until it runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for two weeks now and am starting to see some results. Skin is smoother and no irritation, which is rare because my skin is pretty sensitive. I also like the gel format - it has no odor and goes on without a trace. Looking forward to seeing what the coming weeks will show.</li>
            <li> This product has a semi-thick texture to it, and it applies evenly in my face.  After several days of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I’ve tried so far, results are immediate. You can literally feel the skin tighten after applying it. It is not sticky and absorbs nicely. The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I’ve jumped the gun early on my review&lt;br /&gt;I used this product each morning and in the evening. It was easy to apply and not to thin or too thick.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends in the future.  I received a discount to try this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the serum and I have noticed a difference.  But admittedly I fail to use as much as I should.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have oily skin and have been having issues with breakouts. I changed moisturizers and started having issues with dry patches. I started using HA and started noticing a difference almost immediately. I continued using it and have been having great results. I love the fact that it is light and moisturizing and not sticky at all. Good stuff!!</li>
            <li> It really helps plump up the skin around my eyes (crow&#x27;s feet) so I look more rested and my skin looks soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied so far.  No complications such as some users reported.  Would definitely order again. Skin feels smooth, somewhat firmer. I have only used it a short time, works well under makeup with a moisturizer and last all day.</li>
            <li> so far i really like it  the texture is just right as far as the thickness  you only need a little bit goes a long way  i let my mom try it and i thick she likes it too  i would really recommend and i have also told some about it</li>
            <li> I use this serum every morning. After it soaks in (which is really right away) I moisturize. The product claims to be the BEST acid serum...reviews mirror their claims also. I&#x27;ve heard a lot about hyaluronics and, with all said and read, I&#x27;m resting in what the ingredients are doing for me.</li>
            <li> Great product that works.  I have reordered numerous times.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several other serums and never had results like with this one.  I purchased this at a reduced price to give my honest and unbiased opinion. Will definitely buy again as well as recommend this product to all my friends.  I even convinced my husband to use the hyaluronic acid serum....Ill let you all know how that goes.</li>
            <li> too thin this seum is not moisturizing at all  I went back to my original hyaluronic serum which is much more moisturizing, I do find hyaluronic acid serum too be beneficial in the protection and prevention of aging skin just not this one</li>
            <li> I did not like this. It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I used the Inst Hyaluronic Acid Serum to try to get rid of some of the fine lines that have started to pop up the last couple years. It is the professional formula with Vitamin C, Green Tea, and JoJoBa Oil. It has a strong musky smell, but, it is pleasant. The oil absorbs well and does not feel greasy .It smells amazing when it is absorbed. It does hydrate my skin and give it a light glow. It did seem to reduce my fine lines, but, I would have to use it a while longer to see if it would truly erase them.&lt;br /&gt;It did not cause any breakouts or dry out my skin. I have dry skin, so, a lot of times products will dry my skin out, so, I was happy not to have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product each morning and in the evening. It was easy to apply and not to thin or too thick.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends in the future.</li>
            <li> I like how smooth my skin is after using this. This winter my skin has been very dry and flaky but after a few days of using it has plumped back up and is nice and hydrated. I like how big the size of the bottle is since you only use a little at a time it should last a decent amount of time. It&#x27;s not greasy, not sticky, and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it. I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  My skin has never felt so good.  It has diminished some fine lines that were starting to bug me!  My skin feels fresher and is very smooth!  Product arrived well packaged and very quick!  I will definitely be using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> In.love! My skin drinks up the hydration.. I have combination skin, norm to oily, leaves my face feeling fresh and supple. I use it on its own and combined with my vit c serum</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen that much of a difference, but I use this with a lot of different products and my skin already looks pretty good. I&#x27;m more in the prevention stage. What I like is that it&#x27;s hydrating so I don&#x27;t have to put lotion on top of it unless I need an spf. Also the price is good for what you&#x27;re getting, imo.</li>
            <li> I SIMPLY LOVE IT!  IT WORKS FOR ME  - AND I CAN STILL CARRY THROUGH WITH MY OWN PERSONAL BEAUTY REGIMANT AFTER APPLICATION.  I SHALL BE A FAITHFUL USER!!!  :)</li>
            <li> This really works!!!! My laugh lines are seriously reduced!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Immediate difference.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as shown in the picture.  It is easy to get the product out of the container because of the dropper/cover.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is more like a gel with the right consistency (not too watery nor too thick). It is clear, odorless and is easily absorbed by the skin.  It spreads really well and dries quickly.  This is the first time that I am using a Hyaluronic Serum so I have no basis for comparison.  I am using this product for 2 weeks already but I have already noticed a difference in how my facial skin looks.  I think it is too early to say whether I would get the desired results that other users have experienced from using this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I am a satisfied customer and will definitely order this serum again</li>
            <li> This is very light and calming for my skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of weeks and I really feel like it&#x27;s improving the look and feel of the skin on my face.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple weeks, and I notice improvement in the area around my mouth particularly.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced , also.</li>
            <li> First, let me tell you what I do not like about this serum.  It needs to be a pump instead of an eye dropper.  I don&#x27;t care how careful you are but pulling the eye dropper in and out gets messy and you waste serum getting on all sides when you screw it back on.  Even though I do not like that part I still gave it a five.  No one has influenced me to write this.  I researched this and other products before I bought this particular product.  i also read all the comments and that was a deciding factor also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 having celebrated my birthday last month.  I use Clinique as I am allergic to a lot of foods and cosmetics.  My hairdresser says I come from a family with good genes because I do not look 62 and honestly I did not.  I use the past tense because I am getting lines around my eyes and now have some smile lines.  With this being said that is why I was looking for for a product that could help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product two weeks ago.  My routine is to use it in the morning and at night when I take my make-up off.  After showering, I apply the serum, let it dry then I apply Clinique moisturizer (dramatically different).  When I apply this serum it  leaves my skin very soft.  The first week I just thought &amp;#34;wasted my money on another product&amp;#34; and was truly disappointed, but I kept up the routine as usual.  I am so glad I did because I woke up one morning and my skin was transformed!!!!!!!!!  I no longer had big pores but smooth soft skin that actually looked great.  Well, it just happened that I had a hair appointment  a few days later.  My hairdresser stared at me then said that I looked rested and just wonderful.  She then asked me why my skin looked so good.  I told her about this serum and then noticed other clients and stylist were listening to me.  I went through and told them what I am telling you now.  They made comments about buying this product too.  So ladies and gents, without a doubt I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  Whatever you do, DO NOT  give up like I almost did.  The transformation of your skin is truly amazing.  Unequivably and without a doubt, I will be ordering this particular product as long as the company continues to sell it!!!!  This my honest opinion.Whatever you do, DO NOT  give up like I almost did.  The transformation of your skin is truly amazing.

            <li> Fast shipping, product started working from day one. My face is so much brighter and healthier looking. Its faded my dark spots and even helped with my adult acne. I will be using this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I love Hyaluronic acid! This serum was the best way to get more of it into my face care routine. I always notice my skin being more resilient after using it. I don&#x27;t really have age spots, but adore this for making my skin plump and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I can already see a difference in my complexion.  I mix this with equal parts Argan Oil. Impurities are coming out of my skin stays smooth and soft all day long.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the InstaNatural brand and their amazing products.  I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one. The packaging is awesome (glass bottle with dropper lid), and the product inside is superior to most products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is full of wonderful ingredients (vitamin c, jojoba oil, and green tea, just to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly, smells like a floral/baby powder combination, has a slight cooling effect, and over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;m actually seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;I have significant redness on my face-- everywhere except around my eyes and mouth, and after a couple weeks of using this, I&#x27;m noticing a much more even skintone!  I didn&#x27;t think it would be possible without the help of a dermatologist/ full-strength harsh medication.  This is one product that I won&#x27;t let run out!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller. I am very fair, never tan and have sensitive skin. I even use it on my neck, ears, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and the back of my aging hands. Of course that means I use it up faster but its affordable! There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking. It does not sting or burn. Ladies, give this a try before you buy something more expensive. The deep lines at the corner of my eyes have smoothed considerably, there is a glow to my skin and I swear the deep wrinkles on my forehead have softened. Follow the directions and apply a good moisturizer with sunblock after it has dried. Be aware that this product will not make your wrinkles go away permanently, it just diminishes them so you have to keep on using it.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after three days</li>
            <li> After using this for 3 weeks, I’m not sure if it’s actually done anything for me. The first week, when I applied only this (for testing purposes) after showering, it really didn’t seem to do much. In the second week, I followed it with some rosehip oil, and that’s when I started seeing the effects–though this could be the result of the rosehip oil and not the serum. By the third week of using both items, my skin was feeling great, and many of my scars had faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to tell whether or not this serum actually did anything–serums are supposed to enhance the moisturizer that you apply afterwards–so it’s difficult to know exactly how much a benefit the serum adds. That being said, this serum does contain some powerful ingredients found in other skin products, and it didn’t irritate my skin or anything when I tried it (and I have sensitive skin). There’s no real strong smell either, so there’s no need to worry about that. I couldn’t really tell if it affected my skin, but the end result (when I combined it with a moisturizer) was positive, so it wouldn’t hurt to try. I just can’t guarantee you results, from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note that I was given a review sample</li>
            <li> Really like it Have been using the whole line and my skin looks great</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement in my skin after 3 weeks of use, I like it.  It feels good when you apply it and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this but just didn&#x27;t. I purchased it to help my dry skin to retain some extra moisture in the winter but the product is watered down with so much witch hazel that it actually dried me out more. I will give it another try this summer. I am hoping to have better results with it then.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing! It makes my skin feel tighter and smoother. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy, just soft. I have oily skin so it&#x27;s important that face products don&#x27;t leave any residue. It&#x27;s great quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks so far and am impressed with it. My skin is hydrated and it is absorbed quickly, no greasy or sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This has been added to my daily routine, love it!!</li>
            <li> I use it along with another instanatural product called age defying skin clearing vit. C. And my regular moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and  for more than 2 weeks now my skin seems to accept it (very happy) my skin feels smoother the pores are finer. Great product! Will continue to buy them for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up review. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle. My face just love love love it.</li>
            <li> I have been.this serum faithfully for a few weeks now and tracking my reviews. My skin had been really dry and cracking. Now I feel as if the natural.moisture has been restored.  My skin tone is more even and my pores are invisible. I havent even attempted to put any makeup foundation on my face...that just how flawless my skin looks. There are no harsh smells associated with thia serum and alll of the ingredients are all natural. I received thks items at a promotional rate in exchange</li>
            <li> First of all this serum smell so good just like green tea I love when I put this on my skin amazing make my skin so refreshing</li>
            <li> I love this, enough said! I can tell a awesome difference especially around my eyes, (:</li>
            <li> This is a really incredible product. I like the semi thick texture, and I like when you apply it you can actually feel your skin tighten just a bit. I put it on my face and make sure I apply it well where I have those fine lines, especially around my eyes. The size of the product is generous and the smell is great and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is improving anything for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every morning under my moisturizer since I first got it. I like the texture, it&#x27;s slightly thick and takes a moment to rub in. Since I added this to my skin care routine, I have noticed an improvement in my skin. I wasn&#x27;t using it on my neck at first, but since I noticed improvement in my face I have started using it on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly finicky skin, so I judge products by 2 criteria right off the bat. First, does it break me out and second, does it irritate my skin. I have heard of hyaluronic acid for its anti-wrinkle properties and was excited to try this. I put it on my naked face in the morning and layer it with Vitamin C serum. My skin is hydrated and softer, with no acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid along with a blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C, jojoba oil, and green tea to give your skin premium hydration and benefits. Not only does it offer anti-aging benefits, like diminishing fine lines, but it can help reduce hyper-pigmentation, the appearance of dark circles, and can help soften skin to create a supple, firm look. One of the main reasons that I appreciate and love the company&#x27;s products is because they stand by their word with providing products that are safe for everyone involved. This serum has no parabens, harsh chemicals, or alcohol, and most importantly, it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using, my skin was dull, a combination of oily with flaking dry areas along my skin and nose. Within one application of this product, my skin was hydrated, and soft. I have tried numerous InstaNatural products over the past few months, so my expectations were high, and I knew they would be met, but this product blew me away. I have a bit of discoloration on my face due to hormonal imbalances, and dark circles underneath my eyes that has slowly cleared up with the aid of this serum. I apply this every morning and evening, as directed, and have seen such success with improving my skin imperfections. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, and within seconds of applying, it absorbs, leaving my skin smooth. This has become a must-have product for me, and I always recommend it to those looking for a serum, or just to anyone who would benefit from this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product so that I could try and minimize some sun damage discoloration I had on my forehead. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about two weeks now and am very happy with the results. Its has lightened up considerably and the texture is much smoother and more refined. My skin hasn&#x27;t been overly dry (but I do put moisturizer on after it dries like the instructions suggest). Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this product for the past month for different reasons I can&#x27;t believe my dark spots are fading and my husband&#x27;s skin texture has smoothed and his face overall is brighter...I wasn&#x27;t jazzed about about the combo of ingredients but it is a fantastic mix.</li>
            <li> After being so impressed with Instanatural&#x27;s phytoceramides, I decided to purchase their Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Being 49 and in all-out war with aging skin, I wanted to try this moisture-grabbing substance.  I love it.  My skin care regimen is a layering approach, slightly different for day and night.  Firmly believing that MOISTURE is a major key in the way skin looks, any way I can retain moisture in and on the skin is one of two goals for me.  As to the product&#x27;s performance, I think it does what it is marketed to do.  I use it slightly differently than the label instructs.  With my layering approach, I often combine a generous amount of the serum with another serum, and always on skin already wet (want to give all those HA molecules something to hold on to!)  Used alone, the serum dries to a very light finish and is ready for the next layer.  I like this aspect, because heavy products can pile up until you can scrape them off and ruin your makeup if you have to scratch your face at any time during the day.  I like all the other ingredients in the serum, especially the vitamin C and green tea, which when applied topically are known to be good for the skin. Hint:  anything good for the face is good for the backs of the hands, another highly visible clue to one&#x27;s real age. Will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Up until now I have only used one brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum (HA), and I have been very pleased with my results, but this time when I came close to finishing my usual brand, I thought that I would try another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few good reasons why I chose InstaNaturals to try their HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This skin care line had an overwhelming amount of positive reviews&lt;br /&gt;2) The same excellent ingredients that are in my usual HA serum&lt;br /&gt;3) I liked that their HA came in a 2 fl. oz. bottle rather than the usual l oz.&lt;br /&gt;4) &amp;#34;MANUFACTURER GUARANTEE: InstaNaturals backs their products with a Lifetime Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee, no matter where you buy our product.  If you&#x27;re not satisfied, simply contact us and get a full refund.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;5)  The incredible price of $16.45 for 2 fl. oz., which is less expensive than any other skin-care line at even half the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those were my 5 original reasons for trying InstaNaturals HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY FINDINGS AND RESULTS:  In comparing my usual HA serum, and InstaNaturals HA, I found that the InstraNaturals serum was just a little thinner substance than my usual HA serum.  I am just noting that detail; it does not make any difference to me, but some may prefer this thinner HA to the thicker HA serum.  I was pleased that the dropper vial extended all the way to the bottom of the bottle, eliminating any waste.  It only takes 3 or 4 drops of this HA to cover my face and neck, and the InstaNaturals immediately soaked into my skin, keeping my mature and dry facial skin hydrated, and soft. My fine lines are diminished, less prominent, resulting in a smooth and even texture, which is exactly what I require in a HA serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid  (HA) -holds up to 1,000 times its weight in water - it functions not only to deliver water to the skin, but also to hold it there.

            <li> I absolutely loved this product and the company. Received this product in the mail right away. Started using this with, the vitamin c mixture afterward, and  could feel the tightening afterwards.  Then about a week into it, I was putting on makeup, and where I usually put on my cover up on, my forehead where I have some fine wrinkle lines, I didn&#x27;t have to put on any cover up, and didn&#x27;t even think about it until, I got to the doctors office. I knew something was different but didn&#x27;t know what it was until, it hit me later that day!!  Needless to say this is working great. I&#x27;m seeing a difference on my smile lines, forehead, and under my eyes and my neck all were my problems were. I am even getting nice compliments. I am also using other  products from this company and love them all. They are also organic which I Thank god for, because my son is in remission from cancer and I only put on organic stuff on him like the rose hip oil. for his scars and stretch marks, which he got from the cancer like his port etc. from the very first day I could see the difference. He also gets a lot of compliments. My son, is actually starting to feel good about himself and his body again. This is like the best company and best stuff. This month I will be trying out new stuff from them. So excited. This Company contacted me personally and asked me how I liked their product, that if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied, they would give me a total refund without even sending the bottle back. who&#x27;s ever heard of that? Then I didn&#x27;t see that I could get a discount for ordering more then 2 items then they granted me that. Then I went through my bottle so fast. That they are sending me another one for free. How about that for service. Love them and their customer service. Thank you for being real in this tough world of today, for you don&#x27;t really ever see this in today&#x27;s world anymore. Thank you again Teri</li>
            <li> Lite ans smooth feeling, just has a Smell not so pleasant</li>
            <li> Feels amazing and refreshing.  My skin has a tendency to act up with certain products, so I am always nervous using new products.  After 1 use, I knew I would be purchasing this item again.  To top it off, they have an amazing customer support team.  I highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li> I DO SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FACE .FIRST I WASH MY FACE AND THEN PUT SERUM ON AND LET IT DRY THEN APPLY MOISTURIZER. I HOPE I AM DOING IT RIGHT.PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF I AM DOING ANYTHING WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;RITA WEST</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that the last time I followed any sort of skin care regimen was WAY before Serum-Plus-Moisturizer was in style.  Grunge rock was in, tanning was cool and acne was a bigger worry than wrinkles.  This year, my mid-50&#x27;s struck (hard) and it was time to call in a SWAT team of potions, facial exercises and makeup so as not to frighten small children when walking down the street.  This serum has become the heavy hitter in my arsenal.  Right away, it started to brighten my complexion and restore a radiance that, well, I pretty much never had to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If like me, you are new to the concept of applying a liquidy gel and then moisturizing, give it a try. The combination sort of heals your skin in a way that moisturizer alone doesn&#x27;t.  This serum is not very expensive compared with those sold behind cosmetic counters so since it works, I have no desire to shop around.  I purchased the eye gel at the same time and though it took a while to start working, I&#x27;ve become a fan of it as well.  AJ is lovely in following up on customer satisfaction.  The company stands behind its products.  Instanatural is doing a lot of things right and deserves its high ratings on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It works beyond my expectations. The eye dropper is easy to direct to my skin and my skin feels so good after I apply it. I can see a difference too.</li>
            <li> sorry my englisch is not that good,  very happy</li>
            <li> After 4 week trail....no further deterioration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now....this serum is magic in a bottle, I absolutely love it! Once applied, it dries smoothly and never sticky. Its also great under makeup! I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about hyaluronic acid and how amazing it is supposed to be for the skin. I would have to agree, I feel that it is quite firming, and is also gentle on my sensitive and acne-prone skin. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!! I can not say enough good things. I bought this along with the InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment. My skin is so dry &amp; dehydrated. I have been buying and trying SO many products.... some seem to work, until I apply my makeup... then my skin is all dry and flaky and my makeup looks AWFUL! :( I have been getting so discouraged and frustrated. I&#x27;m so so glad I decided to try these 2 products! They are the only things that truly WORKS! After using them only twice, once at night and again the next morning, I applied my makeup and it looked AMAZING! For the first time in a long time. I am so excited that I finally found something that works. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who has dry and/or dehydrated skin. If I had to say a negative about it.... it would be that it feels kind of thick and sticky at first, but that feeling goes away in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Large sized bottle for the money.  Spa-level formulation.  Excellent customer service followup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
            <li> I love it. I will definitely order again. i do see a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product together with the InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment and began using both products at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives: I love the cute blue bottle this comes in.  The serum is easy to apply and feels great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I&#x27;m not sure whether this serum or the night cream was responsible, but after a few days of use, I ended up with a horrible break-out and had to discontinue using both products.  I&#x27;ve never had acne before, so this was a real surprise to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was not able to use the product for long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t wk as well as dr oz and didn&#x27;t last Langer for being a bigger sz.</li>
            <li> Started using this on my hands, they were looking very old. Amazing what it has done for my hand alone, not to mention my face. It&#x27;s like a fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my skin feel soft</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feel  better. .!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and texture. Thick but not greasy and absorbs into skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I have read many articles on the benefits of a serum with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin C in a pure form.  This product has improved the texture and moisture level of my skin immensely over the past two weeks!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks and face broke out a little after 2 weeks and steadily got worse. I stopped using and my skin is almost cleared up now.  Yes, I would like a refund if possible. By the way, it didn&#x27;t help my wrinkles</li>
            <li> Seems to benefit the skin after a short period of time. Too early to tell. Mild nonirritating. Seeing what happens.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using it but I like it very much and my skin feels very solt.</li>
            <li> Based on all the promises, I was expecting amazing results. After 6 weeks of daily use, there is no visible difference. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Save your money, this product has been worthless.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, I&#x27;ve never seen so many people buy an item as much as this one. I know why now, you can fill it lift, and tighten, and hydrate! The best! Buy it every month to every other month!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. You can feel the tightening of your skin after applying it and there is no odor at all. Will be reordering it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and do actually see a difference in my skin.  It applies as a thick, cooling gel which has not bothered my ultra sensitive skin in any way.  The bottle is huge and truly a great value.  I have tried other products that claim to remove sun spots.  This one delivers it&#x27;s marketing promise.</li>
            <li> Like it so far haven&#x27;t really seen that much of a difference, feels good on skin</li>
            <li> Did absolutely NOTHING noticeable for me at all, except waste my money and time. Eh...</li>
            <li> Clogged up my pores. Now I need to go see a dermatologist to clear it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fault as well for not checking whether it is noncomedonic.</li>
            <li> love this. my skin drank it up and it didn&#x27;t leave a film at all. loved applying this under makeup and my skin really glowed. great product!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily yet dehydrated skin. I&#x27;ve already been using vitamin C serum for some time, but was looking for something to help hydrate my skin. Well, this is it! I layer it on after the C serum both morning and night, then follow up with a moisturizer. It has a nice texture, seems a bit thick at first but glides on easily, and dries completely. My skin not only looks more radiant and plump, but it&#x27;s noticeably less oily.</li>
            <li> love it, i have been useing it for a week  and my face is smoother and my pimples got much better. i haven&#x27;t see something on my wrinkles but it takes time to the product to make its work. it is a viscose transparent and without a smell product, goes easy and smoothy on the face an neck.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff.  My face looks amazing. Its soft,  crows feet are disappearing so fast, and everyone says my skin is glowing.  After applying it to my face,  i would quickly rub my fingertips over the backs of my hand.  After a week,  i was driving and the sun was beating down on my hand and i noticed how incredible the skin looked where i would rub the serum into,  as opposed to the 40yr old skin around it.... So now i cover face,  neck,  and hands with it twice a day.  Seriously, i am hooked!  And it doesn&#x27;t mess with my overly sensitive skin,  and the occasional acne has stopped as well.  Buy it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> My second time getting it. I am giving 3 stars since the consistency of the serum seemed and felt different this time. It was more viscous though after using it it felt okay.. Not sure if the hot weather had anything to do with the consistency but I would hope that the packaging would take care of any extreme temperatures.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick, you can&#x27;t get any into the dropper.  Consistency is just awful.  Will go back to Swanson Vitamin HA.  Their product goes on much smoother and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom! She is in her mid-50 and she loves it it works very well and she says her skin feels amazing after!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working effectively so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent  for reducing fine lines around the eyes. It is a nice thick serum that goes on quite well without a strong odor.  A little goes along way. I would say that using this in conjunction with a good moisturizer is your best bet to stave off the effects of Father Time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of days now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin.  I&#x27;m going to give it some more time, but so far I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this when I noticed my skin was getting dry. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product on Instagram &amp; it sounded like something I was in desperate need for. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week, but my skin already looks more radiant &amp; healthy. I no longer have any dry spots. The dropper method is a little annoying because this product is so thick, but honestly it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I&#x27;m glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Top quality haluronic acid serum. I have used several products by Instanatural and am very impressed with this company and its products.Easy to use and can be worn under make up as it goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> I love how this hydrates without feeling heavy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  Made a difference as soon as I used it.  I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but it didn&#x27;t meet with what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for eight months and I am really happy with it.  My age spots have faded considerably, but what I really like is how it changed the texture of my skin without feeling at all sticky.  This serum spreads easily, soaks in quickly and with my moisturizer makes my skin noticeably softer and my skin texture very fine.  I am a repeat buyer and plan on using it as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really appreciate about this company is that they contact their customers via email, touching base and asking if there are any problems or questions.  Such a proactive approach is refreshing.  I&#x27;m 63 and not one to jump on bandwagons.  This product and company earned my repeat business.</li>
            <li> This product is so moisturizing! Works great on sensitive skin. Love the natural and organic formula!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!  The company is great!  I trust them.</li>
            <li> I wanted your product to work diminishing wrinkles around my eyes and my cheeks. I&#x27; developed red blotches and itching and thought it was just an initial reaction and would go away. Unfortunately it did not and I had to take antihistamine tablets and steroid ointment to clear it up. I stopped using it and the reaction is disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;This is an addendum to my previous review. After I posted this review, company representatives reached out to ask if there was anything they can do. Needless to say no one can stop an untiward reaction to a product. Understandably different skin types have differing reactions. I certainly did not anticipate a bad reaction but no one can predict that.&lt;br /&gt;This company stands by their 100% satisfaction guarantee and for that I give them 3 stars. I hope it will work on others.</li>
            <li> Love love love, I&#x27;m 33 and have been looking for something to help reduce and preven wrinkles. This is the first product that is doing the job. I will definitely be purchasing more Insta-natural face care products in the future</li>
            <li> I have been using for almost a month.  I like this because it isn&#x27;t sticky.  I think its too early to tell if my fine line and wrinkles have diminished. My face feels hydrated.  I will purchase again.  Really appreciate that it&#x27;s free of nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tried the InstaNatural Premium Hydration Hyaluronic Acid Serum Professional Formula. On the cover on the front of the bottle it mentioned Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jojoba Oil. From the bottle it says: &amp;#34; About Hyaluronic Acid Serum: InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum contains Hyaluronic Acid along with a perfect blend of antioxidants such as Vitamin C + JoJoba Oil + Green Tree. With a capacity to sustain up to a 1,000 times its weight in water, Hyluronic Acid is a great natural hydrator by helping the skin to retain moisture.&amp;#34; I really like to apply it on my face before I go to work, I don&#x27;t have to apply much, and it dries quickly. My skin feels moisturized for so very little Hyaluronic AcidSerum!!</li>
            <li> For someone in her 60&#x27;s, with sun damaged skin this has been the best product I&#x27;ve tried &amp; I have been trying everything to repair the damage I have done to my skin. We farm/ranch for a living so most of my time is spent outside in the elements &amp; I had just about decided there was nothing I could do to change the way my skin was until I tried the hyaluronic acid serum. Now, to be real.....no, it hasn&#x27;t erased the hands of time but I do see a good improvement in my skin which has increased my confidence in how I look &amp; we all want to look our best. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much improvement I can see with more time. I reordered some more today......&amp; believe me I was so tired of trying everything with golden promises &amp; no results. I plan to stay with this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s made a great deal of difference on my face by drastically reducing the number of &amp;#34;flakeys&amp;#34; I have. It really helps my skin retain moisture.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I used to wake up to flakey, dry, patchy skin, but no more after using this serum. After using this at night, I wake up and there is no need to wash my face. I am glowing and look rested. There is no scent to this which I also love!!! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Slowly, but sure working</li>
            <li> i have definitely seen a difference in my skin after 1 week</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with Instanatural&#x27;s rose water face toner and I love the results of brighter looking (and feeling) skin.  The first bottle I purchased had a broken syringe tip, but Instanatural was quick to replace it with a brand new item.  I appreciate the combination excellent customer service and effective products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Haluronic Acid, but I seem to the only one having a terrible time with accessing this one by the dropper. My dropper doesn&#x27;t pick up much of anything, so I take it out, turn it upside down to access the formula, and then, from being upside down, when I try to replace the dropper, it spews out product all over the place. If you tap the botttle before you try to insert the dropper, you won&#x27;t have this problem. I&#x27;m using (and losing) so much that I think I&#x27;ll go back to a somewhat more expensive one, but this one&#x27;s costing me!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li> Love it,,feel it tightening and gets rid of wrinkles....</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have very oily skin and therefore I don&#x27;t use creams and oils on my face to maintain moisture. I was using another well known product that I was actually quite pleased with until I tried Hyaluronic Acid Serum. This product is oil free and I appreciate how my face feels so smooth and clean after the application. Some days I&#x27;d like to wear a powder makeup and I usually apply a primer prior to its application. The serum is absorbed nicely through my skin and I don&#x27;t feel dry and tight. The primer glides on and my makeup is flawless.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and I stand behind its claim that it reduces discoloration (I&#x27;ve used it for a month now) and gives my skin a beautiful glow. I am of a darker complexion and discoloration is quite noticeable with my skin however, I SEE a big difference since using this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product was not good. Had too many other ingredients and not enough of the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  I haven&#x27;t used it for a month yet, but I feel it is helping my skin.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Perks of a product with Vitamin C and green tea? Tightened skin, less wrinkles - I noticed a difference withing a week or two!  A little bit goes a long way - a small amount provided full coverage for face and entire neck - leaving my skin feeling healthier and tighter!  I use this product at night and morning before applying makeup - with a 100% guarantee you have nothing to lose - you will love it too!</li>
            <li> absolutely enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Makes my skin feel so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Have ordered a second bottle and plan on not ever running out.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results..disappointed and won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.. great seller. Loved this product.. good under face cream and makeup</li>
            <li> My skin feels much more hydrated since using this product, even with the nasty winter weather rolling in! I plan on continuing to use it on a regular basis. In fact I use mainly InstaNatural products on my face and love them.</li>
            <li> OK, but the product is stock in the bottle, vey hard to take out of the bottle. Also, makes my spf or day cream clumps all over my face. Honestly do not worth $$.&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon Insta Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum I was reading reviews for emu oil. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of years, but I like to read and see how other people use it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway a lady posted and said that she uses this Hyaluronic Acid under the emu oil. Mind you I&#x27;m 48 with no crows feet or laugh lines but I still wanted to see if it could make my skin better. So I placed my order. When it arrived in two days I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. It&#x27;s gel like and I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s from the aloe. It makes my face cool and smoother. Ta da!!  No more pores. I use it in the morning under my face cream which I mixed with a bit of emu oil, and at night under pure emu oil on my face and neck. My skin has never looked better. I&#x27;ve since switched to Insta Naturals emu oil. All I can say is I&#x27;m in love and will continue to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid for my review.</li>
            <li> no difference. great customer service tho</li>
            <li> It is a little thin and so it runs when applying.  I would prefer a little thicker or richer texture.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff. After about two weeks of using it at least once a day, I really see the difference. My skin is glowing! Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is getting smoother. Small scars seem to be fading and getting smoother.I love it so much, I&#x27;ve ordered the Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m only holding  back one star because I&#x27;ve not been using it for very long. I&#x27;ll be curious to see the results after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with this product! It is so easy to use, and feels just great on my skin.  I have tried it for two weeks now, and plan to buy another one before my bottle is empty.  I use it morning and night, and under my makeup. Since I live in a very hot country (Dominican Republic), I need to put on my face non greasy, smooth, fresh and very light creams.  This serum is all that and much more! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and seems to hydrate my skin well.  I use it twice daily - under a tinted moisturizer during the day, and under a facial oil and night cream at bedtime.  I&#x27;ll be 50 in a few months and just recently someone asked me if my daughter and I were sisters - given that type of feedback, I&#x27;ll keep using this!</li>
            <li> This is the best serum that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a nice heavy glass jar with a dropper top. The dropper doesn&#x27;t always pick up the product well enough but it&#x27;s not a major problem. The serum has the consistency of hair gel but emulsifies well when you rub it into the skin. That&#x27;s about where the good things stop for me and this serum. Although it contains Hyaluronic Acid I did not find it to be very moisturizing at all. After reading the ingredients I noticed that it contained witch hazel, glycerin (which can be drying at low dew points), and very few oils. I think that this serum would be fine for the summer or for someone with oily skin but I&#x27;m going to have to pass on finishing this bottle for right now. I plan on reviewing another one of Instanatural&#x27;s serums that has more of an oil base to it in the near future so keep a look out for that.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum absorbs quick which is nice. Also my skin feels smooth and ready for moisturizer. It is made in the USA which means allot to me and their products are Cruelty-free!! I suffer from Dark circles so have been using this mostly for those....success! They appear lighter and my eyes are brighter!</li>
            <li> Not bad...thought I w notice more of a change.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing...it actually instantly brightens up my complexion which I still have a hard time believing. because of lack of sleep my complexion has been really dull and almost grayish. This serum changed that which has never happened before and I&#x27;ve used countless products. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this thing but it works...don&#x27;t think I can ever buy another serum instead.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum works for both the larger and fine wrinkle lines. It is easy to use I would and will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and its great! My skin feels softer and seems to have a glow. The product is light, smells wonderful and is easy to use. I highly recommend it and will be purchasing more in the future. I am also using both eye products from instanaturals and love them!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum on my face for a few weeks now and I think it is helping to tighten my forehead.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this product and was glad that Amazon offered it for such a good price! Ladies, try it out! You will be amazed by the outcome of your skin</li>
            <li> Truly excellent serum. Very easy and sanitary to use (great bottle!), and this should last forever - a little goes a long way. But the price is so reasonable, you&#x27;ll want to keep expanding the areas where you use it (hint: try the backs of your hands. Superb!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful. I use it every morning after washing my face. It tightens and plumps the skin, as well, makes my pores appear smaller. I love the fact that there are no chemicals or harsh ingredients. Great company, great product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this serum! It&#x27;s such a good value for the price. The serum is light, and easily absorbed by the skin. Once I put on the lotion after the serum, my face stays moisturized all day. It&#x27;s important to put on the lotion afterwards to lock in the &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; for me as if I just apply the serum, I feel like I need to reapply the serum again to keep my skin more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it, told 4 friends</li>
            <li> Light-weight, hydrating and absorbs quickly. I love the other benefits I get with this serum.</li>
            <li> Excellent hyaluronic acid for your face. it leaves it really soft after applying it, and absorbs quickly. It has a slight scent that I love. I don&#x27;t like strong scents so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel really silky. I highly recommend if you want to start using a serum.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and I get really dry skin due to under skin dehydration from the disease so I thought I would give this a try I actually have oily and dry face skin anyway I have only used this for four days and it has made a dramatic difference already it evened out the issues and has added hydration to the skin great stuff</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way it makes her skin look.I&#x27;ve tried it also and it&#x27;s pretty incredable. Love your product.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any changes already and use it everyday</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serums usually offer amazing moisturizing benefits for the skin, however a lot of Hyaluronic Acid Serums that I have used in the past do not deliver enough moisture to my skin and some of them even make it feel a bit dryer, so moisturizer over it is a must. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum actually hydrates my skin well enough and I do not need any other facial cream over it. I apply the serum in the morning after I wash and tone my face. It feels a little bit sticky for the first 15 seconds and once is dry I can not even feel that is there. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum leaves my skin moisturized and soft and it is good for under makeup as well. I have combination skin that is acne prone however I had no side effects or breakouts while using this serum. InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a huge 2 fl oz/60 ml bottle that will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> I will surely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome - and super packaging! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Instant results!  My skin thirstily &#x27;drank&#x27; in this product --and it looked and felt GREAT --even after the just the FIRST application!!  Its great and I love it!  It really plumps out and instantly rehydrates my dry dry facial skin! I recommend this for everyone!!</li>
            <li> Love this product !!  After two weeks of using this serum, my face looks and feels smooth and radiant. I&#x27;m turning 50 yes old next month and I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> First time using a serum but as we enter our 30s, we thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums (hyaluronic and vitamin C) as part of our skin regimen (glycolic acid peels) to take care of our skin. This hyaluronic acid serum is nourishing, refreshing, and has a pleasant smell. We use this hyaluronic acid serum after the vitamin C serum twice per day - I like that it can be applied prior to makeup. It&#x27;s easy to apply, quickly absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little early to see any results but after about 1 week of use, our skin feels tighter and hydrated. We&#x27;ll see how it effects fine lines and discoloration. So far my husband and are very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Seeing Results Already! Feels nice..Great price!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Well I have been using the serum Matave 20% vitamin C, which is a great, great product, my skin completely gets hydrated and supple, bought this product thinking on the reviews and it is bigger and more affordable than the one I mentioned above. It didn&#x27;t deliver the same results, this product is thicker, takes more time to sunk in, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel the same, it is good, but not as I expected.</li>
            <li> makes me break out...</li>
            <li> I Liked very much this product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It looks like a great product, but for some reason my face breaks out after I used it. I have been using Age-defying skin clearing serum and it is awesome!!! I love it and my skin looks great. I am tempting to trying Vitamin C serum to see how it works for my skin...</li>
            <li> After a severe reaction to a facial toner I was using caused my neck to be inflamed, itchy, I used this product Hyalauronic Acid Serum and their Vitamin C Serum twice and the flakey, red, burning skin on my neck disappeared - I am so delighted.&lt;br /&gt;This product packs a punch in the form of a clear gel. It spreads evenly and dries quickly without stickiness. It layers well under sunblock. It appears that this formula is packed with all gentle, natural ingredients in addition to hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, like witch hazel, aloe, and jojoba oil. I am hooked! I wish this product came in larger sizes although a little goes a long way - I am using it on my hands and an area on my arm that has slight dermatitis so says my Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Works great for razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This serum is so good ,I would recommend it to any one,the feel and ease of use plus the results are great.So glad I had a chance to use it. Julianne Parkinson Found a very good serum that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I could tell a difference in a week. I used a little extra one the worst areas and am please.  Works as well as some high dollar products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;Only four stars because I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to rate it a five.</li>
            <li> I had been using Instanaturals facial toner with adequate results but when I tried their moisturizing serum immediately after, I was blown away by its tightening effects. I have never tried anything like it!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t react well to the product. The company was very gracious about the situation. I&#x27;m glad others have had so much success w/ it. For me it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, gentle serum for the face -- I use it at night before bed, and it helps to moisturize and protect my skin.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I Received This Product Free Of Charge For An Honest And Unbiased Review To Sample And Review Hyaluronic Acid Serum By InstaNatural. I Have Never Heard Of This Before Or Tried It And Was Really Curious To Find Out More About This Beauty Product. I Was Scared At First To Put Acid Serum On My Face But It Didn&#x27;t Smell Bad At All Or Pull Any Of  Your Natural Beauty Away, I Feel Very Supportive Of InstaNatural Products. It Made My Skin Feel Rejuvenated, Fresh And Clean. It Says To Use A Toner Before Applying And I Did As It Said Might I Say Perfect For Anyone Who Wants A Clean Face! InstaNatural Is A Brand You Can Trust And One Of It&#x27;s Top Ingredients Is Witch Hazel, \\&quot; Perfect For Faces\\&quot;.First Off, Don&#x27;t Let that Little Word \\&quot;Acid\\&quot; Scare You. Hyaluronic Acid Is&#x27;nt Harsh At All, In Fact It&#x27;s The Exact Opposite. It&#x27;s A Powerful Humectant That Keeps Your Skin Hydrated. We All Have Large Amounts Of Spaces Between Our Skin Cells, Where It Provides Moisture, Firmness And Suppleness To Our Skin. Hyaluronic Acid Is A Naturally Occurring Substance Found In The Skin. As We Age, The Amount Of Hyaluronic Acid In Our Skin Diminishes. Makes It Easier For Sun Damage To Occur. One Of The Most Skin Damaging Elements Are UVB Rays From The Sun. Hyaluronic Acid Benefits The Skin As It Protects The Skin From UVB Rays, Which Can Cause Sunspots.</li>
            <li> Great. Really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> It is great product works for me very well.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love Hyaluronic Acid (H.A.) It is one of the most amazing things produced by your body. If you were a car, it would be the oil in your engine. Its everywhere in your body. They even use H.A. in lip injections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think InstaNatural&#x27;s H.A. serum is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It has a light, pleasant smell and is really easy to use. You only need about a pea sized amount for your whole face, so it lasts quite a while. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy. I love the blue bottle it comes in, and the dropper is convenient because it makes it very easy to dispense the amount you need perfectly. I really like all the aditional ingredients that are added to help your skin. It has vitamin C, green tea, jojoba oil, aloe, witch hazel, and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I live, it gets really cold in the winter and I don&#x27;t leave the house much. It makes my skin feel dryer to be stuck indoors all the time, so this H.A. serum is great for me either by itself or as an added boost with your moisturizer. It really helps my skin to retain moisture so if your skin is dry and dehydrated, this would work miracles for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed any anti-aging benefits from it, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it wouldn&#x27;t show results for someone else. Its worth a shot for the moisturizing benefits alone, anti-aging would just be an added bonus as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful mild serum.  Great to use after cleaning the face and applying the Moroccan Rose water.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I love the texture and it&#x27;s amazing how much my skin has improved in just a matter of days! My skin is much softer and I love the fact that I am preventing it from aging! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I was introduced to this amazing product. It has really helped my skin to become balanced, glowing and look more youthful. I love the invigorating sensation when I applied it to my face and has kept my face clear and moisturized. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Very drying no change in skin</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and well packaged. Unfortunately I cannot use it. It was too harsh for my skin and made my face red and puffy and my skin look absolutely terrible. I have used other Vitamin C products before with the Hyaluronic acid, but this one was too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! My face feels smooth and radiant!</li>
            <li> Love this product! A little goes a long way and I use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the results from using this product.  She highly recommends it!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is my FAVORITE skin care company Thank you for keeping this 54year young skin YOUNGER</li>
            <li> awesome product and price</li>
            <li> This serum has been great for improving the texture and tone of my skin.  Noticable improvement in firmness and softness.  Hydration has also improved.  Have been using for about six weeks and plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife only has used it for 2 weeks so her initial thoughts are that &amp;#34; it seems to work&amp;#34; in a subtle way. She has very good skin to begin with so&lt;br /&gt;improvements are in  small increments . Then again it;s only been 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> 5 stars since it is a pure ingredient product, though more ingredients than just hyaluronic acid, but it does make my skin look and feel very smooth and hydrated.  I would recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.  Good customer follow-up proves that they do care about the quality of their product.  There are much more expensive products on the market that are not even near as nice as this.  Lastly, it was shipped very promptly.</li>
            <li> Sorry  this  hyaluronic  acid  serum  has  not  worked  for  me maybe  I  haven&#x27;t  used  it  long  enough  I do  agree  it&#x27;s  has very  good  ingredients  in  it .  LOVE  the  amount  and  price  I will  continue  to  use  it .</li>
            <li> I am 86 years old and this serum has made my face so much smoother and I swear I look at least ten years younger----really love this and have told all my friends even the sixty years old one that it is fantastic-----It is all they say it is and more------thank you from me</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Some improvement is noticed, but not enough time has passed to offer complete review</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It makes my skin feel smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product. I love the way it feels on my skin. I have only used it for a little over a week but what I have experienced has been well worth it. If you have a chance to get this product definitely worth it. Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> felt really nice going on but made me break out something fierce.</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency of InstaNatural’s Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It was gel-like which was nice. Pleasant scent. It left my skin hydrated, brightened, and firm. It also contains Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jajoba oil. And very importantly Made in the USA and cruelty free! Now that I&#x27;m 40 Hyaluronic acid serum is a serious part of my anti-aging regimen.  I try to keep my skin exfoliated. I received a complimentary bottle from BrandBacker to try out and review.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worked miracles but it&#x27;s become a staple in my skin care cabinet.</li>
            <li> So here’s the scoop on Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I was able to try it out so why not. First things first what I love about this is the Ingredients, I absolutely love products that are all natural. Its just guilt free use! The worst thing is creating new problems trying to correct old ones. One of the key ingredient is  Jojoba oil which happens to be one of my favorites and it has a such a great scent. My over all experience with this was good. Its easy to use, I didn’t have any reactions to it. It has a slight smell of the ingredient green tea but the smell doesn’t last long and is very vaint. My skin was definitely smoother, softer and just hydrated after one use. When your skin is hydrated it such a vibrant and healthy look that just make you feel good. What more can I ask for, I looking forward to seeing more results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I noticed a diffrence right away after my first use. I don&#x27;t know about making me look younger oe anything, but I still like it. I live in Colorado, a extremely dry state, and since I started using it I no longer need a moisturizer (which is cool, cause that&#x27;s what is causing my constant breakouts). I use it after I do a chemical peel. Better than any product I&#x27;ve used for skin repair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to blow smoke: this isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle. But, if you are looking for a great product that will make you feel like you a doing great things for your skin: this is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for less expensive but equally as good products as Rodan and Fields. This product works nicely.</li>
            <li> I am currently using both InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid (in the a,m.), and Retinol Serum at night.  I am seeing definite results; however, not overnight.  I am 66 years old, but if you saw me you would guess a younger age--maybe 50 something.  I think I will continue to see good results as time goes by.  I love InstaNatural&#x27;s products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;66 year-old</li>
            <li> Love this product, very nourishing and refreshing with good instant results.</li>
            <li> This is simply a diluted and generally inferior version of the product you thought you were getting. Get the OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum instead, it&#x27;s real. This isn&#x27;t. This has superfluous filler ingredients in place of the basics that actually make skin more attractive.</li>
            <li> Love it, work well on me will buy again</li>
            <li> I really love this serum.  When applied it really tightens up my facial and neck line skin.  Love the price and the very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of gel like liquid. Easy to apply. As to effectiveness, I still cannot say since i only started using it three days ago, But overall I like it because it smells good, the price is very reasonable for it&#x27;s size &amp; I feel that since it contains all the ingredients like vitamin C ( I hope they indicate on the box how many percentage) , 5% hyaluronic acid , Vitamin E, Jojoba etc. Also, I decided to get three bottles on my very first purchase coz I have confidence on the product when they offered the 100% satisfaction guarantee. In my opinion, this company is very sincere with their claims. I will write another feedback after one month when I see results.</li>
            <li> This product is silky smooth. It has very little scent but the smell is pleasant. It spreads easily and absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, leaving it refreshed. I have been using it for a couple weeks. It is too early to tell if it will have an effect on my dark spots but my skin texture feels like it has improved a little. The 2 oz. bottle costs less than similar products, providing twice the amount for the same price. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I like this product under my make up.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to hold everything in place for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it&#x27;s anti wrinkle aspect...I have deep expression lines&lt;br /&gt;around my mouth, eyes and between my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product twice a day as well as&lt;br /&gt;using it with a derma wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I do not see much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> Loving it !Makes my skin feel moist without being sticky.It also looks brighter.Still waiting to see what affect it has on spots and wrinkles.I have used it for 2 weeks now.Hope it delivers ! I also bought one for my sister and she is satisfied with it too !</li>
            <li> Love this product 👍my pores smaller and moist.</li>
            <li> LOVE! I had lots of dark spots on my face especially near the eye, cheek bone area. 1 1/2 late I have none! and im not even exaggerating. my skin is smooth and I can even see my large pores have reduced its size. will re-purchase. once bottle i run low.</li>
            <li> This acid is simply amazing.  Easy to apply absorbs quickly and works in just weeks. I m extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Yes It is just what I expected.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I notice a difference in my 11&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I tried this brand since I went through the 1 oz so fast.  I use it four times a day sometime 6 times (every time I wash my face).  It works well and the price is ok.  I find that I do not want to be without it on the face.  When I do not have it on you can see more lines on the face.  I will stay with this brand over my other brand since it works just as well and I can get it in a 2 oz size.  Would like to see the price stay low for people to really be able to buy and use as they need it. I work outside and get dirty so I use it more than an average person would.  Washing my face constantly.</li>
            <li> The first hyalauric acid serum was like a gel, so I was quite surprised the new one was so watery. how come?j</li>
            <li> Its actually pretty good</li>
            <li> product is great and I will be ordering more in the future</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is a great size and doing what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the product however I do find that it is a bit difficult to get it sucked up by the stopper at times, having to &amp;#34;re-dip&amp;#34; to get the serum into the littel stopper. Otherwise it seems to feel nice /not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that contained the Hyal. Acid and Vit. C.  Yours is the only one I could with both at an affordable price.  Best of all, I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have very oily skin, and still prone to breakouts. I&#x27;ve used the serum for several years and love it. I use it after washing, applying a thin layer in my &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone and the results are less oiliness as the day progresses. No more breakouts! It has a nice and light feel and I really have no discernible wrinkles -- people think I look to be in my 40&#x27;s. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Been using for a couple weeks now along with the vitamin c face wash, the toner spray,  the eye serum and the night moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been getting more than usual compliments on my skin. I love the products so far. They make my skin feel so soft and healthy. Has def become a large part of my skin care routine!!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly without irritations</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum that I ordered from is awesome. It has done a great job on my skin. I am so happy that I ordered it. I just love it 5stars for the product.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum and I love it. I am 71years old and women age 50 and up are asking me why I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles. Most of it is family genes and the rest is this serum. My skin is soft and smooth and when I am applying it feel good on my skin. Caution, you only need to use a small amount because the consistency of this serum goes a long way. I also use it on my neck and I follow with  a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and so affordable, I wish I had discovered it years ago. I noticed an immediate overnight change in the texture of my skin, it was smoother, my pores were smaller. I am very fair, never tan and have sensitive skin. I even use it on my neck, ears, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and the back of my aging hands. Of course that means I use it up faster but its affordable! I am now well into my 2nd month of using it. There is a slight tightening &amp; tingling feeling after I apply it to my clean face, which I assume is the shrinking. It does not sting or burn.. Ladies, give this a try before you buy something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a different brand that I think worked better.  Can&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin.  Goes on smoothly and hopefully it is helping my skin on the inside.  I had my eyelids &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; about 6 months ago and the Plastic Surgeon suggested I use hyaluronic acid on my skin.  Of course, he had some to sell but it was about 3 times the price.  Probably 3 times as strong but I think this is probably better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to use in conjunction with a vitamin c serum to really add a glow and air-brushed texture to mt skin...it does that! I am pleasantly surprised on how quickly I noticed a tighter shrinking of the pore holes and a luminous look to my skin...I will continue using and update you, will I buy again....Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Oh...and the company is great with getting back to assure your satisfaction and great experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this as well and use them together great stuff !!</li>
            <li> I started using the 2 weeks,this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this off with a little scary fact: most Hyaluronic Acid found in medicines is derived from the combs of roosters (yuck!), but InstaNatural only uses vegan Hyaluronic Acid.  Phew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like other Hyaluronic Acid Serums I&#x27;ve used in the past, I loved the little glass bottle with dropper, which made it so simple to apply the product onto my face.  My skin just soaked this stuff up - I am not sure if that&#x27;s normal, or if I am that much in need of hydration, but I barely got the chance to rub it in before it all was absorbed!  It definitely gave my skin a fresh and dewy appearance, without making it look greasy at all.  I felt like my skin retained moisture throughout the rest of the day, which isn&#x27;t always the case with my moisturizers in the wintertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you are looking for Hyaluronic Acid Serum, definitely give this stuff a try!  The best thing about InstaNatural? Their guarantee: InstaNatural is proud to back their products with a 100% Lifetime Satisfaction Guarantee Policy. If you are not completely happy with your purchase, just contact them for a refund - no questions asked. They are confident you will enjoy results - or get your money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a few months ago.  It works really well.  My skin looks much smoother and feels firmer.  It has also helped reduced the redness in my skin.  I&#x27;ve recommended it several of my friends, the ones that tried all love it.  The company delivered in less time than expected and it arrived in perfect condition, both times I&#x27;ve purchased it.  I&#x27;m just starting on my second bottle even though I use on my face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and this serum! I use it as a light moisturizer/primer underneath my sunscreen/bb cream in the mornings and it works great for those purposes. It is not irritating at all and it is moisturizing as long as you put something else on top of it to seal the hyaluronic acid. If the outside atmosphere is dry, then the serum can feel a bit dry because it sucks the moisture from inside your body instead. However, sealing it with sunscreen/makeup removes that problem. It also serves as a barrier between my sunscreen/makeup and my skin so my skin feels less irritated. I haven&#x27;t been able to find an spf product that doesn&#x27;t bother my skin in some way so this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> I have paired the Hyaluronic Acid Serum with my derma roller and they are the perfect combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.The serum is light gel that dissolves nicely into the skin without residue, the fact the product is absorbed by the skin allows you not to worry about it coming off while  you sleep. Best of all it&#x27;s not greasy. I was skeptical about putting a moisturizer and my makeup on top of the serum (as I use it twice a day -under makeup during the day and before bed at night-) but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with using it in the day time when used with the products mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Another concern prior to using this product was my sensitive skin, I was afraid I would breakout or irritate my skin, Hyaluronic Acid Serum hasn&#x27;t created any havoc on my delicate skin which I am so happy about. No breakouts, no irritation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Lastly, another added plus which you don&#x27;t see often was the company sent me an email thanking for purchasing the product AND shared their contact information in case I had any further questions/concerns about the product while using the serum. Now, that is customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a few weeks, I now trust it and would recommend it. I am getting another bottle for sure. The price and quality are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Good product and Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a reasonably priced hyaluronic acid serum. this is it. I use it every day in my anti aging regime. Like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products. Love, love, love this one.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say my skin looks and feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;(At long last.)  And the very nice comments I receive&lt;br /&gt;back it up. Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid  Serum is helpful, but it is not as much as I would need this soon, perhaps long time use because of my advance age.</li>
            <li> Nice light texture. Use it every other day just for preventive purposes. Skin feels great!</li>
            <li> Amazing face serum!! I&#x27;m always trying new beauty products and this has been my absolute favorite by far. I love the way it feels when you put it on. It&#x27;s so refreshing and light. And you know it works when the first thing you notice is your plump pout.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Acid serums daily  for a couple months. I find that Hyaluronic Acid is very moisturizing. I like to apply it immediately after a shower. First I apply a vitamin C serum then the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, then when these are absorbed I apply a moisturizing sunscreen.  My skin stays well hydrated all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In theory (according to Livestrong&#x27;s article on benefits of Hyaluronic Acid for the skin), Hyaluronic Acid holds many times its weight in water so it helps hold moisture. in lotions \\&quot;it functions not only to deliver water to the skin, but also to hold it there. As a large molecule, it doesn&#x27;t permeate deep into the skin, but instead stays near the surface where it moisturizes the skin surface layers.\\&quot; (source: http://www.livestrong.com/article/57045-benefits-hyaluronic-acid-skin/). I hope it is okay to link to the source as it is one of the better explanations I have seen. My experience is that it does help my skin stay moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic acid works just as well as any other I have tried. I compared the ingredient list with a brand I previously reviewed and the ingredients were pretty much the same. The main difference was that InstaNatural came in a 2 ounce bottle while the other brand came in a one ounce bottle (for more or less the same price). Both brands are made in the USA and were not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend a good quality Hyaluronic acid in general. And recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum because it also seems to be good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free sample of this product  for review.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth serum, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I went with the 5 day treatment to see how effective the combined ingredients compared to major brands. I&#x27;m so impressed, I told my mother last night to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t moisturize like intended, but the cellular rejuvenation is exactly what I was looking for. And great price at that.</li>
            <li> Believe the 5 star reviews. This product worked wonders on my mom. My mom has helped me through all the good and bad times in my life. Unfortunately, all those hardships have shown on my mom&#x27;s face.  This product has reversed the hands of time and given me a reminder how young my mom once looked like. But through it all, my mom is a beautiful person. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice, soil use on the day before the sunscreen and at night apply the serum retinol, I think we should have more concentration of hyaluronic acid because I see very slow results.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this serum several weeks ago, I have been using it morning and night everyday.  It has reduced the fine lines around the eyes and given my skin a youthful appearance.  The serum melts into the skin leaving it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serum will be part of my daily routine from now on.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this. I especially love that it&#x27;s animal-friendly. Seems to plump skin and not leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for 5 days now and have noticed a big difference in the moisture of my skin! Living in utah in the winter can be tough on my skin but this has helped keep it from drying out as much. I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in discolorations yet but it has only been 5 days.</li>
            <li> I am vey satisfied with this product. I have been using it for about 4 weeks &amp; I notice the improvement of the lines on my forehead and my Nick libe also my skin looks lighter. I will contin&amp;uacute;e to use it!</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised at the results...I really like this product...first being vegan with no animal testing and second it does plump up the skin...this will be a regular on my beauty arsenal!!!</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin on face.  I put moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  My skin feels soft and hydrated after using it.  If you have dry skin, this works beautifully under your moisturizer, but if you have oily skin you could definitely get away with using this on its own.  It&#x27;s hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.  This sinks right in and you can put other products or cosmetics on top without any kind of interference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was offered to me for review, but my opinion is 100% honest.  I will definitely be buying this again (with my own money...).</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly. I have used many products over the years.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not have heavy feel/oil base. So it is light. But I do not see any changes in skin. Not in appearance or feel.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use until finished but do not see any difference in wrinkles or skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s been several weeks now since I&#x27;ve been using this and Ive seen a difference with my skin. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this very long, but seeing some noticeable difference</li>
            <li> Really fast delevery for a great item ! Thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and do notice a difference ! I am very lined around eyes forehead and jaw line and feel that the lines are softening a great deal  As well as a very noticeable brightening effect&lt;br /&gt;Im very happy with it so far&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels on my skin too no irritation whatsoever and I have very fair skin  I will definitely re-order thiis product again  thankyou</li>
            <li> Clearly have seen good results in two weeks! Will continue to use this product and reorder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00K2O3NV2 InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum - Anti Aging Serum for Face - Reduces Wrinkles, Fine Lines &amp; More - For Youthful &amp; Radiant Skin - With Vitamin C Serum and More - 2 OZ]]</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using this serum after micro needling and I can feel it going to work on my skin as soon as I smooth it on.  I&#x27;m anxious to see the long-term results but i&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, so I&#x27;ll report back in later. I&#x27;m happy with the product so far and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works to keep my face hydrated all day long. It quickly absorbs into my skin too.</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks.</li>
            <li> Been using a week and this stiff is real deal.  Wrinkles in forehead look like had botox.....in a week!!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping with sun spots a little, and some fine lines</li>
            <li> skin feels soft after use</li>
            <li> This serum isn&#x27;t bad....it goes on good and dries fast but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in the wrinkle area....not yet anyway....I will give it more time...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now.  I bought 3 bottles.  I&#x27;m hoping something happens by the time I use my third bottle.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with both the serums I got recently from InstaNaturals. Just a week after using the Vit C serum, I could see dramatic changes in my skin colour, tone, and texture. I am 42 and have suffered from acne for a long time since my teenage. Now, after using your Hyaluronic acid serum, even the pock marks seem to be vanishing. Finally, at this age I realize what it is like to have clear skin and feel confident about my looks...I no longer hesitate to look at mirrors in public places!! I used to dread it before, especially under those bright tube lights!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of serum and I use after washing my face- adding the vitamin c and then applying this after. It is amazing to see how plump you skin gets! Love it!</li>
            <li> Really have not used this product long enough to see how well it works..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference</li>
            <li> I use this with vitamin c serum and it has helped my age spot to become lighter.</li>
            <li> This product is good for around the eyes.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with his product. I like the ingredients, the price and the company follow up to make sure I am pleased. A nice and welcome personal touch . A thumbs up for this company! A side note as an esthetician, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have several InstaNatural products and find I can always rely on them for quality and great products made with many organic ingredients.  This serum is a wonderful moisturizer that I put on after my shower and before I apply my makeup.  Full of vitamins C&amp;E, I feel good about this serum and how it is making my skin feel healthier, more moisturized and providing tons of nutrients and antioxidants.  I really like that it is paraben-free and alcohol-free, so I know I am safe while using it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BETTER THAN AMARA PRODUCT LINEYOU GET MORE FOR THE MONEY AND WORKS IMMEDIATELY I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALSO VERY GOOD ON THE WALLET</li>
            <li> I am on the second bottle; speaks for itself.  Slowly but surely, my face is regaining the glow it used to have.</li>
            <li> Great stuff; my 72 year old face loves it, I&#x27;m on my 3rd or 4th bottle, and will continue to use it. I love how it feels when I put it on, it&#x27;s so refreshing , and not greasy, which is another big plus.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have seen an improvement in the color of my skin....it&#x27;s just great and&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural should be proud of their success. Great organic products are hard to find so look&lt;br /&gt;no futher.</li>
            <li> I have tried many similar to this but by far this is the absolute BEST!</li>
            <li> Great product - great price.</li>
            <li> Love how moisturizing it is</li>
            <li> I have tried several hyaluronic acid before I try this one InstaNatural LLC. With many other products that I tried I did not get what I was looking for but with this product it was great from the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the feeling of the product on my skin in the key to me even using it, if it does not feel great when placed into my hands and moved around a little then I am not usually going to this again but with this Hyaluronic Acid Serum it past the first test now on to my face. After first application it was a go for me, it has been 2 weeks since I started and I noticed a few changes to my facial skin, less dry in the morning when I first apply and those lines around my mouth are better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle with is well designed as well you can get your moneys worth out of this product by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I only used it a few days and can clearly see a huge difference with my skin.  I will continue to use your serum and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> my skin fell in love the first time i used the serum. i was so happy with the results that I bought a vial for my best friend.</li>
            <li> I have tried several serums and so far this is my favorite. It has an extra ounce in the bottle and not as runny so more for your money and better quality and good results</li>
            <li> I bought this and , I have to say I really loved what it did for my skin. I would still be buying this if I hadn&#x27;t learned I could by the powdered hyaluronic acid in powder for from Bulk Supplement and make much more , much cheaper. I still feel if you don&#x27;t want to make your own, this product was very nice!</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell but I recognized noticeable improvement on the texture and brightness of my skin. I use in the a.m. and p.m. before moisturizer and makeup. Plus price and size very affordable compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have used many Hyaluronic serums and this is by far the best!! Its not watery like most other brands and it doesnt make my face feel sticky. I emailed their customer service to find out the percentage of Vit C and their response was 10%. It was a major concern for me because most Vit C serums contain 20% and my sensitive skin simply cant handle it. This is the perfect combination for people with sensitive skin. I get the benefits of both Hyaluronic Acid and Vit C in one bottle. Its only been a week and my skin already is more hydrated and glowing. After applying this serum I use my Argan or Rosehip oil. Ive tried several Instanatural products and I havent been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is great. I love this.</li>
            <li> This serum appears to be decreasing the depth of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Very good. Not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a little sketched out by any products with such a lengthy, claim-filled headline; however, I see that is the going trend for all serum sellers on Amazon (Though seriously, who started that, and when can it stop??).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this bottle, and it was leaked slightly. However, it was packed very well and so the leaking was contained to the cap and the wrap around it. When I used the serum, it immediately softened and smoothed my skin. It wasn&#x27;t the best smelling, but it wasn&#x27;t bad either. And honestly, if I&#x27;m using a serum, it&#x27;s for the effects on my skin and not the scent. As long as a product is formulated with quality, beneficial ingredients, I&#x27;m good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains &amp;#34;Botanical Hyaluronic Acid&amp;#34; otherwise known as cassia angustifolia seed polysaccharide. I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of hyaluronic acid and have never tried this form. I&#x27;ll admit, it did feel just like the other hyaluronic acid serums I have used - super refreshing to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I teetered between four and five stars. I think this product deserves 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;If the price stays at $15, I think that is fair. However, so many companies grossly overprice their products, making it a much smarter and more cost efficient solution to just buy directly from the wholesale manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the manufacturer&#x27;s website, this identical product is available for a few dollars at the 2oz size. However, shipping is usually high on those websites. So, I would definitely continue to purchase it from this company if the prices remained fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do really like this product, and would recommend it to a friend or relative.</li>
            <li> I use this product two time a day and love it !!!!</li>
            <li> This serum has a thin gel like quality to it. It is easy to apply and just takes a couple drops each application so this bottle has lasted a long time. It leaves my skin feeling a little tighter after applying. My skin feels smooth and is not dry but I do prefer to follow up with a moisturizer. Great product. Sample received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for long, but can say that I see a difference already.  It is not a huge difference as, again, I haven&#x27;t used it for long but it is noticeable.  It has a good consistency, dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup in any way.  I will write another review later after using it for a longer period of time, but as of now I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Insta Naatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum for one month.  This is the first time using this type of product.  I have been very happy with the results that I am experiencing.  My facial pores appear to be smaller and the wrinkles and fine lines are definitely minimized.  I ordered this brand because of the customer reviews.  I was pleased to hear that people with sensitive skin had no problems.  I do have sensitive skin and I have had no problems.  I was amazed at how smooth my skin felt even after the first use.  It applies very easily and I use it morning and night followed with a moisturizer as suggested.  I just ordered two more Insta Natural products and I am anxiously waiting to use them.  They are the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer and the night cream.  You will not be disappointed in this product.  The longer you use this type of product, the better your skin will look in clarity and firmness.</li>
            <li> I am impressed, this is the 1st time I have use any kind of skin care on my face in years.  My skin is extremely sensitive and I have been using this product twice a day since the middle of DEC, 2014 with no negative effects.  It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy residue on the surface of my skin as so many other products have done in the past.  I am 64 and I am not aging gracefully as some people have the good fortune of doing.  This serum has taken a few wrinkles out and has put a nice smoothness and softness to my skin that I have not had for many years.  My Mother-in-law even noticed that my skin looked really good.  This 2 oz. bottle has lasted me almost 2 months and I WILL be reordering more.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about two weeks. Not long, but so far my skin does feel softer and my overall skin tone is looking much more even.&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I am quite happy with the serum</li>
            <li> I use this every night after washing my face. I especially like to use this under my eyes in which I have dark undereye circles. I am very pleased with the results i have noticed with this product. The dark areas under my eyes are diminishing, fine lines are fading. I look younger and rejuvinated! I am happy to recieve this serum to review. I have absolutelly no complaints!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice BIG (2 fl oz!!) serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: Deionized Water,Organic Aloe, Witch Hazel, Hyaluronic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Methylsulfonylmethane, Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Geranium Essential Oil, Vitamin C, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Vitamin E, Tocopheryl Acetate, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like aloe and witch hazel. The serum itself is thin and milky opaque. It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way so this bottle will really last you a long time. Be careful to put a little on or otherwise you will get a tacky film on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this. It smells very nice and goes on smooth. I definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a  Anti-Aging Serum.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so have to be careful what I put on my face.  I have used this product for over a week and have had no side effects at this point.  I do think my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old with combination skin &amp; unfortunately I still deal with some (not bad) acne. I&#x27;ve noticed that while using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum my acne had simmered down quite a bit probably really noticed by week 2. I usually use the Neutrogena acne control lotion during the day, but kept forgetting to put it in after my hyaluronic acid &amp; then to my surprise I didn&#x27;t even need it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased the vitamin C serum which I love. For no real reason other than maybe subconsciously trying to ration my supply... I developed the routine of using the Hyaluronic Acid for day time use &amp; my Vitamin C serum for night time &amp; Rose-hip oil on top of each, and I must say some how the combo is working as I&#x27;ve been told multiple time by various friends how great I&#x27;m looking!!  So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say though that I have developed a drying up of my skin just below my lips just above either side of chin (if that makes sense).  Not sure yet which product is responsible for this yet, but if I figure it out I&#x27;ll update my post. In the mean time I&#x27;m putting vitamin A&amp;D to help with this issue as I do love the overall results!</li>
            <li> Feels really moisturizing on my skin.  I use it under my BB cream in the morning and it makes my skin look &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Absorbs very well, makes the skin so soft to the touch.Given it;&#x27;s 2 oz. size and price, it was a very good bargain. I also like that it is not so sticky as some other HA products.</li>
            <li> Only used twice used after Roller Derm can&#x27;t give an opinion yet l write another review in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell any difference after having used this for a month, but it hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin in any way. It just feels like I&#x27;m smearing aloe vera gel on my face and that&#x27;s about it. I prefer the bottles that squirt the product rather than using the dropper method because it&#x27;s faster. Now that I&#x27;ve reached the bottom of the bottle, the dropper doesn&#x27;t pull up enough of the product in one go.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog and I really liked it. Not much scent and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li> I like how this doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling sticky. It has all organic ingredients in it. It does take some time for the product to work. It&#x27;s meant to help with wrinkle lines on the face. Those don&#x27;t go away over night. I do feel like the original price is a little steep, but it&#x27;s discounted right now. Stock up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for review. I am a selected blogger. I give my own opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this serum during and after derma-rolling along with additional aloe vesta gel - this is a serum and not creamy so it goes on easily and cools down the skin after treatment too. I love it so I bought another bottle of it while the price is good! I have noticed that my skin is plumper and as I move toward that 60 mark I am glad for this effect! If my skin feels dry this makes a nice touch up and it isn&#x27;t sticky. I use a light vit E cream over the serum after it dries.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Hyaluronic Acid Serum after using InstaNatural Vitamin C for some time and loving the results I was getting from it. Both my husband and I have noticed great results from both products. Our skins&#x27; texture and tone has improved significantly and we have noticed a brighter complexion only after a few weeks of use. I have noticed a huge improvement in my husbands wrinkles since he started using the serums. I apply both products after the shower, I don&#x27;t wear make up so the only other thing I apply to my skin is an SPF moisturizer and my skin feels great all day long. We really love this product and I&#x27;m excited to try more of InstaNaturals products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending this product to all my friends and they love it too!</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. I have been using it about a month. Have noticed some improvement for the puffiness &amp; dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Like.  Am using in combo with phytoceramides</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  It is far more economical than &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; products that have the same ingredients.  I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now and I can&#x27;t really say that I&#x27;ve seen any changes in my skin. I was hoping to get rid of some fine lines around my eyes but some actually look worse not that I&#x27;m saying this product is at fault, just that it&#x27;s not helping. It hasn&#x27;t changed the texture or dryness of my skin either.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I didn&#x27;t even know it existed before it was sent to me for review, and now I&#x27;m sold on it.  The thing is, my skin has gone from mixed to surprisingly dry in certain spots.  I&#x27;d say something here about avoiding the problem by not getting old but we all know what the truth of that is!  Most moisturizers drive me crazy because the feel of anything heavy or oily makes me want to claw my skin off.  And during the summer, it&#x27;s even worse.  I can put moisturizer on and have it wiped off in minutes, so it&#x27;s not likely to do me much good.  Then I got a bottle of this serum, and WOW.  I put it on, it wasn&#x27;t sticky or greasy, but my skin felt so much better immediately.  What a relief it is to find something that really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural makes quality products, and they are generous with them.  This is a lot of product for a very little bit of money, and a little of it goes a long way.  They&#x27;re not going to get rich marketing this way, but they are going to make a lot of people a whole lot more comfortable inside their skins.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was a little skeptical before purchasing it, but it has far exceeded my expectations. I love the way it makes my face feel and it is definitely improving the wrinkle lines. So far I&#x27;ve recommended it to five friends and 4 are using it regularly. Just purchased my 5th bottle!</li>
            <li> Fantastic, come on time, works well, everything that I expected. N</li>
            <li> InstaNatural does it again.  I love all of their products that I&#x27;ve tried so far so when given the chance to try another one I took advantage of the opportunity.  I love anything with hyaluronic acid in it.  This serum is no exception.  It applies smooth and even and my skin soaks it right up.  It has kept my skin moisturized all day without being greasy plus it really helps with my under eye puffiness in the mornings.  The anti-aging benefits are such a bonus.  This is a great product. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Amazing product  thanks for letting me review In exchange for product</li>
            <li> Works great yet still gentle enough on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.  After one week of use I can see a difference in my skin tone and fine lines.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t really like is the texture and how tacky it feels once on the face.  You definitely need to use good moisturizer over top.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I was hesitant to buy/use at first. It has made a huge difference with my skin tone and face. Highly recommend buying this serum and making it a part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. First thing , the label is so attractive and its the first thing that caught my eye. I use this interchangablely with the insta natural vitamin c serum. It does not have a scent and works wonderfully to hydrate the skin. I would recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - makes my skin feel smooth and younger. Reduces the appearance of wrinkles and helps being moisture to my skin. Great quality product!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> It feels and smells good pn the skin. Too soon to tell how effective it is</li>
            <li> I was offered this as a free product and the customer service is fantastic... but I am just someone who cannot use hyaluronic acid in any face products. I have tried it multiple times from various companies and it dries my skin.</li>
            <li> Everything in this serum is found in nature and has reputations for being great remedies for a variety of skin issues - hyaluronic acid is a strong natural moisturizer, witch hazel shrinks pores, vitamin C renews skin / fades scars and aloe, green tea, jojoba oil and vitamin E are great for skin health on a few different levels. I figured that since I&#x27;m not sensitive to anything on the ingredients list, so it can&#x27;t hurt to try. The price was great, the bottle is made of dark, sturdy glass, and the dropper is easy to use, so the packaging is all around fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself behaves more like a gel since most of the ingredients are suspended in aloe. It goes on like a cool gel and sinks in IMMEDIATELY, so you have to work quickly to cover the whole face. I use this twice a day - once after cleaning and before moisturizer in the morning, and once after cleaning before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was AMAZED to see a difference after only two days since I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting a huge difference for a while. I have large pores and most of them were visibly smaller (probably due ot the witch hazel). My acne scars from the previous weeks have faded faster than expected (yay for Vit C!) and my skin just feels better, probably due to the aloe and all the moisturizers in this product. I have oily skin naturally but it gets dehydrated easily, so the hyaluronic acid seemed to have solved that issue by sinking in quickly and &amp;#34;gripping&amp;#34; on to any moisturizers I put on top. I no longer have flaking issues around old acne scars and my skin looks &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;, but not in an oily way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m SO happy to have added this to my skin regime. I will keep using it twice daily. I haven&#x27;t noticed miracles, per se, but the smaller pores, fading scars and calmer skin is worth it. I&#x27;ll report back in a month or two if this helped at all with my on-and-off adult acne.</li>
            <li> Well I have used it consistently since it was received but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin as of yet.  When applied, I can feel what&lt;br /&gt;seems to be a &amp;#34; tightening &amp;#34;, but nothing beyond that...nothing visible. I do want to see if over time it reduces my pores and smooths the few wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> For the life of me, I can&#x27;t fathom how this stuff could have worked for all those who wrote positive reviews. After applying it religiously to dark (brown) spots on my face and hands twice a day for three months I have noticed no change in their appearance. If the positive reviews are genuine then I must conclude I belong to a different species whose skin does not respond to this concoction.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Not a miracle cure.must use consistently to see a difference. Noticed an improvement in the 2nd week. Wrinkles  around my eyes and mouth melting away. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this and I absolutely love it! After 3 weeks I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in my skin. I have changed up my skincare routine many times over the years, and this is a game changer.&lt;br /&gt;I start off my skincare routine by cleansing my skin 2x/day with Nubian Heritage African Black Soap, followed by Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Witch Hazel Toner, then follow it up with this product. Once this dries, I use my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product.  I like the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> After I purchased one of InstaNatural product, I am very excited to try out another one of their product. This is 2oz bottle unlike other serum, I think because it uses more since it is very thick. The good thing is that it is not sticky nor heavy to the skin and feels just right for the moist bouncy skin. I would recommend this product to people concerns with wrinkles and dryness of their skin. I have been using this product with my mask once a week to give a bouncy healthy skin.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality serum and comes in a large blue glass bottle, which speaks to the quality and care of the company in protecting the natural ingredients.  The company also provided helpful tips and tricks in a follow-up email after I ordered.  I like that personal touch - they recommend to gently pat the product on your skin and let it absorb.  You can follow up with a daily moisturizer or makeup after for overall coverage.  It absorbs beautifully, glides on the skin like a dream.  The serum is very thick and clear and clean smelling.  It feels like it is dense with nutrition and hydration.  My skin feels incredibly soft and supple after one week of use.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I used this product and really liked how it felt on my skin. Please note that I paid full price for it so this is not any paid commercial! It lasted quite a long time since you use so little. It is not going to get rid of wrinkles per se, but it did seem to give a &amp;#34;youthful glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face brake out, it has a very thick consistency, not for me:(,</li>
            <li> only been using the present for a couple weeksbut I can tell the fine line I decreasing on my skin is extremely moisturize I don&#x27;t know that everyone will have the result but for me two weeks I can see a difference thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been trying it out for a while! After testing out the product for a while I have started to notice the benefits - my skin feels hydrated and looks more plump and radiant.  I will definitely continue to use this throughout the winter, where my skin tends to get drier, and will repurchase it once my bottle runs out (this will take a while though as the bottle contains 60ml of the serum). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent, great price!</li>
            <li> I put the serum on work  Fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best serum ever!</li>
            <li> I am not being paid for this review. I received the Hyaluronic Acid Serum in a timely fashion.This Item does what it said it would do.This product was free.</li>
            <li> I received the Instanatural Hyaluronic Serum a few weeks ago, and started using it immediately since I had run out of the WattsBeauty 100% Hyaluronic Acid. I came across this while looking through the listings for the WattsBeauty version, and the size and price was attractive, as well as the inclusion of green tea, vitamin C, and jojoba oil. When I recived it, I was pleased to find that it was in a glass bottle as opposed to WattsBeauty&#x27;s plastic squirt bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face, and patted it dry, then used about a large pea-sized drop on my entire face and neck. I noticed immediately that it felt more moist. I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with Aveeno&#x27;s day cream with SPF, and Acure night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that my combination skin has felt less greasy in the T-zone, and less dry on my cheeks and chin, my hormonal acne from my cycle has lessened, and overall, my skin looks and feels less fatigued. The only reason I dropped a star for the product is because of ease of use of the dropper; I found it a bit hard to draw the serum into the pipette and it tended to goop up the mouth of the bottle. Maybe if the bulb on the dropper was a bit larger, it&#x27;d have more suction? Overall, a wonderful product, which I will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized glass bottle with glass dropper that is easy to use.  The serum doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and rubs in and is absorbed into the skin quickly.  There is no goo or residue.  The serum helps lessen the appearance of fine lines by plumping up your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  So far I am very impressed.  I am very happy with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;This product contains Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin C, and Jojoba Oil.  I love how smooth it applies to my skin and it has virtually no smell.  The texture is nice; it is not sticky or gooey.  It goes on easily and dries like it is not there.  I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Age spots are definitely fading. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice! It soaked in nicely and didn&#x27;t feel oily. It was nice and light and smelled nice too. Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher. Insta Naturals knows what&#x27;s up with skincare!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and packaged nicely. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now. After cleansing and toning my face I use the serum followed by moisturizer. I really do feel like the serum has been helping beat winter skin. My skin is less blotchy and dry.</li>
            <li> Hylauronic acid is a must for all. As always, I love my product from Insta Natural and would highly recommend purchasing from them.</li>
            <li> I love this serum I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Great for smooth skin. I use it after peels and prior to putting on make up. It is great after using a facial roller. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> So far it seems like its making my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I really am happy with this and have been asked if I used botox! Hoorah! It is not a moisturizer though. You will still need a good quality moisturizer also.</li>
            <li> Well first of all this this review is kind of useless.I mean this serum is made by Insta Natural, how can it not get 5 stars and an awesome review. I can actually feel my skin tighten after applying, It is not sticky and absorbs perfectly into my skin. This serum seems to eliminate the dark circles under my eyes from lack of sleep. The moisturizing aspect of the serum for my skin is great as well, not to mention that it reduces the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead as well. It seems to flawlessly smooth out the texture of my skin in a very positive way. Needless to say if you haven&#x27;t gathered by now, I really like this serum. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic!  Works wonders on complexion.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail earlier this week, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed too big of a difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week. The product feels nice on my skin, is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> I like how this serum is slightly thicker and it goes on smoothly and dries quickly. It is perfect under a moisturizer and foundation. I did not make me break out at all and my skin feels firmer. I also apply this at night and my skin looks refreshed the next morning.</li>
            <li> I love this serum after one week i have noticed a difference. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the price and size. Honestly, have been finishing up another brand first before using your product. If I am not please with quality I will be sure do let you know. Thank you</li>
            <li> InstaNaturals Hylauronic Acid Serum is a very nice product. The reasons I like it are:&lt;br /&gt;Hylauronic Acid is wonderful for hydration, My skin feels plumper.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels firmer and the fine lines around my mouth seem to be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I love how easily it spreads on my face&lt;br /&gt;My moisturizer soaks in better when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNaturals has great customer support, I had an issue and it was resolved right away!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I was able to grab this while it was at an introductory price and I&#x27;m so happy InstaNaturals could help me with the shipping issue. I&#x27;ll continue to support a business like this.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t absorbed into the skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Incredible!  I wash my face and wait for it to dry completely.  Then use this acid which is a kind of thick clear gel and feels very refreshing.  Once it dries which is very fast, I immediately feel my skin tightening and incredibly soft.  Sometimes I use moisturizer over it but my skin already looks much more radiant and the pores smaller. Will definitely be a part of my beauty regimen from now on.</li>
            <li> Came back exhausted from an 8-day camping trip with sunburn face on 7/6 - dark circles and spots under eyes appeared like - angrily. I use the serum twice a day and noticed the darkness fading away on 7/14. Just turned 43 a week ago, my reaction toward the result is beyond happy because I finally find something that works after trying this and that for so long, and the seller deserves another five stars by showing me how much they care for their customers. Great product and great service - THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is wonderful, my skin feels so soft and looks radiant. It is a must have!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff helps clear skin fast!! I highly recommend it if you have hear and there pimples.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!! I would give it six stars if I could. I&#x27;ve ordered many other brands at all price ranges. This is the winner by far. A true serum. No odor. Great texture. Immediate absorption. Good price. I use it daily and when I needle. I want it gallon size jugs!</li>
            <li> Had to stop using this.  I only used it for about two weeks then I started noticing I was breaking out and I couldn&#x27;t attribute it to anything but this.  I do have acne prone skin but I&#x27;ve had my breakouts under control for about a year...until I began using this.  :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every night for a week and I think this is the main reason my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel dry anymore.&lt;br /&gt;The product keeps my skin feel soft and hydrated all day and a little goes a long way with this stuff that I have enough to rub on my face, neck and hands with one use. I have oily/combination skin so I would recommend keeping this off the oily spots like the the T-zone or your face will look really oily after applying but it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This serum is my favorite product I have tried thus far.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  I have always been an advocate of using hyaluronic acid serum and this one is the most effective brand I have tried.  (I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician)  It is quite soothing to the skin and provides a great deal of hydration.  Plumps up fine lines and even has great healing benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, we were without A/C for an extended period of time (due to a lack of available parts) and the temps in our home almost reached 100 degrees at one point.  This not only made us physically ill, but caused severe heat rash.  When I started applying this serum to my face a few times a day (I even kept it in the frig) it kept my face from blistering and helped heal the areas that were burning.  I was really impressed and grateful that I had this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the serum directly to my laugh lines and forehead lines and notice those areas looking more hydrated.  Esp. when used in conjunction with moisturizer.  - This is important because using the right serum will only help your moisturizer to be more effective.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and brings moisture to the skin.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd reorder and won&#x27;t be without it ever. Besides that...this is a great company. I order a lot from amazon and these guys are terrific.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be very helpful on my skin.  I think it has helped on deep wrinkles around the mouth area.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff, this is some real deal stuff it&#x27;s thick yet dries quick and has made my skin look that much better than the other leading brand. Great moisture and hydration AL day</li>
            <li> I like this Hyaluronic Acid Serum, it smells nice and a little goes a long way, I have only been using it for a short time, so I have not noticed any big changes. I do love this product for hydrating my face so well! Over all, between the great price and a great product I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Still early to see results but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Next time I think I&#x27;ll try a different one. Maybe the vitamin C one or the Retinol one. Would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> i have received this product free or a discount&lt;br /&gt;i would highly recommend this if you have age spots or discoloring&lt;br /&gt;ive been using it for awhile now and my age spots are almost gone&lt;br /&gt;ive also noticed the fine lines near my eyes are fading as well&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend getting this product</li>
            <li> Not only does this leave my skin glowing, it also smells SOOO good! I use this in the morning along with a Vitamin C serum after washing my face. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I got this product to review and test for free the research that i&#x27;ve done on Hyaluronic acid serum really peak my interest because it can be used for so many place on the skin, stretch marks, eczema, blemishes,new &amp; old scars, You can used it on minor cuts. It helps Relieve eczema, and dry/ chapped skin. Help get rid of dark spots and skin dicoloration. It can help with Smoothing wrinkles and blemishes. Relax muscular stiffness. And Improves skin elasticity. I like that it can Minimize stretch marks. And Reduce  razor burn/ bumps. This is such an high quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this seum, one of the best I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Hyaluraoic Acid Serum feels wonderful on the face and neck. It comes in a two ounce bottle with an eyedropper top for more precise application. It takes just a little to cover your face and neck. It has a water like consistency. It feels good when you first put it on and feels even better after a while. All you need to do is apply a thin film to experience its soft and soothing benefits. This serum also has wonderful natural ingredients including Vitamin C, Vitamin E,  and Green Tea. I like that this product addresses fine lines, wrinkles, and skin disclorations. I especially like that it reduces dark circles under the eyes and puffiness. I will reorder this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I really like using this product. It makes my skin look good. It&#x27;s not greasy. Probably the only thing that would make it better is if it came in a pump.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I use it 2 a day along with the vitamin C concentrate and can see a decrease in the little lunes around my eyes. Very happy...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin is bright and hydrated.  I can wear this under makeup with no issues.  Also, it smells like oranges.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with InstaNatural skin products, this is another serum that is a winner! Natural ingredients, easy to dispense and as always, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I ever tried.  My skin is softer and have a nice glow.  No dryness anymore.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am always weary of using serums as most don&#x27;t feel great on my face. I like that the serum was in a drop form and I could put several drops in the palm of my hand and then apply it to my face. I like that it is very light and I pretty much feel like it is not on my face after I apply it. I can see it go on and then it just disappears. I did get several tiny zits the first week of using it, but they went away and I am pregnant so I don&#x27;t know which of those reasons it could be. It wasn&#x27;t a big deal though. One of the best parts is that 5 drops covers my face and I know it is going to last me a very long time. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great serum!  Works well and I noticed my line become smoother!</li>
            <li> like how it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Night Cream Moisturizer Treatment and am loving it so far. It seems to plump up the skin to diminish the look of my little lines and it smells really nice too!!</li>
            <li> It was okay, but it didn&#x27;t meet with what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Light and makes your skin feel silky!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a difference at all.</li>
            <li> well, this is a nice product but really does nothing for fine lines &amp; wrinkles that I can tell, been using it for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The insta naturals website does not tout it for helping with wrinkles like the Amazon description does so there we go !&lt;br /&gt;So folks, what do you think is a really good product  to plump/get rid of wrinkles?</li>
            <li> Paired with the night cream that&#x27;s all the regimen you need, I&#x27;ll be super young fast little lines are getting even smaller</li>
            <li> Love it so far. Makes my face look smoother and fresher. I have even had compliments from people telling me how fresh I look even late in the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it every night and some mornings. My skin has never looked better. I&#x27;m almost 33 and need to really fix the damage to my skin. I couldn&#x27;t have found a better product! Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  Need more time.</li>
            <li> So far, this is producing even better results than I hoped for. I&#x27;ve had dry red patches above my upper lip that nothing has taken care of until now. They are almost completely gone and I&#x27;m hopeful that they will stay gone!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about three weeks and so far I have seen some minor changes around my lips. I am 56 years old!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum .. This makes your face look radiant and young ..I love also that it has Hyaluronic acid .. Am 43 and my daughter is 23 and they ask her when we together if am her big sister ..I just love this ..</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and has cleared up most of my blemishes!! Will be a customer for life, have since ordered other products directly from sellers website and I have loved them all! Not only are the products amazing but the follow up and customer service is unmatched with any other company that I have ever used. As I said, I am a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum and I find the results are very good.  It is tightening my skin and reducing many wrinkles.  Also several skin discolorations seem to be fading.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice serum that adds moisture and &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; up skin. Lines seem smaller and my skin just feels firmer. I am loving it</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I know more time will tell, but at this point I am glad I made the purchase and plan to continue to do so!!!</li>
            <li> I feel instant tightness in my skin when I put this on, it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like it. The serum is thick, you need just a few drops. It keeps your skin very silky and smooth. Can&#x27;t tell about the long term results, because I am using other Vit C serum at the same time.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00K2O3NV2 Instanatural&#x27;s Hydraulic Acids Serum]] is one of the better hydraulic acid serums I have used in a long time. What I think makes this product so special is the way that the bottle has an applicator dropper allowing me to do a lot with just a little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear in color, and has a very mild scent. This product mixes the best of Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Green Tea. I really love how this product goes on thin and dries quickly. Other products I have used in the past have left my skin feeling oily or a filmy residue; not with instanatural, it goes on smooth and is like I&#x27;m not even wearing it. The product comes in a 2 ounce bottle and seems to last forever.  I have been using it for a week now, morning and night, and there is still the same amount in the bottle as when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really excited about this product and have even recommended it to a few of my friends. I think it&#x27;s one of the better Hydraulic Acid Serums available on the market because I have seen the results and they are pretty impressive. Other serums I&#x27;ve tried have been nothing but problems, but instanatural is actually correcting my problem areas and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided for Review and Evaluation]</li>
            <li> “I love using this serum. It goes on the skin smoothly and feels good. I feel that my skin is softer and more firm in 3 weeks of use. I recommend this product.”&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff!!! It has the consistency of aloe vera gel.  Feels great on a hot day after being in the fridge. I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to do much, but I have noticed quite an improvement in the blotchy spots on my face....my face looks much more even toned, and my pores are noticeably smaller.  The seller&#x27;s customer service was second to none when I had a problem with another one of their products.  I&#x27;m going to be trying the emu oil next.  I also tried the vitamin c serum, and I love it just as much as this one....it&#x27;s a close tie between those two products for me so far.  I am going to wait a little while before trying any more of the products so I can tell which results are associated with which product.  The price is really nice for the quality ingredients you get as well!</li>
            <li> Verdict is still out in regards to the true benefits.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I LOVE IT!!! I will definitely buy it again! I have seen a huge change in my overall skin on my face and neck. Fine lines and wrinkles have improved so much that a before and after picture make me smile.</li>
            <li> I brought this product but I do not have any wrinkles.  I am being proactive.</li>
            <li> I prefer OZ brand Vitamin C that I have used for a year. Thought I would vary the brand for a look see.  I have gone on a no wheat diet as well, which may have something to do with skin surface.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m usen this product it&#x27;s amazing how my skin change..I work nights before always I looked soo tired since I use the serum my face look soo rest and glow..tku so much:)</li>
            <li> the product was damage and I return it</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful! I just ordered another bottle.  It definitely improved the look of my d&amp;eacute;colletage area and added life to my face as well. Mainly took out some of the redness on my chest - which I assume is sun damage (at my age - 60+).</li>
            <li> I had heard that Hyaluronic Acid was good for damaged/wrinkled skin.  After years of having horses and being in the weather, cold or hot, rain or shine, my skin is definitely damaged and wrinkled.  I have never found a anything that did anything for my skin.  I guess the damage is just too much for any cream or serum to help with the wrinkles.  The reviews were great for this serum and I had high hopes but again I was disappointed.  Guess my skin is just too damaged and wrinkled for anything to help much.</li>
            <li> This Product is Fabulous. I see my eye wrinkles soften and my face look younger.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product on a regular basis, yet, and I&#x27;m not sure what it is supposed to do, thus the 3 stars. I bought it to maybe tighten the areas of my face that have allowed my laugh, smile lines to appear deeper. When I tried the serum it didn&#x27;t seem to change very much or I was perhaps thinking that it would change the appearance in short time. I use a collagen moisturizer and don&#x27;t have any wrinkle on my face to start with, so I had hoped for the skin to firm up somewhat. I guess I should try using it more often to see if over a period of time, it does what I think it should do. I suppose, I&#x27;m expecting too much and too soon. I think these types of products take weeks at 2 times a day usage to show any real progress. (It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it &amp;#34;feels good going on&amp;#34;, so that&#x27;s a plus because I have sensitive skin.) I see no reason not to keep using it just to see if it does something spectacular.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day for a few wks. My skin has never looked or felt better. So soft to touch. My imperfections are getting lighter and some are almost gone. I&#x27;ve have tried many products in my life time, and this is one of the best. Will definately continue to use as I am so pleased with results so far.</li>
            <li> I have used the product twice daily for 16 days and I can see no difference in facial lines. I won&#x27;t make a final decision on it until I try it for at least another week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and it seemed liked the bottle was watered down. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> A nurse that looked 10 years younger for her age because of her smooth skin recommends the product and purchases it from Amazon.com. It seems to start working right away. My lines are not as noticeable and my complexion is improving. I recommend the product and will buy it again once I get close to running out.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&amp;#34;ve been using the product for two months and am 100% satisfied. In fact, I recommended to a friend because her products that she recommended are not working for her. She has lots of wrinkles and this product will defiantly reduce the fine lines and deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Am sad about this cause it broke before I even used it. I had a long way to travel and I didn&#x27;t wrap it well. However, the little that remained was really absorbent I used it with Argan oil. Very happy with IstaNatural products.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum. Nice texture and feel good on skin. Been using for 3 weeks in the morning only.( I use the age defying clearing serum at night).My skin definitely improved.Has a nice glow and more even tone. Love the natural ingredients and great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM WITH A DISCOUNT TO TRY, BUT MY OPINION IS UN BIASED AND HONEST.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this serum with 2 drops of Argan Oil by the same company, at night after I wash my face. I wake up with plump moisturized skin. So far great results. And terrific customer service from the company.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply and my wife and I have noticed an improvement in our skin after about two weeks of use. We apply it before we go to bed. I plan on purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I got this product and was iffy about it due to reviews most witch were good but there is always that skeptasisam but I tried it any way the product has improved my skin texture decently I have dry skin and acne scars and it has given me back the soft smoothness and hydrated my skin and it only been 2 weeks  will buy again</li>
            <li> Very noticeable results since I&#x27;ve started using hyaluronic acid serum. I&#x27;ve already been complimented on my skin tone and smoothness . Love it!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES A GREAT JOB AT TIGHTENING &amp; FIRMING UP THE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin so I usually avoid putting product on my face, however, this product does not make my face feel oily or smothered. It has also made a drastic difference in my skin tone. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product works well. I am placing my second order for the product. Does not cause breakouts or irritation like some products can. Definitely one to try.</li>
            <li> First of all the packaging for this product was the worst I&#x27;ve seen from Amazon. Came in  one of those boxes that they use for books and a little bubble wrap. The seal and cap were broken when I received it but since the glass was intact I decided to try the product out. My intention was to find a cheaper replacement for Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Truth Serum, which by the way, is amazing. However, this product has done very little or perhaps nothing for my skin. It&#x27;s lightly moisturizing but has done nothing for fine lines the way that the Truth Serum does. I used this product a total of 10 days, and I feel that when a product works, it does so within three days. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE NEVER NOTICED CHANGE ON MY FACE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks.  I&#x27;m 51 years old and have taken care of myself pretty well.  No drinking, no drugs,&lt;br /&gt;very  little sugar, no red meat, no processed foods,  however, I have spent quite a few years smoking clove cigarettes, which I&#x27;m not very proud to admit.  I do have some fine lines on the left side of my face from smoking and probably also due to the relentless California sun.  The skin on my face seems smoother and brighter.  Regarding the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement, however, it&#x27;s only been two weeks.  One cannot expect miracles in two weeks.  All and all, I love this product. It&#x27;s not heavy, goes on easily, and is not greasy.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> “I do not notice any freckles or black spot on my face anymore. Looking confident and having healthier skin make me feel so good. This is my third purchase in almost a year now. Will strongly recommend.”</li>
            <li> I really liked using this but the issues is the dropper. I have to squeeze the dropper so many times to get the product.  Other than this, it&#x27;s clear, and goes on the face nicely and dries to a clear finish. Does not leave any residue, not oily or anything.</li>
            <li> This serum lived up to the standard I have come to expect from Instanatural. I love that it is all natural. I never knew that all natural products could be so effective! This serum definitely lives up to everything it claims. I am so glad they allowed me the opprotunity to review it. I highly reccommend this serum and all of their products!</li>
            <li> The serum didn&#x27;t work for me personally but excellent service from InstaNaturals, so you can order with no reservations. I think I&#x27;ll try the vitamin C serum next.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have deep acne scars, and this serum has improved the smoothness and appearance of my face a ton! My makeup is going on smoother as well. I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore. Looking forward to using this for a long time and can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 2 months of use!</li>

This works, help them reduce your bags,  Wrinkles and fine lines,Damaged skin - sun spots, age spots, and discoloration, Dehydrated, dry, rough or flaky skin &amp; Uneven skin tone and texture!!

            <li> I do like the fact that is not sticky. it has improve my skin texture. I will see where this takes me</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product.  I refuse to try it after seeing one of the ingredients is Sodium Benzoate, a carcinogen!!  Sure wish I&#x27;d known that before purchasing.  I&#x27;m going to be returning this.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I use it every day and night. It&#x27;s not greasy or too thick. I love how it comes with a dropper so I don&#x27;t overuse it -</li>
            <li> Hydrates well no issues</li>
            <li> I love it, I can see a dramatic difference in my skin.  I like the fact that it is a gel serum rather than the usual watery type that is harder to apply as it runs down the face.  Will be purchasing again. thank you  Toni Woolsy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I have not noticed a difference. I will keep using it. See what happens.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product for a few weeks before actually posting this review. What I like about it is that it didn&#x27;t cause any rashes on my skin. I felt a bit of smoothness as a change and a fresher looking skin even. My wrinkle though are still there so I am giving it more time. :) I bet those are really hard to remove. Anyway, I&#x27;ll continue using this for further and nicer results. As long as my skin doesn&#x27;t dry and itchy, I am okay. :)</li>
            <li> This is a very effective moisturizer and when used regularly it will keep your skin plump with fewer fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Any effective moisturizer with hyaluronic acid should do the same thing but if you&#x27;re a lazy type, this serum is super easy to use and actually works.  It&#x27;s a gel and smooths onto the skin without stickiness.  It has a distinctly herby smell which I don&#x27;t care for but the results are undeniable.  If you struggle with acne, this has aloe in it that will help with healing.  It&#x27;s also a reasonable price which is another incentive.  I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have ever used. It has a thick consistency and really moisturizes well. I have very dry skin but this product really delivers. I have used Skinceuticals B5 gel before and this product is just as good but the only difference is that it is a fraction of the price and you get twice as much product (2 oz) in comparison to Skinceuticals (1 oz). This product is truly amazing and makes your skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. It also brightens and evens out your skin tone and I have also noticed tightening of my skin. I use it on my face and neck morning and night before I apply moisturizer. If you are serious about maintaining your youth, then this product is a must have. This company also delivers superb customer service. I will continue to buy this product again and again from this seller because it truly is a gem.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product. Dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> This serum works wonders!!  I&#x27;m 60 yrs young and my skin looks better today than it did in my 40&#x27;ds.  After studing what is best for your skin in several area&#x27;s the things that kept coming up were hyaluronic acid and vitamin c.  I also use argon oil (cold pressed) with this serum. My lines and wrinkles have all taken a vacation from my face!  It is wonderful!  I even use it on my hands!  I will be ordering this product again and again! Thank YOU!!</li>
            <li> This is a product that really does what it claims to do, plus it is natural, they never test on animals, and I have had terrific results with this! I have been using it for almost a month to see how it works over time, and I see it smoothing out my wrinkles, plumping up my once aging, tired skin. Now, my skin is looking firmer, smoother, wrinkles and circles have smoothed out quite a bit in this short time, and my skin has more elasticity. Before, my skin would not bounce back. If I slept on  wrinkle, I had a large mark on my skin that stayed almost all day. Now my skin bounces right back like a teenager! I love that! It is like I stopped aging! I love this product and and will stay with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything is hoped it would be!</li>
            <li> Premium Hydration is what the bottle says so I accepted the offer to review and now I am giving you my honest unbiased opinion.  This works like the lightest deep moisturizing lotion I have ever tried.  I absolutely recommend buying this to add that moisture you don&#x27;t even know your missing back into your skin.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before this.  Thank you so much am so going to keep ordering.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this serum is a good value - most serums are 1 oz.  I appreciate the larger size.  The bottle is attractive enough to leave out on my bathroom counter.  I really like this product&#x27;s choice of ingredients - especially the green tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is somewhat thicker than some of the other ones I have tried - a definite plus for application.  It was easy to control (didn&#x27;t run all over your face) and soaked in quickly without stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have definitely seen an improvement in the appearance of my face.  I have only been using this product for a short period of time, and the lines are still visible, but are less noticable, and the overall texture of my skin has improved.  I also see some evening of skin tone, which I hadn&#x27;t expected but was certainly a nice benefit.  This serum did not sting my rather sensitive skin as some of the other serums I have tried do.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a function of the strength of hyaluronic acid or the additional anti-oxidants.  What I do know is that this is something I could confidently recommend to a friend.  Nice job!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Take that winter dryness.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and do not like very heavy creams or oils on my face. I purchased this product because of its natural ingredients and have to say I am very pleased with this product.  It does absorb into the skin nicely, with no overpowering scent. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin since using.  Price is right too.</li>
            <li> I was given a significant discount to review this product. The bottle comes with a built-in dropper to easily get the right amount of product. It has a very faint, refreshing, citrus smell. It absorbs rather quickly and leaves your skill feeling refreshed! Great to be used in the morning &amp; evening! Skin feels supple. Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t not believe how well this stuff works. I have only been using it for 2 days and I already see results. My skin is so smooth and soft and my ( ) are less visible it&#x27;s amazing can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin will look like in a month best facial product I have invested in :)</li>
            <li> Liars! This is fake stuff does nothing for the face. Some of these reviews use the exact same words in sentences from other reviews, meaning these are fake and by the same person. Take a look at this quote: &amp;#34;This serum is light and not sticky. It glides on and seems to leave my skin soft without feeling like it is coated in anything heavy.&amp;#34; The quote was used at least twice on this Amazon platform. Do not by from fakes. If they don&#x27;t have integrity and care about your health and wellbeing, then don&#x27;t trust the product on your precious face. You don&#x27;t deserved to be scammed!</li>
            <li> Love this. It absorbs quickly and does its job</li>
            <li> worked ok..I guess..not I thought it would</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference.  I used a different product before buying this one and do not feel the tightening that I felt with the other product.  I bought this one because of the better price.</li>
            <li> Superior Hyaluronic Acid serum! You can feel it actually working, as it dries it tightens slightly to reduce the appearance of fine lines. Great to use before primer and makeup. Has a very convenient dropper so you don&#x27;t use too much. Fantastic packaging and very high quality product! *Sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month, I used to have a very dry skin specially my forehead, now it feels soft and my small lines and facial skin looks much healthier , I have rosacea and it has also help to reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> This product is smooth and feels good on the skin . But for some reason caused dryness around nose and forehead</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!  I use it primarily as a cleanser/toner and have been very happy with the results.  It leaves my face feeling soft and seems to be improving the ugly dark circles under my eyes.  Unbeatable product for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed by this product. It is definitely one the best anti-aging products I have ever used. I started seeing lines disappearing and growing smaller in less than a week. It is also thick and smells great. I only use it in the evening and I will be ordering this again. It seems you get more for your money with this because it is thicker than the competitors serum and it&#x27;s two ounces instead of one.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this product so far. I have followed the instructions which were very clear and will do a follow up review in a few weeks. Very good value. Check o u t the size -  2oz. I paid the same price for a 1oz bottle. This is a company I would like to continue to do business with. They really have the customer at heart and I highly recommend them and their product.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product, I use it before my Retina so my skin is well hydrated.</li>
            <li> Great formula, will order again</li>
            <li> Instant results ..... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. You can feel the the product working. I love that there is only a light scent to geranium essential oil, no heavy perfume.  I have noticed slight changes, as it has only been a couple of weeks, I will update after a couple of months.  I also bought the anti-aging facial moisturizer, which I also love. Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> This product need a greater concentration of Vit C and Hyaluronic Acid, I prefer using a 100% product, with at least a 25% Vitamin C product! Keep working, your product has a nice texture...</li>
            <li> I apply this before any other facial creams and its improving my skin. I only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying it! The serum has a lovely natural perfume (vaguely citrus) and absorbs really fast, almost like a dry oil but with no residue. Leaves skin soft and tighter, I&#x27;ll order again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can tell that much of a difference. I&#x27;ve been using the product for approximately 2 - 3 weeks. There is a light smell to the product which is ok, but I&#x27;d rather there not be a smell. It is also of a gel consistency more than a liquid making it hard to get a good squeeze out of the dropper. It is too thick for the dropper. I end up trying to get some out but end up only with a small amount and then having to grab the remails off the dropper to use. I think this is a good product, but could be tweaked to make it more user friendly and possible to not have the fragrance in there as well.</li>
            <li> Since starting using the Hyaluronic acid serum for almost two weeks, I have found that the serum is very good, in the sense that it plump up skin, especially under eye area.  Anyway, I love the serum, and will definately place my order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hyaluronic serums but I like this the best so far.  I also like that its a bigger bottle than any of the others for the same price</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet, but seems very lite and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> will order again...Love it...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I bought this a second time that I have constant brake outs when I use it. I stopped using it and my skin is clear again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It absorbs quickly into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily, greasy film.  My skin feels and looks softer. I would recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Skin feels great.  I do use a moisturizer also.  Great price.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after I  use this.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and will definitely buy it again.  Feels good on my skin, absorbs well  and when used with vitamin c serum it is diminishing my brown spots especially on my hands.</li>
            <li> It simply works. Try it.</li>
            <li> I am saying okay at this point for this product because I haven&#x27;t used it as frequently as directed.  Once I use it on a regular basis, I will come back and write a more thorough review.  It does go on very smoothly, is unscented and does not flake or peel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in confidence the description and anticipated result would apply to me.  After a reasonable period of time using the serum as suggested, the results are disappointing.  I started the serum with realistic expectations and hopes of smoother, more even and less pigmentation. Thus far I haven&#x27;t noticed too much improvement.  The upside (unlike most products similar) is the amount is twice the normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry. Does not leave face oily</li>
            <li> serum is very light weight and dewy. seems to work well with my skin type (combination). works great alone or with a moisturizer on top.</li>
