            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The clarity was great, that&#x27;s why I bought these sun glasses.  </li>
            <li>and they offer great protection from the wind</li>
            <li>IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect great optical quality from them for the $10 asking price.</li>
            <li>Great HD  view.</li>
            <li>but they worked great.</li>
            <li>Vision is GREAT  </li>
            <li>these glasses are great.  </li>
            <li>The lenses are great.  </li>
            <li>2 days I&#x27;m Happy with my glasses woohoo üëç</li>
            <li>Tried them out and love them !!</li>
            <li>very nice what a bald making them in the Brown frame</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing!  </li>
            <li>They are remarkable pair of shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are especially good during rainy conditions, as they cut reflections and make viewing a bit better.</li>
            <li>love the lens and they have great looks and appeal, the lens are very good would recommend these sun glasses.</li>
            <li>Driving at night is really a pleasant surprise when using the Ultra HD&#x27;S.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;as advertised, great value for price paid, very satisfied, recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The are very good for driving but not so for activities like golf or more mobile sports.  </li>
            <li>Everything looks as if it&#x27;s orange or gold, depending on how bright of a day it is.  </li>
            <li>Product does what they say it will do under adverse conditions of bright sunlight glare.</li>
            <li>But by blocking the actinic (UV/blue) part of the spectrum, they eliminate eye strain from glare, even on a bright day in the snow.</li>
            <li>The glasses help but not as bright as others I tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>On sunny days, it dims bright skies.</li>
            <li>A problem because bright sunlight can trigger migraines.  </li>
            <li>I have eye problems, I can not handle bright sunlight, I also have a problem at night with the glare of headlights.  </li>
            <li>All in all I would say they are a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to mention that these shades work good for people who have to spend hours in front of computer screens like me.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this style to wear for good looks when I have my contacts in.</li>
            <li>Good price and the product was as described.</li>
            <li>AS GOOD</li>
            <li>on to the good stuff.</li>
            <li>a good note they do work in blocking out glare..</li>
            <li>On a good note they do work in blocking out glare..</li>
            <li>These glasses are also great for sunrise and sunset when the sun is just blinding...pretty effective.    </li>
            <li>They Are Also Good For Night Driving There</li>
            <li>Good sun blockage, yet bright view.</li>
            <li>They were that good.  </li>
            <li>I had a pair before and loved them, so I assume something has changed in the materials</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had good luck buying sunglasses online</li>
            <li>the product is good for the money.</li>
            <li>good sunglasses.</li>
            <li>So $9 was a good deal</li>
            <li>Took good care of glare.</li>
            <li>At this price, they make a good pair of driving glasses.</li>
            <li>Works good, cuts the glare and sharpens the images.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li>Still a good pair to wear around.</li>
            <li>Price is right!!!!</li>
            <li>I really liked this PURCHASE, I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS VERY NICE AND HAVE GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>They work great, fit great and are well made.</li>
            <li>best part is buying from amazon super to deal with if you ever have a problem they will take care of it pronto  </li>
            <li>These are great on the course, lightweight, don&#x27;t realy care if they get scratched or you drop them and the best part, it makes spotting balls much easier.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with the great results in the sun &amp; on cloudy days when wearing these inexpensive glasses.</li>

            <li>handy.</li>
            <li>Nice price too.</li>
            <li>The car clip that comes with them is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I wish I didn&#x27;t buy so many of them, but I taught that the price was good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li>These, however, are more attractive, and I feel more dressed for the day with the Ultra&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I put this concern aside because I really liked the performance of the lenses.</li>
            <li>As much as I liked the performance of the lenses, I will refuse to purchase any additional pairs unless I found out that the frames have been improved.</li>
            <li>He liked the originals.</li>
            <li>They are the kind of lenses you put on</li>
            <li>They look nice on also, for men and women.  </li>
            <li>I bought 3 pairs of these nice sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>But my husband wears them on their own.  </li>
            <li>When ordering the glasses, they told me they were charging me a dollar to send me a package offering me some kind of savings coupons.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed by these sunglasses as I was not expecting much from them.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a pair before and loved them, these are okay</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and the great service</li>
            <li>Actually, I don&#x27;t own these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>Very good product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought this glasses because I liked the way they helped my eyes, even in bright light.</li>
            <li>I purchased these glasses and they are absolutely the most awesome  </li>
            <li>they work really good but will brake easy</li>
            <li>Very easy on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Plus, they scratch very easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you want a good inexpensive pair of sunglasses then these will work just fine.</li>
            <li>cheap, HD, work great, great for summer, great for skiing in the winter, all around versatile, good cheap buy, a definite recommend</li>
            <li>and that is to reduce the bright light so you can see.  </li>
            <li>Good fit and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They perform well in bright sunlight as well as in light overcast.  </li>
            <li>So by wearing the glasses about an hour before bedtime, it should help your body to produce it&#x27;s own melatonin and help you sleep better.  </li>
            <li>These are clearly the best sunglasses ever.</li>
            <li>there wonderful really clear my fiends want me to get them</li>
            <li>not the fit i was looking for  lenses not has good</li>
            <li>the frame breaks too easily, but the fit and clearity of glass is great.</li>
            <li>You know, that way we could easily recognize one another during our trips!  </li>
            <li>You know, that way we could easily recognize one another during our trips!  </li>
            <li>You do see better in bright light just that the improvement is marginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also scratch very easily, I have to use them and try to see around the scratch until I get a better pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li>they look great and they make reading labels in the grocery store so much eaiser!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to easy to broking it with the new model, however you offering an excellent replacement services.</li>
            <li>bright and vibrant..  even in bright sun or cloudy days...</li>
            <li>Very cheap and flimsy plastic frames.</li>
            <li>,they are very comfortable</li>
            <li>I like them, very light and works</li>
            <li>Frame material very light weight and flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li>However, they are very cheap</li>
            <li>Like isaid before very comfortable on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Also, its good to just keep a bit of bacon fat around to make everything else super duper.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that these glasses are actually very good.  </li>
            <li>So they were free!  </li>
            <li>I wear them mostly on my motorcycle, and like the way things look through them :-)</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy some nice glasses and not this cheap, plastic pair.</li>
            <li>The glasses are nice and lite, comfortable to wear in the sun, plus that there it</li>
            <li>If you feel that paying more gives you better protection, go ahead.</li>
            <li>If you have them, throw them on the ground, stomp on them, drive your car on top of them, and then set them on fire.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a better brand.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a smallet frame to fit my face</li>
            <li>love them, I wish the stores still carried these</li>
            <li>They are gradient(dark on top lighter on the lower portion)so you can wear in the sun, read or drive at night with them to cut glare from on coming head lights.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>I may even buy a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li>I wear them with earth-tones for the most part.</li>
            <li>Because of this I try to never pay more than $15 for a pair of sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>If it makes you feel better to pay $100 for sunglasses, or if you just don&#x27;t like the styling, then buy all means by something else.  </li>
            <li>I love the glasses.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>For the price, I can&#x27;t find a better pair of sunglasses for ppg.</li>
            <li>They are light, comfortable, they look good.</li>
            <li>Unless you are into that :)</li>
            <li>The point of sunglasses is to reduce eye fatigue and help you see better on sunny days.</li>
            <li>I bought these expecting something more like the hd vision glasses as seen on tv.  </li>
            <li>, I want to see better and protect my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I drive a lot and LOVE them.  </li>
            <li>more so my wife &amp; I each have a pair in each car.  </li>
            <li>ok....</li>
            <li>Ok, hey man.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to thank God for such awesome meta-physical sunglasses as these and the fact that He also gave us the planet Mars to explore!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to thank God for such awesome meta-physical sunglasses as these and the fact that He also gave us the planet Mars to explore!  </li>
            <li>i bought some of theses glasses a while ago and they broke, my fault, and had to buy some more.</li>
            <li>If they only had a better set made for a motorcycle driver I would be very happy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s OK -</li>
            <li>I enjoyed having them around and wearing.  </li>
            <li>I wondered why so many people were smiling at me.  </li>
            <li>even more so I was not expecting top line stuff</li>
            <li>Ok while they lasted.</li>
            <li>Nice, cheap glasses</li>
            <li>I love these sun glasses.</li>
            <li>For the price there are nothing better</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>For our $, surely there are better choices.  </li>
            <li>these are ok</li>
            <li>Just received the item, I love them.</li>
            <li>Get one for yourself and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three more words</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>These glasses are the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; HD glasses, and they&#x27;re my favorite driving glasses.</li>
            <li>Headlights still glared and did nothing to help me see better at night.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d better stock up.</li>
            <li>Very happy overall.</li>
            <li>Ok, hear me out.  </li>
            <li>that being said, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why i gave this product 4 stars and bought it three</li>
            <li>These glasses are great and really do help in both sun and rain.</li>
            <li>Even though the company promised money-back guarantee, they charge wayyy more for shipping than the product itself, and of course don&#x27;t return the shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I would not pay a cent more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect them to magically make objects appear on HD or make objects look better.</li>
            <li>I love the HD glasses.  </li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite sunglasses ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These have totally met my expectations and I would truly recommend them 100% and buy them for my best friend. :)</li>
            <li>The orange &#x27;shade&#x27; has a gradient that is darker at the top and lighter at the bottom, which also works well for driving.</li>
            <li>Still working great, not broken or chipped.</li>
            <li>I love these sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Better then my $85 glasses.</li>
            <li>They are not the huge kind that wrap around prescription glasses, but you could do that in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>My in laws are golfers, they wear them on the course and also love them.  </li>
            <li>Update - I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain a replacement for the damaged glasses but was issued a return and credit.</li>
            <li>These glasses reduce the glare and makes driving during the day more relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love these sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to buy more.</li>
            <li>but when I went to reorder 2 more pairs from this &amp;#34;same supplier&amp;#34; they shipped me what appears to cheap knockoffs!</li>
            <li>I love them for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With these you are able to .  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>They may not be the most fashionable eyewear but in my case that is not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>Product is okay though it looks like a copy.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t any better than the $5.00 knock offs at the flea market.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Love these sunglasses both for the comfort and lens shade color</li>
            <li>you could all most wear them at night..</li>
            <li>I love the HD effect for lawn and garden work.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find the lenses in a more durable frame.</li>
            <li>I love my HDTV vision sun glasses my husband had bought.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with them</li>
            <li>love them....</li>
            <li>purchase two more pairs for friends...</li>
            <li>See better with them on than off.</li>
            <li>There is no need to pay 200 bucks for the Ray Bans, I think these work better.</li>
            <li>LOVE these.</li>
            <li>or I could find them elsewhere because we love these</li>
            <li>its a good hd glasses, its not as bright as previous versions which makes it a good choice for summer time.</li>
            <li>These high definition sunglasses are a great choice because they cut glare, but also allow me to read outdoors.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone wanting a great pair of HD glasses.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for what you get.  </li>
            <li>They make things bright and they make everything crystal clear!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love the glasses, but they scratch so easy.</li>
            <li>If you buy sunglasses for $100 you could just as easily sit on them or lose them as you could with this pair, and then you&#x27;re out a lot more</li>
            <li>When you look thorough them, the whole world seems more bright and sunny, in a perspective that you have never been exposed to before.</li>
            <li>Very light and comfortable for any length of time wearing them.</li>
            <li>and they actually works with rain and very bright areas while driving.</li>
            <li>Not just very good for the price, which they are, but very good compared to more expensive sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>These glasses really help to block out the glare while still keeping everything else bright and in focus.</li>
            <li>These glasses really help to block out the glare while still keeping everything else bright and in focus.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are cheap and cheaply made!</li>
            <li>I have been buying these glasses for about five years and they are ok they are cheap</li>
            <li>Crystal clear vision at a great price.</li>
            <li>They work great for me as far as the glare.</li>
            <li>While admittedly the quality is not the best, but the quality is comparable to drugstore sunglasses and as expected for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block the sun, it doesn&#x27;t make things look better, it&#x27;s just orange tinted cheap pastic glasses.</li>
            <li>, they are super cheap and kind of garbarge.....</li>
            <li>Very light and flimsy, and the glass scratched way too early, but the vision is good.</li>
            <li>How totally cool!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the original Blublockers many years ago and they literally made everything \\&quot;pop\\&quot; when you put them on.</li>
            <li>and I love the warm, crisp color and light they give the world when looking through them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>As for the merchant, there was a mixup with my original order, they corrected it quickly and courteously.  </li>
            <li>I love my HD VISION SUNGLASSES every day is bright and clear in my eyes</li>
            <li>BUT THEY BREAK EASY..</li>
            <li>Easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li>people talk about them breaking easy</li>
            <li>The plastic frame starts to degrade and break easily.  </li>
            <li>I am so easy on things</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I can easily replace them.</li>
            <li>Lenses come out away too easy</li>
            <li>they relax the eyes and have easy vision -</li>
            <li>but I wear strong prescription glasses</li>
            <li>and they are perfect for lousey dark cloudy days because when I wear them everything looks brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>These glasses were nice, but they are flimsy and broke in the first month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are cheaply made, feel like they would scratch easily (</li>
            <li>THESE ARE FINE</li>
            <li>They are fine sunglasses and the price is fine but they did not do anything for the glare in my case</li>
            <li>They worked fine for two days then the lens fell out.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in perfect condition in about half of the estimated delivery time.  </li>
            <li>Night driving is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I really love these glasses as they have the best color (not sure what to call it) or tint of any I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-very cheap and easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit well around my head and the lenses are strong and scratch resistant.</li>
            <li>The clarity of sight is wonderful, makes an ordinary day look brighter and more detailed.  </li>
            <li>I will have to admit though, that they are a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, which is fine for me, because they match and fit my face</li>
            <li>Just get over the supposed need to have things darker and enjoy the feeling of having your eyes relax while keeping the scene bright and clear.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay $15 or $20 so that was a huge factor in this review.</li>
            <li>I bought them because I was five bucks away from free shipping ...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but they are quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Of course everything will have a light yellowish tint to it, (</li>
            <li>Is it a one size fit all concept you got?</li>
            <li>They are lightweight, but the plastic frame does appear to be cheap.  </li>
            <li>it gets the job done for being so cheaped, of course its cheaply made too.</li>
            <li>these are cheaply made sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>They fit my face well.</li>
            <li>They are made so cheap that you need to handle them with kid gloves.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find something similar.</li>
            <li>These sunglasses have great potential...</li>
            <li>No stars for the cheap feeling plastic material though.</li>
            <li>No stars for the cheap feeling plastic material though.</li>
            <li>I ordered three sets at the time, so I paid for three and got three pairs for free.  </li>
            <li>I have always bought cheap sunglasses($5-10)</li>
            <li>What can you expect from cheap sun glasses though.</li>
            <li>and they fit well.  </li>
            <li>so cheap</li>
            <li>The frame is cheap plastic with no adjustment.  </li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>they fit snugly on the nose</li>
            <li>Great glasses for seeing things differently.</li>
            <li>Otherwise enjoy the picture</li>
            <li>These  are  cheap  </li>
            <li>I have purchased HD glasses before and one of the draw backs for me was that the tint was so light that the sun still bothered me when I went out.  </li>
            <li>they fit me well and</li>
            <li>They looked like the cheap plastic toy sunglasses I used play with as a child.</li>
            <li>Tilting the head just a bit allows you to adjust the degree of darkness for varying light situations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are light and don&#x27;t slip off.  </li>
            <li>They also aren&#x27;t as cheaply built as the price would lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li>My mother had cataract surgery, and all light bothered her eyes,</li>
            <li>Amber glasses are supposed to block &#x27;&#x27;blue&amp;#34; light from cell phones, computers, &amp; TV (which block melatonin production).</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting a quality pair of sunglasses but these were beyond cheap.</li>
            <li>They are so light they would bounce on my nose when I would walk.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t fit like the others did.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy how these brighten things up a bit, however..</li>
            <li>The variable shade is a great feature, especially when I wear them at night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amber vision will make us free.</li>
            <li>They looked like cheap plastic sunglasses to me and that is what they are.</li>
            <li>, I rate them as acceptable for cheap plastic sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Light,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already lost one pair of these sunglasses but being that cheap</li>
            <li>So comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have told many many people about these glasses and how much I like them</li>
            <li>great vision, but need to keep them in a safe case to keep from getting scratched or crushed.</li>
            <li>the image is crisp and good but the frame is way too large.</li>
            <li>These glasses are excellent for driving and making things easier to see while preventing glare and excessive light.  </li>
            <li>think these will work fine for a reasonable time for their intended purpose, and they actually fit much better than I thought they would.  </li>
            <li>The shape is downright unattractive, but I forgo all that to see super clear when I am driving in my car or walking around in bright sun.</li>
            <li>Good ,comfortable,cheap, easy on the eyes, but one flaw, every pair that I have bought, has a crack in the lens, same place every time.</li>
            <li>When you put them on things don&#x27;t get darker, as with traditional sunglasses, but the sensitivity of your eyes to the &#x27;glare component&#x27; of what you see is remarkably reduced.  </li>
            <li>They fit well with full coverage.  </li>
            <li>bought many glasses that were much more expensive and found these to be the best</li>
            <li>I have had many different kinds of traditional sunglasses but these HD Sunglasses are the BEST!!!  </li>
            <li>However, as I used them through the following days while driving, I found that they worked remarkably well.</li>
            <li>Lens are awesome as the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>These may be best suited for someone with a small head.</li>
            <li>They were in original packaging, so</li>
            <li>Fits well and the veiw is more clear and colors are better.</li>
            <li>I actually thought it was nice that these glasses were lighter than most.</li>
            <li>Bright blue light will cause a fuzziness like a fogged up window.  </li>
            <li>The lenses get spotty and it a challenge to clean them.</li>
            <li>seemingly disappearing, as you clean, lense coating.</li>
            <li>These are adequate cheap driving glasses, which is what I use them for.  </li>
            <li>&quot; sun glasses i have ever owned but certainly the most functional ones.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for decent, inexpensive sunglasses and can wait for delivery (which was very speedy by the way), then these are a good buy.</li>
            <li>Nice clear and clean view.</li>
            <li>The plastic is so light and cheap, you feel like you can break them just by looking at them funny.</li>
            <li>I made the purchase and exited the store into the bright sunlight beneath the cobalt blue sky of planet earth.  </li>
            <li>I am careful with them and they are great in the daytime.  </li>
            <li>The clear vision is amazing.</li>
            <li>The yellow tint also makes everything so bright, that they hurt my eyes.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li>tho be such a good buy for the price</li>
            <li>Not too trendy, not too old</li>
            <li>The HD Vision Sunglasses,Ultra Are not Only Good</li>
            <li>Like most cheap sunglasses, all these do is change the color and slightly dim the light that gets through to your eyes by wearing them.</li>
            <li>The lenses are good but the frame seems too fragile?</li>
            <li>The frames look good and they stay put during various activities.</li>
            <li>UPS picked up the package from my front porch with a return sticker and I was notified that the glasses had been received and my account was credited for the full price.</li>
            <li>quality is actually not bad at all for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving the glasses 3 stars for somewhat doing what it says, for the pretty good quality overall in the craftsmanship (lenses fit in frame perfectly, arms fold in/and out smoothly, no imperfections in plastic frame, no scratches on plastic or lenses right out of box, etc.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the glasses 3 stars for somewhat doing what it says, for the pretty good quality overall in the craftsmanship (lenses fit in frame perfectly, arms fold in/and out smoothly, no imperfections in plastic frame, no scratches on plastic or lenses right out of box, etc.)</li>
            <li>Thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li>The sunglasses provide a bright and clear image that is superior to any other sunglasses I have owned.</li>
            <li>I wear prescription glasses, and these fit right over the glasses, sometimes I also need to wear flip up polarized lenses, it still fits over the glasses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased very high end glasses and in my opinion the HD glasses are far superior.</li>
            <li>The sky was no longer blue like it was a moment ago on planet Earth, but had become a murky red hue, AWESOME!  </li>
            <li>I like, totally enjoyed my stay there and then thought I better get back to planet Earth</li>
            <li>But these are certainly worth buying for sure since they are so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Great glasses, make the images much clearer then regular sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Love them, highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I was then able to explore Mars in Highly Defined detail...</li>
            <li>these are worth checking out... and the price is right!</li>
            <li>Both times after normal use tug of the lanyard, to pull the shades around to place them on my face, THE FRAME snapped at the top holding the lense.  </li>
            <li>(Make sure you are getting the normal \\&quot;surfer style\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the plastic frames seemed too light.  </li>
            <li>The hinge mechanism is pretty cheap and they need to be handled gingerly.  </li>
            <li>they blocked out blue light, well these appear to attenuate most \\&quot;yellow light\\&quot; (for a good example try looking at traffic lights</li>
            <li>Weather in a car,walking around the city or just simply ookng cool, they work just amazing.</li>
            <li>The spring loaded temples are a nice feature and they do seem to make everything crisp and clear..</li>
            <li>They look pretty good too, especially for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes to the light &amp; these help a lot!  </li>
            <li>thanks again!!</li>
            <li>and I do not like being blind by conventional sunglasses, so these HDs are perfect to make things more bright on overcast days, and stop the squinting on all sunny days.</li>
            <li>They are as good as any of the other pairs of plastic sunglasses I have had over the years, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>does a good job at blocking the Sun but not high definition in my opinion</li>
            <li>I have very light sensitive eyes &amp; cataracts, these are the only kind of glasses that work for me.</li>
            <li>Right on, I&#x27;m like, planning more trips to Mars via these far out sunglasses!  </li>
            <li>Everything is much sharper and they fit well too.  </li>
            <li>The real sensitivity to light comes when it&#x27;s overcast or foggy..</li>
            <li>The real sensitivity to light comes when it&#x27;s overcast or foggy..</li>
            <li>The glasses fit very well over my prescription glasses.  </li>
            <li>Scratched too easily, very snug fit .</li>
            <li>so they are worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth about $5 if you ask me.</li>
            <li>, these should be worth 5$ but ended up paying 14$.  again there</li>
            <li>I feel I got my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li>When you first get them out of the package, the first thing you notice is how cheap they are made.</li>
            <li>but it worth every penny</li>
            <li>The virtue of these glasses is that they effectively attenuate the blue (and ultraviolet!)</li>
            <li>and  they arent worth the postage to return.  </li>
            <li>By the time I paid return shipping, it wasn&#x27;t worth the bother, and just threw them in the garbage, chalking it up to another TV con job.</li>
            <li>When wearing the glasses, the top light of the signal looks yellow, otherwise the gasses are helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good theory, but I think next time, I&#x27;d buy glasses made for the purpose of helping to block blue light to help you sleep!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where they are now...not worth the return process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are worth about .72 cents each.</li>
            <li>Lens had splotchy spot out of the box, used water and soft cloth to clean and lens scratched easily.  </li>
            <li>best cheap sunglasses you will ever buy, I always lose expensive sunglasses these ones are worth buying and</li>
            <li>IM big fan of the h-d vision,, I had a pair of the old school ones.. very nice on the eyes</li>
            <li>I was also drawn to these glasses because they looked sleeker and more stylish than some other ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>But, I tend to break or lose sunglasses pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I bought these more out of curiosity than anything, but I really did need a decent pair of driving sunglasses.</li>
            <li>anybody knows of a source to get the REAL HD Vision glasses (original style), please let me know.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I have a cataract in my right eye.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>They also tend to slide right up to my face, no matter how I try to keep them on the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>The damage was right where the sticker was placed.</li>
            <li>The price is right on these glasses.</li>
            <li>Right after the 10th day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I will say they are comfortable and look decent on.</li>
            <li>It felt better with the bare plastic resting on my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these glasses in the past &amp; was happy to see Amazon carried them.</li>
            <li>they are more pinkish, and barely block the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In both cases, they work great on highways, but you must be more careful on city streets due to poorer peripheral vision.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great for a second of third pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I had a previous pair and loved them.  </li>
            <li>They do not have the distinct yellow HD lenses that I used to love...</li>
            <li>They filter out light from the blue end of the light spectrum.  </li>
            <li>When they broke I went looking for new ones !!!</li>
            <li>The problem is, when I clean them I have to be so careful because they just pop from the top.</li>
            <li>Over the last seventy decades or so, I have had countless pairs of sunglasses to protect my 20/20 blue eyes, and the HD are more than adequate to filter those bright Arizona rays.</li>
            <li>I have a normal to large head and these fit well</li>
            <li>Great, very stylish, just too bad that i scratched them up already, but i lover them and would defieanlty</li>
            <li>First, I would like to say that I did not purchase these from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>IF they were NOT so fragile, they would have more than met my needs.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what I want them to do.</li>
            <li>I went back and purchased two more just in case they get discontinued.</li>
            <li>I would have paid $20 or $30 if they actually would have made them more durable and could have added the clarity and something that blocks the effects of sun fatigue.  </li>
            <li>Thanks God!  </li>
            <li>Thanks God!  </li>
            <li>works really well!</li>
            <li>My light sensitivity is actually not bad when the skies are blue and sunny.</li>
            <li>pretty effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My light sensitivity is actually not bad when the skies are blue and sunny.</li>
            <li>They are not the best sunglasses I have ever owned but for under $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
            <li>The HD sunglasses were exactly like I had hoped they would be.  </li>
            <li>And I really love driving with them on, especially at night!</li>
            <li>As someone else said in another review, they look like they are toy sunglasses when you first see them.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>,  everything  looks  crisp and  </li>
            <li>Yes, they are not made of titanium steel and will break if you sit on them, but for under $10 I am willing to have them.</li>
            <li>On top of that they broke on the middle hinge after about two months.</li>
            <li>For the price, they do exactly what I want ...</li>
            <li>Also, the tone is not constant; its darker in the top of the lens and lighter in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>that is when I bought her first pair.  </li>
            <li>Even here in sunny Southern California I have no need for greater filtering (as offered by darker colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are more of a blue blocker than just sunglasses that darken.  </li>
            <li>However this last pair the plastic was much more</li>
            <li>I feel this is pretty much a scam!  </li>
            <li>Which has more to do with me having a tiny  face than the size of the glasses.</li>
            <li>For exactly that amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my first pair of these in May or June of 2010.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Me my first pair when they came out on TV</li>
            <li>Had my first pair for two years, than accidentally sat on them.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping these were half as good as they claim.</li>
            <li>While the first impression of the lenses was positive because of the great clarity and acuity, the coating on the lenses scratches way too easily leaving them pretty much useless.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty effective in well lit rooms too, and yes, your eyes can be seen through these shades when you are in close quarters with other people.  </li>
            <li>The fit is great not too tight or too loose.</li>
            <li>They reduce glare and everything is very clear, not dark like most sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know whether to buy these since there was divergence in opinion, but opinions were mostly positive.  </li>
            <li>but my experience was positive.</li>
            <li>but in the long run they are much better  bargain...</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described on the website, priced reasonably, and met all expectations.......</li>
            <li>think they&#x27;re pretty much identical to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t look good, it&#x27;s definitely not stylish.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about buying these glasses and hoping to purchase more items, this being my first amazon buying experience is not good.  </li>
            <li>Though they were not expensive, I expected more durability.  </li>
            <li>The lenses have a yellow tint to them, but I found this easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, and make everything super clear.  </li>
            <li>I have two pair of HD Sunglasses which are rather large.</li>
            <li>Pure junk.  </li>
            <li>Looked great on my phone and PC but frames are not a solid black color.</li>
            <li>For less than three cups of coffee, I got sunglasses that completely take care of the glare of bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>If you plan to do city driving these will likely be fine since there are plenty of street lights around</li>
            <li>If you plan to do city driving these will likely be fine since there are plenty of street lights around</li>
            <li>The only issue I found with this pair was there were some fine line scratches on one of the lenses.</li>
            <li>Will be back next year for more stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li>They also look pretty decent while wearing them.  </li>
            <li>attenuating certain kinds of yellow light reduces squinting thus reducing eye strain/fatigue.  </li>
            <li>No I am not related to anyone in the company that makes these sunglasses, just a huge fan.</li>
            <li>Plus they sent a double order, again charging a huge shipping fee.  </li>
            <li>vision\\&quot;... a friend of mine has the real pair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are really HD</li>
            <li>(insert CHEAPER than necessary even for cheap sunglasses), even glue was not a viable option.  </li>
            <li>Go head and avoid the ASOTv specials and move on the NEXT pair of cheap sunglass readers.  </li>
            <li>Who knew you could get this much out of 10 bux?</li>
            <li>The HD claim might be bogus, but the functionality and price are the real deal.</li>
            <li>this is the cheapest price found, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Got turned on to real HD by Edge</li>
            <li>They provided so much protection from the sun UV rays with darkening the scenery.  </li>
            <li>The glasses filter out blue light and will almost cancel the effects of the cataract.      </li>
            <li>This is very helpful while driving.</li>
            <li>They are made so cheap that the frame broke simply by putting them on.  </li>
            <li>not much to say except i am satisfied with the hd glasses.</li>
            <li>and they are very helpful for filtering out the glare and make everything seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>modern design, lightweight,reduces glare, enhances color and clarity&lt;</li>
            <li>Paid too much for this product.  </li>
            <li>It is a real pleasure to wear these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>They protect my eyes while I am driving under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li>Are these real?  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be out in the sun without them, and the shape on the sides really helps block the side glare.</li>
            <li>Received this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I am very picky with the clarity of my sunglass lenses.</li>
            <li>these were the replacement, Thanks</li>
            <li>anti-glare hue is actually more orange than amber, and so a bit brighter than I expected.</li>
            <li>You can see really well with these glasses.</li>
            <li>but they work really well</li>
            <li>I really like these HD glasses.  </li>
            <li>I bought these straight from the manufacturer, not Amazon, after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>This really does feel like it blocks out the harmful UV rays that are coming straight from the sun.</li>
            <li>that means that either a girl or boy can wear them(anyone really).</li>
            <li>I would just like to warn everyone that these are very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>Did not like at all, pinch the nose too much.  </li>
            <li>They really do make everything look sharper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does seem to enhance your vision.</li>
            <li>The flimsyness of the frames is not a deterant as I didn&#x27;t pay that much for them, but if you are looking for a heavier frame these are not for you.</li>
            <li>These are the type of sunglasses that fit over regular eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>but I am very upset they wrote what to me are lies about this product.</li>
            <li>Though they may feel cheap and plasticy to some, they are actually quite sturdy.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t cost much, so I took a chance on them, but I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li>My husband really enjoys these glasses.</li>
            <li>The lense blocks the eye tiring blue light</li>
            <li>they are REASONABLY priced.  </li>
            <li>but anyway thanks for the product</li>
            <li>I really wish they would sell them in stores again .</li>
            <li>wearing these glasses is an experience more than i expected.</li>
            <li>very well</li>
            <li>Pretty interesting on cloudy days as well, but not recommended on rainy days, snowy days, foggy days or in the dark.  </li>
            <li>Liked these enough to buy several pairs.</li>
            <li>These glasses are nice to look through, but they are made of cheap plastic wrapped in a thin plastic coating that is now peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These glasses used to be made very strong, but now the plastic is rather thin and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>I drive for a living in a high action type job and tend to go through sunglasses quickly.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who is active outside with a sport and needs a good pair of sunglasses that help from having to squint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert on sunglasses but these seem to block out the sun better than any other sunglasses i&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>My original pair I got back in 2006 or 2007 and there were no nose pads that sat acroos the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and what makes rhem unique is that the inside is polarized as opposed to the outside of the lens.  </li>
            <li>I extremely like the brighter colors, how everything stands out more.</li>
            <li>I found that if you open and close the arms, right at the corners of the frames they will last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>As far as the glasses go, they seem cheaply made, scratch easily, &amp; are a little blury to look through.</li>
            <li>And today, my second pair broke while trying to clean them.</li>
            <li>I use them to drive in especially because they are not too dark, have gradiant lenses (lighter at the bottom) and work if it&#x27;s bright or cloudy.  </li>
            <li>only reason i bought them was cause my eyes are sensitive to certain amount of light</li>
            <li>; it looks too squared and old fachioned; and the frame is too fragile, it may break easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if these would work for a good cheap pair of sunglasses if you didn&#x27;t already have some - wouldn&#x27;t make things much less bright and glaring :(</li>
            <li>sunglasses are great because instead of dimming the light and just making everything harder to see like a pair of black sunglasses will, they just filter out the blue part of the light which is harder on your eyes.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t all that &#x27;ultra\\&quot;  --as in it didn&#x27;t provide the clear, crisp vision they claim in their ads.</li>
            <li>at how  crisp and clear everything was....</li>
            <li>i have long lashes and they fit so close to my face</li>
            <li>These glasses make images crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li>There are better looking sunglasses that cost less and don&#x27;t trick you into buying them with BS marketing.</li>
            <li>so i just put them cause i could&#x27;nt find decent anti glare glasses around my way</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not my main beef.</li>
            <li>I put the shades on again and just as quickly I was back on Mars!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The lenses looked decent.</li>
            <li>Put them on and they make absolutely NO difference to what you see - doesn&#x27;t at all do anything it advertises on the box - nothing is any more clear.</li>
            <li>These give you a better quality of the world around you, you can actually see every speck of dust there is, even individual leaves of every tree.</li>
            <li>The pair I found lasted me 7 or 8 months used I have had this new pair for a couple of months now with no problems so far !!!</li>
            <li>but apparently there is some type of scientific formula built into these sunglasses that opens up a kind of vortex or gateway that instantly dispatches the wearer across the solar system, landing them on the Red Planet, Mars, man!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have to impress people with high dollar sunglasses</li>
            <li>Over the high priced sunglasses...</li>
            <li>Nothing is high definition about them.</li>
            <li>ive seen glasses like these in high end stores that are almost identicle  </li>
            <li>For one thing, by no mean will these ever be HD vision, i don</li>
            <li>I was trying to clean a blur from the left side and found the scratches after tilting the lense up and down in the light.  </li>
            <li>Dont forget they are cheap, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li>Also the screws kept wanting to come out with normal use.</li>
            <li>ive bought a few more pairs to keep on hand  just in case...</li>
            <li>I just wanted the normal ones like it shows in the picture...</li>
            <li>I have few pairs that I had bought from As Seen On TV and they feel a lot more substantial than the ones</li>
            <li>They were absoulutely worth the money ten times over.</li>
            <li>sunny day was instantly tranformed into a surreal vision -- of intense clarity and contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of these from a store a few years ago, but I dropped them one too many times and they broke</li>
            <li>SOMETHING IS STOPING FROM A 5 GLASSES GOOD NOT GREAT</li>
            <li>They are well made, and cut down glare and light everything up, most sunglasses just make everything kinda dark</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not hard on glasses, these are just manufactured to minimum specifications.</li>
            <li>I have has the other HD Vision wrap around sun glasses that fit over my street glasses</li>
            <li>I live in New York, so street lights help a lot at night.</li>
            <li>I suffer from migraines and live in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve just bought a new pair from Amazon.</li>
            <li>last great buy on sunglasses was approximately 15 years ago when BlueBlocker sunglasses were running their TV adds.</li>
            <li>Very clear.</li>
            <li>i have purchased several pairs of these over the years at stores with AS SEEN ON TV products and this pair unfortunately is not the same the fit differently.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I think they look good but understand that they are not super dark shades (people can see your eyes).</li>
            <li>I thought that was a nice touch especially for people like me who don&#x27;t have a high enough bridge to wear a lot of other sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my first pair of these sunglasses from the as seen on tv section of a local Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow, man!  </li>
            <li>Wow, man!  </li>
            <li>Even if the glasses did not perform at all, I&#x27;d still consider them an OK buy for $7-$8 like the usual fashion glasses out there.</li>
            <li>Even if the glasses did not perform at all, I&#x27;d still consider them an OK buy for $7-$8 like the usual fashion glasses out there.</li>
            <li>Not worth the price, cheaply made</li>
            <li>I am still using the 2nd pair of my BlueBlockers; the first pair I lost.</li>
            <li>The frames on both pairs have snapped in exactly the same place, where the frame connects to the nose bridge.</li>
            <li>And the second pair has held up pretty well</li>
            <li>These glasses are not bad and about what I expected for $7.  </li>
            <li>They are no more special than most other sunglasses.  </li>
            <li>They actually do bring the view into clarity and provide a crisp, clear image when you look through them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what to expect from HD glasses, but in any case these are very good sunglasses at an unbelievable price!  </li>
            <li>It makes everything around you look different (luminous and rich while protecting your eyes from UV rays) and not dark like regular sun shades.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as expected Kind of disappointed</li>
            <li>Loved them until they snapped in half at the nose piece within just a few months.</li>
            <li>One thing people need to know about these glasses is you cannot drop them and have them fall on a hard service, because I have dropped more pairs than I have fingers on one hand and every one of them broke around the glass frame.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to find a hard case for the glasses to protect them :)</li>
            <li>These lenses cut all the glare and give me super sharp clarity.</li>
            <li>And it kinda tricks you because everything does seem clear in a way with the glasses on.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t see clearly indoors.  </li>
            <li>which were both well over $150 and am embarrassed to say that their lenses were not this clear.</li>
            <li>so anything you put over them (except those who wear prescription lens/contact) will have the effect of blocking your eyes natural HD vision.  </li>
            <li>while wearing them you will notice the green light looks bluish</li>
            <li>and I really wish I could take that all back.</li>
            <li>Buy a couple pairs for yourself and buy your old lady some Ray Bans with the savings.</li>
            <li>Not the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>I really like to HD vision Sunglasses because I like the amber lens, but the last 4 pair I have bought keep cracking under or over the eye.</li>
            <li>When you put them on and walked outside, you really do say, \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can save your money and use it towards an actual pair of sunglasses that can really give you the anti-glare and \\&quot;HD\\&quot; like vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alternatively, you can save your money and use it towards an actual pair of sunglasses that can really give you the anti-glare and \\&quot;HD\\&quot; like vision.     </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t understand how sellers like this can be allowed to use such misleading words to describe their merchandise in order to \\&quot;con\\&quot; people into buying them.</li>
            <li>I keep a pair open on the den bar ready to wear for every time I leave the house.</li>
            <li>i was surprised..</li>
            <li>Although from the look of this product you might think it will not work it actually blocks the sun really well.</li>
            <li>not what an adult would wear.</li>
            <li>if you want really crappy yellow glasses then these are for you!</li>
            <li>They really do improve your visual clarity.</li>
            <li>With regular sun glasses , you can&#x27;t see the dash on very sunny days.  </li>
            <li>They always fit, never distort and if broken are cheap enough to throw away.</li>
            <li>Shoddy build quality but pretty cool looking for the shape of my face/hair</li>
            <li>I know they aren&#x27;t super durable, but I&#x27;ve had pairs last all summer as long as I don&#x27;t step on them.</li>
            <li>Dark sunglasses just darken everything making it just that much more difficult to focus my eyes (even adding more strain) when I have a migraine.</li>
            <li>Dark sunglasses just darken everything making it just that much more difficult to focus my eyes (even adding more strain) when I have a migraine.</li>
            <li>The front of the lenses are a deep amber yellow color and the flip side of the lenses have a pretty neat purplish/blue metallic coating on them.</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re willing to pay the big bucks for prescription sunglasses, you don&#x27;t want to fool around removing your regular glasses to don your sunglasses, and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Strange plant life, rust colored leaves on unusually large trees.  </li>
            <li>There is no such thing as \\&quot;high definition\\&quot; when it comes to sunglasses.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased two pairs of the HD Vision Ultra High Definition Sunglasses.</li>
            <li>the brighter the yellow sun light the less the yellowish effect).  </li>
            <li>although I haven&#x27;t tried to scratch mine to test this), and I don&#x27;t really expect anything long term out of these.</li>
            <li>I solve it by using one of my son&#x27;s dental rubber bands to close it back to normal angle like the otherside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a teenage girl who wears them almost everyday, and they look fine for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear real dark glasses anymore and these allow enough light in my eyes to see clearly yet keep the glare and sunlight controlled.  </li>
            <li>A few hours after that they fell off my face because the hinges that look like they are made of metal are actually just cheap plastic components that are painted a shiny silver to make them look like they are metal.....</li>
            <li>these are the only glasses that fit my round fat face and dont rub my lady like eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They fog up quickly and within a week they have a film on them like dried up crayons.</li>
            <li>Glasses are very cheap, you have to be very careful with them, otherwise you will break them, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I like the tint of the HD Vision sunglasses which work to improve visibility in broad daylight to dusk.</li>
            <li>Major brand names can cost $50, $100 and</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, two of them broke at above the frame (thinner section) near bridge, without falling or any accident!</li>
            <li>For me at least, they actually made some colors look much LESS bright.  </li>
            <li>These things are hard to fit .</li>
            <li>I expect them to break and generally buy 2 pairs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they will work as well for general use.</li>
            <li>Polarized lenses generally block out tablet screens and these do not</li>
            <li>The picture clearly shows the standard sunglasses as seen on TV</li>
            <li>and I am not careful with them.</li>
            <li>They are too wide, though, and do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this pair, because my old ones(which</li>
            <li>The color on these sunglasses distorts too far to the yellow range and they do not handle glare as well as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have bought about 4 pairs and 2 of those have broken from the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the frames are stylish  and are a  bit thin in some areas but for me its NOT  an issue.  </li>
            <li>Although I liked the way the lenses on these work, the quality of these sunglasses is VERY poor.</li>
            <li>The old design was much cooler, they&#x27;ve changed a little bit.</li>
            <li>I absolutely agree with the other reviews...</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the fragile coating on the glasses which scratch or spiderweb easily if dropped onto paved surfaces.</li>
            <li>I compared them to a pair of Raybans I have had for years and they actually beat the Raybans as far as overall clarity.  </li>
            <li>First off, I had a pair of the black ones, and wore them for several hours while driving.  </li>
            <li>The average person who&#x27;s never tried on a pair of REAL \\&quot;HD\\&quot; sunglasses would probably never know the difference.</li>
            <li>These are very dark-too dark for nite driving.</li>
            <li>The first day after I got these glasses, I was in a foursome playing golf, I dropped them on the green and one of the guys picked them up and looked through them.  </li>
            <li>If you have one ear a little higher than the other, you&#x27;ll have to live with the sunglasses sitting tilted on your face.  </li>
            <li>I usually keep a few pair of glasses around, these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>first pair lasted a few months and broke above the nose piece.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better HD sunglasses in the past and have purchased them a few times.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first pair of glasses I&#x27;ve found myself wearing consistently during the night, rains, fog or other bad light situations.</li>
            <li>These are great inexpensive sunglasses, I&#x27;ve had several pairs of these over the past few years and they&#x27;re very comfortable, why pay a bunch of money for fancy expensive sunglasses just to loose or destroy them on the job?</li>
            <li>Not sure what other people are talking about (cheaply made??).</li>
            <li>They darken the light a little bit, but cut out harsh oncoming lights and give a clearer view.</li>
            <li>my favorite sunglasses  double order never want to go without  only complaint frame could be a little stronger</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The clarity was great, that&#x27;s why I bought these sun glasses.  </li>
            <li> and they offer great protection from the wind</li>
            <li> IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect great optical quality from them for the $10 asking price.</li>
            <li> Great HD  view.</li>
            <li> but they worked great.</li>
            <li> Vision is GREAT  </li>

            <li> The lenses are great.  </li>

            <li> Tried them out and love them !!</li>
            <li> very nice what a bald making them in the Brown frame</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing!  </li>
            <li> They are remarkable pair of shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are especially good during rainy conditions, as they cut reflections and make viewing a bit better.</li>
            <li> love the lens and they have great looks and appeal, the lens are very good would recommend these sun glasses.</li>
            <li> Driving at night is really a pleasant surprise when using the Ultra HD&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;as advertised, great value for price paid, very satisfied, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The are very good for driving but not so for activities like golf or more mobile sports.  </li>
            <li> Everything looks as if it&#x27;s orange or gold, depending on how bright of a day it is.  </li>
            <li> Product does what they say it will do under adverse conditions of bright sunlight glare.</li>
            <li> But by blocking the actinic (UV/blue) part of the spectrum, they eliminate eye strain from glare, even on a bright day in the snow.</li>
            <li> The glasses help but not as bright as others I tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> On sunny days, it dims bright skies.</li>
            <li> A problem because bright sunlight can trigger migraines.  </li>
            <li> I have eye problems, I can not handle bright sunlight, I also have a problem at night with the glare of headlights.  </li>
            <li> All in all I would say they are a good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to mention that these shades work good for people who have to spend hours in front of computer screens like me.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this style to wear for good looks when I have my contacts in.</li>
            <li> Good price and the product was as described.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD</li>
            <li> on to the good stuff.</li>
            <li> a good note they do work in blocking out glare..</li>
            <li> On a good note they do work in blocking out glare..</li>
            <li> These glasses are also great for sunrise and sunset when the sun is just blinding...pretty effective.    </li>
            <li> They Are Also Good For Night Driving There</li>
            <li> Good sun blockage, yet bright view.</li>
            <li> They were that good.  </li>
            <li> I had a pair before and loved them, so I assume something has changed in the materials</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had good luck buying sunglasses online</li>
            <li> the product is good for the money.</li>

            <li> So $9 was a good deal</li>
            <li> Took good care of glare.</li>
            <li> At this price, they make a good pair of driving glasses.</li>
            <li> Works good, cuts the glare and sharpens the images.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
            <li> Still a good pair to wear around.</li>
            <li> Price is right!!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this PURCHASE, I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS VERY NICE AND HAVE GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> They work great, fit great and are well made.</li>
            <li> best part is buying from amazon super to deal with if you ever have a problem they will take care of it pronto  </li>
            <li> These are great on the course, lightweight, don&#x27;t realy care if they get scratched or you drop them and the best part, it makes spotting balls much easier.</li>
            <li> The world looks amazing and bright and I do not squint in the sun.</li>

            <li> handy.</li>
            <li> Nice price too.</li>
            <li> The car clip that comes with them is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t buy so many of them, but I taught that the price was good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> These, however, are more attractive, and I feel more dressed for the day with the Ultra&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I put this concern aside because I really liked the performance of the lenses.</li>
            <li> As much as I liked the performance of the lenses, I will refuse to purchase any additional pairs unless I found out that the frames have been improved.</li>
            <li> He liked the originals.</li>
            <li> They are the kind of lenses you put on</li>
            <li> They look nice on also, for men and women.  </li>
            <li> I bought 3 pairs of these nice sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> But my husband wears them on their own.  </li>
            <li> When ordering the glasses, they told me they were charging me a dollar to send me a package offering me some kind of savings coupons.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed by these sunglasses as I was not expecting much from them.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a pair before and loved them, these are okay</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product and the great service</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t own these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> Very good product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this glasses because I liked the way they helped my eyes, even in bright light.</li>
            <li> I purchased these glasses and they are absolutely the most awesome  </li>
            <li> they work really good but will brake easy</li>
            <li> Very easy on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Plus, they scratch very easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you want a good inexpensive pair of sunglasses then these will work just fine.</li>
            <li> cheap, HD, work great, great for summer, great for skiing in the winter, all around versatile, good cheap buy, a definite recommend</li>
            <li> and that is to reduce the bright light so you can see.  </li>
            <li> Good fit and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They perform well in bright sunlight as well as in light overcast.  </li>
            <li> So by wearing the glasses about an hour before bedtime, it should help your body to produce it&#x27;s own melatonin and help you sleep better.  </li>
            <li> These are clearly the best sunglasses ever.</li>
            <li> there wonderful really clear my fiends want me to get them</li>
            <li> not the fit i was looking for  lenses not has good</li>
            <li> the frame breaks too easily, but the fit and clearity of glass is great.</li>
            <li> You know, that way we could easily recognize one another during our trips!  </li>
            <li> You know, that way we could easily recognize one another during our trips!  </li>
            <li> You do see better in bright light just that the improvement is marginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also scratch very easily, I have to use them and try to see around the scratch until I get a better pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li> they look great and they make reading labels in the grocery store so much eaiser!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to easy to broking it with the new model, however you offering an excellent replacement services.</li>
            <li> bright and vibrant..  even in bright sun or cloudy days...</li>
            <li> Very cheap and flimsy plastic frames.</li>
            <li> ,they are very comfortable</li>
            <li> I like them, very light and works</li>
            <li> Frame material very light weight and flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li> However, they are very cheap</li>
            <li> Like isaid before very comfortable on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, its good to just keep a bit of bacon fat around to make everything else super duper.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that these glasses are actually very good.  </li>
            <li> So they were free!  </li>
            <li> I wear them mostly on my motorcycle, and like the way things look through them :-)</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy some nice glasses and not this cheap, plastic pair.</li>
            <li> The glasses are nice and lite, comfortable to wear in the sun, plus that there it</li>
            <li> If you feel that paying more gives you better protection, go ahead.</li>
            <li> If you have them, throw them on the ground, stomp on them, drive your car on top of them, and then set them on fire.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a better brand.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a smallet frame to fit my face</li>
            <li> love them, I wish the stores still carried these</li>
            <li> They are gradient(dark on top lighter on the lower portion)so you can wear in the sun, read or drive at night with them to cut glare from on coming head lights.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> I may even buy a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li> I wear them with earth-tones for the most part.</li>
            <li> Because of this I try to never pay more than $15 for a pair of sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> If it makes you feel better to pay $100 for sunglasses, or if you just don&#x27;t like the styling, then buy all means by something else.  </li>
            <li> I love the glasses.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> For the price, I can&#x27;t find a better pair of sunglasses for ppg.</li>
            <li> They are light, comfortable, they look good.</li>
            <li> Unless you are into that :)</li>
            <li> The point of sunglasses is to reduce eye fatigue and help you see better on sunny days.</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting something more like the hd vision glasses as seen on tv.  </li>
            <li> , I want to see better and protect my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I drive a lot and LOVE them.  </li>
            <li> more so my wife &amp; I each have a pair in each car.  </li>
            <li> ok....</li>
            <li> Ok, hey man.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to thank God for such awesome meta-physical sunglasses as these and the fact that He also gave us the planet Mars to explore!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to thank God for such awesome meta-physical sunglasses as these and the fact that He also gave us the planet Mars to explore!  </li>
            <li> i bought some of theses glasses a while ago and they broke, my fault, and had to buy some more.</li>
            <li> If they only had a better set made for a motorcycle driver I would be very happy.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s OK -</li>
            <li> I enjoyed having them around and wearing.  </li>
            <li> I wondered why so many people were smiling at me.  </li>
            <li> even more so I was not expecting top line stuff</li>
            <li> Ok while they lasted.</li>
            <li> Nice, cheap glasses</li>
            <li> I love these sun glasses.</li>
            <li> For the price there are nothing better</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> For our $, surely there are better choices.  </li>
            <li> these are ok</li>
            <li> Just received the item, I love them.</li>
            <li> Get one for yourself and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three more words</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These glasses are the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; HD glasses, and they&#x27;re my favorite driving glasses.</li>
            <li> Headlights still glared and did nothing to help me see better at night.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d better stock up.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall.</li>
            <li> Ok, hear me out.  </li>
            <li> that being said, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why i gave this product 4 stars and bought it three</li>
            <li> These glasses are great and really do help in both sun and rain.</li>
            <li> Even though the company promised money-back guarantee, they charge wayyy more for shipping than the product itself, and of course don&#x27;t return the shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I would not pay a cent more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect them to magically make objects appear on HD or make objects look better.</li>
            <li> I love the HD glasses.  </li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite sunglasses ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These have totally met my expectations and I would truly recommend them 100% and buy them for my best friend. :)</li>
            <li> The orange &#x27;shade&#x27; has a gradient that is darker at the top and lighter at the bottom, which also works well for driving.</li>
            <li> Still working great, not broken or chipped.</li>
            <li> I love these sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Better then my $85 glasses.</li>
            <li> They are not the huge kind that wrap around prescription glasses, but you could do that in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> My in laws are golfers, they wear them on the course and also love them.  </li>
            <li> Update - I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain a replacement for the damaged glasses but was issued a return and credit.</li>
            <li> These glasses reduce the glare and makes driving during the day more relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love these sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to buy more.</li>
            <li> but when I went to reorder 2 more pairs from this &amp;#34;same supplier&amp;#34; they shipped me what appears to cheap knockoffs!</li>
            <li> I love them for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With these you are able to .  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> They may not be the most fashionable eyewear but in my case that is not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Product is okay though it looks like a copy.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any better than the $5.00 knock offs at the flea market.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Love these sunglasses both for the comfort and lens shade color</li>
            <li> you could all most wear them at night..</li>
            <li> I love the HD effect for lawn and garden work.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find the lenses in a more durable frame.</li>
            <li> I love my HDTV vision sun glasses my husband had bought.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with them</li>
            <li> love them....</li>
            <li> purchase two more pairs for friends...</li>
            <li> See better with them on than off.</li>
            <li> There is no need to pay 200 bucks for the Ray Bans, I think these work better.</li>
            <li> LOVE these.</li>
            <li> or I could find them elsewhere because we love these</li>
            <li> its a good hd glasses, its not as bright as previous versions which makes it a good choice for summer time.</li>
            <li> These high definition sunglasses are a great choice because they cut glare, but also allow me to read outdoors.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone wanting a great pair of HD glasses.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for what you get.  </li>
            <li> They make things bright and they make everything crystal clear!!!!  </li>
            <li> Love the glasses, but they scratch so easy.</li>
            <li> If you buy sunglasses for $100 you could just as easily sit on them or lose them as you could with this pair, and then you&#x27;re out a lot more</li>
            <li> When you look thorough them, the whole world seems more bright and sunny, in a perspective that you have never been exposed to before.</li>
            <li> Very light and comfortable for any length of time wearing them.</li>
            <li> and they actually works with rain and very bright areas while driving.</li>
            <li> Not just very good for the price, which they are, but very good compared to more expensive sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> These glasses really help to block out the glare while still keeping everything else bright and in focus.</li>
            <li> These glasses really help to block out the glare while still keeping everything else bright and in focus.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are cheap and cheaply made!</li>
            <li> I have been buying these glasses for about five years and they are ok they are cheap</li>
            <li> Crystal clear vision at a great price.</li>
            <li> They work great for me as far as the glare.</li>
            <li> While admittedly the quality is not the best, but the quality is comparable to drugstore sunglasses and as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block the sun, it doesn&#x27;t make things look better, it&#x27;s just orange tinted cheap pastic glasses.</li>
            <li> , they are super cheap and kind of garbarge.....</li>
            <li> Very light and flimsy, and the glass scratched way too early, but the vision is good.</li>
            <li> How totally cool!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the original Blublockers many years ago and they literally made everything \\&quot;pop\\&quot; when you put them on.</li>
            <li> and I love the warm, crisp color and light they give the world when looking through them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> As for the merchant, there was a mixup with my original order, they corrected it quickly and courteously.  </li>
            <li> I love my HD VISION SUNGLASSES every day is bright and clear in my eyes</li>
            <li> BUT THEY BREAK EASY..</li>
            <li> Easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li> people talk about them breaking easy</li>
            <li> The plastic frame starts to degrade and break easily.  </li>
            <li> I am so easy on things</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I can easily replace them.</li>
            <li> Lenses come out away too easy</li>
            <li> they relax the eyes and have easy vision -</li>
            <li> but I wear strong prescription glasses</li>
            <li> and they are perfect for lousey dark cloudy days because when I wear them everything looks brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> These glasses were nice, but they are flimsy and broke in the first month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are cheaply made, feel like they would scratch easily (</li>
            <li> THESE ARE FINE</li>
            <li> They are fine sunglasses and the price is fine but they did not do anything for the glare in my case</li>
            <li> They worked fine for two days then the lens fell out.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition in about half of the estimated delivery time.  </li>
            <li> Night driving is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I really love these glasses as they have the best color (not sure what to call it) or tint of any I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-very cheap and easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit well around my head and the lenses are strong and scratch resistant.</li>
            <li> The clarity of sight is wonderful, makes an ordinary day look brighter and more detailed.  </li>
            <li> I will have to admit though, that they are a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, which is fine for me, because they match and fit my face</li>
            <li> Just get over the supposed need to have things darker and enjoy the feeling of having your eyes relax while keeping the scene bright and clear.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay $15 or $20 so that was a huge factor in this review.</li>
            <li> I bought them because I was five bucks away from free shipping ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but they are quite nice.  </li>
            <li> Of course everything will have a light yellowish tint to it, (</li>
            <li> Is it a one size fit all concept you got?</li>
            <li> They are lightweight, but the plastic frame does appear to be cheap.  </li>
            <li> it gets the job done for being so cheaped, of course its cheaply made too.</li>
            <li> these are cheaply made sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> They fit my face well.</li>
            <li> They are made so cheap that you need to handle them with kid gloves.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find something similar.</li>
            <li> These sunglasses have great potential...</li>
            <li> No stars for the cheap feeling plastic material though.</li>
            <li> No stars for the cheap feeling plastic material though.</li>
            <li> I ordered three sets at the time, so I paid for three and got three pairs for free.  </li>
            <li> I have always bought cheap sunglasses($5-10)</li>
            <li> What can you expect from cheap sun glasses though.</li>
            <li> and they fit well.  </li>
            <li> so cheap</li>
            <li> The frame is cheap plastic with no adjustment.  </li>
            <li> Cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> they fit snugly on the nose</li>
            <li> Great glasses for seeing things differently.</li>
            <li> Otherwise enjoy the picture</li>
            <li> These  are  cheap  </li>
            <li> I have purchased HD glasses before and one of the draw backs for me was that the tint was so light that the sun still bothered me when I went out.  </li>
            <li> they fit me well and</li>
            <li> They looked like the cheap plastic toy sunglasses I used play with as a child.</li>
            <li> Tilting the head just a bit allows you to adjust the degree of darkness for varying light situations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are light and don&#x27;t slip off.  </li>
            <li> They also aren&#x27;t as cheaply built as the price would lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li> My mother had cataract surgery, and all light bothered her eyes,</li>
            <li> Amber glasses are supposed to block &#x27;&#x27;blue&amp;#34; light from cell phones, computers, &amp; TV (which block melatonin production).</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting a quality pair of sunglasses but these were beyond cheap.</li>
            <li> They are so light they would bounce on my nose when I would walk.</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t fit like the others did.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy how these brighten things up a bit, however..</li>
            <li> The variable shade is a great feature, especially when I wear them at night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amber vision will make us free.</li>
            <li> They looked like cheap plastic sunglasses to me and that is what they are.</li>
            <li> , I rate them as acceptable for cheap plastic sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Light,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already lost one pair of these sunglasses but being that cheap</li>
            <li> So comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have told many many people about these glasses and how much I like them</li>
            <li> great vision, but need to keep them in a safe case to keep from getting scratched or crushed.</li>
            <li> the image is crisp and good but the frame is way too large.</li>
            <li> These glasses are excellent for driving and making things easier to see while preventing glare and excessive light.  </li>
            <li> think these will work fine for a reasonable time for their intended purpose, and they actually fit much better than I thought they would.  </li>
            <li> The shape is downright unattractive, but I forgo all that to see super clear when I am driving in my car or walking around in bright sun.</li>
            <li> Good ,comfortable,cheap, easy on the eyes, but one flaw, every pair that I have bought, has a crack in the lens, same place every time.</li>
            <li> When you put them on things don&#x27;t get darker, as with traditional sunglasses, but the sensitivity of your eyes to the &#x27;glare component&#x27; of what you see is remarkably reduced.  </li>
            <li> They fit well with full coverage.  </li>
            <li> bought many glasses that were much more expensive and found these to be the best</li>
            <li> I have had many different kinds of traditional sunglasses but these HD Sunglasses are the BEST!!!  </li>
            <li> However, as I used them through the following days while driving, I found that they worked remarkably well.</li>
            <li> Lens are awesome as the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> These may be best suited for someone with a small head.</li>
            <li> They were in original packaging, so</li>
            <li> Fits well and the veiw is more clear and colors are better.</li>
            <li> I actually thought it was nice that these glasses were lighter than most.</li>
            <li> Bright blue light will cause a fuzziness like a fogged up window.  </li>
            <li> The lenses get spotty and it a challenge to clean them.</li>
            <li> seemingly disappearing, as you clean, lense coating.</li>
            <li> These are adequate cheap driving glasses, which is what I use them for.  </li>
            <li> &quot; sun glasses i have ever owned but certainly the most functional ones.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for decent, inexpensive sunglasses and can wait for delivery (which was very speedy by the way), then these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> Nice clear and clean view.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so light and cheap, you feel like you can break them just by looking at them funny.</li>
            <li> I made the purchase and exited the store into the bright sunlight beneath the cobalt blue sky of planet earth.  </li>
            <li> I am careful with them and they are great in the daytime.  </li>
            <li> The clear vision is amazing.</li>
            <li> The yellow tint also makes everything so bright, that they hurt my eyes.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  </li>
            <li> tho be such a good buy for the price</li>
            <li> Not too trendy, not too old</li>
            <li> The HD Vision Sunglasses,Ultra Are not Only Good</li>
            <li> Like most cheap sunglasses, all these do is change the color and slightly dim the light that gets through to your eyes by wearing them.</li>
            <li> The lenses are good but the frame seems too fragile?</li>
            <li> The frames look good and they stay put during various activities.</li>
            <li> UPS picked up the package from my front porch with a return sticker and I was notified that the glasses had been received and my account was credited for the full price.</li>
            <li> quality is actually not bad at all for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the glasses 3 stars for somewhat doing what it says, for the pretty good quality overall in the craftsmanship (lenses fit in frame perfectly, arms fold in/and out smoothly, no imperfections in plastic frame, no scratches on plastic or lenses right out of box, etc.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the glasses 3 stars for somewhat doing what it says, for the pretty good quality overall in the craftsmanship (lenses fit in frame perfectly, arms fold in/and out smoothly, no imperfections in plastic frame, no scratches on plastic or lenses right out of box, etc.)</li>
            <li> Thanks so much !!!!</li>
            <li> The sunglasses provide a bright and clear image that is superior to any other sunglasses I have owned.</li>
            <li> I wear prescription glasses, and these fit right over the glasses, sometimes I also need to wear flip up polarized lenses, it still fits over the glasses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased very high end glasses and in my opinion the HD glasses are far superior.</li>
            <li> The sky was no longer blue like it was a moment ago on planet Earth, but had become a murky red hue, AWESOME!  </li>
            <li> I like, totally enjoyed my stay there and then thought I better get back to planet Earth</li>
            <li> But these are certainly worth buying for sure since they are so reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Great glasses, make the images much clearer then regular sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Love them, highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I was then able to explore Mars in Highly Defined detail...</li>
            <li> these are worth checking out... and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Both times after normal use tug of the lanyard, to pull the shades around to place them on my face, THE FRAME snapped at the top holding the lense.  </li>
            <li> (Make sure you are getting the normal \\&quot;surfer style\\&quot; ones.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the plastic frames seemed too light.  </li>
            <li> The hinge mechanism is pretty cheap and they need to be handled gingerly.  </li>
            <li> they blocked out blue light, well these appear to attenuate most \\&quot;yellow light\\&quot; (for a good example try looking at traffic lights</li>
            <li> Weather in a car,walking around the city or just simply ookng cool, they work just amazing.</li>
            <li> The spring loaded temples are a nice feature and they do seem to make everything crisp and clear..</li>
            <li> They look pretty good too, especially for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes to the light &amp; these help a lot!  </li>
            <li> thanks again!!</li>
            <li> and I do not like being blind by conventional sunglasses, so these HDs are perfect to make things more bright on overcast days, and stop the squinting on all sunny days.</li>
            <li> They are as good as any of the other pairs of plastic sunglasses I have had over the years, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> does a good job at blocking the Sun but not high definition in my opinion</li>
            <li> I have very light sensitive eyes &amp; cataracts, these are the only kind of glasses that work for me.</li>
            <li> Right on, I&#x27;m like, planning more trips to Mars via these far out sunglasses!  </li>
            <li> Everything is much sharper and they fit well too.  </li>
            <li> The real sensitivity to light comes when it&#x27;s overcast or foggy..</li>
            <li> The real sensitivity to light comes when it&#x27;s overcast or foggy..</li>
            <li> The glasses fit very well over my prescription glasses.  </li>
            <li> Scratched too easily, very snug fit .</li>
            <li> so they are worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth about $5 if you ask me.</li>
            <li> , these should be worth 5$ but ended up paying 14$.  again there</li>
            <li> I feel I got my moneys worth.  </li>
            <li> When you first get them out of the package, the first thing you notice is how cheap they are made.</li>
            <li> but it worth every penny</li>
            <li> The virtue of these glasses is that they effectively attenuate the blue (and ultraviolet!)</li>
            <li> and  they arent worth the postage to return.  </li>
            <li> By the time I paid return shipping, it wasn&#x27;t worth the bother, and just threw them in the garbage, chalking it up to another TV con job.</li>
            <li> When wearing the glasses, the top light of the signal looks yellow, otherwise the gasses are helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good theory, but I think next time, I&#x27;d buy glasses made for the purpose of helping to block blue light to help you sleep!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s where they are now...not worth the return process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are worth about .72 cents each.</li>
            <li> Lens had splotchy spot out of the box, used water and soft cloth to clean and lens scratched easily.  </li>
            <li> best cheap sunglasses you will ever buy, I always lose expensive sunglasses these ones are worth buying and</li>
            <li> IM big fan of the h-d vision,, I had a pair of the old school ones.. very nice on the eyes</li>
            <li> I was also drawn to these glasses because they looked sleeker and more stylish than some other ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> But, I tend to break or lose sunglasses pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I bought these more out of curiosity than anything, but I really did need a decent pair of driving sunglasses.</li>
            <li> anybody knows of a source to get the REAL HD Vision glasses (original style), please let me know.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I have a cataract in my right eye.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> They also tend to slide right up to my face, no matter how I try to keep them on the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> The damage was right where the sticker was placed.</li>
            <li> The price is right on these glasses.</li>
            <li> Right after the 10th day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I will say they are comfortable and look decent on.</li>
            <li> It felt better with the bare plastic resting on my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these glasses in the past &amp; was happy to see Amazon carried them.</li>
            <li> they are more pinkish, and barely block the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In both cases, they work great on highways, but you must be more careful on city streets due to poorer peripheral vision.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great for a second of third pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I had a previous pair and loved them.  </li>
            <li> They do not have the distinct yellow HD lenses that I used to love...</li>
            <li> They filter out light from the blue end of the light spectrum.  </li>
            <li> When they broke I went looking for new ones !!!</li>
            <li> The problem is, when I clean them I have to be so careful because they just pop from the top.</li>
            <li> Over the last seventy decades or so, I have had countless pairs of sunglasses to protect my 20/20 blue eyes, and the HD are more than adequate to filter those bright Arizona rays.</li>
            <li> I have a normal to large head and these fit well</li>
            <li> Great, very stylish, just too bad that i scratched them up already, but i lover them and would defieanlty</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I did not purchase these from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> IF they were NOT so fragile, they would have more than met my needs.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what I want them to do.</li>
            <li> I went back and purchased two more just in case they get discontinued.</li>
            <li> I would have paid $20 or $30 if they actually would have made them more durable and could have added the clarity and something that blocks the effects of sun fatigue.  </li>
            <li> Thanks God!  </li>
            <li> Thanks God!  </li>
            <li> works really well!</li>
            <li> My light sensitivity is actually not bad when the skies are blue and sunny.</li>
            <li> pretty effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My light sensitivity is actually not bad when the skies are blue and sunny.</li>
            <li> They are not the best sunglasses I have ever owned but for under $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
            <li> The HD sunglasses were exactly like I had hoped they would be.  </li>
            <li> And I really love driving with them on, especially at night!</li>
            <li> As someone else said in another review, they look like they are toy sunglasses when you first see them.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> ,  everything  looks  crisp and  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are not made of titanium steel and will break if you sit on them, but for under $10 I am willing to have them.</li>
            <li> On top of that they broke on the middle hinge after about two months.</li>
            <li> For the price, they do exactly what I want ...</li>
            <li> Also, the tone is not constant; its darker in the top of the lens and lighter in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> that is when I bought her first pair.  </li>
            <li> Even here in sunny Southern California I have no need for greater filtering (as offered by darker colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are more of a blue blocker than just sunglasses that darken.  </li>
            <li> However this last pair the plastic was much more</li>
            <li> I feel this is pretty much a scam!  </li>
            <li> Which has more to do with me having a tiny  face than the size of the glasses.</li>
            <li> For exactly that amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair of these in May or June of 2010.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Me my first pair when they came out on TV</li>
            <li> Had my first pair for two years, than accidentally sat on them.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping these were half as good as they claim.</li>
            <li> While the first impression of the lenses was positive because of the great clarity and acuity, the coating on the lenses scratches way too easily leaving them pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty effective in well lit rooms too, and yes, your eyes can be seen through these shades when you are in close quarters with other people.  </li>
            <li> The fit is great not too tight or too loose.</li>
            <li> They reduce glare and everything is very clear, not dark like most sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know whether to buy these since there was divergence in opinion, but opinions were mostly positive.  </li>
            <li> but my experience was positive.</li>
            <li> but in the long run they are much better  bargain...</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described on the website, priced reasonably, and met all expectations.......</li>
            <li> think they&#x27;re pretty much identical to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t look good, it&#x27;s definitely not stylish.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about buying these glasses and hoping to purchase more items, this being my first amazon buying experience is not good.  </li>
            <li> Though they were not expensive, I expected more durability.  </li>
            <li> The lenses have a yellow tint to them, but I found this easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and make everything super clear.  </li>
            <li> I have two pair of HD Sunglasses which are rather large.</li>
            <li> Pure junk.  </li>
            <li> Looked great on my phone and PC but frames are not a solid black color.</li>
            <li> For less than three cups of coffee, I got sunglasses that completely take care of the glare of bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> If you plan to do city driving these will likely be fine since there are plenty of street lights around</li>
            <li> If you plan to do city driving these will likely be fine since there are plenty of street lights around</li>
            <li> The only issue I found with this pair was there were some fine line scratches on one of the lenses.</li>
            <li> Will be back next year for more stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> They also look pretty decent while wearing them.  </li>
            <li> attenuating certain kinds of yellow light reduces squinting thus reducing eye strain/fatigue.  </li>
            <li> No I am not related to anyone in the company that makes these sunglasses, just a huge fan.</li>
            <li> Plus they sent a double order, again charging a huge shipping fee.  </li>
            <li> vision\\&quot;... a friend of mine has the real pair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are really HD</li>
            <li> (insert CHEAPER than necessary even for cheap sunglasses), even glue was not a viable option.  </li>
            <li> Go head and avoid the ASOTv specials and move on the NEXT pair of cheap sunglass readers.  </li>
            <li> Who knew you could get this much out of 10 bux?</li>
            <li> The HD claim might be bogus, but the functionality and price are the real deal.</li>
            <li> this is the cheapest price found, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Got turned on to real HD by Edge</li>
            <li> They provided so much protection from the sun UV rays with darkening the scenery.  </li>
            <li> The glasses filter out blue light and will almost cancel the effects of the cataract.      </li>
            <li> This is very helpful while driving.</li>
            <li> They are made so cheap that the frame broke simply by putting them on.  </li>
            <li> not much to say except i am satisfied with the hd glasses.</li>
            <li> and they are very helpful for filtering out the glare and make everything seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> modern design, lightweight,reduces glare, enhances color and clarity&lt;</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this product.  </li>
            <li> It is a real pleasure to wear these sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> They protect my eyes while I am driving under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li> Are these real?  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be out in the sun without them, and the shape on the sides really helps block the side glare.</li>
            <li> Received this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I am very picky with the clarity of my sunglass lenses.</li>
            <li> these were the replacement, Thanks</li>
            <li> anti-glare hue is actually more orange than amber, and so a bit brighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> You can see really well with these glasses.</li>
            <li> but they work really well</li>
            <li> I really like these HD glasses.  </li>
            <li> I bought these straight from the manufacturer, not Amazon, after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> This really does feel like it blocks out the harmful UV rays that are coming straight from the sun.</li>
            <li> that means that either a girl or boy can wear them(anyone really).</li>
            <li> I would just like to warn everyone that these are very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all, pinch the nose too much.  </li>
            <li> They really do make everything look sharper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does seem to enhance your vision.</li>
            <li> The flimsyness of the frames is not a deterant as I didn&#x27;t pay that much for them, but if you are looking for a heavier frame these are not for you.</li>
            <li> These are the type of sunglasses that fit over regular eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li> but I am very upset they wrote what to me are lies about this product.</li>
            <li> Though they may feel cheap and plasticy to some, they are actually quite sturdy.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t cost much, so I took a chance on them, but I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys these glasses.</li>
            <li> The lense blocks the eye tiring blue light</li>
            <li> they are REASONABLY priced.  </li>
            <li> but anyway thanks for the product</li>
            <li> I really wish they would sell them in stores again .</li>
            <li> wearing these glasses is an experience more than i expected.</li>
            <li> very well</li>
            <li> Pretty interesting on cloudy days as well, but not recommended on rainy days, snowy days, foggy days or in the dark.  </li>
            <li> Liked these enough to buy several pairs.</li>
            <li> These glasses are nice to look through, but they are made of cheap plastic wrapped in a thin plastic coating that is now peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These glasses used to be made very strong, but now the plastic is rather thin and breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> I drive for a living in a high action type job and tend to go through sunglasses quickly.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who is active outside with a sport and needs a good pair of sunglasses that help from having to squint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on sunglasses but these seem to block out the sun better than any other sunglasses i&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> My original pair I got back in 2006 or 2007 and there were no nose pads that sat acroos the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and what makes rhem unique is that the inside is polarized as opposed to the outside of the lens.  </li>
            <li> I extremely like the brighter colors, how everything stands out more.</li>
            <li> I found that if you open and close the arms, right at the corners of the frames they will last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> As far as the glasses go, they seem cheaply made, scratch easily, &amp; are a little blury to look through.</li>
            <li> And today, my second pair broke while trying to clean them.</li>
            <li> I use them to drive in especially because they are not too dark, have gradiant lenses (lighter at the bottom) and work if it&#x27;s bright or cloudy.  </li>
            <li> only reason i bought them was cause my eyes are sensitive to certain amount of light</li>
            <li> ; it looks too squared and old fachioned; and the frame is too fragile, it may break easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if these would work for a good cheap pair of sunglasses if you didn&#x27;t already have some - wouldn&#x27;t make things much less bright and glaring :(</li>
            <li> sunglasses are great because instead of dimming the light and just making everything harder to see like a pair of black sunglasses will, they just filter out the blue part of the light which is harder on your eyes.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t all that &#x27;ultra\\&quot;  --as in it didn&#x27;t provide the clear, crisp vision they claim in their ads.</li>
            <li> at how  crisp and clear everything was....</li>
            <li> i have long lashes and they fit so close to my face</li>
            <li> These glasses make images crisp and clear.  </li>
            <li> There are better looking sunglasses that cost less and don&#x27;t trick you into buying them with BS marketing.</li>
            <li> so i just put them cause i could&#x27;nt find decent anti glare glasses around my way</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not my main beef.</li>
            <li> I put the shades on again and just as quickly I was back on Mars!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The lenses looked decent.</li>
            <li> Put them on and they make absolutely NO difference to what you see - doesn&#x27;t at all do anything it advertises on the box - nothing is any more clear.</li>
            <li> These give you a better quality of the world around you, you can actually see every speck of dust there is, even individual leaves of every tree.</li>
            <li> The pair I found lasted me 7 or 8 months used I have had this new pair for a couple of months now with no problems so far !!!</li>
            <li> but apparently there is some type of scientific formula built into these sunglasses that opens up a kind of vortex or gateway that instantly dispatches the wearer across the solar system, landing them on the Red Planet, Mars, man!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have to impress people with high dollar sunglasses</li>
            <li> Over the high priced sunglasses...</li>
            <li> Nothing is high definition about them.</li>
            <li> ive seen glasses like these in high end stores that are almost identicle  </li>
            <li> For one thing, by no mean will these ever be HD vision, i don</li>
            <li> I was trying to clean a blur from the left side and found the scratches after tilting the lense up and down in the light.  </li>
            <li> Dont forget they are cheap, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Also the screws kept wanting to come out with normal use.</li>
            <li> ive bought a few more pairs to keep on hand  just in case...</li>
            <li> I just wanted the normal ones like it shows in the picture...</li>
            <li> I have few pairs that I had bought from As Seen On TV and they feel a lot more substantial than the ones</li>
            <li> They were absoulutely worth the money ten times over.</li>
            <li> sunny day was instantly tranformed into a surreal vision -- of intense clarity and contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these from a store a few years ago, but I dropped them one too many times and they broke</li>
            <li> SOMETHING IS STOPING FROM A 5 GLASSES GOOD NOT GREAT</li>
            <li> They are well made, and cut down glare and light everything up, most sunglasses just make everything kinda dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not hard on glasses, these are just manufactured to minimum specifications.</li>
            <li> I have has the other HD Vision wrap around sun glasses that fit over my street glasses</li>
            <li> I live in New York, so street lights help a lot at night.</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines and live in Los Angeles.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve just bought a new pair from Amazon.</li>
            <li> last great buy on sunglasses was approximately 15 years ago when BlueBlocker sunglasses were running their TV adds.</li>
            <li> Very clear.</li>
            <li> i have purchased several pairs of these over the years at stores with AS SEEN ON TV products and this pair unfortunately is not the same the fit differently.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I think they look good but understand that they are not super dark shades (people can see your eyes).</li>
            <li> I thought that was a nice touch especially for people like me who don&#x27;t have a high enough bridge to wear a lot of other sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair of these sunglasses from the as seen on tv section of a local Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow, man!  </li>
            <li> Wow, man!  </li>
            <li> Even if the glasses did not perform at all, I&#x27;d still consider them an OK buy for $7-$8 like the usual fashion glasses out there.</li>
            <li> Even if the glasses did not perform at all, I&#x27;d still consider them an OK buy for $7-$8 like the usual fashion glasses out there.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, cheaply made</li>
            <li> I am still using the 2nd pair of my BlueBlockers; the first pair I lost.</li>
            <li> The frames on both pairs have snapped in exactly the same place, where the frame connects to the nose bridge.</li>
            <li> And the second pair has held up pretty well</li>
            <li> These glasses are not bad and about what I expected for $7.  </li>
            <li> They are no more special than most other sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> They actually do bring the view into clarity and provide a crisp, clear image when you look through them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to expect from HD glasses, but in any case these are very good sunglasses at an unbelievable price!  </li>
            <li> It makes everything around you look different (luminous and rich while protecting your eyes from UV rays) and not dark like regular sun shades.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as expected Kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> Loved them until they snapped in half at the nose piece within just a few months.</li>
            <li> One thing people need to know about these glasses is you cannot drop them and have them fall on a hard service, because I have dropped more pairs than I have fingers on one hand and every one of them broke around the glass frame.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to find a hard case for the glasses to protect them :)</li>
            <li> These lenses cut all the glare and give me super sharp clarity.</li>
            <li> And it kinda tricks you because everything does seem clear in a way with the glasses on.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t see clearly indoors.  </li>
            <li> which were both well over $150 and am embarrassed to say that their lenses were not this clear.</li>
            <li> so anything you put over them (except those who wear prescription lens/contact) will have the effect of blocking your eyes natural HD vision.  </li>
            <li> while wearing them you will notice the green light looks bluish</li>
            <li> and I really wish I could take that all back.</li>
            <li> Buy a couple pairs for yourself and buy your old lady some Ray Bans with the savings.</li>
            <li> Not the \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> I really like to HD vision Sunglasses because I like the amber lens, but the last 4 pair I have bought keep cracking under or over the eye.</li>
            <li> When you put them on and walked outside, you really do say, \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, you can save your money and use it towards an actual pair of sunglasses that can really give you the anti-glare and \\&quot;HD\\&quot; like vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> really don&#x27;t understand how sellers like this can be allowed to use such misleading words to describe their merchandise in order to \\&quot;con\\&quot; people into buying them.</li>
            <li> I keep a pair open on the den bar ready to wear for every time I leave the house.</li>
            <li> i was surprised..</li>
            <li> Although from the look of this product you might think it will not work it actually blocks the sun really well.</li>
            <li> not what an adult would wear.</li>
            <li> if you want really crappy yellow glasses then these are for you!</li>
            <li> They really do improve your visual clarity.</li>
            <li> With regular sun glasses , you can&#x27;t see the dash on very sunny days.  </li>
            <li> They always fit, never distort and if broken are cheap enough to throw away.</li>
            <li> Shoddy build quality but pretty cool looking for the shape of my face/hair</li>
            <li> I know they aren&#x27;t super durable, but I&#x27;ve had pairs last all summer as long as I don&#x27;t step on them.</li>
            <li> Dark sunglasses just darken everything making it just that much more difficult to focus my eyes (even adding more strain) when I have a migraine.</li>
            <li> Dark sunglasses just darken everything making it just that much more difficult to focus my eyes (even adding more strain) when I have a migraine.</li>
            <li> The front of the lenses are a deep amber yellow color and the flip side of the lenses have a pretty neat purplish/blue metallic coating on them.</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re willing to pay the big bucks for prescription sunglasses, you don&#x27;t want to fool around removing your regular glasses to don your sunglasses, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Strange plant life, rust colored leaves on unusually large trees.  </li>
            <li> There is no such thing as \\&quot;high definition\\&quot; when it comes to sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two pairs of the HD Vision Ultra High Definition Sunglasses.</li>
            <li> the brighter the yellow sun light the less the yellowish effect).  </li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t tried to scratch mine to test this), and I don&#x27;t really expect anything long term out of these.</li>
            <li> I solve it by using one of my son&#x27;s dental rubber bands to close it back to normal angle like the otherside.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a teenage girl who wears them almost everyday, and they look fine for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear real dark glasses anymore and these allow enough light in my eyes to see clearly yet keep the glare and sunlight controlled.  </li>
            <li> A few hours after that they fell off my face because the hinges that look like they are made of metal are actually just cheap plastic components that are painted a shiny silver to make them look like they are metal.....</li>
            <li> these are the only glasses that fit my round fat face and dont rub my lady like eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They fog up quickly and within a week they have a film on them like dried up crayons.</li>
            <li> Glasses are very cheap, you have to be very careful with them, otherwise you will break them, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the tint of the HD Vision sunglasses which work to improve visibility in broad daylight to dusk.</li>
            <li> Major brand names can cost $50, $100 and</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, two of them broke at above the frame (thinner section) near bridge, without falling or any accident!</li>
            <li> For me at least, they actually made some colors look much LESS bright.  </li>
            <li> These things are hard to fit .</li>
            <li> I expect them to break and generally buy 2 pairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they will work as well for general use.</li>
            <li> Polarized lenses generally block out tablet screens and these do not</li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows the standard sunglasses as seen on TV</li>
            <li> and I am not careful with them.</li>
            <li> They are too wide, though, and do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this pair, because my old ones(which</li>
            <li> The color on these sunglasses distorts too far to the yellow range and they do not handle glare as well as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have bought about 4 pairs and 2 of those have broken from the top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the frames are stylish  and are a  bit thin in some areas but for me its NOT  an issue.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked the way the lenses on these work, the quality of these sunglasses is VERY poor.</li>
            <li> The old design was much cooler, they&#x27;ve changed a little bit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with the other reviews...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the fragile coating on the glasses which scratch or spiderweb easily if dropped onto paved surfaces.</li>
            <li> I compared them to a pair of Raybans I have had for years and they actually beat the Raybans as far as overall clarity.  </li>
            <li> First off, I had a pair of the black ones, and wore them for several hours while driving.  </li>
            <li> The average person who&#x27;s never tried on a pair of REAL \\&quot;HD\\&quot; sunglasses would probably never know the difference.</li>
            <li> These are very dark-too dark for nite driving.</li>
            <li> The first day after I got these glasses, I was in a foursome playing golf, I dropped them on the green and one of the guys picked them up and looked through them.  </li>
            <li> If you have one ear a little higher than the other, you&#x27;ll have to live with the sunglasses sitting tilted on your face.  </li>
            <li> I usually keep a few pair of glasses around, these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> first pair lasted a few months and broke above the nose piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better HD sunglasses in the past and have purchased them a few times.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first pair of glasses I&#x27;ve found myself wearing consistently during the night, rains, fog or other bad light situations.</li>
            <li> These are great inexpensive sunglasses, I&#x27;ve had several pairs of these over the past few years and they&#x27;re very comfortable, why pay a bunch of money for fancy expensive sunglasses just to loose or destroy them on the job?</li>
            <li> Not sure what other people are talking about (cheaply made??).</li>
            <li> They darken the light a little bit, but cut out harsh oncoming lights and give a clearer view.</li>
            <li> my favorite sunglasses  double order never want to go without  only complaint frame could be a little stronger</li>
            <li> one false move could crack the frame, or like I&#x27;ll end up breaking a piece off from applying light to medium pressure.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these, everyone that has tried my pair loves them, and half end up buying a pair for themselves.</li>
            <li> I was cruising through Walmart the other day when I spied these HD sunglasses on the shelf near the checkout stand.  </li>
            <li> While these glasses are clear and on a dark and gloomy day can actually brighten your view, they don&#x27;t reduce eye fatigue.</li>
            <li> only complant is that glasses I received were not solid black frames, they were clear brown with leopard spots</li>
            <li> First seen these last year on a late night infomercial...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t l last to long without breaking,I&#x27;m on my fourth pair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these will work very well in any other situation because the slight tint makes surrounding areas even darker than if you were to look with the naked eye.lublockers or something similar because that was what I was looking for.     </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these will work very well in any other situation because the slight tint makes surrounding areas even darker than if you were to look with the naked eye.</li>
            <li> I put these so called \\&quot;HD\\&quot; vision sunglasses on and it&#x27;s like everything is just as flat as it was before I put them on.</li>
            <li> never last me long</li>
            <li> There is no apparent improvement in the vision (no apparent HD vision with this).  </li>
            <li> I bought a pair of similar glasses at Dollar Tree for one buck; as far as I can tell there is little difference.  </li>
            <li> These HD vision sunglasses will not last you long!  </li>
            <li> The lenses actually look well made..and if it weren&#x27;t for the cheap frame, it could pass for an expensive pair.</li>
            <li> I have had a wide variety of sunglasses from generic big box selections to brands costing hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Still function as long as the crack isn&#x27;t too big, otherwise it gets in your view, even with the crack as long as they do what their supposed to do,I would buy again.</li>
            <li> If I loose these, as I often do, I would replace them with the same.</li>
            <li> The ones in the picture at least have a little style to them, but instead I received the huge glasses that go over regular glasses, just like one other reviewer wrote.</li>
            <li> They were for my teenage son and the wrap around style were way too wide, big and loose for him.</li>
            <li> The color of the lenses is such that they will give you a little different look at things, by coloring the world yellow.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my concern over the quality of the frames has proven to be justified.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you might find yourself in a jam, some guy is hollering at you or you find yourself stuck in a long line at the unemployment office...</li>
            <li> I ordered these on an impulse to take on a long road trip.</li>
            <li> My mother has had several eye operations and her eyes hurt during the day due to the sunlight.</li>
            <li> I have several other pairs because of a problem with my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have since got a second one for my other car, and they both stay in the cars.</li>
            <li> It is a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; for when I forget to bring my other glasses.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality: these glasses are practically brand new.</li>
            <li> Having recently had cataract surgery I have to be especially careful in wearing sunglasses outside all the time.</li>
            <li> aka green - yellow &#x3D; blue)</li>
            <li> Ironically, a friend of mine order the same  a few days before me and got two for the price of one for same glasses</li>
            <li> Sadly the manufacturer is using lesser quality materials than they did a few years ago so the glasses are not as strong and need to be handled carefully.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing and now I&#x27;m thinking about getting the original Blublockers or something similar because that was what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you put them on they don&#x27;t make everything dark like regular sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care as long as they do the job!!</li>
            <li> I even noticed a fourth, hidden wolf in my three wolf moon tee.</li>
            <li> Took them off and noticed they had left two black stripes on the sides of my head where the temple pieces sat.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the yellow colored glasses.  </li>
            <li> They protect your eyes but these were a little too big on my face, and from now on will be looking for sunglasses with the wrap-around look.</li>
            <li> These are a little bigger than I expected but seem to sharpen everything around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lenses are extemely clear and make it so your eyes don&#x27;t have to work so hard.</li>
            <li> These are the same blublockers from the late 80&#x27;s being sold under a different name.</li>
            <li> Just use your common sense, and know the commercial grossly misrepresents reality!</li>
            <li> A few days later I sold them to one of my foursome because I prefer those with bifocals.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different kinds and these are one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Beran-Pittsburgh</li>
            <li> There is nothing remotely HD about these glasses.  </li>
            <li> well minus the HD vision BS.    </li>
            <li> These glasses do not fit over my prescription glasses like the last pair I owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For what I paid, it&#x27;s sort of what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very well constructed.</li>
            <li> Im not gentle with mine</li>
            <li> the frames broke over the center of the lenses, one broke when one hit the ground at a 2&#x27; drop.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later I saw a lens on the ground.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that it&#x27;s a bit harder to see green lights as it filters out the blue in the green...</li>
            <li> just be careful -</li>
            <li> I simply wore them everyday without abusing them.  </li>
            <li> The price was minimal.</li>
            <li> Have to be handled carefully but with care, they will last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> careful driving at night with the sunglasses, since surroundings will be darken.</li>
            <li> I use them for running outdoors and there is absolutely no glare.</li>
            <li> They are as expected.</li>
            <li> but I am told my return window is closed.</li>
            <li> and I the frame is all ready broken, where I bend the frame</li>
            <li> It opens up too wide.  </li>
            <li> So, be careful.</li>
            <li> Not What I Expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These sunglasses are described as \\&quot;anti-glare.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what that is supposed to mean, but my guess is there&#x27;s not polarization (or the description would say so).</li>
            <li> My head isn&#x27;t even that wide, but if I wear these glasses for an extended amount of time, I will notice some soreness behind and near the ears from the squeezing, but if you have long hair this should not be a problem for you.  </li>
            <li> It shows such a dramatic change, from foggy and blurry to sharp and crystal clear.  </li>
            <li> I used a lanyard for security and convenience just like any other pair of prescription glass or sunglass wearer might do.  </li>
            <li> The lense fell out and due to the THINNESS of the frame</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Due to the sunglasses I&#x27;m wearing\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> These are not the sturdiest glasses (as you might have read in other reviews), but they do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Other than that problem</li>
            <li> may buy another pair if I see them again at CVS, but I&#x27;m using some other brands and a metal frame pair</li>
            <li> I have other pairs of these glasses</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but it&#x27;s true for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the clarity of the lenses in these so-called &amp;#34;cheap sunglasses&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The only weak point is that the frames are a bit fragile.  </li>
            <li> I still have the first pair I bought sometime ago and this one looks slightly feeble.</li>
            <li> Spots are already showing on the lenses and we are very careful with them.</li>
            <li> She was VERY careful with them, always putting them in a case when she wasn&#x27;t wearing them.</li>
            <li> My vision is still standard resolution and whats even worse is these turn everything yellow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THe frames may have gotten cheaper in plastic because all three of them broke dead center over the center of each lens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> these are very similar to my old pair of glasses that sadly broke.</li>
            <li> They are also brighter than dark sunglasses when you step indoors.</li>
            <li> They screen out the brightness and are not too dark.</li>
            <li> These are just junk, and not worth dragging home.</li>
            <li> The tint is dark amber and that is all.</li>
            <li> I really do feel like I&#x27;m seeing in HD as cheesy as that sounds.</li>
            <li> Purchased shades on 06/07/2015 wore them a few times and on day i noticed both lens had small spiderweb cracks on each lens enough to where it blurred my vision.</li>
            <li> Finally the design is not really nice</li>
            <li> they enhances the screen unlike dark shades..</li>
            <li> , no enhance clarity all they do is drop the glare down a bit to see with out squinting all the time.</li>
            <li> I wanted glasses I could put over my prescriptions, but these kept falling down.</li>
            <li> I still felt let down when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> very sharp image with them on and dont need my prescription glasses during the day even when im driving my car</li>
            <li> (seriously its just digital radio)  </li>
            <li> Also, mine broke less than a month of owning them.</li>
            <li> The three pairs I bought in 2011 all had rubber nose pads and slightly modified</li>
            <li> I purchased two pairs of BlueBlocker sunglasses with the black nylon frames (aviator style) for $25.00.</li>
            <li> So far they have not cracked or broken in any way (in about a month of almost everyday use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a previous pair and they broke.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t think I would get black -</li>
            <li> I got brown and black before.</li>
            <li> so it does help your eyes on sunny days but as a previous reviewer has indicated.  </li>
            <li> just reserved them less then</li>
            <li> Little on the dark side</li>
            <li> but nothing so special, but not so bad for the price.</li>
            <li> The amber color seems to help a little to make me sleepy, however, I think they&#x27;re a little too dark for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I did feel the color of the lenses was a little lighter than my previous sunglasses.  </li>
            <li> , they were brand new and had only been worn for a few hours when I tossed them disgustedly into the back seat as the total garbage that they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no wonder you can find a pair for as little as about $4 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little too flamboyant for me.</li>
            <li> This is perfectly fine if I&#x27;m driving and not sweating, but really annoying if I&#x27;m moving around and</li>
            <li> I understand that these are cheap plastic sunglasses, but I what I don&#x27;t understand is how terrible this product actually is.</li>
            <li> I can see the shades of green in the putting green.</li>
            <li> I even use sunglasses during heavy rain storm under white-out conditions which help my ability to see.</li>
            <li> However, if you are one of the few who have, then you&#x27;d know that these don&#x27;t even come close.</li>
            <li> I am prone to migraines and still need to drive and function everyday.</li>
            <li> I am prone to migraines and still need to drive and function everyday.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had already unknowingly went into a busy gas station with these stripes on my noggin.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DROP THEM, THE FRAMES FREQUENTLY BREAK RENDERING THEM USELESS BECAUSE THEY CANT BE REPAIRED.</li>
            <li> They cut out harsh lights and reflections.</li>
            <li> I dont wear them, not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The view from behind these &amp;#34;spectacles&amp;#34; is simply a different color; yellowish/orange.</li>
            <li> So I can spend $21 and go a few months before I need anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the plastic frames were flimsy and cracked near the nose piece within a week of wearing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These were my everyday driving lens.</li>
            <li> As though the stickers were attached before the coating dried.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a huge problem for me, anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a huge deal to me</li>
            <li> One side is a little stiff but He Still likes to use them to drive.</li>
            <li> It only lasted about 5 weeks, just enough for the return window to expire.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and weak frame broke, very poor quality.</li>
            <li> If you try, you&#x27;re bound before long to lose one or the other of those expensive items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic above the lens is very thin, like 32nd on an inch or less.</li>
            <li> The sides are a little low thus creating a blind spot.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;were sized for a small child....</li>
            <li> If you have a small head, go for it.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be bothered by glare with this product under ordinary circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very poorly made, flimsy plastic, and the lenses are not even the same!</li>
            <li> After about 1 month they snapped in half!!</li>
            <li> Find it extremely riduculous and frustrating</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably just not very sturdy sunglasses, but I don&#x27;t consider that too bad of a thing because they&#x27;re only $10.</li>
            <li> I mean there are less then 5 bucks !!</li>
            <li> I can hardly see anything when I wear the glasses at night.</li>
            <li> I did not like the 4 way folding as it was hard to just tuck them into your shirt or slide them up onto your head.  </li>
            <li> When wore at night, it darkens the environment a lot which makes it really hard to see correctly and drive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see well at night inside the house with sunglasses on.</li>
            <li> I leave them on the dash board of my vehicle and one day I picked them up and heard a little snap and saw the frame had broken.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe people when they give negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I have purchased TWO pair of the  1.50 power, and I used both pairs for at least a week.</li>
            <li> We all know that sitting in front of a computer for too long can mess with your eyes, but with HD Vision shades it&#x27;s not so bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the heck the HD part is supposed to mean.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really a bad point for me because I&#x27;m not usually rough with my glasses and always have some sort of case</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re called HD Vision Ultra Sunglasses, but I seriously feel like they go beyond HD and give me ultravision.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought the glasses, but the ad for them on TV is positively ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> too bad it was outside the return period.</li>
            <li> They are definitely not as good as a pair of polarized sun glasses I bought at Walmart for 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have Foster grants, Ray bans, an expensive pair of  Pradas..  and these have basically become my  everyday  </li>
            <li> This sucks!</li>
            <li> and it was very hard to see through it</li>
            <li> What I noticed is that after wearing these all day on a sunny day, my eyes, were tired and sore.</li>
            <li> I like how they look, but they were broken within a week.  </li>
            <li> At this price, I can lose or leave behind a pair of these glasses and not get upset.</li>
            <li> The frame, amber lenses and quality is not great and style is out the window.</li>
            <li> I had a pair that had broken and</li>
            <li> Broken sunglasses</li>
            <li> Looking everything in a yellow tone gets really annoying after a while.  </li>
            <li> The fact is however that polarization is really unnecessary except for activities like water sports.</li>
            <li> Im taking one of the broken pairs to my eye doctor to see if they can match the color in a prescription version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I am not Happy with the glasses, I am they work well for what I want it to do......</li>
            <li> and I like that the frames are not too thick to cause blind spots .</li>
            <li> The wrap around design keeps wind and debris from contact with your eyes while not having the foam that in my opinion make other motorcycle eyewear ugly .</li>
            <li> Usually buy 2-3 pairs at a time, as I am bad for leaving sunglasses here and there.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered them and instead got the stupid looking wraparound ones with little lenses on the side too.</li>
            <li> The expensive glasses I have purchased I end up sitting on or loseing them.....</li>
            <li> I am sorry to add that after two months of varied use the frame split over the lens and then the plastic lens split.</li>
            <li> I use them at work 8 hours a day and they never feel uncomfortable or fall off my nose when I bend over to pick things up.</li>
            <li> Things looked weird.  </li>
            <li> so I refuse to buy expensive ones anymore.  </li>
            <li> THEY ATE ALMOST USELESS TO ME</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wrong for this company to send out a product that isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s shown in the picture at all.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all!</li>
            <li> These glasses are silly.</li>
            <li> these are useless to me.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want an expensive pair to lose or break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> because, well, they aren&#x27;t expensive.  </li>
            <li> seller shipped me the wrong pair to start with, but I emailed them about it and they immediately shipped me the correct pair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel sorry for it.</li>
            <li> Cuts glare without cutting colors or brightness.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that one day I will no longer find them anywhere and then</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, this product is worthless, useless, and has no purpose in this world.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to evaluate the product when I never recieved it.  </li>
            <li> These sunglasses are not too bad for the price...</li>
            <li> even in bad winter  </li>
            <li> Probably my bad.</li>
            <li> Upon putting on these glasses, I was majorly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received these sunglasses and completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> disappointed, not recommend anyone, and I can not get help</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Worthless glasses.  </li>
            <li> They are completely worthless, not blocking the night</li>
            <li> I think these glasses are crap.  </li>
            <li> If anyone&#x27;s vision, represented by the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shot, is THAT bad even with their prescription glasses on, they have no business driving on the highway, either in the daytime OR night time!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My mom is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality ,splitting ans crackling inside the lens.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever bought in life.  </li>
            <li> The worst thing I&#x27;ve purchased from Eyeware.</li>
            <li> The glare gives me an awful headache and since getting these sunglasses, NO HEADACHES!</li>
            <li> This was a terrible product, it doesn&#x27;t even do what it was made to do, AT ALL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They were scratched and the coating was peeling off</li>
            <li> I bought them because I was five bucks away from free shipping ... So they were free!  I didn&#x27;t expect much, but they are quite nice.  I wear them mostly on my motorcycle, and like the way things look through them :-)</li>
            <li> I love the lenses but after wearing the HDs three times, the frames around the lenses broke, rendering the sunglasses useless.</li>
            <li> The expensive glasses I have purchased I end up sitting on or loseing them.....so I get these and for some reason I dont sit on them or lose them....so they are worth it. Dont forget they are cheap, so be careful with them.</li>
            <li> Fits well and the veiw is more clear and colors are better.</li>
            <li> Very nice Sunglasses, planing to order more for my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;SSV</li>
            <li> The first day after I got these glasses, I was in a foursome playing golf, I dropped them on the green and one of the guys picked them up and looked through them.  Then it was, &amp;#34;let me see&amp;#34; by everyone else.  A few days later I sold them to one of my foursome because I prefer those with bifocals. Now my friend is using them for his motorcycle glasses.  Go HD vision</li>
            <li> Great sunglasses !! Cuts glare without cutting colors or brightness. The fit is great not too tight or too loose. Love them, highly recomend.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s all the hype? They weren&#x27;t all that &#x27;ultra\\&quot;  --as in it didn&#x27;t provide the clear, crisp vision they claim in their ads. It&#x27;s worth about $5 if you ask me. Save your money and buy some nice glasses and not this cheap, plastic pair.</li>
            <li> does not look like the picture and does nothing for \\&quot;hd vision\\&quot;... a friend of mine has the real pair so that is what prompted me to get these but after opening the package upon delivery I noticed it was nothing close to what the product looks like in the package... STILL WAITING FOR MY MONEY BACK.... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> With this glasses everything looks clearer and you can feel the UV protection they give to your eyes.  I really liked them.</li>
            <li> I bought this glasses because I liked the way they helped my eyes, even in bright light. The problem is, when I clean them I have to be so careful because they just pop from the top. I have bought about 4 pairs and 2 of those have broken from the top. They also scratch very easily, I have to use them and try to see around the scratch until I get a better pair of sunglasses.</li>
            <li> The glasses are nice and lite, comfortable to wear in the sun, plus that there it no glare if you wear them inside or out..BUT THEY BREAK EASY..</li>
            <li> Very good product and they actually works with rain and very bright areas while driving.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat the effectiveness of these. I can hardly believe people when they give negative reviews. People always find something to complain about.  Driving at night is really a pleasant surprise when using the Ultra HD&#x27;S. I bought two pair, one for the car and one for the boat. If you feel that paying more gives you better protection, go ahead. I have tried quite a few different kinds and these are one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Beran-Pittsburgh</li>
            <li> I purchased these glasses and they are absolutely the most awesome  glasses I have ever worn !! They are light, nice tint , I don&#x27;t know why everyone  don&#x27;t own a pair of these, they are wonderful , I purchased two  pair of them as I don&#x27;t want to ever be without them. My sister has a pair of them also and she told me about them ,she loves hers too. You can get more expensive ones but I  don&#x27;t think that you would like tham  any better .They are just great for anyone and one size fits all. Thanks so much !!!! ONE SCORPION</li>
            <li> These are the same blublockers from the late 80&#x27;s being sold under a different name.</li>
            <li> There is nothing remotely HD about these glasses.  It&#x27;s all BS marketing.  Don&#x27;t buy them.  If you have them, throw them on the ground, stomp on them, drive your car on top of them, and then set them on fire.  There are better looking sunglasses that cost less and don&#x27;t trick you into buying them with BS marketing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are really HD but they are excellent glasses. Having recently had cataract surgery I have to be especially careful in wearing sunglasses outside all the time. I am pleased with the great results in the sun &amp; on cloudy days when wearing these inexpensive glasses. I recommend them fully!   I am sorry to add that after two months of varied use the frame split over the lens and then the plastic lens split. Save your money and buy a better brand. Yes, they are cheap and cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Why is it that we have reached a point were we will only believe the truth wrapped up in lies?  HD radio? (seriously its just digital radio)  HD sun glasses?  These sun glasses will not let you see in HD vision for the simple fact that your eyeballs already see in HD...so anything you put over them (except those who wear prescription lens/contact) will have the effect of blocking your eyes natural HD vision.  Remember \\&quot;Blue blockers\\&quot;? they blocked out blue light, well these appear to attenuate most \\&quot;yellow light\\&quot; (for a good example try looking at traffic lights while wearing them you will notice the green light looks bluish aka green - yellow &#x3D; blue) attenuating certain kinds of yellow light reduces squinting thus reducing eye strain/fatigue.  Of course everything will have a light yellowish tint to it, (the brighter the yellow sun light the less the yellowish effect).  consequently the effect is opposite from the commercial lol    These work as they are intended to...well minus the HD vision BS.    Not the best \\&quot;looking\\&quot; sun glasses i have ever owned but certainly the most functional ones.</li>
            <li> the image is crisp and good but the frame is way too large. Is it a one size fit all concept you got? I would have liked a smallet frame to fit my face</li>
            <li> These glasses do not fit over my prescription glasses like the last pair I owned. They got smaller.</li>
            <li> Well they are alright but nothing so special, but not so bad for the price. All in all I would say they are a good buy.</li>
            <li> For one thing, by no mean will these ever be HD vision, i don even know why they even compare it to HD TVs the person who boast this claim should be slap and hung.  All these sun glasses do is reduce glare, you will not see clearer colors, like as you would see on a HD tv, what you would see is different yellow tints that all.  there what you would call driving glasses. only reason i bought them was cause my eyes are sensitive to certain amount of light so i just put them cause i could&#x27;nt find decent anti glare glasses around my way, these should be worth 5$ but ended up paying 14$.  again there no HD vision, NO Enhance color, no enhance clarity all they do is drop the glare down a bit to see with out squinting all the time.</li>
            <li> love them, I wish the stores still carried these</li>
            <li> Boy I was took again.  All these glasses do is turn everything yellow.  Not clearier and brighter like advertised.</li>
            <li> Great for motorcycle riding!!</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I did not purchase these from Amazon.  However, we are still talking about the same product.  The clarity of sight is wonderful, makes an ordinary day look brighter and more detailed.  Pretty interesting on cloudy days as well, but not recommended on rainy days, snowy days, foggy days or in the dark.  They&#x27;re pretty effective in well lit rooms too, and yes, your eyes can be seen through these shades when you are in close quarters with other people.  So if you&#x27;re looking to hide your eyes, these will not work for you.  Everything looks as if it&#x27;s orange or gold, depending on how bright of a day it is.  These are not for wide-headed individuals.  My head isn&#x27;t even that wide, but if I wear these glasses for an extended amount of time, I will notice some soreness behind and near the ears from the squeezing, but if you have long hair this should not be a problem for you.  They are lightweight, but the plastic frame does appear to be cheap.  I feel like one false move could crack the frame, or like I&#x27;ll end up breaking a piece off from applying light to medium pressure.  For the most part, I can&#x27;t complain too much.  After all, they were only $10 and that&#x27;s a pretty good deal for what you get.  It makes everything around you look different (luminous and rich while protecting your eyes from UV rays) and not dark like regular sun shades.  I&#x27;d also like to mention that these shades work good for people who have to spend hours in front of computer screens like me.  We all know that sitting in front of a computer for too long can mess with your eyes, but with HD Vision shades it&#x27;s not so bad.  I say give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have has the other HD Vision wrap around sun glasses that fit over my street glasses and they are perfect for lousey dark cloudy days because when I wear them everything looks brighter and clearer. So I bought this style to wear for good looks when I have my contacts in. They are gradient(dark on top lighter on the lower portion)so you can wear in the sun, read or drive at night with them to cut glare from on coming head lights. They fit well around my head and the lenses are strong and scratch resistant. Can&#x27;t beat the price or quality here.</li>
            <li> I have purchased TWO pair of the  1.50 power, and I used both pairs for at least a week. I used a lanyard for security and convenience just like any other pair of prescription glass or sunglass wearer might do.  Both times after normal use tug of the lanyard, to pull the shades around to place them on my face, THE FRAME snapped at the top holding the lense.  The lense fell out and due to the THINNESS of the frame (insert CHEAPER than necessary even for cheap sunglasses), even glue was not a viable option.  Go head and avoid the ASOTv specials and move on the NEXT pair of cheap sunglass readers.  IF they were NOT so fragile, they would have more than met my needs.</li>
            <li> I can see the shades of green in the putting green. I can tell when going against the grain. I am glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done for being so cheaped, of course its cheaply made too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes to the light &amp; these help a lot!  Everything is much sharper and they fit well too.  I feel I got my moneys worth.  I may even buy a couple more just to have around.</li>
            <li> These are great for a second of third pair of sunglasses. I think they look good but understand that they are not super dark shades (people can see your eyes). I wear them with earth-tones for the most part. I get lots of compliments on them and they actually work wonders for my Ps3 games too. Who knew you could get this much out of 10 bux?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest... these are cheaply made sunglasses.  That being said, they do what you want sunglasses to do and that is to reduce the bright light so you can see.  I drive for a living in a high action type job and tend to go through sunglasses quickly.  I either sit on them or they fall on the asphalt and get smashed.  Because of this I try to never pay more than $15 for a pair of sunglasses.  If it makes you feel better to pay $100 for sunglasses, or if you just don&#x27;t like the styling, then buy all means by something else.  If you want a good inexpensive pair of sunglasses then these will work just fine.</li>
            <li> My vision is still standard resolution and whats even worse is these turn everything yellow.</li>
            <li> glasses were broken---inside corrugated box</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about appearance Protecting my eyes and improving my ability to see is the goal.  These sunglasses do just that.  I expect them to break and generally buy 2 pairs.  That way I have a backup on hand.  Each pair lasts about 6 months and I am not careful with them. They do exactly what I want them to do.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair of these sunglasses from the as seen on tv section of a local Walgreens.  I love the glasses.  I lost my pair so I decided to buy another pair off of amazon.com.  Just opened my package about 20 minutes ago and there was not a pair of sunglasses in the box.  Have been trying to get this figured out but every number I call and every website I go to are zero help.  Find it extremely riduculous and frustrating that I order a product and only receive the box they come in.  I have told many many people about these glasses and how much I like them and I really wish I could take that all back.</li>
            <li> I love these. I use these for powered paragliding. They fit my face well. Don&#x27;t fall off. Keep the wind and dirt off my contact lenses. And do a great job of highlighting the sky and country side. I know they aren&#x27;t super durable, but I&#x27;ve had pairs last all summer as long as I don&#x27;t step on them. For the price, I can&#x27;t find a better pair of sunglasses for ppg.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and flimsy plastic frames. While the first impression of the lenses was positive because of the great clarity and acuity, the coating on the lenses scratches way too easily leaving them pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for me but I wear strong prescription glasses so it was not for me. I wanted glasses I could put over my prescriptions, but these kept falling down. I gave them to my husband who loves them. The product does what it says. I ordered a different type that I can put over my prescriptions. It hasn&#x27;t arrived yet. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical. Hmmm... HD Vision ? What a bunch of marketing BS. They look like AmberVision to me. Then I saw them on sale for $9.99 and I tried them on. They are light, comfortable, they look good. I use them at work 8 hours a day and they never feel uncomfortable or fall off my nose when I bend over to pick things up. The world looks amazing and bright and I do not squint in the sun. They are also brighter than dark sunglasses when you step indoors. The HD claim might be bogus, but the functionality and price are the real deal. I went back and purchased two more just in case they get discontinued. Buy a couple pairs for yourself and buy your old lady some Ray Bans with the savings. (Make sure you are getting the normal \\&quot;surfer style\\&quot; ones. Not the \\&quot;old man\\&quot; wrap arounds with the side windows). Unless you are into that :)</li>
            <li> Good price and the product was as described. I received the item in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping these were half as good as they claim. Well, they weren&#x27;t. Let me explain why. When you first get them out of the package, the first thing you notice is how cheap they are made. The plastic is so light and cheap, you feel like you can break them just by looking at them funny. That&#x27;s not my main beef. The point of sunglasses is to reduce eye fatigue and help you see better on sunny days. While these glasses are clear and on a dark and gloomy day can actually brighten your view, they don&#x27;t reduce eye fatigue. What I noticed is that after wearing these all day on a sunny day, my eyes, were tired and sore. You get sun fatigue as if you didn&#x27;t have any sunglasses on. And it kinda tricks you because everything does seem clear in a way with the glasses on. I stopped using them and went back to a regular pair of sunglasses because these were wearing me out.  Also, mine broke less than a month of owning them. They are made so cheap that you need to handle them with kid gloves. I would have paid $20 or $30 if they actually would have made them more durable and could have added the clarity and something that blocks the effects of sun fatigue.  I can&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> I bought these expecting something more like the hd vision glasses as seen on tv.  I have some of those but they are too big.  That is not what they were.  Probably my mistake.</li>
            <li> este articulo es bueno mejora la vision es practico es bonito y no es muy costoso es un buen producto</li>
            <li> They work great, fit great and are well made. Not sure what other people are talking about (cheaply made??). I&#x27;ve been wearing BlueBlockers for years but can&#x27;t find them anymore so I was happy to find something similar. These work just as well for 1/3 the price. They reduce glare and everything is very clear, not dark like most sunglasses. I have very light sensitive eyes &amp; cataracts, these are the only kind of glasses that work for me.</li>
            <li> I know these are not the most expensive glasses but I don&#x27;t care as long as they do the job!! I don&#x27;t feel like I have to impress people with high dollar sunglasses, I want to see better and protect my eyes.  I love them so much that I feel frustrated when I forget them and have to wear my \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sunglasses. I drive a lot and LOVE them.  I am gonna order more so my wife &amp; I each have a pair in each car.  My wife uses a power wheelchair at times and accidently ran over hers but popped the lense back in and is still wearing them!</li>
            <li> I really like to HD vision Sunglasses because I like the amber lens, but the last 4 pair I have bought keep cracking under or over the eye. I would like to know if anyone else is having that problem?</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re called HD Vision Ultra Sunglasses, but I seriously feel like they go beyond HD and give me ultravision. When I put these puppies on I can see the pixels of life. I even noticed a fourth, hidden wolf in my three wolf moon tee. That&#x27;s so ultra it hurts!</li>
            <li> product arrived timely and works ok....makes a great handburger but does not cook bacon well at all!! depends on what ur r buying the product for.</li>
            <li> Ok, hey man.  I was cruising through Walmart the other day when I spied these HD sunglasses on the shelf near the checkout stand.  I made the purchase and exited the store into the bright sunlight beneath the cobalt blue sky of planet earth.  Upon entering my vehicle I unpackaged the shades, removed the UV 400 sticker attached to the lense and placed them onto my head...  I WAS INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED TO THE PLANET MARS, MAN!  That&#x27;s right, I haven&#x27;t quite figured it out but apparently there is some type of scientific formula built into these sunglasses that opens up a kind of vortex or gateway that instantly dispatches the wearer across the solar system, landing them on the Red Planet, Mars, man!  Once I had put the sunglasses on and made the trip I was then able to explore Mars in Highly Defined detail... The sky was no longer blue like it was a moment ago on planet Earth, but had become a murky red hue, AWESOME!  I was on Mars, man!  Things looked weird.  Strange plant life, rust colored leaves on unusually large trees.  Wow!  I like, totally enjoyed my stay there and then thought I better get back to planet Earth, so I whipped off the shades and instantly (I&#x27;d like to note that the user does NOT feel any actual movement during the transportation process) was back on Terra Firma...  I put the shades on again and just as quickly I was back on Mars!  How totally cool!  These sunglasses have great potential... Perhaps you might find yourself in a jam, some guy is hollering at you or you find yourself stuck in a long line at the unemployment office... Whip out the shades, pop them onto your head and WHOOSH!  You&#x27;re instantly transported to Mars, man!  You don&#x27;t have to be stuck here on Earth if you don&#x27;t want to!  Right on, I&#x27;m like, planning more trips to Mars via these far out sunglasses!  Maybe I&#x27;ll run into a fellow traveler or two during my visits to the Red Planet!  Perhaps we should make ourselves some shirts with a phrase, like:  \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been to Mars, man.  Due to the sunglasses I&#x27;m wearing\\&quot;  You know, that way we could easily recognize one another during our trips!  Wow, man!  I&#x27;d like to thank God for such awesome meta-physical sunglasses as these and the fact that He also gave us the planet Mars to explore!  Thanks God!

            <li> i bought some of theses glasses a while ago and they broke, my fault, and had to buy some more. this is the cheapest price found, fast shipping. thanks again!!</li>
            <li> this is a great HD Sunglasses, I bought it for the boyfriend and he is in love with it, i didnt think it would turn out tho be such a good buy for the price but it worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great product! works really well!</li>
            <li> I have had a wide variety of sunglasses from generic big box selections to brands costing hundreds of dollars. I like the tint of the HD Vision sunglasses which work to improve visibility in broad daylight to dusk. My only complaint is the fragile coating on the glasses which scratch or spiderweb easily if dropped onto paved surfaces. I&#x27;ve probably damaged three pairs, lost two and bought another three for myself and my wife. For this price, it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> If you want great quality sunglasses just keep looking.  The quality might not be there but I will take these any day for this price, color, glare and clarity.  If they only had a better set made for a motorcycle driver I would be very happy.</li>
            <li> NO ONE GETS A PERFECT 5 ALWAYS SOMETHING IS STOPING FROM A 5 GLASSES GOOD NOT GREAT HAVE HAD OTHERS&lt;br /&gt;JUST AS GOOD</li>
            <li> These are not the sturdiest glasses (as you might have read in other reviews), but they do the trick.  I am careful with them and they are great in the daytime.  Didn&#x27;t do squat to cut the night glare.  That&#x27;s OK - it&#x27;s not a huge problem for me, anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for decent, inexpensive sunglasses and can wait for delivery (which was very speedy by the way), then these are a good buy.</li>
            <li> HD VISION sunglasses ultra  these are great sunglasses! i  will always order them. they are great for day and night wear.</li>
            <li> Product does what they say it will do under adverse conditions of bright sunlight glare. I even use sunglasses during heavy rain storm under white-out conditions which help my ability to see.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of similar glasses at Dollar Tree for one buck; as far as I can tell there is little difference.  They are definitely not as good as a pair of polarized sun glasses I bought at Walmart for 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> These glasses are great. They screen out the brightness and are not too dark. How can you beat the price.</li>
            <li> Pieces of garbage. For ten bucks you get what you deserve. Got turned on to real HD by Edge and they are great. Only about $40 and the frames, unlike these cheapos, is solid. Skip on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no expert on sunglasses but these seem to block out the sun better than any other sunglasses i&#x27;ve ever had.  They also look pretty decent while wearing them.  Very easy on the eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t say you can wear these at night though like the ad seems to indicate.</li>
            <li> The virtue of these glasses is that they effectively attenuate the blue (and ultraviolet!) part of the visible spectrum.  When you put them on things don&#x27;t get darker, as with traditional sunglasses, but the sensitivity of your eyes to the &#x27;glare component&#x27; of what you see is remarkably reduced.  Just get over the supposed need to have things darker and enjoy the feeling of having your eyes relax while keeping the scene bright and clear.  These also seem to help night vision as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: These were purchased in the summertime, but have since seen service during ski season.  Again, these glasses do not provide \\&quot;broadband attenuation\\&quot;; that is, they do not make things darker.  But by blocking the actinic (UV/blue) part of the spectrum, they eliminate eye strain from glare, even on a bright day in the snow.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay $15 or $20 so that was a huge factor in this review. I paid about $8 at Bed Bath and Beyond (was $10 but I had a coupon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what I paid, it&#x27;s sort of what I expected. The plastic is thin and the feel is cheap. It almost feels fragile in your hands when you are flipping the arms open. This wasn&#x27;t really a bad point for me because I&#x27;m not usually rough with my glasses and always have some sort of case handy. I actually thought it was nice that these glasses were lighter than most. I was also drawn to these glasses because they looked sleeker and more stylish than some other ones I&#x27;ve seen. Not too trendy, not too old fashioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lenses looked decent. The front of the lenses are a deep amber yellow color and the flip side of the lenses have a pretty neat purplish/blue metallic coating on them. The lenses actually look well made..and if it weren&#x27;t for the cheap frame, it could pass for an expensive pair. Also no one has mentioned yet but the inside of the frame where it sits on the bridge of the nose actually has two rubber pads for comfort. I thought that was a nice touch especially for people like me who don&#x27;t have a high enough bridge to wear a lot of other sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the good stuff. I absolutely agree with the other reviews...Upon putting on these glasses, I was majorly disappointed. The average person who&#x27;s never tried on a pair of REAL \\&quot;HD\\&quot; sunglasses would probably never know the difference. However, if you are one of the few who have, then you&#x27;d know that these don&#x27;t even come close. I&#x27;ve tried the original Blublockers many years ago and they literally made everything \\&quot;pop\\&quot; when you put them on. They made everything stand out...almost 3 dimensional. Same with Ray-Bans. When you put them on and walked outside, you really do say, \\&quot;wow!\\&quot;. I put these so called \\&quot;HD\\&quot; vision sunglasses on and it&#x27;s like everything is just as flat as it was before I put them on. Really disappointing and now I&#x27;m thinking about getting the original Blublockers or something similar because that was what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a good note they do work in blocking out glare..that&#x27;s the only fact. I am prone to migraines and still need to drive and function everyday. My light sensitivity is actually not bad when the skies are blue and sunny. The real sensitivity to light comes when it&#x27;s overcast or foggy..it&#x27;s almost like staring at a lightsource reflected over a white sheet of paper. These glasses really help to block out the glare while still keeping everything else bright and in focus. Dark sunglasses just darken everything making it just that much more difficult to focus my eyes (even adding more strain) when I have a migraine. These glasses are also great for sunrise and sunset when the sun is just blinding...pretty effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the glasses 3 stars for somewhat doing what it says, for the pretty good quality overall in the craftsmanship (lenses fit in frame perfectly, arms fold in/and out smoothly, no imperfections in plastic frame, no scratches on plastic or lenses right out of box, etc.) and also for the sleek style. No stars for the cheap feeling plastic material though. Even if the glasses did not perform at all, I&#x27;d still consider them an OK buy for $7-$8 like the usual fashion glasses out there. Alternatively, you can save your money and use it towards an actual pair of sunglasses that can really give you the anti-glare and \\&quot;HD\\&quot; like vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A word of caution for those who are considering wearing these at night.... If you plan to do city driving these will likely be fine since there are plenty of street lights around and there aren&#x27;t a lot of surprises in your path. I don&#x27;t think these will work very well in any other situation because the slight tint makes surrounding areas even darker than if you were to look with the naked eye.lublockers or something similar because that was what I was looking for.

            <li> These sunglasses are not too bad for the price... The spring loaded temples are a nice feature and they do seem to make everything crisp and clear.. They are not the best sunglasses I have ever owned but for under $10 you can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
            <li> I was expecting the hd vision night glasses as advertised on tv. I can hardly see anything when I wear the glasses at night.</li>
            <li> When I first received these glasses and tried, I was really impressed.  They actually do as what the TV commercial mentioned.  They actually do bring the view into clarity and provide a crisp, clear image when you look through them.  I enjoyed having them around and wearing.  They provided so much protection from the sun UV rays with darkening the scenery.  I ordered three sets at the time, so I paid for three and got three pairs for free.  They are remarkable pair of shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downfall is that if they break, they can&#x27;t be repair, but at the price I paid, it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the way the lenses on these work, the quality of these sunglasses is VERY poor. First off, I had a pair of the black ones, and wore them for several hours while driving.  Took them off and noticed they had left two black stripes on the sides of my head where the temple pieces sat. Unfortunately I had already unknowingly went into a busy gas station with these stripes on my noggin. I wondered why so many people were smiling at me.  A few hours after that they fell off my face because the hinges that look like they are made of metal are actually just cheap plastic components that are painted a shiny silver to make them look like they are metal..... and they just sort of crumbled.  Mind you, they were brand new and had only been worn for a few hours when I tossed them disgustedly into the back seat as the total garbage that they are. You can get these same type of lenses here on Amazon made by different manufacturers that are cheaper, which I have done, because I do like this type of lense. Avoid this manufacturer though, and save your money. These are just junk, and not worth dragging home.</li>
            <li> The HD Vision Sunglasses,Ultra Are not Only Good For The Sun They Are Also Good For Night Driving There Great</li>
            <li> Very clear. Good sun blockage, yet bright view. I had a previous pair and loved them.  Great buy and price.</li>
            <li> These glasses are not bad and about what I expected for $7.  Major brand names can cost $50, $100 and even more so I was not expecting top line stuff and they are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have five dogs and glasses never last me long so I refuse to buy expensive ones anymore.  These are a little bigger than I expected but seem to sharpen everything around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $7 if they break its no big deal and I can toss them around knowing that.</li>
            <li> I already had a pair of these glasses.  I wanted a second pair for back up.      I have a cataract in my right eye.  Bright blue light will cause a fuzziness like a fogged up window.  The glasses filter out blue light and will almost cancel the effects of the cataract.      This is very helpful while driving.</li>
            <li> Purchased two; one for me and one my daughter. The frame cracked on both of them within a week. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I like how they look, but they were broken within a week.  They are made so cheap that the frame broke simply by putting them on.  I have always bought cheap sunglasses($5-10) but I will never again get HD Vision Sunglasses.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know whether to buy these since there was divergence in opinion, but opinions were mostly positive.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that these glasses are actually very good.  Not just very good for the price, which they are, but very good compared to more expensive sunglasses.  I compared them to a pair of Raybans I have had for years and they actually beat the Raybans as far as overall clarity.  No joke.  They were that good.  The only reason I am not giving them a five star is wish they were just a bit darker on the eyes--just a tad.  But these are certainly worth buying for sure since they are so reasonably priced.  Great for driving or on the golf course.</li>
            <li> These things are hard to fit .</li>
            <li> not much to say except i am satisfied with the hd glasses.</li>
            <li> Ok while they lasted. Had for two weeks and the part that holds the lens cracked open and the lens fell out. Also the screws kept wanting to come out with normal use. I always had to screw back in. What can you expect from cheap sun glasses though.</li>
            <li> these are great,second pair i bought so i have a spare,they are very comfortable and i like how evrything looks  best part is buying from amazon super to deal with if you ever have a problem they will take care of it pronto  buy from them you will never regret it.  tom.</li>
            <li> Not very well constructed. Lens frame cracked, and lens fell out after only wearing these glasses five times. Not worth the price, cheaply made</li>
            <li> These were for my son! He requested them because he hates the sun in his eyes when he drives! He likes them!!</li>
            <li> Very light and flimsy, and the glass scratched way too early, but the vision is good.</li>
            <li> I was introduced by friend to the HD glasses. I will not use anything else. I&#x27;ve purchased very high end glasses and in my opinion the HD glasses are far superior.</li>
            <li> The glasses fit very well over my prescription glasses.  I use them on a cloudy day when I play tennis and they are very helpful for filtering out the glare and make everything seem brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use them at night to cut the glare of oncoming headlights because I have astigmatism.</li>
            <li> The HD sunglasses were exactly like I had hoped they would be.  For some reason the retail stores quit selling this style and I truly missed them!  I now have three pair and treat them like gold!  One thing people need to know about these glasses is you cannot drop them and have them fall on a hard service, because I have dropped more pairs than I have fingers on one hand and every one of them broke around the glass frame.  Other than that problem these glasses are awesome!</li>
            <li> Stylish and very nice. I like them because I was in a sunny place for vacation and I didn&#x27;t once have to squint or glare while wearing them.</li>
            <li> I bought these more out of curiosity than anything, but I really did need a decent pair of driving sunglasses. (I didn&#x27;t get one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand how sellers like this can be allowed to use such misleading words to describe their merchandise in order to \\&quot;con\\&quot; people into buying them. There is no such thing as \\&quot;high definition\\&quot; when it comes to sunglasses. Like most cheap sunglasses, all these do is change the color and slightly dim the light that gets through to your eyes by wearing them. The color of the lenses is such that they will give you a little different look at things, by coloring the world yellow. And now that the novelty is over, I&#x27;ll probably throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are cheaply made, feel like they would scratch easily (although I haven&#x27;t tried to scratch mine to test this), and I don&#x27;t really expect anything long term out of these. It&#x27;s no wonder you can find a pair for as little as about $4 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They deserve one star because there&#x27;s no option for no stars. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Nice, cheap glasses-I have 2 pair, one for me-one stolen by my husband.  They fit well with full coverage.  Easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I love these sun glasses. We use them exclusivly&lt;br /&gt;for our business as well as personal use. For the price there are nothing better</li>
            <li> I have been buying these glasses for about five years and they are ok they are cheap but in the long run they are much better  bargain... Over the high priced sunglasses...</li>
            <li> Sunglasses are disposable to me, so I don&#x27;t ask for a lot.  I appreciate the spring hinges on these so that they are not as prone to breakage.  I like the tint and they fit well.  I would order them again.</li>
            <li> I found a pair of these in the pocket of saddle bags on my motorcycle after I bought it !! Tried them out and love them !! When they broke I went looking for new ones !!! people talk about them breaking easy but they have held up well for me and I have them on all the time either over my eyes or pushed up on my head !! The pair I found lasted me 7 or 8 months used I have had this new pair for a couple of months now with no problems so far !!! I ordered 2 pairs since there so cheap I mean there are less then 5 bucks !! Buy a back up pair !!!! Im not gentle with mine they get dropped and bashed and tossed around with out a thought but they are plastic so they wont last forever !!!</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this ZERO stars! Put them on and they make absolutely NO difference to what you see - doesn&#x27;t at all do anything it advertises on the box - nothing is any more clear. I don&#x27;t even know if these would work for a good cheap pair of sunglasses if you didn&#x27;t already have some - wouldn&#x27;t make things much less bright and glaring :(</li>
            <li> modern design, lightweight,reduces glare, enhances color and clarity&lt;br /&gt;as advertised, great value for price paid, very satisfied, recommend this product.</li>
            <li> value for the dollar was there. bought many glasses that were much more expensive and found these to be the best</li>
            <li> Paid too much for this product.  Spots are already showing on the lenses and we are very careful with them.</li>
            <li> I have had many different kinds of traditional sunglasses but these HD Sunglasses are the BEST!!!  This is my fourth pair because my family members always seem to try them and find a way to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; them eventually.  They shield your eyes from the sun, but also enhance the clarity of your eyesight.  I love them.  I only wish I could find the traditional ones ( not the fold-aways) again.  Until then, when the sun comes out, I&#x27;m in my HD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These glasses are regular sunglasses with a hue tint. Nothing is high definition about them. The tint is dark amber and that is all. Nothing HD about them</li>
            <li> I used to buy these from Walgreens, but they no longer carry this style.  At this price, I can lose or leave behind a pair of these glasses and not get upset.</li>
            <li> My original pair I got back in 2006 or 2007 and there were no nose pads that sat acroos the bridge of your nose. The three pairs I bought in 2011 all had rubber nose pads and slightly modified frames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe frames may have gotten cheaper in plastic because all three of them broke dead center over the center of each lens.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find them at CVS Drug Store nolonger, I think they dropped them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for the nose pads. It felt better with the bare plastic resting on my nose. The rubber soak up sweat and disintegrates over time. They were great for driving in sunlight or cloudy days which seemed brighter with  the glasses on. Vision was great. I never had any issues with spotting or scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the frames broke over the center of the lenses, one broke when one hit the ground at a 2&#x27; drop. Another frame broke when the camera swung around my side and hit the glasses that were tucked in my belt. A few minutes later I saw a lens on the ground. Another one broke in the storage  console on the car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic above the lens is very thin, like 32nd on an inch or less. Too think in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may buy another pair if I see them again at CVS, but I&#x27;m using some other brands and a metal frame pair I&#x27;ve had almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> I just received these sunglasses and completely disappointed.  The frame is cheap plastic with no adjustment.  If you have one ear a little higher than the other, you&#x27;ll have to live with the sunglasses sitting tilted on your face.  One of the lenses has three 1/4 - 1/2 inch scratches.  I was trying to clean a blur from the left side and found the scratches after tilting the lense up and down in the light.  For our $, surely there are better choices.  &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; strikes again.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality ,splitting ans crackling inside the lens.</li>
            <li> Always provide what I need for any weather condition. I didn&#x27;t think I was going to ever find these again after my last pair broke. I can always count on Amazon. Nice price too.</li>
            <li> These glasses are amazing... I really do feel like I&#x27;m seeing in HD as cheesy as that sounds. But I wear them all the time. And I really love driving with them on, especially at night!</li>
            <li> It is a real pleasure to wear these sunglasses.  They protect my eyes while I am driving under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected Kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> i will buy again. this is the second time i purchase this item, 2 of each on eacn purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 pairs of these sun glasses from rite aid a couple of years ago.  The plastic frame starts to degrade and break easily.  These HD vision sunglasses will not last you long!  What a rip off!</li>
            <li> The picture shows the regular sunglasses. I received the folding ones. This is not a huge deal to me but I would not have ordered the folding ones.</li>
            <li> Are these real?  I though I had lost a pair of HD Vision I bought at Wal-Mart, only to find them a day later.  When I received these glasses, I found that these are smaller and stiffer than the HD Vision.  Also, these glasses do not have the HD Vision label on the frame.</li>
            <li> The frames broke the third time I put them on! I had a pair before and loved them, so I assume something has changed in the materials</li>
            <li> Over the last seventy decades or so, I have had countless pairs of sunglasses to protect my 20/20 blue eyes, and the HD are more than adequate to filter those bright Arizona rays. I keep a pair open on the den bar ready to wear for every time I leave the house. I won&#x27;t be out in the sun without them, and the shape on the sides really helps block the side glare. Very light and comfortable for any length of time wearing them.</li>
            <li> these are ok the only thing is that it&#x27;s a bit harder to see green lights as it filters out the blue in the green...</li>
            <li> Good fit and just what I was looking for. They block the sun&#x27;s rays and makes your visual acuity clearer.</li>
            <li> Shoddy build quality but pretty cool looking for the shape of my face/hair and I love the warm, crisp color and light they give the world when looking through them.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ride a motorcycle and they are a great all around day/night pair of glasses.  just be careful - they&#x27;re brittle.</li>
            <li> These things are advertised to make the world clearer.  They are no more special than most other sunglasses.  And today, my second pair broke while trying to clean them. Cheap plastic.  Though they were not expensive, I expected more durability.  I simply wore them everyday without abusing them.  As someone else said in another review, they look like they are toy sunglasses when you first see them.&lt;br /&gt;Will not be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> First seen these last year on a late night infomercial...i was like eh...  then i saw these in person..and tried a pair on..i was surprised..at how  crisp and clear everything was....everything POPS!  bright and vibrant..  even in bright sun or cloudy days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ive had a pair of these for a year and proud to say they still hold up and are looking great..even in bad winter  when the snow reflects everything...these are  awesome..  ive bought a few more pairs to keep on hand  just in case...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the frames are stylish  and are a  bit thin in some areas but for me its NOT  an issue.  they fit snugly on the nose and they dont slip...and they look  great..whats not to like?  ive seen glasses like these in high end stores that are almost identicle  and they are way up there!  save some cash and get these..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have Foster grants, Ray bans, an expensive pair of  Pradas..  and these have basically become my  everyday  pair.... they also help if you have migranes..bottom line  dont knock  them until you try them..&lt;br /&gt; these are worth checking out... and the price is right!</li>
            <li> but i dont have the return info  and  they arent worth the postage to return.  so i am stuck with them</li>
            <li> very sharp image with them on and dont need my prescription glasses during the day even when im driving my car</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t l last to long without breaking,I&#x27;m on my fourth pair and i only use them for my afternoon walk and they still snap,the reason i keep buying them is the view they give you is awesome but I&#x27;m gonna have to buy something else because the frame&#x27;s are just garbage on these things.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! The car clip that comes with them is a nice touch. Received this product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t under estimate this brand.  Although from the look of this product you might think it will not work it actually blocks the sun really well.</li>
            <li> cheap, HD, work great, great for summer, great for skiing in the winter, all around versatile, good cheap buy, a definite recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had good luck buying sunglasses online but these glasses were an exception...I usually keep a few pair of glasses around, these are my favorite.  If I loose these, as I often do, I would replace them with the same.</li>
            <li> I have other pairs of these glasses and I like the way they reduce strain on eyes without darkening everything so you can&#x27;t see clearly indoors.  These arrived with scratched lenses</li>
            <li> I did not receive the pictured item (regular sunglasses), but the wrap around style. They were for my teenage son and the wrap around style were way too wide, big and loose for him. The company DID issue an immediate refund and promised to send the correct sunglasses as soon as they have them in stock.</li>
            <li> Lenses are extemely clear and make it so your eyes don&#x27;t have to work so hard. They are too wide, though, and do not stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I have two pair of HD Sunglasses which are rather large. So I bought this pair as they are smaller and easier to carry in my shirt pocket. Great glasses, make the images much clearer then regular sunglasses.</li>
            <li> my favorite sunglasses  double order never want to go without  only complaint frame could be a little stronger but I am a bit clutsy</li>
            <li> great looking shades.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE FINE BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE THE HD READERS WHICH I WANTED. THEY ATE ALMOST USELESS TO ME BUT I DIDN&#x27;T RETURN THEM. I&#x27;VE HAD A LOT OF THESE. IF YOU DROP THEM, THE FRAMES FREQUENTLY BREAK RENDERING THEM USELESS BECAUSE THEY CANT BE REPAIRED.</li>
            <li> I ordered two pair of sunglasses. One has a defect on a lens making it cloudy and unusable.</li>
            <li> the product is good for the money. does a good job at blocking the Sun but not high definition in my opinion</li>
            <li> I love my HD VISION SUNGLASSES every day is bright and clear in my eyes it block the sun glare.</li>
            <li> Great glasses for seeing things differently. I would not suggest wearing them while driving. The sides are a little low thus creating a blind spot. Otherwise enjoy the picture</li>
            <li> I am so easy on things and there was no reason for the frame to break around one lens.&lt;br /&gt;Had the Glasses about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Just received the item, I love them. Now I have to find a hard case for the glasses to protect them :)</li>
            <li> I am very picky with the clarity of my sunglass lenses. Believe me, I have owned Persol, Ray Ban, etc. which were both well over $150 and am embarrassed to say that their lenses were not this clear. Call me crazy, but it&#x27;s true for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe the clarity of the lenses in these so-called &amp;#34;cheap sunglasses&amp;#34;. The frame, amber lenses and quality is not great and style is out the window. The shape is downright unattractive, but I forgo all that to see super clear when I am driving in my car or walking around in bright sun. These lenses cut all the glare and give me super sharp clarity. I have owned 4 of these as they are sort of disposable and yet I keep coming back to these sunglasses.  I am afraid that one day I will no longer find them anywhere and then what? I recommend these if you want clarity and no glare. Style is not #1 here, function is.  So there. Get one for yourself and enjoy! No I am not related to anyone in the company that makes these sunglasses, just a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I received a pair of night vision wrap around glasses instead of what I wanted!  There is no paper work, packing slip, nothing.  I have no idea how to get what I want.  I was very excited about buying these glasses and hoping to purchase more items, this being my first amazon buying experience is not good.  I believe it will be my last.  This sucks!</li>
            <li> I purchased these HD sunglasses from seller on Amazon.com.  The price was minimal. When I received these HD sunglasses, they&lt;br /&gt;were sized for a small child....not what an adult would wear. I will never again buy any sunglasses from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The last great buy on sunglasses was approximately 15 years ago when BlueBlocker sunglasses were running their TV adds. I purchased two pairs of BlueBlocker sunglasses with the black nylon frames (aviator style) for $25.00. I am still using the 2nd pair of my BlueBlockers; the first pair I lost.</li>
            <li> I bought four pairs of HDVision sunglasses. I like them, very light and works fine.&lt;br /&gt;However, two of them broke at above the frame (thinner section) near bridge, without falling or any accident! The lenses are good but the frame seems too fragile? This cost one star.[[ASIN:B002V04OKO HD Vision Sunglasses, Ultra]]</li>
            <li> These  are  cheap  but  very  good  glasses  ,  everything  looks  crisp and  bright !  i  recomment these  if  you  don&#x27;t  want  to  spend  alot  on  sunglasses !</li>
            <li> Love em. I will buy multiple pairs of these just in case I lose or break them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three more words</li>
            <li> IM big fan of the h-d vision,, I had a pair of the old school ones.. very nice on the eyes</li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows the standard sunglasses as seen on TV so I ordered them and instead got the stupid looking wraparound ones with little lenses on the side too. I just wanted the normal ones like it shows in the picture...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just wrong for this company to send out a product that isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s shown in the picture at all.  The ones in the picture at least have a little style to them, but instead I received the huge glasses that go over regular glasses, just like one other reviewer wrote.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works great.</li>
            <li> Loved them until they snapped in half at the nose piece within just a few months.</li>
            <li> I looked for these glasses everywhere! I&#x27;m so glad I found them here on Amazon. These glasses are the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; HD glasses, and they&#x27;re my favorite driving glasses.</li>
            <li> Glasses are very cheap, you have to be very careful with them, otherwise you will break them, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because they are the item that I wanted and ordered. I had a pair that had broken and these were the replacement, Thanks</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, if your like me and break/lose sunglasses every month, then investing in Ray-Bans or the like is probably not a viable solution. So, I went on a shopping spree for &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; sunglasses on Amazon (&amp;#60;$10), and these were one of the pairs I purchased. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect size for medium/large heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Build quality is actually not bad at all for what you pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Well-packed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The anti-glare hue is actually more orange than amber, and so a bit brighter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was looking for sun glass readers an ordered &amp;#34;Ultras&amp;#34;.  Probably my bad. I&#x27;ve bought HD visions before, however they only last about a year before they break.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work!!  Headlights still glared and did nothing to help me see better at night.  Worthless glasses.  Will give them to someone as play glasses.</li>
            <li> they work really good but will brake easy</li>
            <li> its a good hd glasses, its not as bright as previous versions which makes it a good choice for summer time. for cloudy weather i would recommend the ones with metal frame cause it makes everything look brighter and nicer.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to evaluate the product when I never recieved it.  I have tried for 3 weeks to inform you of this problem and recieved no  answers. I am finiished ordering with Amazon.</li>
            <li> These glasses used to be made very strong, but now the plastic is rather thin and breaks easily.  Plus, they scratch very easily.</li>
            <li> These sunglasses greatly reduce any glare but not your visibility, I love these glasses. Yes, they are not made of titanium steel and will break if you sit on them, but for under $10 I am willing to have them. Highly recommend these, everyone that has tried my pair loves them, and half end up buying a pair for themselves.</li>
            <li> My mother has had several eye operations and her eyes hurt during the day due to the sunlight. I purchased these glasses for her and she loves them. She doesnt have to close one eye to drive.</li>
            <li> Left lens fell out in my coat pocket this morning at church.  When I looked at the glasses to put it back in, the frame was cracked in two.  Not very good quality: these glasses are practically brand new.</li>
            <li> They are well made, and cut down glare and light everything up, most sunglasses just make everything kinda dark these are very similar to my old pair of glasses that sadly broke. Might buy another pair just in case I lose them or something...</li>
            <li> I have few pairs that I had bought from As Seen On TV and they feel a lot more substantial than the ones I just these. The lenses get spotty and it a challenge to clean them. I wish I didn&#x27;t buy so many of them, but I taught that the price was good and I&#x27;d better stock up. I will not do that again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> love the lens and they have great looks and appeal, the lens are very good would recommend these sun glasses.</li>
            <li> These glasses are great.  They can be worn on a sunny day or when the clouds are in the sky.  I had previously purchased the yellow colored glasses.  These, however, are more attractive, and I feel more dressed for the day with the Ultra&#x27;s.  For the price they are a great buy.</li>
            <li> The glasses were shipped to me ahead of schedule which was great. Packaging was solid.&lt;br /&gt;These glasses truly help during the day time. Everything is definitely clearer.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate a five but I wanted these for glare of  car lights at night. The glasses help but not as bright as others I tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;At the price point these are excellent and a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have a normal to large head and these fit well</li>
            <li> You can see really well with these glasses. They are not designer sunglasses but they work really well and they last.</li>
            <li> the frame breaks too easily, but the fit and clearity of glass is great.</li>
            <li> Purchased shades on 06/07/2015 wore them a few times and on day i noticed both lens had small spiderweb cracks on each lens enough to where it blurred my vision. i only cleaned with room temperature water. too bad it was outside the return period. my suggestion is not to buy.</li>
            <li> Great, very stylish, just too bad that i scratched them up already, but i lover them and would defieanlty get a nother pair if i could find them</li>
            <li> I was looking for the sun glasses to help me see through the glare. They are fine sunglasses and the price is fine but they did not do anything for the glare in my case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to expect from HD glasses, but in any case these are very good sunglasses at an unbelievable price!  They perform well in bright sunlight as well as in light overcast.  The frames look good and they stay put during various activities. The lenses have a yellow tint to them, but I found this easy to get used to.  No fogging issues, either, even after glasses have been in a freezing car overnight. Very happy overall.</li>
            <li> Ok, hear me out.  I bought these 3 times now, they are super cheap and kind of garbarge..... that being said, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re wondering why i gave this product 4 stars and bought it three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the answer is simple.  Golf. These are great on the course, lightweight, don&#x27;t realy care if they get scratched or you drop them and the best part, it makes spotting balls much easier.</li>
            <li> These glasses are great and really do help in both sun and rain. Sadly the manufacturer is using lesser quality materials than they did a few years ago so the glasses are not as strong and need to be handled carefully. They do sharpen vision, perhaps not for everyone but my experience was positive.</li>
            <li> Very good product I recommend</li>
            <li> I really like these HD glasses.  I have purchased HD glasses before and one of the draw backs for me was that the tint was so light that the sun still bothered me when I went out.  These have a darker tint, so you not only get the clarity of the HD glasses, but you get the shade of regular sunglasses.  I would recommend these glasses.</li>
            <li> I bought these straight from the manufacturer, not Amazon, after reading the reviews.  They are completely worthless, not blocking the night glare  at all.  Even though the company promised money-back guarantee, they charge wayyy more for shipping than the product itself, and of course don&#x27;t return the shipping.  Plus they sent a double order, again charging a huge shipping fee.  By the time I paid return shipping, it wasn&#x27;t worth the bother, and just threw them in the garbage, chalking it up to another TV con job.</li>
            <li> Great view and look. However, I had to order three times to have a pair arrive without stress cracks in the lens. The last pair that i bought for about $7 arrived undamaged, but the frame broke within a week. I&#x27;m not hard on glasses, these are just manufactured to minimum specifications.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two pairs of the HD Vision Ultra High Definition Sunglasses. My first impression was that the plastic frames seemed too light.  I put this concern aside because I really liked the performance of the lenses.The sunglasses provide a bright and clear image that is superior to any other sunglasses I have owned. Unfortunately, my concern over the quality of the frames has proven to be justified. The frames on both pairs have snapped in exactly the same place, where the frame connects to the nose bridge.As much as I liked the performance of the lenses, I will refuse to purchase any additional pairs unless I found out that the frames have been improved.</li>
            <li> These are everything they&#x27;re cracked up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I feel like they reduce glare without draining the color from the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  they fit me well and the frames&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  No, they don&#x27;t give you x-ray vision or anything, but they are&lt;br /&gt;darn good sunglasses.</li>
            <li> Perfect for summer , driving , etc.</li>
            <li> They worked fine for two days then the lens fell out. It kept falling out day after day, don&#x27;t buy these glasses.</li>
            <li> These sunglasses exceeded my expectations. Crystal clear vision at a great price. Have to be handled carefully but with care, they will last.&lt;br /&gt;JR</li>
            <li> Literally what my dad said. He liked the originals. Which I told him were the metal framed ones but He swears they were plastic framed. One side is a little stiff but He Still likes to use them to drive.</li>
            <li> It does reduces sun glare and that was the reason I got the sunglasses. So $9 was a good deal and I would not pay a cent more. Don&#x27;t expect them to magically make objects appear on HD or make objects look better. It won&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from migraines....sunlight and vehicle headlights feel like stabs on my eyes, so blocking glare helps.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful driving at night with the sunglasses, since surroundings will be darken. I live in New York, so street lights help a lot at night.</li>
            <li> These glasses did not appear to be HD glasses, nor did they have any effect on preventing glare issues. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I swear by these.  I have bought several pair because I lose them.  They are sturdy and what makes rhem unique is that the inside is polarized as opposed to the outside of the lens.  I have several other pairs because of a problem with my eyes.  Sometimes gray works, sometimes brown.  But sun, snow or rain HD always works.</li>
            <li> I love the HD glasses.  I did not like the 4 way folding as it was hard to just tuck them into your shirt or slide them up onto your head.  On top of that they broke on the middle hinge after about two months.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite sunglasses ever. When you look thorough them, the whole world seems more bright and sunny, in a perspective that you have never been exposed to before. This really does feel like it blocks out the harmful UV rays that are coming straight from the sun. You probably can&#x27;t see this from the picture and description, but where your nose would go, there are these rubber &amp;#34;comforters&amp;#34; that help keep your nose stable and in place. I will have to admit though, that they are a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34;, which is fine for me, because they match and fit my face perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would also like to note, that this is a unisex pair of glasses, that means that either a girl or boy can wear them(anyone really). I am a teenage girl who wears them almost everyday, and they look fine for me. I actually bought this pair, because my old ones(which I have used them for over 6 months)which were identical to these, cracked at the frame and the glass fell out, so I would just like to warn everyone that these are very fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have totally met my expectations and I would truly recommend them 100% and buy them for my best friend. :)</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Pure junk.  Just brown framed with brown lens.  Nothing HD to it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in perfect condition in about half of the estimated delivery time.  It was exactly as described on the website, priced reasonably, and met all expectations.......</li>
            <li> great vision, but need to keep them in a safe case to keep from getting scratched or crushed.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife so that she would have a pair for each vehicle as well as a spare.  She is very happy with them.</li>
            <li> if you want really crappy yellow glasses then these are for you!</li>
            <li> Took good care of glare.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on an impulse to take on a long road trip. At this price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I still felt let down when I opened the package. They looked like the cheap plastic toy sunglasses I used play with as a child. When I tried it on, I was engulfed in a hideous orange tinge.&lt;br /&gt; However, as I used them through the following days while driving, I found that they worked remarkably well. They cut out harsh lights and reflections. The orange &#x27;shade&#x27; has a gradient that is darker at the top and lighter at the bottom, which also works well for driving. On sunny days, it dims bright skies. Tilting the head just a bit allows you to adjust the degree of darkness for varying light situations.&lt;br /&gt; This is also the first pair of glasses I&#x27;ve found myself wearing consistently during the night, rains, fog or other bad light situations. They darken the light a little bit, but cut out harsh oncoming lights and give a clearer view. They are especially good during rainy conditions, as they cut reflections and make viewing a bit better. In both cases, they work great on highways, but you must be more careful on city streets due to poorer peripheral vision.&lt;br /&gt; At this price, they make a good pair of driving glasses. I don&#x27;t think they will work as well for general use. They stay in my car, and are used only during driving. So far they have not cracked or broken in any way (in about a month of almost everyday use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update, March 2014 ***&lt;br /&gt;Wow, can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve had these for three years now! Still working great, not broken or chipped. I have since got a second one for my other car, and they both stay in the cars.</li>
            <li> Did not like at all, pinch the nose too much.  I dont wear them, not comfortable.  I would not recommend them</li>
            <li> Love the glasses, but they scratch so easy. The clear vision is amazing. The glare from the commute can be stressful but these sunglasses virtually eliminates glare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these glasses in the past &amp; was happy to see Amazon carried them. The only issue I found with this pair was there were some fine line scratches on one of the lenses.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Just as described!</li>
            <li> Broken sunglasses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package the glasses were broken&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed, not recommend anyone, and I can not get help</li>
            <li> I love these sunglasses. They don&#x27;t make everything darker, they just take the glare off of everything. They really do make everything look sharper.&lt;br /&gt;My only complant is that glasses I received were not solid black frames, they were clear brown with leopard spots</li>
            <li> Scratched too easily, very snug fit . Broke after a week. If you have a small head, go for it. They really do improve your visual clarity.</li>
            <li> very good glasses.  They are light and don&#x27;t slip off.  They also aren&#x27;t as cheaply built as the price would lead you to believe.  I&#x27;d recommend em</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday!  they look great and they make reading labels in the grocery store so much eaiser! I will always buy these glasses</li>
            <li> I have had these before.  For the price, they do exactly what I want ... reduced glare from the sun and sharper vision.</li>
            <li> These are great inexpensive sunglasses, I&#x27;ve had several pairs of these over the past few years and they&#x27;re very comfortable, why pay a bunch of money for fancy expensive sunglasses just to loose or destroy them on the job?</li>
            <li> i have purchased several pairs of these over the years at stores with AS SEEN ON TV products and this pair unfortunately is not the same the fit differently. i have long lashes and they fit so close to my face my lashes hit when i blink plus they are so close to my forehead the glasses fog up.</li>
            <li> very good quality shipment was great</li>
            <li> The view from behind these &amp;#34;spectacles&amp;#34; is simply a different color; yellowish/orange. Not impressed at all! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s &amp;#34;HD&amp;#34; about them at all.</li>
            <li> yeah very nice what a bald making them in the Brown frame like you had before</li>
            <li> These are great. Just what I wanted. They work great for me as far as the glare. Night driving is just fine for me. I will order more when needed. And the price is right. Thank Danntte.</li>
            <li> There is no apparent improvement in the vision (no apparent HD vision with this).  Looking everything in a yellow tone gets really annoying after a while.  When wore at night, it darkens the environment a lot which makes it really hard to see correctly and drive.  Also, the tone is not constant; its darker in the top of the lens and lighter in the bottom.  Finally the design is not really nice; it looks too squared and old fachioned; and the frame is too fragile, it may break easily.</li>
            <li> A+ sunglasses. Very easy on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I would recommend it to my friends. Better then my $85 glasses.</li>
            <li> Got these three days ago.  The are very good for driving but not so for activities like golf or more mobile sports.  This is because these things aren&#x27;t made well enough to hold up to a lot of taking them off and putting them back on.  The hinge mechanism is pretty cheap and they need to be handled gingerly.  They also tend to slide right up to my face, no matter how I try to keep them on the bridge of my nose.  This is perfectly fine if I&#x27;m driving and not sweating, but really annoying if I&#x27;m moving around and sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving 4 stars because the intended purpose is for driving.  While I can&#x27;t rave about how bright and wonderful the world looks through them, they provide ample UV protection without being polarized which was what I was going for.  Polarized lenses generally block out tablet screens and these do not - which is swell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these will work fine for a reasonable time for their intended purpose, and they actually fit much better than I thought they would.  They look pretty good too, especially for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Bought 4 pairs of these this year.  My parents and my husbands parents love them!  They are not the huge kind that wrap around prescription glasses, but you could do that in a pinch.  They are great for night driving as well as day.  My mother had cataract surgery, and all light bothered her eyes, that is when I bought her first pair.  They are the kind of lenses you put on and they just \\&quot;brighten\\&quot; everything up, yet block all the suns rays that are causing us to squint!  They look nice on also, for men and women.  My in laws are golfers, they wear them on the course and also love them.  Also..The price here on Amazon, cannot be beat!  I have bought these before, never have they been this inexpensive...Great purchase!  Will be back next year for more stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Sunglasses like these are the way to go if you wear prescription glasses. Even if you&#x27;re willing to pay the big bucks for prescription sunglasses, you don&#x27;t want to fool around removing your regular glasses to don your sunglasses, and vice versa. If you try, you&#x27;re bound before long to lose one or the other of those expensive items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever sunglasses you get, amber is the color you&#x27;ll want. It really does seem to enhance your vision. Even here in sunny Southern California I have no need for greater filtering (as offered by darker colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sunglasses are described as \\&quot;anti-glare.\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure exactly what that is supposed to mean, but my guess is there&#x27;s not polarization (or the description would say so). The fact is however that polarization is really unnecessary except for activities like water sports. I don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;ll be bothered by glare with this product under ordinary circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These glasses offer UV protection. Chances are however that you won&#x27;t need that, as your regular glasses probably carry that protection.</li>
            <li> These glasses are silly. If you want sunglasses, buy sunglasses. If you don&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t wear glasses.</li>
            <li> On my 5th pair.  I end up losing them or abusing them, but for the price they are perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> The worst product ever bought in life.  Returned within 1 day.  Its for those who want to see everything in yellow color.  Thats it.  Nothing great about it.</li>
            <li> Cannot see red traffic lights, they appear yellow.  When wearing the glasses, the top light of the signal looks yellow, otherwise the gasses are helpful.</li>
            <li> Lens are awesome as the past 10 years. Makes it easier to see in rain through windshields and cost is. 1/3 of others. You will protect these.</li>
            <li> Frame material very light weight and flimsy feeling.  Pulled a sticker off of the left lens and the lens has internal fractures (I am guessing from pulling the sticker off of the lens) which makes wearing these a no go. I am working on returning them for another pair and hope there aren&#x27;t any issues with getting them replaced.  The flimsyness of the frames is not a deterant as I didn&#x27;t pay that much for them, but if you are looking for a heavier frame these are not for you. Update - I wasn&#x27;t able to obtain a replacement for the damaged glasses but was issued a return and credit. UPS picked up the package from my front porch with a return sticker and I was notified that the glasses had been received and my account was credited for the full price.</li>
            <li> I like the lenses, and the way they &#x27;shade&#x27;.  They are more of a blue blocker than just sunglasses that darken.  Wish I could find some with tougher frames, they are made from &#x27;brittle&#x27; plastic and do not last.  Just remember to adjust your expectations at this price point (I paid $7).  Usually buy 2-3 pairs at a time, as I am bad for leaving sunglasses here and there.  So I can spend $21 and go a few months before I need anymore.</li>
            <li> Liked these enough to buy several pairs.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 pairs of these nice sunglasses.  These are the type of sunglasses that fit over regular eyeglasses.  But my husband wears them on their own.  I did feel the color of the lenses was a little lighter than my previous sunglasses.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I bought these glasses in order to help me sleep at night. Amber glasses are supposed to block &#x27;&#x27;blue&amp;#34; light from cell phones, computers, &amp; TV (which block melatonin production). So by wearing the glasses about an hour before bedtime, it should help your body to produce it&#x27;s own melatonin and help you sleep better.  As far as the glasses go, they seem cheaply made, scratch easily, &amp; are a little blury to look through. They claim to enhance color and clarity-I definitely have to disagree. If anything, I&#x27;d say the opposite.  However, I will say they are comfortable and look decent on. The amber color seems to help a little to make me sleepy, however, I think they&#x27;re a little too dark for this purpose. It&#x27;s hard to see well at night inside the house with sunglasses on. It&#x27;s a good theory, but I think next time, I&#x27;d buy glasses made for the purpose of helping to block blue light to help you sleep!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting a quality pair of sunglasses but these were beyond cheap. I&#x27;ve had the HD vision sunglasses before but these aren&#x27;t even close to the ones sold on TV. They are so light they would bounce on my nose when I would walk. Junk in my opinion. Very disappointed. Returned for refund which was no problem at all.  BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> I have only one eye and was recommended to buy glasses as seen on TV to reduce glare. These glasses reduce the glare and makes driving during the day more relaxing. I just don&#x27;t care for the styling, but they do work.</li>
            <li> I love these sunglasses. I use them for running outdoors and there is absolutely no glare. They also don&#x27;t move around on your face which is perfect for running. Would recommend to anyone who is active outside with a sport and needs a good pair of sunglasses that help from having to squint.</li>
            <li> I have used these glasses for a while and they work great. Weather in a car,walking around the city or just simply ookng cool, they work just amazing. They will help alot and they do everything they say they do.</li>
            <li> bought these because of the reviews on it. These are very dark-too dark for nite driving. I dont know why the others wrote what they did but I am very upset they wrote what to me are lies about this product. these are useless to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to buy more. Great product.</li>
            <li> These glasses are perfect day or night.  They make things bright and they make everything crystal clear!!!!  Price is right!!!!</li>
            <li> These fold BTW. I must have missed that part. I must have also missed the part about their tiny sratches or seemingly disappearing, as you clean, lense coating. Trash...that&#x27;s where they are now...not worth the return process. The worst thing I&#x27;ve purchased from Eyeware.</li>
            <li> I recommend these glasses they can be worn at any time.I bought a previous pair and they broke.The plastic was very fragile.However this last pair the plastic was much more durable.yes the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have purchased HD Vision sunglasses exclusively for years... but when I went to reorder 2 more pairs from this &amp;#34;same supplier&amp;#34; they shipped me what appears to cheap knockoffs! They are very poorly made, flimsy plastic, and the lenses are not even the same! They do not have the distinct yellow HD lenses that I used to love... they are more pinkish, and barely block the sun at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are worth about .72 cents each. Do not get ripped off. Do not order these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(If anybody knows of a source to get the REAL HD Vision glasses (original style), please let me know.</li>
            <li> I think these glasses are crap.  At night, I either see white glare without the glasses or yellow glare with the glasses.  The yellow tint also makes everything so bright, that they hurt my eyes.  Also, they say to keep the glasses in a case so they won&#x27;t get scratched.  However, they&#x27;re so big there isn&#x27;t a case big enough for them.  When ordering the glasses, they told me they were charging me a dollar to send me a package offering me some kind of savings coupons.  I told them I didn&#x27;t want the package, but she said they have to send it anyway.  I told her that, if they had to send it, I would cancel the order.  Of course, they sold the glasses without the package.  I feel this is pretty much a scam!  So, save your money for something that actually works!</li>
            <li> Works good, cuts the glare and sharpens the images.</li>
            <li> I suffer from migraines and live in Los Angeles.  A problem because bright sunlight can trigger migraines.  These high definition sunglasses are a great choice because they cut glare, but also allow me to read outdoors.  I love them for that.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the frames broke after only three weeks of wear.  However, they are very cheap and I can easily replace them.</li>
            <li> With regular sun glasses , you can&#x27;t see the dash on very sunny days.  With these you are able to .  very important !</li>
            <li> I was impressed by these sunglasses as I was not expecting much from them. Though they may feel cheap and plasticy to some, they are actually quite sturdy. I like these glasses and the clarity (which they call HD) it provides. I bought a couple for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that its</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these sunglasses.  They are as expected.</li>
            <li> The clarity was great, that&#x27;s why I bought these sun glasses.  Unfortunately the plastic frames were flimsy and cracked near the nose piece within a week of wearing.  A sturdy frame would make me buy them again.</li>
            <li> I had these sunglasses for almost a year before the frame broke.&lt;br /&gt;These were my everyday driving lens. Although it doesn&#x27;t provide the best protection, it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;A person can&#x27;t complain considering the price tag here.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a pair before and loved them, these are okay, they don&#x27;t fit like the others did. I also didn&#x27;t think I would get black - I got brown and black before.</li>
            <li> When o revived the sun glasses,  y check the frame and I found scratch on the glass and it was very hard to see through it</li>
            <li> They are great glasses! They just don&#x27;t look good on me. Which has more to do with me having a tiny  face than the size of the glasses.</li>
            <li> excellent state of the sunglasses, very good care of the seller. I recommend</li>
            <li> My mom is very disappointed. She was VERY careful with them, always putting them in a case when she wasn&#x27;t wearing them. After about 1 month they snapped in half!! I would like to return them but I am told my return window is closed.</li>
            <li> I really liked this PURCHASE, I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS VERY NICE AND HAVE GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> The sunglasses were damaged - there were stress cracks in the left side lens.  The damage was right where the sticker was placed.</li>
            <li> It only lasted about 5 weeks, just enough for the return window to expire.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and weak frame broke, very poor quality. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy how these brighten things up a bit, however.. The frames broke within a week of use. These may be best suited for someone with a small head. Perhaps women and children?</li>
            <li> I have eye problems, I can not handle bright sunlight, I also have a problem at night with the glare of headlights.  I wear prescription glasses, and these fit right over the glasses, sometimes I also need to wear flip up polarized lenses, it still fits over the glasses.  The variable shade is a great feature, especially when I wear them at night.  The only weak point is that the frames are a bit fragile.  I found that if you open and close the arms, right at the corners of the frames they will last a good long time.  They also relieve the eye fatigue that I used to get while looking at my computer monitor.  I am totally pleased with this product.  As for the merchant, there was a mixup with my original order, they corrected it quickly and courteously.  I have added this merchant to my favorites, and will continue to order from them.  Thanks for the great product and the great service&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Shanak</li>
            <li> cant drive in the sun without them keep my eyes from getting sore also have worn them motorcycling and they offer great protection from the wind</li>
            <li> I really love these glasses as they have the best color (not sure what to call it) or tint of any I have. They are flimsy and I have went through 2 pairs over the last 3 years. Im taking one of the broken pairs to my eye doctor to see if they can match the color in a prescription version.</li>
            <li> Out of the 2 pairs one was broke. Very unhappy. We have bought several pairs and they have broke in the same spot each time. I have a pair that was bought several years ago and they have served me will.</li>
            <li> HELP !, I just bought the HD sun glasses and I the frame is all ready broken, where I bend the frame, well does anyone know where I can write to them....It&#x27;s not that I am not Happy with the glasses, I am they work well for what I want it to do......Help !!!</li>
            <li> The color on these sunglasses distorts too far to the yellow range and they do not handle glare as well as advertised. They didn&#x27;t cost much, so I took a chance on them, but I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I bought these sunglasses for use while riding my motorcycle . The wrap around design keeps wind and debris from contact with your eyes while not having the foam that in my opinion make other motorcycle eyewear ugly . I highly recommend these for anyone wanting a great pair of HD glasses.</li>
            <li> These are clearly the best sunglasses ever. When you put them on they don&#x27;t make everything dark like regular sunglasses.  These glasses make images crisp and clear.  They may not be the most fashionable eyewear but in my case that is not what I&#x27;m looking for. The price is right on these glasses. They were absoulutely worth the money ten times over.</li>
            <li> They protect your eyes but these were a little too big on my face, and from now on will be looking for sunglasses with the wrap-around look.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoys these glasses. He is  visually impaired and he says that things seem clearer to him when he wears the glasses.</li>
            <li> Product is okay though it looks like a copy. I still have the first pair I bought sometime ago and this one looks slightly feeble. Still a good pair to wear around.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these sunglasses to anyone and everyone that wears sunglasses!  The difference is amazing!  See for your self!!!</li>
            <li> The lense blocks the eye tiring blue light so it does help your eyes on sunny days but as a previous reviewer has indicated.  They fall short of their HD claim.  You do see better in bright light just that the improvement is marginal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frame on the one that I got is also crooked.  It opens up too wide.  I solve it by using one of my son&#x27;s dental rubber bands to close it back to normal angle like the otherside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one that I leave at the office to use on my lunch time walk and that is about it.  It is a \\&quot;back up\\&quot; for when I forget to bring my other glasses.</li>
            <li> Actually, I got mine at a dollar store.  For exactly that amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they&#x27;re pretty much identical to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put them on as I left the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sunny day was instantly tranformed into a surreal vision -- of intense clarity and contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was doubleplusgood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I marched back into the store and bought four more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber vision will make us free.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair of these in May or June of 2010. They looked like cheap plastic sunglasses to me and that is what they are. But, I tend to break or lose sunglasses pretty quickly so I don&#x27;t want an expensive pair to lose or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first pair lasted a few months and broke above the nose piece. I leave them on the dash board of my vehicle and one day I picked them up and heard a little snap and saw the frame had broken. No idea why. The store replaced them and I have been using the second pair since then without incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I rate them as acceptable for cheap plastic sunglasses. I don&#x27;t know what the heck the HD part is supposed to mean. They are as good as any of the other pairs of plastic sunglasses I have had over the years, but nothing special. And the second pair has held up pretty well IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect great optical quality from them for the $10 asking price. They are just basic plastic sunglasses.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t any better than the $5.00 knock offs at the flea market. Save your money. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> HD Vision glasses are the best. They always fit, never distort and if broken are cheap enough to throw away.</li>
            <li> great pair of glasses for the price.not easy to find. Nice clear and clean view. I recommend to any driver.</li>
            <li> Good ,comfortable,cheap, easy on the eyes, but one flaw, every pair that I have bought, has a crack in the lens, same place every time. Must be a manufacturing defect. Still function as long as the crack isn&#x27;t too big, otherwise it gets in your view, even with the crack as long as they do what their supposed to do,I would buy again. Like isaid before very comfortable on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful sunglasses. I like them as well as my pricey prescription ones. I wear these when I have contacts in. Great HD  view.</li>
            <li> Bought several pairs of the same.&lt;br /&gt;They always break in the same point. Right after the 10th day.&lt;br /&gt;They are not meant to be disposable.</li>
            <li> Lenses come out away too easy</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t own these sunglasses.  I am a retired optometrist and I do know how they work.  They filter out light from the blue end of the light spectrum.  This does make things appear brighter.  However, because they filter out blues, they change the hue of all colors.  That is, they make colors look \\&quot;different\\&quot;.  Years ago, I bought a similar pair of \\&quot;shades\\&quot;.  For me at least, they actually made some colors look much LESS bright.  I actually went through 2 traffic lights because I thought they were not working!  So, be careful.</li>
            <li> They were not yellow like the ones I was looking for but they worked great.</li>
            <li> These give you a better quality of the world around you, you can actually see every speck of dust there is, even individual leaves of every tree. I extremely like the brighter colors, how everything stands out more.</li>
            <li> Love these sunglasses both for the comfort and lens shade color (personally don&#x27;t care for grey/bluish color lens).  I am on my fifth pair (two I have lost, two broke after 2 years, and one I ran over with my car, accidentally).  While admittedly the quality is not the best, but the quality is comparable to drugstore sunglasses and as expected for the price.</li>
            <li> these are the only glasses that fit my round fat face and dont rub my lady like eyelashes. you could all most wear them at night.. you can even look at your cell phone with them on they enhances the screen unlike dark shades..</li>
            <li> These are the best sunglasses ever.  Inexpensive, and make everything super clear.  Perfect to take on vacations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these sun glasses to everyone.</li>
            <li> Cheep looking.  Not What I Expected. I threw them away in this case I got what I paid for disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have several pairs of these.  they are REASONABLY priced.  Vision is GREAT  and I can afford to lose them!</li>
            <li> there wonderful really clear my fiends want me to get them some so maybe i will but anyway thanks for the product</li>
            <li> Looked great on my phone and PC but frames are not a solid black color. They look spotted almost like a leopard print. With a color matching the lenses.  A little too flamboyant for me.</li>
            <li> Great sunglasses and a great deal! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful  I use them for reading my Kindle at night. Supposed to blank out the blue Rays</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought the glasses, but the ad for them on TV is positively ridiculous.  If anyone&#x27;s vision, represented by the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; shot, is THAT bad even with their prescription glasses on, they have no business driving on the highway, either in the daytime OR night time!  I know, I know--it&#x27;s just a commercial, but it misrepresents the change putting these glasses on is supposed to provide.  It shows such a dramatic change, from foggy and blurry to sharp and crystal clear.  Just use your common sense, and know the commercial grossly misrepresents reality!</li>
            <li> I like these for working in the yard, flower garden etc.  Light, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about their expense, getting scratched, etc. because, well, they aren&#x27;t expensive.  I love the HD effect for lawn and garden work.</li>
            <li> these glasses are great.  I use them to drive in especially because they are not too dark, have gradiant lenses (lighter at the bottom) and work if it&#x27;s bright or cloudy.  I cannot wear real dark glasses anymore and these allow enough light in my eyes to see clearly yet keep the glare and sunlight controlled.  This is my second pair...they are made well and I like that the frames are not too thick to cause blind spots .</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these from a store a few years ago, but I dropped them one too many times and they broke so I&#x27;ve just bought a new pair from Amazon. They&#x27;re probably just not very sturdy sunglasses, but I don&#x27;t consider that too bad of a thing because they&#x27;re only $10. If you buy sunglasses for $100 you could just as easily sit on them or lose them as you could with this pair, and then you&#x27;re out a lot more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunglasses are great because instead of dimming the light and just making everything harder to see like a pair of black sunglasses will, they just filter out the blue part of the light which is harder on your eyes. Your eyes and the muscles around them immediately relax if you wear these on a sunny day, and they stay relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped me the wrong pair to start with, but I emailed them about it and they immediately shipped me the correct pair.</li>
            <li> The frames break within a fairly short period of use.  The lenses are great.  I wish they lasted longer.  I wish I could find the lenses in a more durable frame.</li>
            <li> These glasses are excellent for driving and making things easier to see while preventing glare and excessive light.  I really wish they would sell them in stores again . The old design was much cooler, they&#x27;ve changed a little bit.</li>
            <li> For less than three cups of coffee, I got sunglasses that completely take care of the glare of bright sunlight. The glare gives me an awful headache and since getting these sunglasses, NO HEADACHES! Very good product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to easy to broking it with the new model, however you offering an excellent replacement services.</li>
            <li> not the fit i was looking for  lenses not has good has others i had purchased before .....do not buy</li>
            <li> Each of these pairs had a flaw (in the coating?) just underneath the peel-off sticker on the lens.  As though the stickers were attached before the coating dried.  Returned all and ordered again, from a different vendor, so we&#x27;ll see what the next batch looks like.</li>
            <li> Two of them broke as soon as I tried them on. I sent them back. I assume I will  getting the credit.</li>
            <li> wearing these glasses is an experience more than i expected. details and colors pop...i dont care for &amp;#34;sun&amp;#34; glasses but these i&#x27;ll wear any time</li>
            <li> Lens had splotchy spot out of the box, used water and soft cloth to clean and lens scratched easily.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better HD sunglasses in the past and have purchased them a few times.  Ironically, a friend of mine order the same  a few days before me and got two for the price of one for same glasses</li>
            <li> I love my HDTV vision sun glasses my husband had bought. Me my first pair when they came out on TV I fell in love with them but I loan my hubby my glasses ad came home with them in two pieces üò°look every were couldn&#x27;t find them till now just reserved them less then 2 days I&#x27;m Happy with my glasses woohoo üëç</li>
            <li> I always order the second pair to keep as back up.  These are my signature eye wear .........  going on 16 years.  Please don&#x27;t stop making them.</li>
            <li> these are the best sunglasses to see through.  they relax the eyes and have easy vision - if you try them you will love them and the price is so great</li>
            <li> Might wear these when I&#x27;m driving along a barren highway in a different state. They&#x27;re cheapies. They fog up quickly and within a week they have a film on them like dried up crayons.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-very lightweight, leave no marks on your nose.&lt;br /&gt;-fits very well&lt;br /&gt;-nice amber color&lt;br /&gt;-very cheap and easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already lost one pair of these sunglasses but being that cheap I don&#x27;t feel sorry for it.</li>
            <li> love them....purchase two more pairs for friends...</li>
            <li> good product and nice vision I would say HD</li>
            <li> They arrived scratched</li>
            <li> These glasses were nice, but they are flimsy and broke in the first month. I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> Great, was so glad I could find these. So comfortable. See better with them on than off. Had my first pair for two years, than accidentally sat on them.</li>
            <li> These ARRIVED with a scratched lense.  They were in original packaging, so I don&#x27;t understand how it happened.  I would have returned them, but I had thrown away the mailing packaging and packing slip days before getting them out of their box (lesson learned), so I keep them in the car for emergency backup only.</li>
            <li> Little on the dark side</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and I do not like being blind by conventional sunglasses, so these HDs are perfect to make things more bright on overcast days, and stop the squinting on all sunny days. There is no need to pay 200 bucks for the Ray Bans, I think these work better.</li>
            <li> LOVE these. me and hubs swear by these. BUT as with all sunglasses, they are NOT indestructible. I tend to buy several pair at a time. However, recently Amazon has changed the purchase of this. you cannot purchase alone. they will only ship with another item....what if I ONLY need sunglasses? wish Amazon would change back or I could find them elsewhere because we love these</li>
            <li> I understand that these are cheap plastic sunglasses, but I what I don&#x27;t understand is how terrible this product actually is. It doesn&#x27;t block the sun, it doesn&#x27;t make things look better, it&#x27;s just orange tinted cheap pastic glasses. This was a terrible product, it doesn&#x27;t even do what it was made to do, AT ALL. I don&#x27;t understand why this product exists, what is the point of wearing sunglasses that don&#x27;t block the sun? These don&#x27;t look good, it&#x27;s definitely not stylish. Nonetheless, this product is worthless, useless, and has no purpose in this world.</li>
            <li> These glasses are nice to look through, but they are made of cheap plastic wrapped in a thin plastic coating that is now peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing them out.</li>
            <li> These are adequate cheap driving glasses, which is what I use them for.  I think it makes me look like bono (read: hineyhat).  Also, its good to just keep a bit of bacon fat around to make everything else super duper.</li>
            <li> best cheap sunglasses you will ever buy, I always lose expensive sunglasses these ones are worth buying and it doesn&#x27;t matter if you lose them</li>
