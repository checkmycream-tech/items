    <ol>
            <li>The best I have found.</li>
            <li>Very good polish .</li>
            <li>I woke up with perfectly beautiful fingers and toes.   </li>
            <li>This stuff  is great.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>these are absolutely wonderful--they give a beautiful shine to the manicure</li>
            <li>I buy from the company and LOVE all zoya</li>
            <li>I started using the armor with Out the Door top coat</li>
            <li>sometimes more than once.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Zoya nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>Love this polish/have not had nails for over a year/</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have toxic smell like most polish.</li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Smell too strong, I plan to give it away.</li>
            <li>My nails are finally back to being strong and healthy!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and it chips off quickly, but the top coat makes it stay put and gives it a nice, thick, glossy seal.</li>
            <li>It works it makes my mani and pedi last longer even though I prefer to change colors every week, worth the price :)</li>
            <li>Zoya is 5 free so it isn&#x27;t nearly as harmful for your nails and the fact that it lasts</li>
            <li>Really helps prolong my pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li>After a few tries with increasingly long drying times, I gave myself a successful manicure and was happy with the amount of time that the polish lasted, close to two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best base and top coat</li>
            <li>I waited a couple of minutes and used the Zoya fast drying drops, then went to bed pretty soon thereafter (within 30 minutes).</li>
            <li>and it dries extremely fast now ;O)</li>
            <li>I even invested in the Zoya Fast Drops, which seem to set up the surface of the polish, but after allowing the Armor + Anchor with Fast Drops a reasonable amount of drying time (over an hour, which is much longer than stated in the Fast Drops instructions)</li>
            <li>Overall, using a Zoya polish by itself for a manicure that will last about a week is much more practical for me than using the Anchor, color, Armor, and Fast Drops for a manicure that will take hours to dry (and cost about four times more).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still sitting pretty a week later.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Armor&amp;#34; goes on smoothly, and settles evenly on top of the polish (sinking into any slight irregularities) to leave a slick, shiny surface.</li>
            <li>with this and nailtique finally growing, didn&#x27;t chip, much safer probably.</li>
            <li>Naturally, the Armor + Anchor also make the polish more difficult to remove, which I hadn&#x27;t considered.  </li>
            <li>Armor + Anchor does make the polishes last much longer, but they require a very long drying period (several hours overall), making them impractical for me.  </li>

            <li> Last long and protects nails</li>
            <li> so long means I am using remover and changing polishes far less.</li>
            <li> Plus, the actual polish adheres immediately to the stuff, so if you put the basecoat on the surface of your nail carefully, the color won&#x27;t bleed off into your cuticles.</li>

            <li> I have been using only cruelty-free cosmetics for about ten years, and I can attest to how difficult it is to find products that are not tested on animals that also work as well as their animal tested counterparts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely terrible at doing my own nails, often having to take everything off and start over ...</li>
            <li> Key is to apply both very thinly.</li>

            <li> Does not have the horrible smell</li>

            <li> These are absolutely amazing! I have never had polish stay on as long as it does with this base and top coat!! My nails were thin and brittle from always changing my polish as soon as it chipped. Zoya is 5 free so it isn&#x27;t nearly as harmful for your nails and the fact that it lasts so long means I am using remover and changing polishes far less. My nails are finally back to being strong and healthy!!</li>
            <li> I buy from the company and LOVE all zoya BUT the armor gets thick after a while and you must use restore drops...other than that, the color locking system is divine! I can&#x27;t say how it wears with other brands besides Zoya though and the dry time for armor is awful unless you have all day...I started using the armor with Out the Door top coat and it dries extremely fast now ;O)</li>
            <li> Last long and protects nails</li>
            <li> The best I have found. Can go 2 weeks w no chipping. Only took polish off because I wanted to!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Does not have the horrible smell</li>
            <li> Probably the best base and top coat I have every used. the colors last forever on my nails, even if I do dishes and laundries nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff  is great. I&#x27;m pretty clumsy at putting on polish AND I lack the patience to let it dry fully. These products help With both problems.  &amp;#34;Anchor&amp;#34; keeps the color &amp;#34;anchored&amp;#34; to the nail to prevent it from peeling off. Plus, the actual polish adheres immediately to the stuff, so if you put the basecoat on the surface of your nail carefully, the color won&#x27;t bleed off into your cuticles. &amp;#34;Armor&amp;#34; goes on smoothly, and settles evenly on top of the polish (sinking into any slight irregularities) to leave a slick, shiny surface. I waited a couple of minutes and used the Zoya fast drying drops, then went to bed pretty soon thereafter (within 30 minutes). I woke up with perfectly beautiful fingers and toes.   I&#x27;m absolutely terrible at doing my own nails, often having to take everything off and start over ... sometimes more than once. Only one try and I&#x27;m still sitting pretty a week later.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Zoya nail polishes.  I have been using only cruelty-free cosmetics for about ten years, and I can attest to how difficult it is to find products that are not tested on animals that also work as well as their animal tested counterparts.  I bought the Armor + Anchor as a way to extend the life of the already durable Zoya colors.  Armor + Anchor does make the polishes last much longer, but they require a very long drying period (several hours overall), making them impractical for me.  I even invested in the Zoya Fast Drops, which seem to set up the surface of the polish, but after allowing the Armor + Anchor with Fast Drops a reasonable amount of drying time (over an hour, which is much longer than stated in the Fast Drops instructions), I found that my shoes seemed to push the polish back on my toenails.  After a few tries with increasingly long drying times, I gave myself a successful manicure and was happy with the amount of time that the polish lasted, close to two weeks.  Naturally, the Armor + Anchor also make the polish more difficult to remove, which I hadn&#x27;t considered.  Overall, using a Zoya polish by itself for a manicure that will last about a week is much more practical for me than using the Anchor, color, Armor, and Fast Drops for a manicure that will take hours to dry (and cost about four times more).</li>
            <li> Love this polish/have not had nails for over a year/with this and nailtique finally growing, didn&#x27;t chip, much safer probably. Doesn&#x27;t have toxic smell like most polish.</li>
            <li> It works it makes my mani and pedi last longer even though I prefer to change colors every week, worth the price :)</li>
            <li> Very good polish . Nail.polish last longer. Will recommend</li>
            <li> these are absolutely wonderful--they give a beautiful shine to the manicure</li>
            <li> Really helps prolong my pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> Smell too strong, I plan to give it away.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat definitely improve nail color&#x27;s longevity.</li>
            <li> Make the polish stay on.  Have worn Zoya polish without both and it chips off quickly, but the top coat makes it stay put and gives it a nice, thick, glossy seal. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Lives up to it&#x27;s claims. Key is to apply both very thinly. And reapply armor as needed. Love them both. Worth every penny.</li>
