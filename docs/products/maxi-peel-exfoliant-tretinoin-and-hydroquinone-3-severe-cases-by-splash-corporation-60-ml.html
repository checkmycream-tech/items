            <li>Best of luck!...NewlyNatural</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>One day I decided to search and stated to use Maxi-Peel #  again and happily it does worked excellent with my face.</li>
            <li>, you will peel, use a good moisturizer, but the results are amazing!!</li>
            <li>I think the combo of the retin a and hydroquinone is a great mix.  </li>
            <li>its a great product it made my skin peel</li>
            <li>I had to stop because I moved to another country, but I&#x27;m so glad I found it here in amazon!!</li>
            <li>Just a follow up, still using this product &amp; still loving it!</li>
            <li>Then i use a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I should mention I have medium skin, fairly oily and acne prone, and I&#x27;m in my mid-40s.</li>
            <li>Make a note: don&#x27;t use for more than 3 days!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>so I used it for 3 nights in a row with great results but on the 4th consecutive night when applied there was a much stronger burning sensation (whoops!)  </li>
            <li>if anyone could comment on this, i wanted to know if the cream would be better than this liquid version?</li>
            <li>i can recommend this product, been using for years now , and i love it,even tnx rarebook, and god bless</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>please just give it a try! :)</li>
            <li>I will give a update by the end of November :)</li>
            <li>So It&#x27;s a okay product.</li>
            <li>I had to apply it with a q Tip ( allowed for more precision).</li>
            <li>I apply in an outward motion mostly.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful peel that actually makes my skin peel after 48 hours.</li>
            <li>For someone who does peels all the time I think that&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>I wanted to update this reveiw because I have had wonderful results with this and only using it 2 days a week &amp; then taking a break as directed,then I use the Hydroquinone free version.</li>
            <li>I am loving my face right now</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly it was too strong for me</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It tingled a bit but otherwise felt fine.</li>
            <li>This product was excellent for me and it might be cost a little more but worth it.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to focus primarily on the areas with scarring.</li>
            <li>THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL REVIEW OF WHAT I EXPERIENCED USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as a toner after washing.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>After trying this process for just 3 days, my face began to peel significantly.</li>
            <li>and I see a significant difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>As my face is peeling however, I follow-up with a mild alcohol free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tried the Maxi-Peel Exfoliant #2 and really liked it, but I still have persistant adult acne and some sun damage.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to tretinoin ointment 0.5 percent and buy separately white and fair cream</li>
            <li>I love, love, love maxi-peel it cleared my dark marks within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>threw that bottle away so quick.</li>
            <li>AND THAT IS WHY BLEACHING AND WHITENING ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR THEM.</li>
            <li>I applied with a cotton square to my freshly washed face before bed.</li>
            <li>I noticed I was most sensitive at my crows feet.</li>
            <li>I started using Maxi peel #3 since early September...has a strong alcohol smell but tolerable once you continue using it.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was buying the soap, it turns out it was solution.  </li>
            <li>This product really exfoliates, you will peel!</li>
            <li>(&amp; fast shipping) Will definatly buy again!</li>
            <li>Thanks Yollie!</li>
            <li>i did this at first</li>
            <li>I used an aloe vera based gel to soothe the redness, and was able to wear regular makeup on Sunday.</li>
            <li>and I must say already I&#x27;m seeing a difference from just the first use.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it, I saw peeling within 2 days.</li>
            <li>, I was devastated, tried so many different things, including Porcelana and Retina and nothing helped, my scars are almost completely gone with just this and moisturizer, I noticed the difference after one week!!!</li>
            <li>First off the package came very quickly thanks to the sender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can certainly tell a difference in the softness and smoothness of my skin and with continued use I hope that the spots will lighten.</li>
            <li>People are always suprised when I tell them my age, that is also very nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>IN ASIANS WOMEN TEND TO AGE FAST BECUASE</li>
            <li>Thanks hoping that this product wont be out of the market forever....</li>
            <li>This was just too much for it.</li>
            <li>But for around $10, what did I really have to lose?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to promise that it will work the same for everyone, but it has allowed me to finally enjoy my skin.</li>
            <li>but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my hyper-pigmentation marks.</li>
            <li>Not on the product overrall, just from how much I peeled.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really smooth and glowy the next day.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Although my face hasn&#x27;t cleared 100%, I notice that a LOT of the hyperpigmented spots are fading fast...</li>
            <li>some pink patches were definitely more pronounced than others.</li>
            <li>The Jessner peel did absolutely nothing for my skin.  </li>
            <li>i had fresh clear glowing lighter skin in about 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely appears brighter, healthier and free of acne.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have used other products and find that this lightens my melasma spots better than anything else.</li>
            <li>i just put some on a cotton ball and apply that to my face in the morning and night and then apply some moisturizer with spf 15 to protect my skin from more dark spots</li>
            <li>It should be used on clean skin with a cotton swab, apply a facial lotion after peel is dry, leave on over night and wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Update: January 2013 somehow I originally missed \\&quot;use nightly\\&quot; on the bottle</li>
            <li>Dermatologist, peels, the most expensive and latest products</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how much this made me peel.  </li>
            <li>I am an african american female the spots onmy chest have peeled nicely and are much lighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I would highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest for those who do buy this product to also buy a moisturizer because you will peel.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to people battling with Melasma and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to read other people&#x27;s review on Amazon as to how they used it and then formulate my own personal regimen from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If i use a little more than I wanted I have a lot of peeling and dryness.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician advised me to go easy at the beginning and use this only twice a week to let my skin adjust, so I&#x27;ll do this again next Thursday.</li>
            <li>I then use the mild cleanser and wash my face using a white soft washcloth.</li>
            <li>And the price is crazy good!</li>
            <li>There is definitely peeling and occasional tenderness, but investing in a nice moisturizer or salve all but solves this minor issue.</li>
            <li>The next morning, my face felt red almost like a light sunburn.</li>
            <li>And boy, was I friggin&#x27; surprised!</li>
            <li>By the way, I am Indian and my skin isn&#x27;t too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>First I cleanse my face with my regular cleanser (no AHA), 2.</li>
            <li>It took 3 days before I actually peeld the first time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, but will probably use this intermittently due to the presence of hydroquinone in the product, which I think can actually darken your skin if you use it too long.</li>
            <li>I just received this product last week, and tried it out over the weekend (didn&#x27;t want to get super red and have to go to work).</li>
            <li>n clear.</li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKINS</li>
            <li>But it could definately help others that aren&#x27;t as sensitive as I am to it.</li>
            <li>Alpha Hydrox along with a sunscreen applicated area will be sensitive to UV rays during the process.</li>
            <li>It offers UVB and UVA protection.</li>
            <li>I have been applying aloe vera (straight from the plant) in addition to moisturizer and my face is still peeling (3 days later).</li>
            <li>At night only, I wash my face with a mild cleanser (CerVe), Let dry for 15-20 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li>It is smoother, clearer, no acne breakouts, less fine lines, smaller pores</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews on here I was super excited because I thought I found the cure, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li>I am using the Bananna Boat Ultra Defense SPF 100 Broad Spectrum .</li>
            <li>So far I have used the treatment only 5 times.  </li>
            <li>I have had very positive results in reducing age spot, uneven skin tone &amp; eliminating acne.</li>
            <li>i dont recommend peeling your neck or maybe not apllying it on ur neck everyday as it really gets sensitive and itchy well for me anyway.</li>
            <li>Right before I go to bed (usually a couple of hours later)</li>

            <li> At night only, I wash my face with a mild cleanser (CerVe), Let dry for 15-20 minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> It is smoother, clearer, no acne breakouts, less fine lines, smaller pores</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on here I was super excited because I thought I found the cure, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am using the Bananna Boat Ultra Defense SPF 100 Broad Spectrum .</li>
            <li> So far I have used the treatment only 5 times.  </li>
            <li> I have had very positive results in reducing age spot, uneven skin tone &amp; eliminating acne.</li>
            <li> i dont recommend peeling your neck or maybe not apllying it on ur neck everyday as it really gets sensitive and itchy well for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Right before I go to bed (usually a couple of hours later)</li>
            <li> So far it seems this product in conjunction with some other products is keeping my breakouts at bay</li>
            <li> I have been using Maxi-Peel long time ago and it keeps me away from pimples.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see if this is going to be long term.</li>
            <li> , nothing had long term results.</li>
            <li> This is pretty painless, slight tingling, definatly benifical for uneven complexions &amp; age spots!</li>
            <li> It make my skin peel which is ok, but then my skin get very very red and painful, so I have to stop use it.</li>
            <li> I already know that I have sensitive skin as well as oily, but usually it can handle stronger products.</li>
            <li> and I had a severe acne breakout on both cheeks that left me with dark brown scars</li>
            <li> This time there was peeling within 3 days but 2 days later the spots were dark with scabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bi-racial woman and have always had pretty bad hyperpigmentation, and the only thing that has really worked for me previously was a prescription for Triluma, a topical cream for women experiencing melasma due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> and my face begin breakin out with big pimples and turning black.</li>
            <li> You can actually see all the dead and dry skin on the washcloth.</li>
            <li> It has faded acne scars just using a little daily.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m using the clinique uneven skin tone booklet to measure my skin tone and btw the clinique product promises the same results, two shades in 4 weeks, and is 50.00).</li>
            <li> After applying with a cotton ball or round, I apply moisturizer 10-15 minutes later.</li>
            <li> Anyway this product has the same effects for me as the tretinoin cream i was prescribed by my doctor and this stuff is half the price and no doctor visit!     </li>
            <li> I have tried a few other \\&quot;strong\\&quot; peels that have caused no visible peeling of the facial skin.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t lie, I was pretty skeptical upon reviewing this listing.</li>
            <li> Like every other product, my skin got used to the product.</li>
            <li> I have extremely severe acne all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> But it work on the place other than my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it in conjunction with some other skin products and while my skin has yet to lighten any</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amout</li>
            <li> I am very careful of what products I use on my face due to</li>
            <li> i had marks and my skin became very prone to pimples and clogged pores due to an insalon procedure gobe wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to help lighten my dark spots from acne and they seem to have lightened by two shades in 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> any sort of blemish or laceration leaves a dark mark for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help alleviate some dark acne scars on my cheeks</li>
            <li> The only negative is that there are no directions included</li>
            <li> I used to have dark spots, I used this product, and my dark spots started to fade in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight!</li>
            <li> It has been less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I use this solution under my chin as I suffer from dark spots left behind from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> This product has literally erased almost every trace of hyperpigmentation from my face with little irritation, including a dark discoloration around my mouth that I&#x27;ve had since the 5th grade(I&#x27;m 23 now)!</li>
            <li> I also use sunscreen everyday &amp; every few months do a glycolic or lactic acid peel.</li>
            <li> It was so stressful having breaking out with big pimples and irritating.</li>
            <li> use it a few times a week at night like a toner.</li>
            <li> waste of money used for over month</li>
            <li> It gets all the icky dirt left behind that my cleanser didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> All the scars and dark spots from my pimples went away too!!</li>
            <li> You just have to use it twice a day everyday and once your skin clears up, give your skin a rest and stop using for at least 2 weeks and use again.</li>
            <li> As this cream was quite expensive, I happened to search google for any options with some of the same ingredients (specifically hydroquinone and tretinoin), and I found MaxiPeel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By Monday huge pieces of skin were peeling off all over just like a sunburn but nothing that was horrible -</li>
            <li> You should use this at least 2-3 times a week, once at night...</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a while. I had bad acne and this is the only product that worked for me. It made my skin peel and my blemishes went away. All the scars and dark spots from my pimples went away too!! You just have to use it twice a day everyday and once your skin clears up, give your skin a rest and stop using for at least 2 weeks and use again. It really works! I have been using this for years...... I had to stop because I moved to another country, but I&#x27;m so glad I found it here in amazon!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was buying the soap, it turns out it was solution.  I use this solution under my chin as I suffer from dark spots left behind from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution does lighten the area and cause you to peel.  The solution works well. I will however try the cream next time as this will allow me to apply the treatment to specific problem areas and spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and haven&#x27;t had any acne problems.  I&#x27;m using this product to help lighten my dark spots from acne and they seem to have lightened by two shades in 4 weeks (i&#x27;m using the clinique uneven skin tone booklet to measure my skin tone and btw the clinique product promises the same results, two shades in 4 weeks, and is 50.00). I have never once had my skin peel using this product so perhaps i&#x27;m using it wrong? i just put some on a cotton ball and apply that to my face in the morning and night and then apply some moisturizer with spf 15 to protect my skin from more dark spots and i do get a slightly painful tingling from that. Anyway this product has the same effects for me as the tretinoin cream i was prescribed by my doctor and this stuff is half the price and no doctor visit!     if anyone could comment on this, i wanted to know if the cream would be better than this liquid version?</li>
            <li> This product really exfoliates, you will peel! I use it on the weekends not the day before I have to work. This has helped even my complexion alot. I also use stronger peels (I alternate) This is pretty painless, slight tingling, definatly benifical for uneven complexions &amp; age spots! Yollie is a WONDERFUL person to buy from, very nice &amp; personable !!(&amp; fast shipping) Will definatly buy again! Thanks Yollie! 10-15-09 I wanted to update this reveiw because I have had wonderful results with this and only using it 2 days a week &amp; then taking a break as directed,then I use the Hydroquinone free version.I have had very positive results in reducing age spot, uneven skin tone &amp; eliminating acne. I also use sunscreen everyday &amp; every few months do a glycolic or lactic acid peel. People are always suprised when I tell them my age, that is also very nice!&lt;br /&gt;12/29/12 Just a follow up, still using this product &amp; still loving it! No one can beleive my actual age so its definatly working for me + I now wear very little makeup, my skin tyone has evened out &amp; my sun spots are gone!  I always wear sun screen now!</li>
            <li> THEY ASIANS HAVE THICK SKINS AND THAT IS WHY BLEACHING AND WHITENING ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR THEM. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKINS THEY WILL DAMAGE YOUR SKIN VERY BAD. IN ASIANS WOMEN TEND TO AGE FAST BECUASE THEY USE THE WHITENING WITH CHEMICAL.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maxi-Peel long time ago and it keeps me away from pimples.I went back to states and I stop for awhile and my face begin breakin out with big pimples and turning black.I have used alot of different products so it could be convenient for me to get here but apparantly not even one of the product I used did not worked with my face.One day I decided to search and stated to use Maxi-Peel #  again and happily it does worked excellent with my face.It was so stressful having breaking out with big pimples and irritating.Sad to say I should had took picture of my face to prove that it worked.This product was excellent for me and it might be cost a little more but worth it.Thanks hoping that this product wont be out of the market forever....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week. I have dark spots on my chest and stomach. I am an african american female the spots onmy chest have peeled nicely and are much lighter. So far so good. I just have to keep remembering to use sunblock. I hope they dont return upon stopping.</li>
            <li> i can recommend this product, been using for years now , and i love it,even tnx rarebook, and god bless</li>
            <li> I tried the Maxi-Peel Exfoliant #2 and really liked it, but I still have persistant adult acne and some sun damage. So I decided to step it up one and see how #3 worked. Unfortunatly it was too strong for me and I peeled like crazy. Not a pretty sight! I already know that I have sensitive skin as well as oily, but usually it can handle stronger products. This was just too much for it. I am going back to using level #2. But it could definately help others that aren&#x27;t as sensitive as I am to it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;m a bi-racial woman and have always had pretty bad hyperpigmentation, and the only thing that has really worked for me previously was a prescription for Triluma, a topical cream for women experiencing melasma due to pregnancy. As this cream was quite expensive, I happened to search google for any options with some of the same ingredients (specifically hydroquinone and tretinoin), and I found MaxiPeel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie, I was pretty skeptical upon reviewing this listing. Why would this stuff work for me where almost nothing else had? But for around $10, what did I really have to lose? And boy, was I friggin&#x27; surprised! My issues have always stemmed from bug bites, pimples, scratches, etc...any sort of blemish or laceration leaves a dark mark for me. This product has literally erased almost every trace of hyperpigmentation from my face with little irritation, including a dark discoloration around my mouth that I&#x27;ve had since the 5th grade(I&#x27;m 23 now)! There is definitely peeling and occasional tenderness, but investing in a nice moisturizer or salve all but solves this minor issue. You&#x27;ll also want to have an SPF on hand.&lt;br /&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would highly, highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m not going to promise that it will work the same for everyone, but it has allowed me to finally enjoy my skin. I haven&#x27;t needed foundation to even out my skin tone and I haven&#x27;t been using any sort of acne treatment either. Literally only two products (a prescription that sells for about $90 and MaxiPeel) have ever delivered these kinds of results for me, so if you&#x27;re thinking about it...please just give it a try! :)</li>
            <li> I have used other products and find that this lightens my melasma spots better than anything else. I have used this before and will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and I have to say it has stopped working.  After the third use, my skin peeled a lot! However, it does not peel anymore. I squeezed the liquid onto a cotton ball, and I applied it to my face and went to sleep every night for two weeks. Like every other product, my skin got used to the product. I have extremely severe acne all over my cheeks. It reduced the acne but it did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for my hyper-pigmentation marks. After reading all the reviews on here I was super excited because I thought I found the cure, but I was wrong. This product failed for me. By the way, I am Indian and my skin isn&#x27;t too dark or too light. Hope it works out for the rest of y&#x27;all! I would highly suggest for those who do buy this product to also buy a moisturizer because you will peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, I put it on with a cotton ball before I go to sleep and I use it 3 or 4 times a week, you will peel, use a good moisturizer, but the results are amazing!! I am a Latin woman with olive skin and I had a severe acne breakout on both cheeks that left me with dark brown scars, I was devastated, tried so many different things, including Porcelana and Retina and nothing helped, my scars are almost completely gone with just this and moisturizer, I noticed the difference after one week!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have dark spots, I used this product, and my dark spots started to fade in less than 2 weeks. I strongly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it only at night.</li>
            <li> First off the package came very quickly thanks to the sender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is from a person who is no stranger to peels (glycolic, lactic, tca...) I was very surprised at how much this made me peel.  On a scale of 1-10... I would say a 6. Not on the product overrall, just from how much I peeled. For someone who does peels all the time I think that&#x27;s pretty good lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it a few times a week at night like a toner. It gets all the icky dirt left behind that my cleanser didn&#x27;t get. Don&#x27;t rinse!  Then i use a really good moisturizer. It leaves my skin really smooth and glowy the next day.  I think the combo of the retin a and hydroquinone is a great mix.  I really like this stuff. And the price is crazy good! This will not be my last purchase!</li>
            <li> Since my last baby, I have battled with severe melasma. I have done a couple of expensive facials, done in-home peels and used a prescibed cream all to no avail. I just had this incredibly nasty shield on my cheek that refused to leave. I am very careful of what products I use on my face due to it&#x27;s sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a series of research online, I decided to give this maxi-peel a try. When I received it, I initially thought it reeked of alcohol and the package did not provide a step by step instruction on how to use the product. So, I decided to read other people&#x27;s review on Amazon as to how they used it and then formulate my own personal regimen from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my simple procedure: First I cleanse my face with my regular cleanser (no AHA), 2. apply maxi peel with a cotton swap to my face as a toner, 3. apply my alcohol-free moisturizer immediately after this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  After trying this process for just 3 days, my face began to peel significantly. I don&#x27;t know about others, but my&lt;br /&gt;face has improved very incredibly. The crappy Melasma seems to have met it&#x27;s match because it&#x27;s starting to scale off seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As my face is peeling however, I follow-up with a mild alcohol free moisturizer. I am loving my face right now and I highly recommend this to people battling with Melasma and hyperpigmentation. Good luck y&#x27;all...</li>
            <li> I love, love, love maxi-peel it cleared my dark marks within a couple of days. I would recommend this product to anyone. Don&#x27;t wash it off use it as toner once or twice a week if you want to speed up the peeling process purchase Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion-6 ozby Alpha Hydrox along with a sunscreen applicated area will be sensitive to UV rays during the process.</li>
            <li> Very good. I started peeling 4 days after. My face is smooth n clear. Thinking about using maxi peel 4 for my body hopefully it works.</li>
            <li> I started using Maxi peel #3 since early September...has a strong alcohol smell but tolerable once you continue using it. And yes there.is a lot of shedding! You should use this at least 2-3 times a week, once at night...i did this at first but now I use it daily (not recommended for everyone). Although my face hasn&#x27;t cleared 100%, I notice that a LOT of the hyperpigmented spots are fading fast...I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I will give a update by the end of November :)</li>
            <li> It make my skin peel which is ok, but then my skin get very very red and painful, so I have to stop use it. But it work on the place other than my face. So It&#x27;s a okay product.</li>
            <li> I just received this product last week, and tried it out over the weekend (didn&#x27;t want to get super red and have to go to work). I applied with a cotton square to my freshly washed face before bed. It tingled a bit but otherwise felt fine. My skin looked shiny. The next morning, my face felt red almost like a light sunburn. I noticed I was most sensitive at my crows feet. I used an aloe vera based gel to soothe the redness, and was able to wear regular makeup on Sunday. some pink patches were definitely more pronounced than others. By Monday huge pieces of skin were peeling off all over just like a sunburn but nothing that was horrible - I just used a washcloth to exfoliate a bit to loosen the skin, that was all I needed. I have done deeper peels where I peeled for days and could hardly leave the house, but this wasn&#x27;t bad at all.... I bought this to help alleviate some dark acne scars on my cheeks and I must say already I&#x27;m seeing a difference from just the first use. My aesthetician advised me to go easy at the beginning and use this only twice a week to let my skin adjust, so I&#x27;ll do this again next Thursday. I&#x27;m going to focus primarily on the areas with scarring. So far, so good.  i would recommend this to others. I should mention I have medium skin, fairly oily and acne prone, and I&#x27;m in my mid-40s. My skin can tolerate a lot. I&#x27;ve done peels and use AHAs already. I&#x27;m very pleased, but will probably use this intermittently due to the presence of hydroquinone in the product, which I think can actually darken your skin if you use it too long.</li>
            <li> This product destroyed my skin. I was prescribed a cream that had the same concentrations of tretinoin and hydroquinone as this product but my prescription refills ran out so I decided to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the product is a liquid not a cream. I had to apply it with a q Tip ( allowed for more precision). I only used the product twice. I applied a very thin layer on only the troubled areas. The first time I applied it, I saw peeling within 2 days. The acne didn&#x27;t go away but when it did there was terrible scarring ( worse than usual). I waited a week and applied it a second time. This time there was peeling within 3 days but 2 days later the spots were dark with scabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw that bottle away so quick. Do not buy this product. Try to get a prescription.</li>
            <li> I ordered Maxi-Peel after I went to the dermotologist for a Jessner peel.  The Jessner peel did absolutely nothing for my skin.  I still had acne and I still had areas of hyperpigmentation from the acne and from sun damage.  I ordered Maxi-Peel after some research and decided to try it.  I began using it on May 30th. I also am using a prescription Retin-A.  My routine is as follows:  At night only, I wash my face with a mild cleanser (CerVe), Let dry for 15-20 minutes or so.  I apply the Maxi-Peel solution to my entire face and neck area (as this is were my issues are? I apply in an outward motion mostly.  I concentrate on the areas that are the worse. I put on one to two coats.  Do not wash it off.  Right before I go to bed (usually a couple of hours later) I apply my Retin-A cream.  When I wake up in the morning, I am dry and peeling like crazy.  It took 3 days before I actually peeld the first time.  I then use the mild cleanser and wash my face using a white soft washcloth. I wash the cleanser off using a circular motion.  You can actually see all the dead and dry skin on the washcloth. It has been less than 2 weeks and I see a significant difference in my skin.  It is smoother, clearer, no acne breakouts, less fine lines, smaller pores and I can see the skin hyperpigmentation breaking up.  I did have some redness in some areas but It has gone away. My skin is glowing and now my face/neck area are almost the same shade as the rest of my body. I forgot to mention that I am African American with a chocolate complexion. I am loving this product so far.  No complaints.  I plan to use it for 6 weeks, stop for 6 weeks, see how it goes and if necessary begin the routine again.  I will continue to use the Retin-A.  ***** so important!!!!! DONT FORGET THE SUNBLOCK**** IT IS A MUST, EVERY MORNING!!!.  I am using the Bananna Boat Ultra Defense SPF 100 Broad Spectrum . It offers UVB and UVA protection. DISCLAIMER: THIS PRODUCT HAS WORKED AND IS WORKING FOR ME.  I CANNOT TELL YOU THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE SAME RESULTS, THAT DEPENDS ON YOU AND YOUR SKIN. THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL REVIEW OF WHAT I EXPERIENCED USING THIS PRODUCT. Best of luck!...NewlyNatural</li>
            <li> So far it seems this product in conjunction with some other products is keeping my breakouts at bay.....we&#x27;ll see if this is going to be long term. I will order this item again.</li>
            <li> i tried the maxi peel after reading reviews and doing a bit of research. its a great product it made my skin peel but it wasnt so bad that i culdnt leave the house or go to work which was a bonus. i had fresh clear glowing lighter skin in about 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really recommend it. i had marks and my skin became very prone to pimples and clogged pores due to an insalon procedure gobe wrong. this product definately cleared my skin up and i dont even want to wear make up. i dont recommend peeling your neck or maybe not apllying it on ur neck everyday as it really gets sensitive and itchy well for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading reviews with the hope that it will help to lighten some of my sun spots.  It is a wonderful peel that actually makes my skin peel after 48 hours. I have tried a few other \\&quot;strong\\&quot; peels that have caused no visible peeling of the facial skin.  I have been using it in conjunction with some other skin products and while my skin has yet to lighten any I can certainly tell a difference in the softness and smoothness of my skin and with continued use I hope that the spots will lighten. So far I have used the treatment only 5 times.  The only negative is that there are no directions included so I had to look them up.  It should be used on clean skin with a cotton swab, apply a facial lotion after peel is dry, leave on over night and wash in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Update: January 2013 somehow I originally missed \\&quot;use nightly\\&quot; on the bottle so I used it for 3 nights in a row with great results but on the 4th consecutive night when applied there was a much stronger burning sensation (whoops!)  the next day my face was a bit red.  I have been applying aloe vera (straight from the plant) in addition to moisturizer and my face is still peeling (3 days later). Make a note: don&#x27;t use for more than 3 days!</li>
            <li> neither it helps peel the skin, nor it had bleaching power..I will stick to tretinoin ointment 0.5 percent and buy separately white and fair cream</li>
            <li> I have suffered with facial,back,and chest acne and hyper pigmentation for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Dermatologist, peels, the most expensive and latest products, nothing had long term results. Then I found maxi peel on amazon. Thank god!!! And it&#x27;s soooo affordable. This product is a staple in my skin regimen. Lovvvvvveeee it!!!! My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Did not work and made my face worse I couldn&#x27;t even wear my makeup&lt;br /&gt;And facejust got worse and worse</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I&#x27;m an African American female and started using Maxi Peel 3 about a month or two ago. I ran out of Retin-A so decided to try this. It has worked wonders for my skin. I use it primarily as a toner after washing. After applying with a cotton ball or round, I apply moisturizer 10-15 minutes later. I peeled after about a week. My skin definitely appears brighter, healthier and free of acne.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> waste of money used for over month no change in complexion.blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  blah</li>
            <li> It has faded acne scars just using a little daily. But you NEED to use sunblock- trenitoin&#x27;s skin cancer risk.&lt;br /&gt;It helps fade acne scars and helps with wrinkles. But you must be religious about using sunblock. If i use a little more than I wanted I have a lot of peeling and dryness. It only takes a small amout</li>
