            <li>This was a great set, although I had to give this three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I just used my finger and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Have you ever loved something to the point of fear of using it up?</li>
            <li>My item came in good timing &amp; everything was good.</li>

            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love These!</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more than just one color of each!</li>
            <li>These are life extremely amazing and veryyyyyyyyyyyy pigmented</li>
            <li>They are awesome very pigmented</li>
            <li>and I love them and nice and neat packaging</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy with this purchase and I love the product so much that I might just get another set as I don&#x27;t even want to use this set.</li>
            <li>I would compare these more to the occ lip tars.</li>
            <li>I love my lip paint.</li>
            <li>I love these lip glosses.</li>
            <li>I love every single one of them the color is just perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very in love with my new &amp;#34;My 18 Glazed lip paint!!!</li>
            <li>Not a sticky lip gloss, it has a light minty smell.</li>
            <li>Great product overall, highly recommend</li>
            <li>Very opaque, goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>For the price the set is worth a try if you are just looking to see what colors work for you.</li>
            <li>I own several OCC Lip Tars and these are very comparable.  </li>
            <li>girls super intense...</li>
            <li>Color is very pigmented!</li>
            <li>came fast!</li>
            <li>I think someone did it to be funny</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t funny</li>
            <li>Love them the colors are the actual colors.</li>
            <li>they were shipped to me fast, I haven&#x27;t used them tall but the ones I have.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors are very clownish.</li>
            <li>You need to be very descriptive.</li>
            <li>product is very pigmented.</li>
            <li>i had to get the whole collection</li>
            <li>These are very glossy and watery while the too faced are more creamy with less shine.</li>
            <li>The darker colors perform better and are less runny for some reason.</li>
            <li>They also have a little more menthol than the lip tars, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll liven up your lips and also keep them subtle enough for great day-time looks.</li>
            <li>[ Its actually one of my favorite colors to mix with other pink lip gloss</li>
            <li>I will be buying from them again in the very near future!</li>
            <li>They work better if you apply them with a brush which is pretty inconvenient on the go.</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and I find that they last for a lot longer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>If you apply a little and see that you&#x27;re lacking the shine that lip gloss gives, don&#x27;t be afraid to use a cheap clear, lightly tinted, or sparkley lip gloss.</li>
            <li>There was only 2 that were a little to light for my skin tone, but they can be mixed with other colors.  </li>

            <li> A little certainly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Silly but true!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave them 4 stars, not 5 is because they are extremely glossy.</li>
            <li> They are a little lighter in consistency and the color does not last as long, but I did get hours of wear.</li>
            <li> The tube color may appear to be the same as a few others</li>
            <li> This lip gloss was the one who came empty and displays the photo</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I recieved two of the same lip gloss colors(I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m missing a specific color, but I recieved two babydolls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, my color &amp;#34;Coy&amp;#34; was leaking.</li>
            <li> I add them to other colors for a softer look.</li>
            <li> It was all over my other lip gloss colors, and even after opening, and wiping down coy, its still leaking. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Omg obsessed with these,they are very pigmented and glossy</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say is that the applicator is very thick and can make applying the product very messy.</li>
            <li> They were hard to open and the boxes got ripped :(</li>
            <li> If you are looking for dupes for the too faced melted these are not good.</li>
            <li> Cause this is false advertisement</li>
            <li> One of the colors that disappointed me was tempt because I thought it was darker than expected.</li>
            <li> Buy them YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> Insanely pigmented all came sealed</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.!</li>

            <li> They are awesome very pigmented</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy with this purchase and I love the product so much that I might just get another set as I don&#x27;t even want to use this set. Have you ever loved something to the point of fear of using it up? Silly but true! That&#x27;s me and these lip paints. Second set please!!!</li>
            <li> Love them! Color is very pigmented!</li>
            <li> My item came in good timing &amp; everything was good.</li>
            <li> These are life extremely amazing and veryyyyyyyyyyyy pigmented So pigmented I bought them twice.Buy them YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
            <li> they were shipped to me fast, I haven&#x27;t used them tall but the ones I have. I love them!</li>
            <li> The darker colors perform better and are less runny for some reason. They work better if you apply them with a brush which is pretty inconvenient on the go. The lighter colors are very clownish. If you are looking for dupes for the too faced melted these are not good. These are very glossy and watery while the too faced are more creamy with less shine.

            <li> Insanely pigmented all came sealed and I love them and nice and neat packaging came fast!</li>
            <li> These are exquisite!!! Very opaque, goes on smoothly. I would compare these to the Too Faced Melted lipsticks. Only you save a bunch with these!! The tube color may appear to be the same as a few others but I assure you they are each completely different colors. I was also very impressed with the shipping time with this company! I will be buying from them again in the very near future!</li>
            <li> Great color payoff .... Even faster shipping</li>
            <li> These are great! I got them on time, and they were as described. I received all the colors no repeats colors. The colors are gorgeous! There was only 2 that were a little to light for my skin tone, but they can be mixed with other colors.  I add them to other colors for a softer look. These are great if you&#x27;re trying to start a makeup/lipstick collection because of the variety. I own several OCC Lip Tars and these are very comparable.  They are a little lighter in consistency and the color does not last as long, but I did get hours of wear. They also have a little more menthol than the lip tars, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I Absolutely Love These! I will be purchasing a backup set soon.</li>
            <li> 18 Great lip colors for affordable price</li>
            <li> This lip gloss was the one who came empty and displays the photo and if they see this with the envelope, unopened.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be more than just one color of each! I was very disappointed.! You need to be very descriptive. Cause this is false advertisement</li>
            <li> These lip glosses are great! The color selection is wonderful! I thought I would have to give the lighter ones away, but they all work with my deep skin tone. The only reason I gave them 4 stars, not 5 is because they are extremely glossy. I knew they were glossy, but I didn&#x27;t know they were this glossy. Great product overall, highly recommend</li>
            <li> Just got them. They look great but whoever taped these taped the boxes all together between the boxes AND all over them with a lot of tape. They were hard to open and the boxes got ripped :( I think someone did it to be funny but it wasn&#x27;t funny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very in love with my new &amp;#34;My 18 Glazed lip paint!!! Very amazing!!!</li>
            <li> great colors, the product is buildable which I prefer. One of the colors that disappointed me was tempt because I thought it was darker than expected. Not a sticky lip gloss, it has a light minty smell. Great price just give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love them the colors are the actual colors.</li>
            <li> This was a great set, although I had to give this three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I recieved two of the same lip gloss colors(I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m missing a specific color, but I recieved two babydolls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, my color &amp;#34;Coy&amp;#34; was leaking. It was all over my other lip gloss colors, and even after opening, and wiping down coy, its still leaking. &#x3D;[ Its actually one of my favorite colors to mix with other pink lip gloss colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those two issues, all of my items came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very pigmented. A little certainly goes a long way. If you apply a little and see that you&#x27;re lacking the shine that lip gloss gives, don&#x27;t be afraid to use a cheap clear, lightly tinted, or sparkley lip gloss. It&#x27;ll liven up your lips and also keep them subtle enough for great day-time looks.</li>
            <li> I love every single one of them the color is just perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I love my lip paint. Even the colors that do not match my skin tone I put two colors on and it&#x27;s works</li>
            <li> I love these lip glosses. They are very pigmented and I find that they last for a lot longer than I expected for the price. The colors also look just like they do on the site. The only bad thing I have to say is that the applicator is very thick and can make applying the product very messy. But I just used my finger and it worked great. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Omg obsessed with these,they are very pigmented and glossy i had to get the whole collection</li>
            <li> It says I&#x27;ll get LA glazed and LA  girls super intense...but all I received was LA glazed why is that????</li>
