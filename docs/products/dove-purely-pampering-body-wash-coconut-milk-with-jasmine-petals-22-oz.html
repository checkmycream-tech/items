            <li> The smell is awful, I don&#x27;t like it at all.  It is creamy as it goes on, but there is nothing special about it.  I don&#x27;t like the smell, which is a big deal and the product does not work any better than any other body wash, in fact it is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Was sad when this was no longer available on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> The coconut body wash has a great scent. It lathers up really well and leaves your skin feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> You get good value for your purchase! Excellent quality product, just smells a little too sweet for me! Still A+</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients is hydrogenated soybean oil~ this strikes me as odd in a body wash, it&#x27;s a safe ingredient; but I think this is why this particular Dove wash left me feeling... well; greasy! I prefer the pomegranate verbena scent, it washes away much cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentlest cleansers. It&#x27;s  scent fills your shower  with a wonderful smell.  It&#x27;s fantastically moisturizing.  I used the product and felt improvement in my skin,more soft, more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this does an excellent job of moisturizing it.  My skin is softer when I use it, and I can definitely feel the difference when I use something else.  Love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> The smell is so blooming and cocunuty that i love it.... it leaves your skin soft and hydrated! Order more</li>
            <li> This wash has a very light scent. it smells more like the jasmine and thats fine with me. It is moisturizing and it complements my perfume.</li>
            <li> Works has describes... lovely scent and it does not dry my skin out.. my water is hard so I still have to use moisturizing lotion after each shower..</li>
            <li> great value and quality. works and smells great!</li>
            <li> This body wash smells VERY nice and is subtle (some body washes can have a way too intense scent). I will definitely buy this again in the future- but I&#x27;d also like to try out some of the other Dove body washes as well. I have dry skin and find this to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Dove is the best. This product is moisturizing, and has a great scent. It&#x27;s perfect for dry winter skin. Great!</li>
            <li> This bath wash has a nice lather and I love the scent.  It keeps you fairly moisturized after a shower, but in the winter you will still need additional lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star away because recently I decided to start paying more attention to animal treatment in the development of toiletries I use.  Since Dove is part of the big international unilever company, they still do some animal testing.  However, it looks like they are at least making an effort to minimize it: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime though, I feel a little guilty about getting this body wash, even though it&#x27;s nice and very well priced on amazon.</li>
