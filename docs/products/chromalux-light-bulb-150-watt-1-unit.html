            <li>I have used this bulb before and they are wonderful for an art studio and just good lighting.  </li>
            <li>Great lights.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>These are the best full spectrum bulbs going!</li>
            <li>Well, the idea sounded good.  </li>
            <li>It is very pleasant and easy to see.  </li>
            <li>I love these lightbulbs, and this is a good price. :)</li>
            <li>I find this kind of light pleasing to my eyes and a nice warm glow to my body.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to  find  you.</li>
            <li>but the bright full spectrum light is pleasing.</li>
            <li>I love the light.  </li>
            <li>I will give a more detailed report once I have had them a while.</li>
            <li>I saw it here then bought four elsewhere at a better price with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>This lamp bulb casts a very bright light, much brighter and more natural looking than the 60 watt frosted it&#x27;s replacing.</li>
            <li>and they are great especially in winter in the northern midwest.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice warm light, but at 150 watt I was definitely hoping it would be brighter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how well this light helps me.</li>
            <li>My plants seem to enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the light because it&#x27;s a tomb in here.  </li>
            <li>so went with 150 for a bedside light</li>
            <li>I wondered why I liked the light from them so much, now I know.</li>
            <li>Very warm yellow light</li>
            <li>I was excited to get them.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Chromalux 150 watt full spectrum light bulb to anyone, it&#x27;s quite worth its value.</li>
            <li>Provide a nice light and last well.</li>
            <li>The room is bright as daylight for as long as I need it to be.</li>
            <li>Fair warning: this bulb also casts off some heat, so be careful with it.</li>
            <li>It was not as bright as I hoped for, but, it is brighter than the average buld for it</li>
            <li>It feels so much better on my skin than other light bulbs</li>
            <li>They not only make me feel better</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well, so there was no problem there.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m putting my generic 75 watt bulb right back in!  </li>
            <li>Live in the land of drab and dreariness.  </li>
            <li>I understood that these cast significantly less light per watt</li>
            <li>Not true day light balanced.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see these were used for health reasons.  </li>
            <li>The Light bulb did not fit any lamps or ceiling lights.  </li>
            <li>but I have not previously purchased 150W -</li>
            <li>I could barely get near his cage.</li>
            <li>I have used these bulbs for several years especially in the winter when we can&#x27;t get outdoors as much and the sun is weaker.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t light up our small living room as well as I expected.</li>

            <li> Also, very helpful for SAD sufferers.</li>
            <li> Now, maybe, if I was filthy rich and had ten lamps in my small bedroom I&#x27;d see something</li>

            <li> I have been using these for years and they are great especially in winter in the northern midwest. I think they improve my mood and have a 150w in my bedroom that I fire up in the morning. Not sure if these can treat SAD but the bright full spectrum light is pleasing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see these were used for health reasons.  I use them for my art studio.  I love the light.  It is very pleasant and easy to see.  I wondered why I liked the light from them so much, now I know.</li>
            <li> I have used Chromalux bulbs for years. I stocked up when I heard they were being phased out, but I am out of 150s so I was glad to  find  you.</li>
            <li> I have used these bulbs for several years especially in the winter when we can&#x27;t get outdoors as much and the sun is weaker. They not only make me feel better but my pets as well. My macaw was seriously grumpy and snappy about midwinter when I first read about these bulbs and tried them. I could barely get near his cage. Within 20 minutes of installing the chromolux bulb he was singing and talking and back to his usual self. That is how I know the results are not all in my head.</li>
            <li> I will give a more detailed report once I have had them a while. Will contact later. They are very bright which is in their favor.</li>
            <li> I love these lightbulbs, and this is a good price. :)</li>
            <li> Great lights. Provide a nice light and last well.</li>
            <li> If you get seasonal affect disorder (SAD) like so many people do, you should have these bulbs in your lamps during winter. Great price. Well packaged.</li>
            <li> This lamp bulb casts a very bright light, much brighter and more natural looking than the 60 watt frosted it&#x27;s replacing. The room is bright as daylight for as long as I need it to be. Fair warning: this bulb also casts off some heat, so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice warm light, but at 150 watt I was definitely hoping it would be brighter. Doesn&#x27;t light up our small living room as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing the job</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this light helps me. I have seasonal depression and bipolar disorder. This has helped alleviate  intensity of mood swings, reduce feelings of melancholia, and shorten depressive episodes. Its also very bright and makes color pop. My plants seem to enjoy it as well. I would recommend the Chromalux 150 watt full spectrum light bulb to anyone, it&#x27;s quite worth its value.</li>
            <li> The Light bulb did not fit any lamps or ceiling lights.  I have used this bulb before and they are wonderful for an art studio and just good lighting.  I don&#x27;t understand why this one is different but I have not previously purchased 150W - perhaps that is the difference.  I returned this bulb and ordered the 75W.  I will try that this weekend and hope it fits.</li>
            <li> Great bulb!  Working well.  Live in the land of drab and dreariness.  Bulb is helping to lighten my winter days.</li>
            <li> I found the Chromalux  light bulbs to be just what the docter ordered for my winter blues( SAD ) in other words. I find this kind of light pleasing to my eyes and a nice warm glow to my body. It feels so much better on my skin than other light bulbs and I recommend this product. I feel healthier with it too.</li>
            <li> Well, the idea sounded good.  I saw it here then bought four elsewhere at a better price with free shipping.  I was excited to get them.  I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the light because it&#x27;s a tomb in here.  I understood that these cast significantly less light per watt so went with 150 for a bedside light and then some.  I am next to same lamp and can barely see what I&#x27;m doing, and strangely, my laptop screen has a glare that wasn&#x27;t there before.  Now, maybe, if I was filthy rich and had ten lamps in my small bedroom I&#x27;d see something but I&#x27;m not.  I was going to put one over the bathroom sink--forget that.  I can&#x27;t even put this in small desk lamps or clamp on lights because those generally have a 60 W max.  Right now I&#x27;m putting my generic 75 watt bulb right back in!  I&#x27;m annoyed and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the best full spectrum bulbs going!</li>
            <li> Not true day light balanced. Very warm yellow light</li>
            <li> Once you try full-spectrum bulbs it will be hard to go back to regular bulbs, especially if you live in paces like the Pacific NW. I use these all of them time. Also, very helpful for SAD sufferers.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time as it was to arrive and there was no problems with delivery. It was packaged very well, so there was no problem there. It was not as bright as I hoped for, but, it is brighter than the average buld for it&#x27;s wat.</li>
