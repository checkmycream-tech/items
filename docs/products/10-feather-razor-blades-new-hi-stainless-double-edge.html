            <li>These are very good blades !</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>I got a Merkur Futur Razor from the \\&quot;best girlfriend</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the end result.</li>
            <li>I basically just let the weight of the razor fall against my face and everything worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Best razors I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving with a DE razor.</li>
            <li>They are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>They gave me, and continue to give me, the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>Very good customer service.</li>
            <li>Incredibly close, no irritation, and a great price.</li>
            <li>Great razors for my head shave.</li>
            <li>Great blades.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the brands I got in the sampler, I liked the Derby brand the best.</li>
            <li>great quality blades.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I would buy again.</li>
            <li>Still a great blade for every day use</li>
            <li>, the seller was very nice.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them for my son if I didn&#x27;t believe they were a good product for him.  </li>
            <li>These are good blades.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, they provide a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I get about 5 to 6 good shaves with these.</li>
            <li>Good price also.</li>
            <li>Best blades available.</li>
            <li>So Derbys good head shave, fair to good for the face.   </li>
            <li>and he is very satisfied with them as well.</li>
            <li>there is times where I just cannot get a good shave with any blade I use, I will retry the Feather blade as the 1st shave was outstanding.</li>
            <li>These are kind of pricey though.</li>
            <li>All the guys who have written that you need some kind of ten-year training period to use these are nuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several razor blade brands and this is the one I liked best.</li>
            <li>when I know I need a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>They were ok on my face.</li>
            <li>I also had to apply more pressure as well.   </li>
            <li>I am glad I tried them.</li>
            <li>ONE OF THE BETTER RAZORS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to see they&#x27;re available again.</li>
            <li>I have emailed the sender who said that the blades would be at my house by 4 days ago at the latest..</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t get too cut up, and I shave way better now.</li>
            <li>and I have the closest, most nick-free shave</li>
            <li>Sharper isn&#x27;t necessarily better.</li>
            <li>I experience more discomfort going against the grain with this blade than I do with Wilkinsons.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>its a clean crisp feeling afterwards and makes the shaving experience great.</li>
            <li>These blades are not only the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever used, they have the perfect balance of thinness and flexibility to shave cleanly and glide over curved surfaces \\&quot;like buttah\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The feathers are GREAT for the face shave so far.</li>
            <li>If you want the closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ve ever had, get these blades.</li>
            <li>I normally use Wilkerson Blades and they are good, but Feathers are better.  </li>
            <li>Sharp they work great with the feather popular razor  </li>
            <li>The first kind I tried were Derby.</li>
            <li>Read the fine print regarding the time to get them to your door.</li>
            <li>BBS smooth with a minimum of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how smooth the shave is when I use Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, the price is worth the smooth shave and lack of irritation I get with these blades!</li>
            <li>my skin was perfectly smooth afterwards and I had no irritation on my neck from shaving.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They fit in a razor.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>I switched over from Derby blades, and although those were pretty good, the Feathers blow them out of the water, I have found my new go to blade.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again, but they were not so good that they will be my only blade</li>
            <li>a good quality pre-shave cream, I personally like the Proraso brand</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even feel the alum bar on most of my face (just a tiny sting on neck area); a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li>My best results come on using a blade for the second to fourth time.</li>
            <li>Is a good blade and in Bulk is not expensive so order them in the 200+ or larger size.</li>
            <li>GREAT RAZOR BLADES, SUPER SHARP AND ARRIVED FAST!</li>
            <li>But when you do the feather blades cut so cleanly, that they normally scab up pretty easily because its a clean cut.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, last a lot longer, and don&#x27;t require as many passes or as much effort to get an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>I tried them for the first time a month ago and that first pass through on the side of my face was unreal, it felt like I hadn&#x27;t done anything, yet my face was totally smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked the Merkur blades and Wilkinson Sword blades where similar to the Derby brand...</li>
            <li>and I take good care of my skin, and for my style, these are just too sharp.</li>
            <li>They slice right through with no difficulty going with, or across the grain.</li>
            <li>Second time got it down and got an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>The first ones were the Merkurs.</li>
            <li>The second were the personna DE razors and they were ok on the head</li>
            <li>I shanked myself pretty god with the feathers during the head shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a guy and therefore have never used these to shave, but I was first introduced to these blades in Japan.</li>
            <li>Love the double edge for extended life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve invested this much time, so what the hell!</li>
            <li>You might get cut when you first try it.</li>
            <li>First shave</li>
            <li>Just had my first &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; shave.  </li>
            <li>I found these results consistent over the 10 blades I purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this one seems to work for me</li>
            <li>OK, but I think using the double edge razor is not for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp, and just seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li>They make for a really close shave, I really have no complaints!</li>
            <li>I do not apply (much) pressure on the blade, and I do not feel any of my hairs being pulled or offering resistance to the blade.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem shaving 5 straight days with one blade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much blood.</li>
            <li>oh and if your late for work dont use the feathers good chance you will    cut your self</li>
            <li>and I would not pay much more for them than other blades that I like.</li>
            <li>These Feather blades are much more sharp.</li>
            <li>This blade is sharp, but if you&#x27;re a decent DE shaver, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>My old man also hooked me up with some extra Wilkinson Sword blades he had that must have been at least 15 plus years old but in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This product comes advertised as being the sharpest double edged razor blade on the market, which I believe is true.</li>
            <li>I have previously purchased these blades and am a satisfied user.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my first shave was outstanding, 2nd shave was down hill, 3th shave even more down hill,</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid yo use them in that razor but only in that razor</li>
            <li>I have not found that these are so much different than many other blades I have tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used feather blades, I didn&#x27;t even nick myself once (I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days prior)...</li>
            <li>if your interested in getting these blades, I&#x27;ll give you the following tips I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful using them because they are so sharp, but I think I have experienced maybe 2 minimal cuts after a month or so of using Feather blades.</li>
            <li>The price is right (as long as you can get free/cheap shipping or buy in bulk).</li>
            <li>they are super sharp.</li>
            <li>That is because they are super sharp.</li>
            <li>These blades are just like their reputation says, SUPER sharp.</li>
            <li>If you like them super duper sharp, these are for you.</li>
            <li>THE \\&quot;OLD FASHION WAY\\&quot;</li>
            <li>these feathers are sharper than Derby blades, Derby seems to be the dullest    for me thus far and the feather blades the sharpest    </li>
            <li>For my use I found these blades to be the sharpest that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these blades for anyone with a thick beard and whose face can take a more aggressive blade.</li>
            <li>These are way too sharp, even when you careful it just scrubs more than it should.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t nick myself at all, unless I have a bump on my face, but often the cut is so clean that it bleeds just a little and then scabs up without even using a styptic pencil style applicator like \\&quot;My</li>
            <li>I love these razors, they are so sharp that even after a week of use they are as sharp as the Derby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>As such, they require a bit of getting used to, so go slow and use a very light touch.</li>
            <li>4th shave I had to stop in the middle of shaving and install a new blade, in all fairness to Feather</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fairly new to using a double edged razor.</li>
            <li>these blades are very  very sharp, and a very very close close shave    not forgiving though,</li>
            <li>They may last a little longer, but I did not find them to be more aggressive or sharper than other</li>
            <li>These are my second set of double edged razor blades I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these blades but be careful and no pressure</li>
            <li>you have an adjustable razor, you might need to dial back your setting, since the Feather blades are so much sharper then other brands.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and my shave is much cleaner without having to go against the grain</li>
            <li>these razors are very sharp and they glide on my face very well using musco and proraso cream.</li>
            <li>I kept using the blade, but I noticed I kept cutting myself after getting a perfectly smooth shave the first time...</li>
            <li>These are great blades, they are extra expensive, not sure you always get what you pay for.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The first time I used feather blades, I didn&#x27;t even nick myself once (I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days prior)...</li>
            <li> if your interested in getting these blades, I&#x27;ll give you the following tips I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful using them because they are so sharp, but I think I have experienced maybe 2 minimal cuts after a month or so of using Feather blades.</li>
            <li> The price is right (as long as you can get free/cheap shipping or buy in bulk).</li>
            <li> they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> That is because they are super sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are just like their reputation says, SUPER sharp.</li>
            <li> If you like them super duper sharp, these are for you.</li>
            <li> THE \\&quot;OLD FASHION WAY\\&quot;</li>
            <li> these feathers are sharper than Derby blades, Derby seems to be the dullest    for me thus far and the feather blades the sharpest    </li>
            <li> For my use I found these blades to be the sharpest that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these blades for anyone with a thick beard and whose face can take a more aggressive blade.</li>
            <li> These are way too sharp, even when you careful it just scrubs more than it should.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t nick myself at all, unless I have a bump on my face, but often the cut is so clean that it bleeds just a little and then scabs up without even using a styptic pencil style applicator like \\&quot;My</li>
            <li> I love these razors, they are so sharp that even after a week of use they are as sharp as the Derby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As such, they require a bit of getting used to, so go slow and use a very light touch.</li>
            <li> 4th shave I had to stop in the middle of shaving and install a new blade, in all fairness to Feather</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fairly new to using a double edged razor.</li>
            <li> these blades are very  very sharp, and a very very close close shave    not forgiving though,</li>
            <li> They may last a little longer, but I did not find them to be more aggressive or sharper than other</li>
            <li> These are my second set of double edged razor blades I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these blades but be careful and no pressure</li>
            <li> you have an adjustable razor, you might need to dial back your setting, since the Feather blades are so much sharper then other brands.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and my shave is much cleaner without having to go against the grain</li>
            <li> these razors are very sharp and they glide on my face very well using musco and proraso cream.</li>
            <li> I kept using the blade, but I noticed I kept cutting myself after getting a perfectly smooth shave the first time...</li>
            <li> These are great blades, they are extra expensive, not sure you always get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> and then I adjusted to back down to 2.5 with the new blade</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin on my neck and the other blades were not slicing through those coarse whiskers.</li>
            <li> Fine but too expensive and don&#x27;t hold their edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually careful, give my face time to soak before I start shaving, but I almost always have tiny nicks that bleed and sting like heck</li>
            <li> They are not thin and in fact thick in my opinion for a de razor blade.</li>
            <li> I initially used the Astra and they are not as sharp but easier on the face.</li>
            <li> The first time I used these, I chopped up my face pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Single.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to tell you if you don&#x27;t have one, since I don&#x27;t have experience with a fixed Safety Razor</li>
            <li> For a while, they were very hard to find, even in Japan where they&#x27;re manufactured, and so I was cherishing my remaining blades as if they were made of pure gold.</li>
            <li> and I end up cutting myself frequently on the first use of a blade.</li>
            <li> I usually get almost a week of shaves out of each blade along with my proraso shaving puck, and they cut the closest out of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried in the last several years.</li>
            <li> They are rough on the face it turns out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave once you get out of theshower and leave your face and neck wet</li>
            <li> Bought these blades to get though my thick beard with fewer strokes as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the feathers are too sharp for me for every day use    </li>
            <li> So be careful !</li>
            <li> They are the definition of sharp.</li>
            <li> Have tried a variety of other blades.</li>
            <li> Really sharp, the sharpest blades out there</li>
            <li> people dont like Feather because they are to sharp.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something extremely sharp these will serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a variety of other blades for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and stay sharp longer.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp as stated in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have less irritation with the feathers than I have had with any other razor blade.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the sender.</li>
            <li> Let the weight of your razor do the work, you don&#x27;t have to press down and grind with these.</li>
            <li> sharp !</li>
            <li> I found that the blade was a little sharp for my skill level</li>
            <li> Very sharp too.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp, but can pull on hairs after a while.</li>
            <li> you just need to be very careful as they are VERY sharp!</li>
            <li> Like others, I was a little weary about shaving with these blades, but my fears have been pushed aside since using it.</li>
            <li> I have very very very coarse, and tough man hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work my tough facial hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping was crazy fast</li>
            <li> Did not realize what I was missing until I tried these.</li>
            <li> They are so sharp they irritate my skin instantly, and worse than the expensive disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li> I is the dull blades you got to worry about.</li>
            <li> The other problem I had with them is that while they start very sharp, by the time I got to my chin, it was tugging the hairs out rather than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (AT LEAST FOR ME)I AM</li>
            <li> For me, I need the sharpest blade with the least aggressive setting on my razor.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS!</li>
            <li> understand that every one&#x27;s face and hair are different, so I&#x27;m not knocking this or giving it a bad review, but the blades just aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Nik is Sealed\\&quot;, because you will be cutting yourself,even when your careful.</li>
            <li> a Reviewer said the feathers were thin and I disagree.</li>
            <li> Ill stick with Derby, and once in a while I will use the feathers    </li>
            <li> Since I have been getting 6 months use from my expensive 4 edged razor blades, I think it is cheaper and safer.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34; reputation of these blades.  </li>
            <li> It may be that I received a bad batch, but I can&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate them with a passion.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just awesome blades. Very sharp too.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased these blades and am a satisfied user.  I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased them for my son if I didn&#x27;t believe they were a good product for him.  Shipping was crazy fast and he is very satisfied with them as well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased and use four different types of DE razors since I have started wetshaving. The first ones were the Merkurs. The shredded my face and head. I absolutely hate them with a passion. The second were the personna DE razors and they were ok on the head but hell on the face. The Dorko&#x27;s are garbage. I will never buy them. I used the Derby razors. Great razors for my head shave. BBS smooth with a minimum of nicks and cuts. They were ok on my face.They gave my neck razor burn and nicked it to death. So Derbys good head shave, fair to good for the face.   I purchased the feather razors because I have read enough reviews to know they are super sharp. a Reviewer said the feathers were thin and I disagree. They are not thin and in fact thick in my opinion for a de razor blade. I shanked myself pretty god with the feathers during the head shave. That is because they are super sharp. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. I&#x27;ll stick with the Derby&#x27;s. The feathers are GREAT for the face shave so far. I have less irritation with the feathers than I have had with any other razor blade. I have very very very coarse, and tough man hair. I also have sensitive skin on my neck and the other blades were not slicing through those coarse whiskers. So I had to keep going over and over an area. I also had to apply more pressure as well.   I am not knocking the personna razors or the Derbys. They don&#x27;t work my tough facial hair. The derby&#x27;s work like a champ with Merkur HD 34c razor, and I use the Feathers in my Merkur futur. So far so good but your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Worth the extra money.  Very sharp and stay sharp longer.  I am glad I tried them. Buy them</li>
            <li> If breaking into two, they tend to bend before they actually break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good blades though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several razor blade brands and this is the one I liked best. It&#x27;s super sharp, and just seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> It works as specified...</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR BLADES, SUPER SHARP AND ARRIVED FAST! ONE OF THE BETTER RAZORS OUT THERE (AT LEAST FOR ME)I AM A 22 Y/O MALE AND HAVE GONE TO SHAVING THE \\&quot;OLD FASHION WAY\\&quot; NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS!</li>
            <li> these blades are very  very sharp, and a very very close close shave    not forgiving though, if you get a nick, or a cut, you feel it    these feathers are sharper than Derby blades, Derby seems to be the dullest    for me thus far and the feather blades the sharpest    I shave every day the feathers are too sharp for me for every day use    and I only use the blades once no matter what the brand so for every day    Ill stick with Derby, and once in a while I will use the feathers    oh and if your late for work dont use the feathers good chance you will    cut your self</li>
            <li> Read about this Feather blade being the sharpest blade made, bought 10 blades (1 pack) my first shave was outstanding, 2nd shave was down hill, 3th shave even more down hill, 4th shave I had to stop in the middle of shaving and install a new blade, in all fairness to Feather there is times where I just cannot get a good shave with any blade I use, I will retry the Feather blade as the 1st shave was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a guy and therefore have never used these to shave, but I was first introduced to these blades in Japan. I used them for precision work in a museum laboratory environment on art objects. These blades are not only the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever used, they have the perfect balance of thinness and flexibility to shave cleanly and glide over curved surfaces \\&quot;like buttah\\&quot;. Love the double edge for extended life. For a while, they were very hard to find, even in Japan where they&#x27;re manufactured, and so I was cherishing my remaining blades as if they were made of pure gold. I had to hide them from co-workers with sticky fingers, no kidding! I&#x27;m thrilled to see they&#x27;re available again. I&#x27;d used these to shave my legs but I just can&#x27;t help feel they&#x27;re too valuable for that!</li>
            <li> They are very sharp as stated in other reviews. They are rough on the face it turns out. I will keep trying to see if my face adjusts to them. I initially used the Astra and they are not as sharp but easier on the face.</li>
            <li> These are very good blades !&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp ! So be careful !</li>
            <li> If you want the closest, most comfortable shave you&#x27;ve ever had, get these blades. They are the definition of sharp. As such, they require a bit of getting used to, so go slow and use a very light touch. Don&#x27;t try to whack three days of beard in one stroke. Just re-lather a bit and go over the same area. Let the weight of your razor do the work, you don&#x27;t have to press down and grind with these. I&#x27;ve yet to get a case of razor burn with these blades.</li>
            <li> These are good blades.  I have used three of them and they last me about 4 days before I notice a difference.  I could probably still use them for a day or two longer, but I just replace them.  I have not found that these are so much different than many other blades I have tried.  They may last a little longer, but I did not find them to be more aggressive or sharper than other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, they provide a good shave.  I would purchase again, but they were not so good that they will be my only blade and I would not pay much more for them than other blades that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for years. They&#x27;re perfect. Smooth shave you just need to be very careful as they are VERY sharp! My only complaint is the sender. I ordered these blades over a month ago. I have emailed the sender who said that the blades would be at my house by 4 days ago at the latest.. At this point why ask for a refund? I&#x27;ve invested this much time, so what the hell! My suggestion... Buy these from a different seller.</li>
            <li> Like others, I was a little weary about shaving with these blades, but my fears have been pushed aside since using it. This blade is sharp, but if you&#x27;re a decent DE shaver, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the result. I tried them for the first time a month ago and that first pass through on the side of my face was unreal, it felt like I hadn&#x27;t done anything, yet my face was totally smooth. I switched over from Derby blades, and although those were pretty good, the Feathers blow them out of the water, I have found my new go to blade.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how smooth the shave is when I use Feather blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fairly new to using a double edged razor. Have tried a variety of other blades. Did not realize what I was missing until I tried these. After using Feather blades, the blades I had been using earlier seem rougher. I suppose the Feather gives a cleaner shave than I have had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feather feels like it glides along my skin. I do not apply (much) pressure on the blade, and I do not feel any of my hairs being pulled or offering resistance to the blade.</li>
            <li> I normally use Wilkerson Blades and they are good, but Feathers are better.  They are now my &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; blade! Order about a month before you need them. I believe they are shipped from overseas and it takes awhile to get here.</li>
            <li> These blades are the sharpest I have tried to date and last about 3 or 4 shaves for me. I would recommend these blades for anyone with a thick beard and whose face can take a more aggressive blade. For me, the price is worth the smooth shave and lack of irritation I get with these blades!</li>
            <li> Really sharp, the sharpest blades out there I think. You might get cut when you first try it. But I didn&#x27;t get too cut up, and I shave way better now. I bought the hundred pack, so these are going to last me years i think. I get about 5 to 6 good shaves with these. But i use them for about 12 shaves before I switch to the next one.</li>
            <li> They make for a really close shave, I really have no complaints! I use mine with a merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li> I recently switched over to DE/Safety Razor in December 2012, after dealing with overpriced multi bladed cartage razor blades that irritated the hell out of my neck when I shaved with them. I got a Merkur Futur Razor from the \\&quot;best girlfriend ever\\&quot; now fiancee for my birthday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample pack of 25-30 blades with bunch of different brands. Out of all the brands I got in the sampler, I liked the Derby brand the best. I also placed an order for some Merkur blades and Feather Blades. My old man also hooked me up with some extra Wilkinson Sword blades he had that must have been at least 15 plus years old but in perfect condition. I liked the Merkur blades and Wilkinson Sword blades where similar to the Derby brand...but when I  used the Feather brand blades, they where in a class by themselves...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used feather blades, I didn&#x27;t even nick myself once (I didn&#x27;t shave for 2-3 days prior)...my skin was perfectly smooth afterwards and I had no irritation on my neck from shaving. I was very happy with the end result. I kept using the blade, but I noticed I kept cutting myself after getting a perfectly smooth shave the first time...I was like what the hell is going on? I let my facial hair grow out a couple days again, and I was still chopping my face up with the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed the blade out (I used it about 5-6 times) and took a close look at my Futur again...I come to find out that it got adjusted out to a 4-4.5 (I had it at 3 or 3.5 prior to this) and then I adjusted to back down to 2.5 with the new blade and now it shaves like a champ again and I don&#x27;t nick myself at all, unless I have a bump on my face, but often the cut is so clean that it bleeds just a little and then scabs up without even using a styptic pencil style applicator like \\&quot;My nic is sealed\\&quot; that I use normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your interested in getting these blades, I&#x27;ll give you the following tips I&#x27;ve learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave once you get out of theshower and leave your face and neck wet&lt;br /&gt;Use a good quality pre-shave cream, I personally like the Proraso brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest one is this:&lt;br /&gt;If you have an adjustable razor, you might need to dial back your setting, since the Feather blades are so much sharper then other brands. Not sure what to tell you if you don&#x27;t have one, since I don&#x27;t have experience with a fixed Safety Razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get an astringent like \\&quot;My Nik is Sealed\\&quot;, because you will be cutting yourself,even when your careful. But when you do the feather blades cut so cleanly, that they normally scab up pretty easily because its a clean cut.</li>
            <li> great quality blades.  First shave I was too daring and entire face was oozing blood, even though I didn&#x27;t feel any pain as I was shaving.  Second time got it down and got an excellent shave.  Highly recommend these blades but be careful and no pressure</li>
            <li> Sharp they work great with the feather popular razor  I&#x27;m not afraid yo use them in that razor but only in that razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the sharpest blades that give the smoothest shave. I is the dull blades you got to worry about. These are kind of pricey though.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Just had my first &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; shave.  I&#x27;m a newbie to DE shaving (about 6-8 months on Derby blades).  I&#x27;m usually careful, give my face time to soak before I start shaving, but I almost always have tiny nicks that bleed and sting like heck when I use my alum block.  Today was different.  I was afraid of the &amp;#34;too sharp&amp;#34; reputation of these blades.  I basically just let the weight of the razor fall against my face and everything worked perfectly.  3-passes (with, across, against) and I have the closest, most nick-free shave I&#x27;ve had in a looooooooong time.  I didn&#x27;t even feel the alum bar on most of my face (just a tiny sting on neck area); a huge improvement!  I&#x27;m a believer!  Yes, these took forever to ship from Thailand, but it was actually several days faster than amazon predicted!  Will by again, 100%</li>
            <li> Great product, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur 180 and used the blades that came with it. I then bought these Feather blades. They are worlds apart. These Feather blades are much more sharp. I only have experience with these two, but I&#x27;ll definitely be sticking with Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people dont like Feather because they are to sharp. I&#x27;m not one of them. If you are looking for something extremely sharp these will serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the seller was very nice. I emailed them because I had an additional box of razor blades and I thought they had mixed up what they shipped, but turns out they threw in a sample box of another brand. Very good customer service.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and my shave is much cleaner without having to go against the grain</li>
            <li> These are way too sharp, even when you careful it just scrubs more than it should.  Perhaps there is a skin that can take it.</li>
            <li> For my use I found these blades to be the sharpest that I have used so far. Good price also.</li>
            <li> This product comes advertised as being the sharpest double edged razor blade on the market, which I believe is true. Sharper isn&#x27;t necessarily better. I found that the blade was a little sharp for my skill level and I end up cutting myself frequently on the first use of a blade. My best results come on using a blade for the second to fourth time. I found these results consistent over the 10 blades I purchased.</li>
            <li> Bought these blades to get though my thick beard with fewer strokes as I have sensitive skin. They slice right through with no difficulty going with, or across the grain. I experience more discomfort going against the grain with this blade than I do with Wilkinsons. Still a great blade for every day use</li>
            <li> these razors are very sharp and they glide on my face very well using musco and proraso cream. its a clean crisp feeling afterwards and makes the shaving experience great. I would suggest using these to try them out and see if they work for your face as well!</li>
            <li> I love these razors, they are so sharp that even after a week of use they are as sharp as the Derby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and this one seems to work for me best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an adjustable Merkur razor.  For me, I need the sharpest blade with the least aggressive setting on my razor.  Everyone says that Feather is the sharpest blade - and I think they&#x27;re right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for the sharpest blade you can get, this is likely it.  It also lasts several shaves.  I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem shaving 5 straight days with one blade.</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving with a DE razor. Incredibly close, no irritation, and a great price. Only reason this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is it took a month to arrive; be forewarned, this item ships from Thailand.</li>
            <li> These are my second set of double edged razor blades I have tried so far. The first kind I tried were Derby. They work alright but after using Feather, I will not be going back to Derby and probably won&#x27;t try anything else. They are very sharp, last a lot longer, and don&#x27;t require as many passes or as much effort to get an excellent shave. You do have to be careful using them because they are so sharp, but I think I have experienced maybe 2 minimal cuts after a month or so of using Feather blades. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very Sharp, but can pull on hairs after a while.</li>
            <li> These are great blades, they are extra expensive, not sure you always get what you pay for. Read the fine print regarding the time to get them to your door. That is a seller issue and does not reflect on the product at all.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a variety of other blades for about a year now. I bought these based on some recommendations I saw here. The first time I used these, I chopped up my face pretty bad. So, I dumped the blade and tried another.  Almost the same result.  It may be that I received a bad batch, but I can&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> I shave in two passes, one with the grain and one across the grain. I have a medium beard and I take good care of my skin, and for my style, these are just too sharp. I usually nick myself twice every day, in different places, on the first pass with these. It&#x27;s just too much blood.</li>
            <li> OK, but I think using the double edge razor is not for me.  Since I have been getting 6 months use from my expensive 4 edged razor blades, I think it is cheaper and safer.</li>
            <li> Fine but too expensive and don&#x27;t hold their edge. Get Astra razor blades instead. They are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> These blades are just like their reputation says, SUPER sharp. They are so sharp they irritate my skin instantly, and worse than the expensive disposable cartridges. The other problem I had with them is that while they start very sharp, by the time I got to my chin, it was tugging the hairs out rather than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that every one&#x27;s face and hair are different, so I&#x27;m not knocking this or giving it a bad review, but the blades just aren&#x27;t for me. If you like them super duper sharp, these are for you.</li>
            <li> Is a good blade and in Bulk is not expensive so order them in the 200+ or larger size. Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> All the guys who have written that you need some kind of ten-year training period to use these are nuts. They&#x27;re razor blades. They have two sides. They fit in a razor. With them you can shave your face. There is no need to fear these, they won&#x27;t attack you, and there is no skill required beyond that which we call &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades you will find! They gave me, and continue to give me, the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Best blades available.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the sharpest razors I&#x27;ve found. The price is right (as long as you can get free/cheap shipping or buy in bulk). I usually get almost a week of shaves out of each blade along with my proraso shaving puck, and they cut the closest out of all the blades I&#x27;ve tried in the last several years. I&#x27;ve tried a number of sampler packs and everytime end up coming back to these when I know I need a good clean shave. Every. Single. Time.</li>
