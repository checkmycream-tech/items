    <ol>
            <li>this is a great hairstyling accessory.</li>
            <li>Great way to get curls without irons.  </li>
            <li>Com and have been very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It is one of the best products I have ever bought and when my old one went on the blink I searched everywhere</li>
            <li>Gives wonderful body fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>, so glad to find what I wanted on line.</li>
            <li>I love amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love how well it works on my hair, so I just keep replacing it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush and will buy it from now on in place of the Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how quickly I am finished.</li>
            <li>The larger barrel works great on the top, which is longer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; works well.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago I had a hot air brush that was perfect</li>
            <li>Great for touching up or styling slightly damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush but it dies after a year or so</li>
            <li>More than one reviewer recommended the Salon Edition hot-air brush, saying it did exactly what The Perfecter did at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>This hot-air brush has literally cut my styling time in half, plus it is incredibly lightweight.</li>
            <li>for quick fix of hair or using it on semi wet hair it is great as doesn&#x27;t tangle hair.</li>
            <li>I went on Amazon and ordered three versions of the same type of brush, and I was truly pleased with the Salon Edition!  </li>
            <li>The reviews on The Perfecter basically said it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>How thrilled I am that the same brush is still being made - with improvements!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recommending it to a friend of mine because these particular dryers are no longer available in stores in 1 inch barrels.</li>
            <li>It appears to be better made than the cheap Vidal Sassoon brush, it has the same power (250 watts), and the teeth of the  brush appears to be much gentler on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had use a similar product prior to Helen of Troy; I am very pleased with the Salon Edition and have already purchased a another one!</li>
            <li>Anyhow, thanks for being there with this product when I need it and for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The smaller barrel is great for the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; version and liked it very much, but the larger diameter was a bit too much.  </li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thinning hair, but I found that if I use a 1\\&quot; hot air brush with a volumizing mousse, I could look like I still had a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser had recommended I look into The Perfecter, which does exactly what this brush does but costs $99.</li>
            <li>I have purchased and used this hot air brush before at Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>Both work very well on my medium-length, thinning, very fine hair; most stylers blow too hard and don&#x27;t let me control my hair.  </li>
            <li>I will write again if I find any problems with the brush or if it gives up the ghost much too soon.  </li>
            <li>I had  been looking for a replacement locally for quite some time and nothing came close to my original.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Vidal Sassoon 1\\&quot; hot air brush, but their quality has deteriorated considerably.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair tool.</li>
            <li>I have coarse curly hair and it straightens &amp; styles my hair better than a flat iron.       </li>
            <li>and I need to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Revlon version with interchangeable heads, only to find that the barrel of the brush was too large to hold and maneuver when drying my hair!  </li>
            <li>My order was filled and I had the product in less than 1 week.</li>
            <li>i should have contacted the seller, but was so busy with &#x27;life stuff&#x27;, that i didnt get it done...</li>
            <li>I used it every day with longer hair, but not so much with short hair.</li>
            <li>So far, so</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS DRY AND READY TO GO IN FIVE MINUTES.</li>
            <li>It dries the hair and gives it a soft curl at the same time.</li>
            <li>:  Found that if you shut off this brush for any reason during the drying period after a certain amount of time, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> So far, so</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS DRY AND READY TO GO IN FIVE MINUTES.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair and gives it a soft curl at the same time.</li>
            <li> :  Found that if you shut off this brush for any reason during the drying period after a certain amount of time, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down.  </li>
            <li> This is my third one I&#x27;ve had to buy - they only last about a one year with everyday use.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s only 250 watts), but it works extremely well as a styler on damp or even dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair until it is almost totally dry, then switch to this hot-air brush.</li>
            <li> This product works average for what is out there but doesn&#x27;t blow enough air out to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for coarse, long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been trying to make my last Vidal Sassoon brush last forever, which is difficult because they often stop working because they overheat, and then stop working at all after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Another brand was seriously under-powered and took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> In my city, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a hot air brush in the 1 inch--even at salon stores.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a safety feature, but it is very inconvenient if you are in a hurry to get ready.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area</li>
            <li> If I could get at least two years out of it, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> I have owned various types of curling hair dryers and this one is by far the worst, fell apart after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Drying is quite slow</li>
            <li> the item rotates weird, doesnt hold your hair correctly.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I ordered the wrong size.  </li>

            <li> I already had the 1 1/2\\&quot; version and liked it very much, but the larger diameter was a bit too much.  Both work very well on my medium-length, thinning, very fine hair; most stylers blow too hard and don&#x27;t let me control my hair.  Drying is quite slow (it&#x27;s only 250 watts), but it works extremely well as a styler on damp or even dry hair.  I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for coarse, long or thick hair.</li>
            <li> this is a great hairstyling accessory. My sister is a cosmotologist and recommends this product. I have coarse curly hair and it straightens &amp; styles my hair better than a flat iron.       The only downside is they only work for about a year then I have to throw it away. Maybe it&#x27;s because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Hard to find in my area, so glad to find what I wanted on line.</li>
            <li> the item rotates weird, doesnt hold your hair correctly. i should have contacted the seller, but was so busy with &#x27;life stuff&#x27;, that i didnt get it done...</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my hair.  It styles as it dries and saves me from having to put rollers in my hair.  I&#x27;m recommending it to a friend of mine because these particular dryers are no longer available in stores in 1 inch barrels.</li>
            <li> I had  been looking for a replacement locally for quite some time and nothing came close to my original.  Finally found it (this one!) on Amazon.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for about  3 years and I couldn&#x27;t do without it. It is one of the best products I have ever bought and when my old one went on the blink I searched everywhere and they are not to be found in any store. Thank goodness I found it on amazon. I love amazon.</li>
            <li> Great way to get curls without irons.  Gives wonderful body fast and easy.  This is my 3rd one.  Different sizes for different length hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! for quick fix of hair or using it on semi wet hair it is great as doesn&#x27;t tangle hair. I&#x27;ve used these for yrs and yrs.</li>
            <li> This product works average for what is out there but doesn&#x27;t blow enough air out to meet my needs. Several years ago I had a hot air brush that was perfect and unfortunately I&#x27;ve yet to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush but it dies after a year or so and I need to get a new one.  That&#x27;s not your fault, it&#x27;s the nature of the instrument.  Anyhow, thanks for being there with this product when I need it and for the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This hot-air brush has literally cut my styling time in half, plus it is incredibly lightweight. My hairdresser had recommended I look into The Perfecter, which does exactly what this brush does but costs $99. The reviews on The Perfecter basically said it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. More than one reviewer recommended the Salon Edition hot-air brush, saying it did exactly what The Perfecter did at a fraction of the cost. I have short hair, so I bought two, the 1&amp;#34; and 3/4&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m glad I did. The smaller barrel is great for the back of my hair. The larger barrel works great on the top, which is longer. I blow dry my hair until it is almost totally dry, then switch to this hot-air brush. It is amazing how quickly I am finished. My hair has lots of body and shine. I highly recommend this hair tool.</li>
            <li> Great for touching up or styling slightly damp hair.  I used it every day with longer hair, but not so much with short hair.</li>
            <li> DRIES AND STYLES HAIR AT THE SAME TIME. MY HAIR IS DRY AND READY TO GO IN FIVE MINUTES. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; works well.  This is the 2nd one l&#x27;ve bought &amp; when this one quits l&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> Works well but has a time limit to it</li>
            <li> This is my third one I&#x27;ve had to buy - they only last about a one year with everyday use.  I love how well it works on my hair, so I just keep replacing it.  If I could get at least two years out of it, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> I had use a similar product prior to Helen of Troy; I am very pleased with the Salon Edition and have already purchased a another one!</li>
            <li> I need the smaller diameter to curl my short hair but it is no longer being made. Thought this might work but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have owned various types of curling hair dryers and this one is by far the worst, fell apart after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version that lasted for years!  How thrilled I am that the same brush is still being made - with improvements!  I searched Amazon till I found it!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I ordered the wrong size.  Do you have one smaller than the one inch?</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used this hot air brush before at Amazon.Com and have been very satisfied with it.  It dries the hair and gives it a soft curl at the same time. My order was filled and I had the product in less than 1 week.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, thinning hair, but I found that if I use a 1\\&quot; hot air brush with a volumizing mousse, I could look like I still had a full head of hair.  I have been using the Vidal Sassoon 1\\&quot; hot air brush, but their quality has deteriorated considerably.  I would have to buy three at a time because two of them wouldn&#x27;t even work out of the package.  I had difficulty finding them in stores after a while, probably because of this reason.  I tried the Revlon version with interchangeable heads, only to find that the barrel of the brush was too large to hold and maneuver when drying my hair!  Another brand was seriously under-powered and took forever to dry my hair.  In my city, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find a hot air brush in the 1 inch--even at salon stores.

I went on Amazon and ordered three versions of the same type of brush, and I was truly pleased with the Salon Edition!  It does exactly what I want it to do.  It appears to be better made than the cheap Vidal Sassoon brush, it has the same power (250 watts), and the teeth of the  brush appears to be much gentler on my hair.  I LOVE this brush and will buy it from now on in place of the Vidal Sassoon.  I will write again if I find any problems with the brush or if it gives up the ghost much too soon.  So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ugh:  Found that if you shut off this brush for any reason during the drying period after a certain amount of time, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down.  Same problem as the Vidal Sassoon.  I guess it&#x27;s a safety feature, but it is very inconvenient if you are in a hurry to get ready.  Let&#x27;s hope it outlasts the Vidal Sassoon.</li>
