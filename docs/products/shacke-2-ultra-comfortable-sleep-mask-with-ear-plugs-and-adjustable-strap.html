            <li>Fits good on me but falls off my daughter.</li>
            <li>Good Product, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Masks are made of a very fine material and wear great.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the sleep mask!</li>
            <li>And so cute!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, they&#x27;re pretty much perfect!</li>
            <li>and so I sometimes have to sleep all day while the sun is shining and these work GREAT to keep the light out.  </li>
            <li>The strap is adjustable with velcro, which I found handy.</li>
            <li>This sits nicely and feels comfy on the nose too.</li>
            <li>The design is extremely effective and</li>
            <li>Liked fine until it stained my pillow cases!</li>
            <li>Great shipping speed and price is right.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sleep masks nightly for many years, but this is the best design I&#x27;ve come across so far.</li>
            <li>and it is still very comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>The eye mask is cute and is as advertised.</li>
            <li>Love that the masks include earplugs.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>I find that most are too big/bulky.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and does the job.</li>
            <li>It keeps all the light out, is soft, and fits great.  </li>
            <li>Shacke sent several emails after I purchased these to make sure I was happy with them.  </li>
            <li>Must be made of REALLY CHEAP material that is NOT colorfast.</li>
            <li>I went to register on your site in hopes of another free sleep mask, but as soon as I saw it did not come with a velcro strap</li>
            <li>Soft, cute, adjustable and durable!</li>
            <li>I did not use it personally; however, the recipient loved that it had ear plugs and a place to hold them.</li>
            <li>Nice mask - cute on the outside, soft on the inside, blocks out all light, sturdy adjustable strap.</li>
            <li>Best of all, and what really sets it apart from others I&#x27;ve used, is the way the sleep mask gently cups over the eyes, instead of pressing down on them.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, so comfortable on my face ear plugs shape to your ears</li>
            <li>There is an additional piece of fabric that lays over the bridge of the nose - this is actually very helpful in sealing out light that would otherwise creep in through the bottom.</li>
            <li>They are ultra soft and light weight, the adjustable straps help when I have my hair in a bun to loosen it up!  </li>
            <li>Soft and stylish.  </li>
            <li>so soft and cozy and fits perfectly on the face.</li>
            <li>Used it last nite and found it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised the item came so quickly.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really squeeze them into your ear.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t want it to be too loose or too tight, so this is great.</li>
            <li>Also, the inside fabric is very soft and breathable.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is the ear plugs that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Have had many masks in the past, some cheaper, none that stained my pillows!</li>
            <li>(I assume the freebies are an older, discontinued version), I left without registering.</li>
            <li>The broad elastic strap fastens and adjusts with velcro, so does not loosen overnight.</li>
            <li>I was also super shocked it came with two. :)</li>
            <li>only improvements I can suggest are (1) to make the earplug holsters a little more snug so the earplugs don&#x27;t fall out (not that I really care), and (2) to include a sturdy ziplock pouch to store at least one of the sleep masks for travel</li>
            <li>They are super big and hard to the point</li>
            <li>The included earplugs are nifty, just make sure the thick part of the earplug is all the way in the little loops or they will fall out.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Soft, cute, adjustable and durable! These are great!!!</li>
            <li> Liked fine until it stained my pillow cases! Must be made of REALLY CHEAP material that is NOT colorfast. Have had many masks in the past, some cheaper, none that stained my pillows! An inexpensive mask turned into an expensive mistake now that my pillow cases are ruined! Buyer beware! By the way, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this was so bad, I felt I had no choice.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is cute and is as advertised. I bought it as a gift, so I did not use it personally; however, the recipient loved that it had ear plugs and a place to hold them.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is great.  I no longer wake up at 5 am due to sunlight in my window.  It keeps all the light out, is soft, and fits great.  My grandson calls it his sunglasses.  Since there were 2 he gets to play with one as well.</li>
            <li> Love the sleep mask! I work shift work and so I sometimes have to sleep all day while the sun is shining and these work GREAT to keep the light out.  They are ultra soft and light weight, the adjustable straps help when I have my hair in a bun to loosen it up!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like is the ear plugs that come with it.  They are super big and hard to the point you can&#x27;t really squeeze them into your ear.  I use different ear plugs so it was not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised the item came so quickly.  Looks good and well made and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it, 2 for 1.  Used it last nite and found it to be very comfortable. Update: have now been using this sleep mask for a couple of months now and it is still very comfortable to use.  I wear it every night.</li>
            <li> Soft and stylish.  My daughter loves it. Perfect. Great shipping speed and price is right.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, so comfortable on my face ear plugs shape to your ears you can&#x27;t hear anything! won&#x27;t ever sleep without them again.</li>
            <li> The nose part of the mask was a little uncomfortable and the ear plugs didn&#x27;t fit at all</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome delivery time, great price!</li>
            <li> Very nice, don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on while sleeping!</li>
            <li> Would not stay on my face while I slept</li>
            <li> Cute, functional, wonderful velcro adjusting strap, and great addition to have ear plugs attached. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Received masks.  Masks are made of a very fine material and wear great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Nice masks and excellent customer service!  Shacke sent several emails after I purchased these to make sure I was happy with them.  Love that the masks include earplugs.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sleep mask, I can&#x27;t see how you could complain about this one. I chose the black since it was the least flashy option. The front is a silky nylon while the inside is a cozy fleece. There is an additional piece of fabric that lays over the bridge of the nose - this is actually very helpful in sealing out light that would otherwise creep in through the bottom. The strap is adjustable with velcro, which I found handy. You really don&#x27;t want it to be too loose or too tight, so this is great. The included earplugs are nifty, just make sure the thick part of the earplug is all the way in the little loops or they will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, can&#x27;t think of anything to be improved for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Love love love! so soft and cozy and fits perfectly on the face. I find that most are too big/bulky. This sits nicely and feels comfy on the nose too. And so cute!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sleep masks nightly for many years, but this is the best design I&#x27;ve come across so far. The broad elastic strap fastens and adjusts with velcro, so does not loosen overnight. This sleep mask is, as advertised, 100% lightproof. Best of all, and what really sets it apart from others I&#x27;ve used, is the way the sleep mask gently cups over the eyes, instead of pressing down on them. I found I can even open my eyes and blink while wearing them, yet they don&#x27;t look like goggles from the outside. Also, the inside fabric is very soft and breathable. The design is extremely effective and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note to Shackepak.com: I went to register on your site in hopes of another free sleep mask, but as soon as I saw it did not come with a velcro strap (I assume the freebies are an older, discontinued version), I left without registering. After experiencing your current product, I just can&#x27;t go back! But fear not, I will probably order from you again for just that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only improvements I can suggest are (1) to make the earplug holsters a little more snug so the earplugs don&#x27;t fall out (not that I really care), and (2) to include a sturdy ziplock pouch to store at least one of the sleep masks for travel (I have supplied my own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, they&#x27;re pretty much perfect!</li>
            <li> Love it but i wish they could be tightened. Fits good on me but falls off my daughter.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It&#x27;s cute and does the job. I was also super shocked it came with two. :)</li>
            <li> Nice mask - cute on the outside, soft on the inside, blocks out all light, sturdy adjustable strap.</li>
            <li> Good Product, as advertised. Shipped promptly</li>
