            <li>The Wahl Balder haircut kit is incredible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>BUT, all in all, this is a great trimmer to use if you don&#x27;t want to razor your head, and are happy with the \\&quot;day after\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great head shaving device.</li>
            <li>I used it to cut his hair instead of scissors and it was a great change.</li>
            <li>Great price but would not work with converter.</li>
            <li>If a man doesn&#x27;t need a close shave they work great on the face and neck, looks like a 5:00 shadow.  </li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>THE WAHL ULTRA CLOSE BALDER IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>It did the job great, but my arm and wrist was hurting before I was done.</li>
            <li>Works great, just wish it was cordless/battery operated.</li>

            <li>The price was really great too.</li>
            <li>After using these clippers, I could NOT be more impressed.  </li>
            <li>I bought these clippers because I had heard good things about the Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li>but if you Google Needle Nose reel oiler, you will find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer best as I can.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good device, but it doesn&#x27;t cut that close to the head to be called a Balder Ultra Close.</li>
            <li>This is as good as you&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good clippers for the money</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>Great machine:)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>excellent hair cutter with powerful motor.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>This kit is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>Check out that review if you&#x27;re interested in my thoughts on that SUPERB clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is mostly costumers who are abusing Amazon flexible return policy; but still!</li>
            <li>Shipping on this product was amazing as well.</li>
            <li>I had been using a beard trimmer to shave my head and ended up doing more harm than good over the years, as the beard trimmer would nick and scratch my head.  </li>
            <li>How this thing gets so many good reviews is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product and it delivered flawlessly.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is in the army and he needed a new one, this was perfect !</li>
            <li>Amazing clippers, best I have ever owned by far.</li>
            <li>It works great for that and does it quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I had had to return anything, and I was very impressed with how easy Amazon&#x27;s return process was.    </li>
            <li>Having seen that the guards were color coded, and replacements easy to find online, I went with these, and that first cut was AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for trimming \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is much more effective at hair removal.</li>
            <li>Good price, good quality and shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>Great service, the product was exactly what i was expecting to get.</li>
            <li>I do wish they had the thumb adjustment, but for the value and quality, they&#x27;ll do just fine!</li>
            <li>Very good product - shaves close and isn&#x27;t very loud.</li>
            <li>Is manageable and it comes with many option to cut hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>In fairness, it was doing way more shaving than Pansonic intended.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m Caucasian and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>Then if I want a more pristine, closer shave, I use shaving cream and 3 or 4 blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I am glad</li>
            <li>I had the Wahl Baldfader before this and the fact that the Balder does not have the adjuster lever makes the Balder better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It cuts much more closely and evenly and the teeth don&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It cuts your hair ok</li>
            <li>I was glad to get this set.</li>
            <li>It works better</li>
            <li>Still, OK for the price.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Within 3-4 minutes of talking with the helpful and courteous customer service representative she had already put in the order for my replacement clipper with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s OK,</li>
            <li>This thing is a monster, I love it.</li>
            <li>Couldnt find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Clippers work great and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I should have researched it more.</li>
            <li>1000 better than this balder.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>Works great, it does not cut as close as a razor because it not a razor, but it does cut very close.</li>
            <li>better than going to the barber.</li>
            <li>and it is cheap yet effective and yield almost bald cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Wonderful this is my second one if you want the bald look with out shaving</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind the look, you can literally save yourself hundreds of dollars a year, plus cut your hair more often for neater appearance.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, quiet and great quality!</li>
            <li>I bought it because I would have to be pretty damn good for styling afros into fades,</li>
            <li>The rest of the guides snapped into place perfectly, but they were all too long for our purposes.    </li>
            <li>Otherwise, they&#x27;re pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has been great as far as returning it tho :)</li>
            <li>I needed some trimmer for my 3 lil boys and my husband and so far these are great.</li>
            <li>Great set of clippers is like haveing a professional set of them in the house.</li>
            <li>This set of clippers produces a VERY close trim, closer than I was accustomed to, and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The blades were sharp, aligned perfectly and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li>The 1/16\\&quot; fit a bit better, but did not feel totally secure.  </li>
            <li>Unlike a razor, it&#x27;s easy on the face.</li>
            <li>* Easy to carry and store with the plastic box    </li>
            <li>The Wahl clipper is easy to hold and does a geat job.</li>
            <li>However, the comb and blade are easily resharpened, just google for how-to instructional videos.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with many attachments and it runs smooth and easy clean up with brush</li>
            <li>(none of them fit any better than the original ones, however).  </li>
            <li>is basically like the day after a blade shave- one day&#x27;s worth of very fine stubble or thereabouts.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, great product, I&#x27;m loving it even after all those months after purchase</li>
            <li>Years ago I replaced mine with a cheap medium bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The case has no compartments that are molded to fit the buzzer snugly.</li>
            <li>a side note: Amazon&#x27;s customer service was FANTASTIC when I called them about receiving a used clipper.</li>
            <li>It cuts nice and short if you like (and I surely do) and has attachments for many needs.</li>
            <li>After 3 or 4 usage I am so comfortable.</li>
            <li>* Easy to clean and maintain  </li>
            <li>I am just as happy with this one as I was with my last one.</li>
            <li>Great for bald fades for a former Army NCO like myself.</li>
            <li>I has a good weight (just like a professional one).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;equipment is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>my head so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this model would be a keeper.</li>
            <li>Also, neither my original or replacement clipper came with a bottle of oil.</li>
            <li>This item was paired with an original, and does not meet the before mentioned.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price its a great razor that shaves just as good as some of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li>I use Diawa brand fishing reel oil because the tube lasts forever and it is an extremely clean and lightweight oil.</li>
            <li>I can get a nearly clean shave on his head.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to others and it&#x27;s really worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes excellent clippers, so it wasn&#x27;t a hard decision to make brand-wise.  </li>
            <li>they last a good while and work well, but I do replace them from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;-First</li>
            <li>So, for me, it&#x27;s a good overall shave.  </li>
            <li>The packaging photos will lend ideas to anyone who is talented enough to replicate the styles shown.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would have been a good purchase for my \\&quot;future</li>
            <li>I could get more bald, but i would have to use a razor blade, and that&#x27;s just too much work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 69 years old and never cut my own hair before.  </li>
            <li>corded nature of it means you&#x27;ll always have full power.</li>
            <li>It is much stronger and more resilient than the Wahls they were making 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>I would buy clippers straight from the manufacturer to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>And of course, the guard offers a more pleasant feeling to the head as compared to using bare blades, which can scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li>The good, still works, was brand new when I received it and cuts really close.</li>
            <li>For this $32 (when we bought it) we have recovered our money back many, many times over.  </li>
            <li>cut out of this thing, but it&#x27;s pretty close, which is good enough for me, and it&#x27;s quick and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my experience AMAZON&#x27;s customer service is top notch, on the 2 instances I&#x27;ve needed refunds or new products been sent out there has never been an issue</li>
            <li>Overall, if you trim your hair really close, this is a great kit at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This clipper will literally pay for itself in under two months for a single person, and a even more for families, although most kids will not appreciate Dad&#x27;s DIY economizing effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has many extra features, but we mainly use it to shave his head (smooth).</li>
            <li>Not to mention when you flip the switch on this thing you get a nice solid &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; and this things roars to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It cuts my hair close enough that it looks like a shave without the nicks from cheap razor blades or the expense of the top of the line blades.  </li>
            <li>I started self-DIY buzz-cuts about 5 years ago, after paying thousands of dollars over many years for professional barbering at $15/3weeks.  </li>
            <li>I wear my head bald but can&#x27;t use a razor these clippers are the next best thing I have had other clippers</li>
            <li>In other words, you get so close with these clippers that it feels like the day after having used a razor to shave your head - they&#x27;re THAT good.    </li>
            <li>on time and right box.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it seems geared that way since it is great for everyone.</li>
            <li>, the guides on the wahl set are top notch, just wish there were a few more.</li>
            <li>You can easily fit the accessories back in it without having to try to figure out how to get it to fit.</li>
            <li>This is a no brainer purchase and cuts very, very close.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My husband is balding on the top, and we were looking for clippers that would allow me to cut the rest of his hair really short and that could also be used to trim his beard.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough I found it for about $22 and change.</li>
            <li>These clippers run more quiet than the Remington or Conair, etc.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li>but IF you do buy ANY clippers, always try it on your arm first or check the blades.    </li>
            <li>The machine makes a loud sound even after being adjusted.</li>
            <li>This has saved us SO much money!  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Will continue with this buyer for more of same product.</li>
            <li>and it seems to give a more even cut then my last set</li>
            <li>I have a regular Wahl clipper, which worked OK, but since I&#x27;m balding on the top, I starting shaving my head, and when I knew about</li>
            <li>When I lift the product first time it was sticky like someone used it already.</li>
            <li>So be aware of that.    </li>
            <li>I am using the trimmer first time</li>
            <li>Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  </li>
            <li>You do not fix what is not broken!...</li>
            <li>first use the guide combs to avoid accidently cuts or irriation.</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer does exactly as I wanted it to do and as it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny of the reasonable asking price.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Really like how close the shave is for my husband&#x27;s chrome dome!  </li>
            <li>When yoou turn them on they feel like a good clipper not a cheap set and all plastic.</li>
            <li>Just use reasonable pressure and the right angle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head with buzzers on and off (mostly on) for the last 15 years and have used all types and brands of buzzers and this one is just average.</li>
            <li>Tip: If you are using an electric razor to shave your head for the first time, don&#x27;t adjust the blades to go very close at first.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason this is getting one star rating is because Amazon.com sent it out in good time &amp; it is not there actual product.  </li>
            <li>Fast, powerful and give a very close cut-</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow instructions and keep oiling after every use to keep the clippers sharp and fresh.</li>
            <li>The clipper did not get hot within this period of time; maybe just a little bit warm.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it if you are looking for one simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong and yet really quiet.</li>
            <li>My last set lasted me 7 years and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>They are very well made, fast, powerful and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>This certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>I rated this product low because Amazon sent the razors with fine hairs in them as if they had been used.  </li>
            <li>Bought my first around 15 years ago from Sears, then my second just over a year ago when the original died.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as a quick buzzer or haircutting kit!</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, which is good, but makes it a little too easy to scrape my skin.  </li>
            <li>the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave the clippers two stars rather than one is that their customer service was very responsive.  </li>
            <li>have been shaving my whole head as close as I can get it (boot camp style) without using a straight/safety razor for twenty years.</li>
            <li>I shave my head at the shortest setting sans any guards and it get so very close, but it has never ever nicked me.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOr</li>
            <li>Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPO</li>
            <li>So now I can send him in during a TV commercial to smooth off his face from any stubble he has.</li>
            <li>it is so much easier than using scissors and faster too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a real &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It gets very close for a shaved look without the irritation.</li>
            <li>Without the guard, the clippers provide a very close cut.</li>
            <li>a very close bald fade look if you want to cut your hair that close.  </li>
            <li>The lower blade had the exact thickness of a normal clipper set and cuts just like it.</li>
            <li>This feels, looks, and sounds like a quality tool and it cuts very well.  </li>
            <li>Not as much vibration when using either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped my clipper once and broke the outermost tip off the comb - the shiny stainless steel part that holds the clip in place.  </li>
            <li>This one has never broken in--since day one, it&#x27;s been SUPER-painful, and immediately puts a straight cut in skin, if not marks.  </li>
            <li>I have to keep a finger on the clipper the whole time while using</li>
            <li>This is a great time saver for me, and I hate wasting time on this kind of remedial task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get the right angles and get it short enough in areas I couldn&#x27;t do before.</li>
            <li>He first thought it was just him being too aggressive with new clippers until tonight when I trimmed my sons (19) neckline for him without the comb on, just how the hairdresser or barber does.  </li>
            <li>The original, sold in most walmarts, had a very thin and fine lower blade.</li>
            <li>If you desire a clean cut professional look with the at home price tag these clippers and any of the Wahl professional line products are the way to go.</li>
            <li>This kit includes five other guards if you want to leave more hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great clipper if you want to get as close to slick as possible without using a blade.</li>
            <li>Amazon really needs to check the stuff they ship out, especially after so many complaints of the same problem.</li>
            <li>Most usually go down to 1/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It does a ok job and cuts closer than my previous wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need, and includes a quick picture reference guide on how to make all the short buzz cuts step by step...</li>
            <li>these simply work alot better, youve got all the guards you need for short styles.</li>
            <li>I am bald on the top, with some hair left around the sides and back.  </li>
            <li>I used another Wahl haircut trimmer similar to this one for many years until I managed to break several of the comb attachments.</li>
            <li>Nothing more than a glorified regular hair trimmer like the regular Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li>Main criteria for my barbar ( wife )is that the clipper be manageable as she stands with one hand on her walker as she trims me.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to its durability because I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but my previous Wahl clippers have been around for more than 5 years (and without much maintenance), so I am confident this one will last for a decent amount of time as well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>They are used for keeping the back of his neck tidy in between trips to the barber, plus other body hair he wishes to trim.  </li>
            <li>Most shavers don&#x27;t get close enough, or anywhere near close enough, for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Besides, you can beat it for the price and Wahl has always made a good, if not great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new clipper after using this one for 6 months.</li>
            <li>These clippers were suppose to be new</li>
            <li>But, I can always buy a new set of guards to suit my needs.</li>
            <li>Additionally, when you properly oil the blades and then use the toothbrush again a few times after oiling, you will then have a nice oil-primed brush for cleaning which you can toss in the flimsy case.</li>
            <li>The motor is a bit weaker (I know I&#x27;m comparing a HOME KIT to a PROFESSIONAL KIT) compared to my Wahl 5 Star Series Balding Clipper (clippers that I would highly recommend), but it does get the job done - barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I mean good chunks of skin that a week later are still scabbing over.  </li>
            <li>It just works as good as the other regular Wahl clipper, maybe a little bit better since it&#x27;s a new clipper (the other one I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years or so) but speaking of how close to the head</li>
            <li>Full of small hairs from where the last owner didnt throughly clean it to make it look like new before it was returned and resold to me.  </li>
            <li>It works better as a normal hair clipper, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at least, but it takes hundreds of passes to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>The closest cut available and will last as long as you take care of them.</li>
            <li>After many years another brand&#x27;s hair clippers finally shut down, so I went looking for a replacement and came up with this kit.  </li>
            <li>The cost of buying the replacement attachments was about the same as the whole new set, so I figured, why not?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, the included green guard (1/16\\&quot;) cuts to a length that I really like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neighborhood unofficial barber (high school and college) - shaved heads, mohawks, creative ridiculous and almost embarrassing hairstyles</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed is that the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; plastic strip in the middle of the clipper (where the logo is located) scratches really easily (or I was not so careful with it, I don&#x27;t know!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handle-blade combination that offers a shave contoured to the head to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Wahl clippers were in need of replacement after about 12 years of bi-weekly hair cuts, so I naturally began reading reviews of clippers on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Included is a light green guard which feels like a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; silicon material.</li>
            <li>my scalp and cut me like my old Sunbeam clippers do.</li>
            <li>While It was not a total balding effect, it got VERY close.  </li>
            <li>My clippers were old and broke.</li>
            <li>It is working well, so far.</li>
            <li>Who knows, I might be surprised again.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my finance and it came all in one piece with no missing pieces.</li>
            <li>I also use that guard to keep my beard to a day old length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white with straight, medium texture hair, and this trimmer works well.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud and still got a rather close trim.</li>
            <li>Beats the heck out of our old clippers.</li>
            <li>I really bought it for the short guard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as against-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Throwing out my old battery charging hair cutters now.</li>
            <li>Get the Peanut if you want a close &#x27;day old&#x27; shave.</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin dont get to close at</li>
            <li>My old set of clippers needed replacing and when I got these they did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Gave this to my husband as a Christmas gift to replace his old razor.  </li>
            <li>I have given it to a friend who is a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li>The teeth are much closer together than the standard Wahl, but you can still cut yourself with it.  </li>
            <li>I received this last week and have used it a few times so far...much better than the $10 clippers I had been using.</li>
            <li>BE CAREFUL around your ears with no guards it will cut skin real easy; found out the hard way.</li>
            <li>First the cleavers were oxidized such as if already it had been used before and second does not cut as in the description he was saying I do not recommend her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfy with this product and hope it last as my last clipper.</li>
            <li>only drawback for me is that the clippers get hot very quickly, just as other reviewers had previously mentioned.  </li>
            <li>Wahl replacement combs cost half as much as this entire \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;, so I put up with the busted comb for months, then eventually replaced it with a whole new \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>blade starts getting dull after about 6 haircuts, so you have to go slower and make more passes to get same result.  </li>
            <li>Thought this item was going to be NEW, but as it turned out it was refurbished and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve owned, and it gets right down to where you would have to use a shaving blade if you wante it any closer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most hair clippers come with this absurdly small useless thing that looks suitable for an archaeological dig for microscopic artifacts.</li>
            <li>and they generally just don&#x27;t do the job well or fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely even touched his skin with it.  </li>
            <li>While I expected the whole unit to be a shiny silver, looks are not everything.</li>
            <li>My husband dropped our old &amp;#34;balder&amp;#34; that we purchased from a big box company, so we bought this to replace it.</li>
            <li>true to its name and mark, ive been using these clippers for the past year or so</li>
            <li>While I rarely shave my head I do keep it trim with these clippers a few times a week.</li>
            <li>The clippers pull a little when they cut, and I would like to have a few more selections of length in the attachments.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to remove, but a little harder to reassemble and position properly,  There are also instructional videos explaining how to align comb when reassembling clipper after blade</li>
            <li>I did cut myself the first time just a little, but that was with no attachment.</li>
            <li>far as the length of the cut with these clippers it was short but not short enough for my liking.</li>
            <li>Do not use for trimming, these clippers cut really close and the blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li>I had no reason to deviate from Whal as my brand of choice and felt this clipper kit would meet my needs, but I was a little leery of an online purchase after having read so many negative reviews about possibly having received used clippers.</li>

            <li> best as I can.</li>

            <li> For me this is the perfect length-</li>

            <li> The Wahl Balder haircut kit is incredible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> BUT, all in all, this is a great trimmer to use if you don&#x27;t want to razor your head, and are happy with the \\&quot;day after\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is a great head shaving device.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut his hair instead of scissors and it was a great change.</li>
            <li> Great price but would not work with converter.</li>
            <li> If a man doesn&#x27;t need a close shave they work great on the face and neck, looks like a 5:00 shadow.  </li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> THE WAHL ULTRA CLOSE BALDER IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> It did the job great, but my arm and wrist was hurting before I was done.</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish it was cordless/battery operated.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great</li>

            <li> The price was really great too.</li>
            <li> After using these clippers, I could NOT be more impressed.  </li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I had heard good things about the Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li> but if you Google Needle Nose reel oiler, you will find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer best as I can.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good device, but it doesn&#x27;t cut that close to the head to be called a Balder Ultra Close.</li>
            <li> This is as good as you&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good clippers for the money</li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> Great machine:)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent hair cutter with powerful motor.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> This kit is fabulous!!  </li>
            <li> Check out that review if you&#x27;re interested in my thoughts on that SUPERB clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is mostly costumers who are abusing Amazon flexible return policy; but still!</li>
            <li> Shipping on this product was amazing as well.</li>
            <li> I had been using a beard trimmer to shave my head and ended up doing more harm than good over the years, as the beard trimmer would nick and scratch my head.  </li>
            <li> How this thing gets so many good reviews is beyond me.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product and it delivered flawlessly.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is in the army and he needed a new one, this was perfect !</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers, best I have ever owned by far.</li>
            <li> It works great for that and does it quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I had had to return anything, and I was very impressed with how easy Amazon&#x27;s return process was.    </li>
            <li> Having seen that the guards were color coded, and replacements easy to find online, I went with these, and that first cut was AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for trimming \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is much more effective at hair removal.</li>
            <li> Good price, good quality and shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> Great service, the product was exactly what i was expecting to get.</li>
            <li> I do wish they had the thumb adjustment, but for the value and quality, they&#x27;ll do just fine!</li>
            <li> Very good product - shaves close and isn&#x27;t very loud.</li>
            <li> Is manageable and it comes with many option to cut hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> In fairness, it was doing way more shaving than Pansonic intended.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m Caucasian and I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> Then if I want a more pristine, closer shave, I use shaving cream and 3 or 4 blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I am glad</li>
            <li> I had the Wahl Baldfader before this and the fact that the Balder does not have the adjuster lever makes the Balder better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It cuts much more closely and evenly and the teeth don&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It cuts your hair ok</li>
            <li> I was glad to get this set.</li>
            <li> It works better</li>
            <li> Still, OK for the price.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Within 3-4 minutes of talking with the helpful and courteous customer service representative she had already put in the order for my replacement clipper with free 2 day shipping.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s OK,</li>
            <li> This thing is a monster, I love it.</li>
            <li> Couldnt find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Clippers work great and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I should have researched it more.</li>
            <li> 1000 better than this balder.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> Works great, it does not cut as close as a razor because it not a razor, but it does cut very close.</li>
            <li> better than going to the barber.</li>
            <li> and it is cheap yet effective and yield almost bald cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Wonderful this is my second one if you want the bald look with out shaving</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind the look, you can literally save yourself hundreds of dollars a year, plus cut your hair more often for neater appearance.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, quiet and great quality!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I would have to be pretty damn good for styling afros into fades,</li>
            <li> The rest of the guides snapped into place perfectly, but they were all too long for our purposes.    </li>
            <li> Otherwise, they&#x27;re pretty good for the price.  </li>
            <li> Amazon has been great as far as returning it tho :)</li>
            <li> I needed some trimmer for my 3 lil boys and my husband and so far these are great.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers is like haveing a professional set of them in the house.</li>
            <li> This set of clippers produces a VERY close trim, closer than I was accustomed to, and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> The blades were sharp, aligned perfectly and in pristine condition.</li>
            <li> The 1/16\\&quot; fit a bit better, but did not feel totally secure.  </li>
            <li> Unlike a razor, it&#x27;s easy on the face.</li>
            <li> * Easy to carry and store with the plastic box    </li>
            <li> The Wahl clipper is easy to hold and does a geat job.</li>
            <li> However, the comb and blade are easily resharpened, just google for how-to instructional videos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with many attachments and it runs smooth and easy clean up with brush</li>
            <li> (none of them fit any better than the original ones, however).  </li>
            <li> is basically like the day after a blade shave- one day&#x27;s worth of very fine stubble or thereabouts.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great product, I&#x27;m loving it even after all those months after purchase</li>
            <li> Years ago I replaced mine with a cheap medium bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The case has no compartments that are molded to fit the buzzer snugly.</li>
            <li> a side note: Amazon&#x27;s customer service was FANTASTIC when I called them about receiving a used clipper.</li>
            <li> It cuts nice and short if you like (and I surely do) and has attachments for many needs.</li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 usage I am so comfortable.</li>
            <li> * Easy to clean and maintain  </li>
            <li> I am just as happy with this one as I was with my last one.</li>
            <li> Great for bald fades for a former Army NCO like myself.</li>
            <li> I has a good weight (just like a professional one).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;equipment is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> my head so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this model would be a keeper.</li>
            <li> Also, neither my original or replacement clipper came with a bottle of oil.</li>
            <li> This item was paired with an original, and does not meet the before mentioned.</li>
            <li> Still, for the price its a great razor that shaves just as good as some of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> I use Diawa brand fishing reel oil because the tube lasts forever and it is an extremely clean and lightweight oil.</li>
            <li> I can get a nearly clean shave on his head.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to others and it&#x27;s really worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes excellent clippers, so it wasn&#x27;t a hard decision to make brand-wise.  </li>
            <li> they last a good while and work well, but I do replace them from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;-First</li>
            <li> So, for me, it&#x27;s a good overall shave.  </li>
            <li> The packaging photos will lend ideas to anyone who is talented enough to replicate the styles shown.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have been a good purchase for my \\&quot;future</li>
            <li> I could get more bald, but i would have to use a razor blade, and that&#x27;s just too much work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and never cut my own hair before.  </li>
            <li> corded nature of it means you&#x27;ll always have full power.</li>
            <li> It is much stronger and more resilient than the Wahls they were making 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I would buy clippers straight from the manufacturer to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> And of course, the guard offers a more pleasant feeling to the head as compared to using bare blades, which can scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li> The good, still works, was brand new when I received it and cuts really close.</li>
            <li> For this $32 (when we bought it) we have recovered our money back many, many times over.  </li>
            <li> cut out of this thing, but it&#x27;s pretty close, which is good enough for me, and it&#x27;s quick and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience AMAZON&#x27;s customer service is top notch, on the 2 instances I&#x27;ve needed refunds or new products been sent out there has never been an issue</li>
            <li> Overall, if you trim your hair really close, this is a great kit at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This clipper will literally pay for itself in under two months for a single person, and a even more for families, although most kids will not appreciate Dad&#x27;s DIY economizing effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has many extra features, but we mainly use it to shave his head (smooth).</li>
            <li> Not to mention when you flip the switch on this thing you get a nice solid &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; and this things roars to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It cuts my hair close enough that it looks like a shave without the nicks from cheap razor blades or the expense of the top of the line blades.  </li>
            <li> I started self-DIY buzz-cuts about 5 years ago, after paying thousands of dollars over many years for professional barbering at $15/3weeks.  </li>
            <li> I wear my head bald but can&#x27;t use a razor these clippers are the next best thing I have had other clippers</li>
            <li> In other words, you get so close with these clippers that it feels like the day after having used a razor to shave your head - they&#x27;re THAT good.    </li>
            <li> on time and right box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it seems geared that way since it is great for everyone.</li>
            <li> , the guides on the wahl set are top notch, just wish there were a few more.</li>
            <li> You can easily fit the accessories back in it without having to try to figure out how to get it to fit.</li>
            <li> This is a no brainer purchase and cuts very, very close.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My husband is balding on the top, and we were looking for clippers that would allow me to cut the rest of his hair really short and that could also be used to trim his beard.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough I found it for about $22 and change.</li>
            <li> These clippers run more quiet than the Remington or Conair, etc.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li> but IF you do buy ANY clippers, always try it on your arm first or check the blades.    </li>
            <li> The machine makes a loud sound even after being adjusted.</li>
            <li> This has saved us SO much money!  </li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Will continue with this buyer for more of same product.</li>
            <li> and it seems to give a more even cut then my last set</li>
            <li> I have a regular Wahl clipper, which worked OK, but since I&#x27;m balding on the top, I starting shaving my head, and when I knew about</li>
            <li> When I lift the product first time it was sticky like someone used it already.</li>
            <li> So be aware of that.    </li>
            <li> I am using the trimmer first time</li>
            <li> Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  </li>
            <li> You do not fix what is not broken!...</li>
            <li> first use the guide combs to avoid accidently cuts or irriation.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer does exactly as I wanted it to do and as it was advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny of the reasonable asking price.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Really like how close the shave is for my husband&#x27;s chrome dome!  </li>
            <li> When yoou turn them on they feel like a good clipper not a cheap set and all plastic.</li>
            <li> Just use reasonable pressure and the right angle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head with buzzers on and off (mostly on) for the last 15 years and have used all types and brands of buzzers and this one is just average.</li>
            <li> Tip: If you are using an electric razor to shave your head for the first time, don&#x27;t adjust the blades to go very close at first.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason this is getting one star rating is because Amazon.com sent it out in good time &amp; it is not there actual product.  </li>
            <li> Fast, powerful and give a very close cut-</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow instructions and keep oiling after every use to keep the clippers sharp and fresh.</li>
            <li> The clipper did not get hot within this period of time; maybe just a little bit warm.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you are looking for one simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong and yet really quiet.</li>
            <li> My last set lasted me 7 years and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> They are very well made, fast, powerful and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> This certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> I rated this product low because Amazon sent the razors with fine hairs in them as if they had been used.  </li>
            <li> Bought my first around 15 years ago from Sears, then my second just over a year ago when the original died.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as a quick buzzer or haircutting kit!</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, which is good, but makes it a little too easy to scrape my skin.  </li>
            <li> the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave the clippers two stars rather than one is that their customer service was very responsive.  </li>
            <li> have been shaving my whole head as close as I can get it (boot camp style) without using a straight/safety razor for twenty years.</li>
            <li> I shave my head at the shortest setting sans any guards and it get so very close, but it has never ever nicked me.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOr</li>
            <li> Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPO</li>
            <li> So now I can send him in during a TV commercial to smooth off his face from any stubble he has.</li>
            <li> it is so much easier than using scissors and faster too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a real &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It gets very close for a shaved look without the irritation.</li>
            <li> Without the guard, the clippers provide a very close cut.</li>
            <li> a very close bald fade look if you want to cut your hair that close.  </li>
            <li> The lower blade had the exact thickness of a normal clipper set and cuts just like it.</li>
            <li> This feels, looks, and sounds like a quality tool and it cuts very well.  </li>
            <li> Not as much vibration when using either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped my clipper once and broke the outermost tip off the comb - the shiny stainless steel part that holds the clip in place.  </li>
            <li> This one has never broken in--since day one, it&#x27;s been SUPER-painful, and immediately puts a straight cut in skin, if not marks.  </li>
            <li> I have to keep a finger on the clipper the whole time while using</li>
            <li> This is a great time saver for me, and I hate wasting time on this kind of remedial task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get the right angles and get it short enough in areas I couldn&#x27;t do before.</li>
            <li> He first thought it was just him being too aggressive with new clippers until tonight when I trimmed my sons (19) neckline for him without the comb on, just how the hairdresser or barber does.  </li>
            <li> The original, sold in most walmarts, had a very thin and fine lower blade.</li>
            <li> If you desire a clean cut professional look with the at home price tag these clippers and any of the Wahl professional line products are the way to go.</li>
            <li> This kit includes five other guards if you want to leave more hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great clipper if you want to get as close to slick as possible without using a blade.</li>
            <li> Amazon really needs to check the stuff they ship out, especially after so many complaints of the same problem.</li>
            <li> Most usually go down to 1/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It does a ok job and cuts closer than my previous wahl clipper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need, and includes a quick picture reference guide on how to make all the short buzz cuts step by step...</li>
            <li> these simply work alot better, youve got all the guards you need for short styles.</li>
            <li> I am bald on the top, with some hair left around the sides and back.  </li>
            <li> I used another Wahl haircut trimmer similar to this one for many years until I managed to break several of the comb attachments.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than a glorified regular hair trimmer like the regular Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Main criteria for my barbar ( wife )is that the clipper be manageable as she stands with one hand on her walker as she trims me.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to its durability because I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but my previous Wahl clippers have been around for more than 5 years (and without much maintenance), so I am confident this one will last for a decent amount of time as well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.    </li>
            <li> highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> They are used for keeping the back of his neck tidy in between trips to the barber, plus other body hair he wishes to trim.  </li>
            <li> Most shavers don&#x27;t get close enough, or anywhere near close enough, for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Besides, you can beat it for the price and Wahl has always made a good, if not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a new clipper after using this one for 6 months.</li>
            <li> These clippers were suppose to be new</li>
            <li> But, I can always buy a new set of guards to suit my needs.</li>
            <li> Additionally, when you properly oil the blades and then use the toothbrush again a few times after oiling, you will then have a nice oil-primed brush for cleaning which you can toss in the flimsy case.</li>
            <li> The motor is a bit weaker (I know I&#x27;m comparing a HOME KIT to a PROFESSIONAL KIT) compared to my Wahl 5 Star Series Balding Clipper (clippers that I would highly recommend), but it does get the job done - barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I mean good chunks of skin that a week later are still scabbing over.  </li>
            <li> It just works as good as the other regular Wahl clipper, maybe a little bit better since it&#x27;s a new clipper (the other one I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years or so) but speaking of how close to the head</li>
            <li> Full of small hairs from where the last owner didnt throughly clean it to make it look like new before it was returned and resold to me.  </li>
            <li> It works better as a normal hair clipper, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at least, but it takes hundreds of passes to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> The closest cut available and will last as long as you take care of them.</li>
            <li> After many years another brand&#x27;s hair clippers finally shut down, so I went looking for a replacement and came up with this kit.  </li>
            <li> The cost of buying the replacement attachments was about the same as the whole new set, so I figured, why not?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily, the included green guard (1/16\\&quot;) cuts to a length that I really like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neighborhood unofficial barber (high school and college) - shaved heads, mohawks, creative ridiculous and almost embarrassing hairstyles</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed is that the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; plastic strip in the middle of the clipper (where the logo is located) scratches really easily (or I was not so careful with it, I don&#x27;t know!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handle-blade combination that offers a shave contoured to the head to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Wahl clippers were in need of replacement after about 12 years of bi-weekly hair cuts, so I naturally began reading reviews of clippers on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Included is a light green guard which feels like a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; silicon material.</li>
            <li> my scalp and cut me like my old Sunbeam clippers do.</li>
            <li> While It was not a total balding effect, it got VERY close.  </li>
            <li> My clippers were old and broke.</li>
            <li> It is working well, so far.</li>
            <li> Who knows, I might be surprised again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my finance and it came all in one piece with no missing pieces.</li>
            <li> I also use that guard to keep my beard to a day old length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with straight, medium texture hair, and this trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud and still got a rather close trim.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of our old clippers.</li>
            <li> I really bought it for the short guard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as against-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throwing out my old battery charging hair cutters now.</li>
            <li> Get the Peanut if you want a close &#x27;day old&#x27; shave.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin dont get to close at</li>
            <li> My old set of clippers needed replacing and when I got these they did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband as a Christmas gift to replace his old razor.  </li>
            <li> I have given it to a friend who is a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> The teeth are much closer together than the standard Wahl, but you can still cut yourself with it.  </li>
            <li> I received this last week and have used it a few times so far...much better than the $10 clippers I had been using.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL around your ears with no guards it will cut skin real easy; found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> First the cleavers were oxidized such as if already it had been used before and second does not cut as in the description he was saying I do not recommend her</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfy with this product and hope it last as my last clipper.</li>
            <li> only drawback for me is that the clippers get hot very quickly, just as other reviewers had previously mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Wahl replacement combs cost half as much as this entire \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;, so I put up with the busted comb for months, then eventually replaced it with a whole new \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> blade starts getting dull after about 6 haircuts, so you have to go slower and make more passes to get same result.  </li>
            <li> Thought this item was going to be NEW, but as it turned out it was refurbished and didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve owned, and it gets right down to where you would have to use a shaving blade if you wante it any closer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most hair clippers come with this absurdly small useless thing that looks suitable for an archaeological dig for microscopic artifacts.</li>
            <li> and they generally just don&#x27;t do the job well or fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely even touched his skin with it.  </li>
            <li> While I expected the whole unit to be a shiny silver, looks are not everything.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped our old &amp;#34;balder&amp;#34; that we purchased from a big box company, so we bought this to replace it.</li>
            <li> true to its name and mark, ive been using these clippers for the past year or so</li>
            <li> While I rarely shave my head I do keep it trim with these clippers a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The clippers pull a little when they cut, and I would like to have a few more selections of length in the attachments.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to remove, but a little harder to reassemble and position properly,  There are also instructional videos explaining how to align comb when reassembling clipper after blade</li>
            <li> I did cut myself the first time just a little, but that was with no attachment.</li>
            <li> far as the length of the cut with these clippers it was short but not short enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> Do not use for trimming, these clippers cut really close and the blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I had no reason to deviate from Whal as my brand of choice and felt this clipper kit would meet my needs, but I was a little leery of an online purchase after having read so many negative reviews about possibly having received used clippers.</li>
            <li> The guards seem more sturdy than the other brands, which have always broken on me over time, and replacement guards for the others have always been more difficult to find online than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy like the salon&#x27;s, and sharp enough to use every three days for a pretty short, almost bald look.</li>
            <li> Only suggestion would be if you use it alot like i do maybe buy a new one after a few years as the blades will eventually become duller.</li>
            <li> That guard on my other Wahl trimmers was not a good fit and would even fall off at times.</li>
            <li> Long enough cord for plugging it in.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m concerned at how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Hope to have it as long as the last set.</li>
            <li> , it gets to the exact length I want on my face (a little less than a days growth).</li>
            <li> When we looked further at the clippers, we saw that the blade had not been put in correctly, so the razor sharp blade was actually sticking up out of the claw &amp; was basically scalping them both.    </li>
            <li> In the pictures its looks grey</li>
            <li> My husband cut his hair last weekend, he is military so uses no combs on it,</li>
            <li> While this product DOES give you a Close Haircut, it will NOT complete Balding as the name and photos imply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And it lasted me that long.</li>
            <li> I feel like I will have them for a long time.</li>
            <li> This clipper is one of a few that includes a 1/16\\&quot; (1.5 mm) adaptor (one other is the Professional Balder by Wahl for double the price).  </li>
            <li> I had tried other clippers which left the stubble too long.  </li>
            <li> The Balder Ultra Close is a very clean cutting shaver.  </li>
            <li> As one other reviewer mentioned, you get that &#x27;next day&#x27; stubble feel.  </li>
            <li> These clip shorter than the other Wahl clippers, but it&#x27;s not as short as shaving.  </li>
            <li> Having used and owned other clippers decided to go back with the wahl baldfader, again, the newer product is improved which says a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its similar to other kits but provides a closer cuts for those who want a close shave.</li>
            <li> but isn&#x27;t razor close like other clippers such as Wahl Balding clippers.</li>
            <li> it comes with is decently sized and is a hard plastic case.</li>
            <li> When working, it is not particularly quite, but not loud either.  </li>
            <li> what is more frustrating that it is too late to return it according to Amazon policy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved my hair in about 1/3rd less time, and spent less time needing to go back over it to catch any wild hairs.</li>
            <li> Also cuts in a single pass</li>
            <li> My husband is lazy and his skin is sensitive so he avoids shaving.</li>
            <li> This razor works, but I swear my 3 year old drug store purchased Remington (that has never been greased) works just as well, if not better than this razor.</li>
            <li> Now, if you&#x27;re looking to do some trimming with the clippers, they are so loosely attached, that they sometimes fall off, which can cause a bald spot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver, even with a guard on it, gets it close enough that for 90% of my days, I feel no need to break out a razor and go all the way down.</li>
            <li> and it finally broke down on me.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it break down on me</li>
            <li> The bad, it could use a lever to adjust the high, it does come with some short clips, but i normally prefer a zero on the sides and little longer on time using the lever that my old Wahl had.</li>
            <li> but these get my head tight and last two or three days before I have to clip them again.</li>
            <li> It does have a little finner blade setup but it didnt trim any closer then my regular Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is it will cut you if you do not hold it at a proper angle.</li>
            <li> I MUST HAVE for women who want to trim their husband&#x27;s hair without the extra cost of a barber every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noisy.  </li>
            <li> I felt it gave me a slightly uneven cut even with multiple passes.</li>
            <li> It is just an empty case that allows for everything in it to just slide around.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl since the military.</li>
            <li> If you are not an Amazon Prime member you are missing out big time!</li>
            <li> If you are careful this will not happen to you.</li>
            <li> I just bought this set to possibly switch out to, since I usually \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; down to 1/4\\&quot; or smaller.</li>
            <li> He reccommends not using the guards to get a close cut, but be careful &#x27;cause the razor is sharp and you will get nicked.</li>
            <li> It is heavy, seems like it is built pretty tough and durable, and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I also picked this kit up to use on my goatee, and it takes a little getting used to for your facial hair - not so much in that it hurts or anything, but you have to use the correct guide or you&#x27;ll end up cutting it too short</li>
            <li> , the case the materials come in got a little smaller from the previous version.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no blade adjustment feature on this one which was a little disappointing since you can spend a few dollars more and get the adjustable clipper in another set.</li>
            <li> Had to get a transformer due to Aussie voltage requirements.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviews, but the item I received was also used.</li>
            <li> Like a couple other reviews I also got a USED clipper.</li>
            <li> Other than that, i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> As Close To Shaved Head&#x27; as other reviewer comment.</li>
            <li> However I could not find any hair or other signs.</li>
            <li> This puts all other clippers I&#x27;ve owned and used to shame.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had two other clippers so we have some basis for the opinion.</li>
            <li> They cut extremely close</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as i would like and draws blood if you aren&#x27;t very careful.  </li>
            <li> I do use a razor and go all the way down</li>
            <li> well.......I walked out to see blood dripping down his face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the blade shave down to skin</li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp, and I did the job by myself in 15 min or so, without sweat or fear!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little disappointing that a replacement comb and blade cost nearly as much as an entire new kit.</li>
            <li> However, we timed him trimming his 2-3 day scruff (face and neck) and it took a minute and a half and no irritation.</li>
            <li> if you shave your head to 1/8 of an inch of less</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shut off my breaker like the previous set we had.</li>
            <li> That being said, the little \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; brushes that come with almost all clipper are junk.</li>
            <li> be careful to push too hard though, they can snag and tear your skin</li>
            <li> After a few months, the Pansonic (lightweight and plastic, rechargeable battery) was nearing the end of it&#x27;s duty cycle.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, adjust them downward after your skin has had time to toughen up a bit.</li>
            <li> The thing is heavy, and this might take a bit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s a workhorse.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the green guard fits the trimmer like a glove.</li>
            <li> I added a few images in the customer image section that explains how I knew they were used.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a waste of space compared to this thing.</li>
            <li> the clippers were dropped several times and the shears were broken and started to cut flesh so a replacement was needed.</li>
            <li> read a few reviews indicating the machine they got was used, if that&#x27;s the case, contact AMAZON request a refund end of story.</li>
            <li> He told me this one needs to be replaced because the blades are missing teeth.  </li>
            <li> will probably join other people on the site who complained that they are getting used clippers when ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> small print basically says &amp;#34;for a bald look, finish up with a razor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is the fault of Amazon, the shipping method, or just faulty product from Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Wahl lubricant spray and when I spray the lubricant onto the blades a small burst of flame comes out when I turn on the clipper.  </li>
            <li> This one has a thin blade guard and gets extremely close.  </li>
            <li> Now when I opened it few days ago, i was disappointed because the two blades were not aligned properly and the screw was loose!!</li>
            <li> I take an anticoagulant making it difficult to stop the bleeding from otherwise minor nicks.</li>
            <li> The edges do have a design flaw as the skin can get nicked if trying to push too hard and skin stretches.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe when a couple of fellow reviewers complained about this problem.</li>
            <li> but I thought at least some of the guards would be a bit longer.</li>
            <li> the name &amp;#34;Balder&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ultra close&amp;#34; led me to chose this as a gift...found out too late that it does not</li>
            <li> The closest cutting clippers I have used, almost same effect as a razor.</li>
            <li> Wahl, you&#x27;re disappointing, and I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
            <li> Before buying this machine I read a few comments, but everything I turn out to be false</li>
            <li> and I never thought that in amazon would send secondhand products I am disappointed it is the first time that spends to me this bad experience for which already he had bought before</li>
            <li> Not only was there hair on the end, the clipper had bad scratches on it.</li>
            <li> It appears it was packaged with broken blades by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to get sick of Wahl and their mediocre products.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of lousy battery-charged hair clippers</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the replacement clippers they sent also looked used</li>
            <li> Bit disappointing as no mention on advertising</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father though I do the cutting and trimming.</li>
            <li> I would imagine that this clipper set and the instructions within it makes cutting someone else&#x27;s hair even easier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the blades were bent or what the problem was, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well he now has quite bad cuts on his neck like someone has taken a razor blade &amp; slicced along his neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personal grooming - I hate shaving so use this basically as a razor 80% of the time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This haircut kit have all He needs to cut his hair by himself. Is manageable and it comes with many option to cut hair. I recommend it if you are looking for one simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> - Wahl quality brand name haircut kit&lt;br /&gt;- I have owned nothign but Wahl for YEARS....they last a good while and work well, but I do replace them from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;-First set of  &amp;#34;ultra close&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve owned, and it gets right down to where you would have to use a shaving blade if you wante it any closer.&lt;br /&gt;- Plenty of attachments, accesssories&lt;br /&gt;- For the price, it&#x27;s a solid deal. Well built, solid haircut set.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the purchase. It was as advertised and the cost was reasonable. Amazon prices save $$$$ and is ultra convenient.</li>
            <li> Razors nick my head, so I use electric. I had been using a similarly priced Panasonic hair/beard/body trimmer without the guard to get that bald look. After a few months, the Pansonic (lightweight and plastic, rechargeable battery) was nearing the end of it&#x27;s duty cycle. In fairness, it was doing way more shaving than Pansonic intended. I still needed a replacement.     The Wahl Balder cuts almost as close as a razor without the guard. It is exactly what I wanted. It is heavy, seems like it is built pretty tough and durable, and no nicks or cuts. Just use reasonable pressure and the right angle. Highly recommended.    Tip: If you are using an electric razor to shave your head for the first time, don&#x27;t adjust the blades to go very close at first. After a few weeks, adjust them downward after your skin has had time to toughen up a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper with the hopes that I could shave my face and head with it. It works OK, it gets to the exact length I want on my face (a little less than a days growth). The problem is that it pulls the hair on my face sometimes and it takes lots of passes to get all the stragglers. It works better as a normal hair clipper, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at least, but it takes hundreds of passes to get all the hairs. I&#x27;m looking for a new clipper after using this one for 6 months.</li>
            <li> ... that this product is for Ethnic people.  Meaning, of African descent.  But, I&#x27;m Caucasian and I love this thing.  I bought it because I would have to be pretty damn good for styling afros into fades, etc.  So, for me, it&#x27;s a good overall shave.  Then if I want a more pristine, closer shave, I use shaving cream and 3 or 4 blade razor.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because I had heard good things about the Wahl brand.  My husband is balding on the top, and we were looking for clippers that would allow me to cut the rest of his hair really short and that could also be used to trim his beard.  When we tried to use these clippers, I started with the 1/8\\&quot; guide, and it would not snap into place.  It just sort of \\&quot;sat\\&quot; there.  The 1/16\\&quot; fit a bit better, but did not feel totally secure.  The rest of the guides snapped into place perfectly, but they were all too long for our purposes.    The reason I gave the clippers two stars rather than one is that their customer service was very responsive.  They sent replacement guides twice (none of them fit any better than the original ones, however).  I ended up returning the clippers to Amazon.  This was the first time I had had to return anything, and I was very impressed with how easy Amazon&#x27;s return process was.    I ended up buying an Andis clipper, and we are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on-line, I bought these clippers.  I had been using a beard trimmer to shave my head and ended up doing more harm than good over the years, as the beard trimmer would nick and scratch my head.  After using these clippers, I could NOT be more impressed.  As one other reviewer mentioned, you get that &#x27;next day&#x27; stubble feel.  In other words, you get so close with these clippers that it feels like the day after having used a razor to shave your head - they&#x27;re THAT good.    I also picked this kit up to use on my goatee, and it takes a little getting used to for your facial hair - not so much in that it hurts or anything, but you have to use the correct guide or you&#x27;ll end up cutting it too short (like I did).    BUT, all in all, this is a great trimmer to use if you don&#x27;t want to razor your head, and are happy with the \\&quot;day after\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> I shave my head to the skin. I don&#x27;t cut my hair, or do styling, or need anything fancy. To this end, one would think all shavers would be created equal; but they&#x27;re not. Most shavers don&#x27;t get close enough, or anywhere near close enough, for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver, even with a guard on it, gets it close enough that for 90% of my days, I feel no need to break out a razor and go all the way down. This is a great time saver for me, and I hate wasting time on this kind of remedial task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I do use a razor and go all the way down, I use a [[ASIN:B000NFEX46 Headblade Sport Ultimate Head Shave, 1 razor]]. It&#x27;s a handle-blade combination that offers a shave contoured to the head to avoid cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great head shaving device. I&#x27;ve used a lot of them, and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> Great service, the product was exactly what i was expecting to get. Do not use for trimming, these clippers cut really close and the blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> My old Wahl clippers were in need of replacement after about 12 years of bi-weekly hair cuts, so I naturally began reading reviews of clippers on Amazon. I had no reason to deviate from Whal as my brand of choice and felt this clipper kit would meet my needs, but I was a little leery of an online purchase after having read so many negative reviews about possibly having received used clippers. Another reviewer mentioned this item being sold at \\&quot;Wallyworld\\&quot; so I went and checked. Sure enough I found it for about $22 and change. Now the clipper....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my whole head as close as I can get it (boot camp style) without using a straight/safety razor for twenty years. I am very happy with this clipper after a dozen or so cuts. I shave my head at the shortest setting sans any guards and it get so very close, but it has never ever nicked me. Included is a light green guard which feels like a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; silicon material. It is perfect for trimming \\&quot;sensitive areas\\&quot;. The blades were sharp, aligned perfectly and in pristine condition. All the accessories were bagged separately inside the somewhat flimsy case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have learned two things about clipper care: Always brush hair trimmings out of the clipper blades after each use, and regular oiling. That being said, the little \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; brushes that come with almost all clipper are junk. Years ago I replaced mine with a cheap medium bristle toothbrush. It is much more effective at hair removal. Additionally, when you properly oil the blades and then use the toothbrush again a few times after oiling, you will then have a nice oil-primed brush for cleaning which you can toss in the flimsy case. I use Diawa brand fishing reel oil because the tube lasts forever and it is an extremely clean and lightweight oil. I don&#x27;t think Amazon sells it but if you Google Needle Nose reel oiler, you will find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading and if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer best as I can. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOr best as I can. Thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPO</li>
            <li> The Wahl Balder haircut kit is incredible. I bought for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It&#x27;s so strong and yet really quiet. My husband is lazy and his skin is sensitive so he avoids shaving. However, we timed him trimming his 2-3 day scruff (face and neck) and it took a minute and a half and no irritation. It&#x27;s not like shaving since it can&#x27;t get that close but it gets rid of the scratchy scruff perfectly and keeps it&#x27;s manageable! So now I can send him in during a TV commercial to smooth off his face from any stubble he has. I used it to cut his hair instead of scissors and it was a great change. I was able to get the right angles and get it short enough in areas I couldn&#x27;t do before. Being lefty it is so much easier than using scissors and faster too. Don&#x27;t be concerned with the packaging as it appears to be for men of color. (My husband looked puzzled when he unwrapped it). I&#x27;m not sure why it seems geared that way since it is great for everyone. The packaging photos will lend ideas to anyone who is talented enough to replicate the styles shown. I would definitely recommend this as a quick buzzer or haircutting kit!</li>
            <li> I just bought this set to possibly switch out to, since I usually \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; down to 1/4\\&quot; or smaller. I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used Wahl products for years, just not the hair clippers, I decided to give these a shot, as my Remington Titanium set was \\&quot;ok\\&quot;, but nothing to write home about. Having seen that the guards were color coded, and replacements easy to find online, I went with these, and that first cut was AMAZING!!! I shaved my hair in about 1/3rd less time, and spent less time needing to go back over it to catch any wild hairs. These clippers run more quiet than the Remington or Conair, etc., I&#x27;ve had, are smaller, with a smaller case, making it easier to store and travel with. The guards seem more sturdy than the other brands, which have always broken on me over time, and replacement guards for the others have always been more difficult to find online than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very simple, yet efficient product here, no frills and junk I don&#x27;t need, and includes a quick picture reference guide on how to make all the short buzz cuts step by step...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. We&#x27;ve used it several times now. Either he can shave his head by himself, or I&#x27;ve helped him. It&#x27;s easy to use and has many extra features, but we mainly use it to shave his head (smooth). For the price, it&#x27;s just what it advertises. Very good product - shaves close and isn&#x27;t very loud. Long enough cord for plugging it in.</li>
            <li> Great machine:) I had the Wahl Baldfader before this and the fact that the Balder does not have the adjuster lever makes the Balder better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this last week and have used it a few times so far...much better than the $10 clippers I had been using. It cuts much more closely and evenly and the teeth don&#x27;t &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my scalp and cut me like my old Sunbeam clippers do. Based on the weight and feel I would have guessed they would cost about twice what they did.</li>
            <li> Great price but would not work with converter. Had to get a transformer due to Aussie voltage requirements. Bit disappointing as no mention on advertising</li>
            <li> I rated this product low because Amazon sent the razors with fine hairs in them as if they had been used.  I read \\&quot;feedback\\&quot; on this site that amazon sent a used item to someone else, but I assumed it wouldn&#x27;t happen to me.  My husband loves the razor and he uses it on his bald head.  He reccommends not using the guards to get a close cut, but be careful &#x27;cause the razor is sharp and you will get nicked.</li>
            <li> Before buying this machine I read a few comments, but everything I turn out to be false it was not for what I was looking. First the cleavers were oxidized such as if already it had been used before and second does not cut as in the description he was saying I do not recommend her and I never thought that in amazon would send secondhand products I am disappointed it is the first time that spends to me this bad experience for which already he had bought before</li>
            <li> This razor works, but I swear my 3 year old drug store purchased Remington (that has never been greased) works just as well, if not better than this razor. I don&#x27;t see how this razor gets any shorter of a cut than my razor with a lever. Also- This razor is white in color. In the pictures its looks grey but it is actually white.</li>
            <li> I finally asked my son why he never used it. He didnt want to hurt my feelings since it was a gift. I found out that this item was already used !! Full of small hairs from where the last owner didnt throughly clean it to make it look like new before it was returned and resold to me.  Maybe it would have been a good purchase for my \\&quot;future barber\\&quot;, I&#x27;ll never know. Now I&#x27;m stuck with it. He wont use it. Yuck! So disgusting.</li>
            <li> if you shave your head to 1/8 of an inch of less THIS IS THE CLIPPER SET FOR YOU. yes there is a difference between balding clippers and regular clippers in my opinion. these simply work alot better, youve got all the guards you need for short styles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe the other reviews, but the item I received was also used. It still had hair in the razor, and the Wahl logo was faded. Amazon has agreed to send me a replacement... We&#x27;ll see how that goes.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason this is getting one star rating is because Amazon.com sent it out in good time &amp; it is not there actual product.  My husband cut his hair last weekend, he is military so uses no combs on it, well.......I walked out to see blood dripping down his face.  These clippers cut his head close to 1/2 a dozen times &amp; I mean good chunks of skin that a week later are still scabbing over.  He first thought it was just him being too aggressive with new clippers until tonight when I trimmed my sons (19) neckline for him without the comb on, just how the hairdresser or barber does.  Well he now has quite bad cuts on his neck like someone has taken a razor blade &amp; slicced along his neck.  I barely even touched his skin with it.  When we looked further at the clippers, we saw that the blade had not been put in correctly, so the razor sharp blade was actually sticking up out of the claw &amp; was basically scalping them both.    I am writing WAHL tonight then will call tomorrow to see what they will do about this &amp; I have photos of my sons neck to show them but IF you do buy ANY clippers, always try it on your arm first or check the blades.    Will NEVER buy clippers online again.</li>
            <li> Like a couple other reviews I also got a USED clipper. Not only was there hair on the end, the clipper had bad scratches on it. The box was re-taped by whomever returned it last. Amazon really needs to check the stuff they ship out, especially after so many complaints of the same problem.</li>
            <li> Ordered this clippers in Septemper but opened the box today. I can&#x27;t believe I got used clippers! Read one of th comments below and realized I am not the only one! I deserve and explanation!</li>
            <li> The machine makes a loud sound even after being adjusted. It cuts your hair ok but I&#x27;m concerned at how long it will last.</li>
            <li> While I expected the whole unit to be a shiny silver, looks are not everything. The clippers provided a quality, VERY short cut that I was looking for. While It was not a total balding effect, it got VERY close.  The unit runs well and everything you would expect from a Wahl.</li>
            <li> My clippers were old and broke. I was glad to get this set. It is working well, so far. Hope to have it as long as the last set.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who is 25.  He loves it and saves a lot in not going to a barber.</li>
            <li> These clip shorter than the other Wahl clippers, but it&#x27;s not as short as shaving.  If a man doesn&#x27;t need a close shave they work great on the face and neck, looks like a 5:00 shadow.  Unlike a razor, it&#x27;s easy on the face.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever used.  I use it for beard trimming, and my wife uses it to trim our sons hair.  The thing is heavy, and this might take a bit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s a workhorse.  Should give YEARS of service.</li>
            <li> Thought this item was going to be NEW, but as it turned out it was refurbished and didn&#x27;t work properly. Very disappointed with this purchase. Buyer Beware on this one!</li>
            <li> While this product DOES give you a Close Haircut, it will NOT complete Balding as the name and photos imply.&lt;br /&gt;The small print basically says &amp;#34;for a bald look, finish up with a razor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Amazon sent me a used trimmer. I didn&#x27;t believe when a couple of fellow reviewers complained about this problem. Didn&#x27;t think it would happen to me.     Amazon sent me a used trimmer, with hair in it. I returned it for another piece. Who knows, I might be surprised again.</li>
            <li> This shaver is supreme. Heavy like the salon&#x27;s, and sharp enough to use every three days for a pretty short, almost bald look. I could get more bald, but i would have to use a razor blade, and that&#x27;s just too much work. LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my finance and it came all in one piece with no missing pieces. He loves it so in return I would order from this person again</li>
            <li> I had always used the Wahl trimmers which had the lever for adjusting the blade. I was concerned when I received this model and saw that it didn&#x27;t have the lever. I didn&#x27;t want to \\&quot;shave\\&quot; my head so at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if this model would be a keeper. Luckily, the included green guard (1/16\\&quot;) cuts to a length that I really like. I also use that guard to keep my beard to a day old length. And of course, the guard offers a more pleasant feeling to the head as compared to using bare blades, which can scratch the scalp. I also noticed that the green guard fits the trimmer like a glove. That guard on my other Wahl trimmers was not a good fit and would even fall off at times. You can just about shave a face with this trimmer. It is that close. Very pleased with the purchase. I don&#x27;t think this trimmer was designed just for ethnic groups as one reviewer stated. I&#x27;m white with straight, medium texture hair, and this trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> Great kit! I bought this as a gift for my father though I do the cutting and trimming. Easy to use, quiet and great quality!</li>
            <li> This has saved us SO much money!  My husband&#x27;s haircut used to cost $20 per.  For this $32 (when we bought it) we have recovered our money back many, many times over.  This kit is fabulous!!  I MUST HAVE for women who want to trim their husband&#x27;s hair without the extra cost of a barber every few weeks.</li>
            <li> on time and right box. Product exactly as described. Will continue with this buyer for more of same product. and recommend.</li>
            <li> Its like shaving. It works better then I thought it would.  Could not be happier. Everyone that likes it close should have one of these clippers!!!!&lt;br /&gt; Danny</li>
            <li> The good, still works, was brand new when I received it and cuts really close. The bad, it could use a lever to adjust the high, it does come with some short clips, but i normally prefer a zero on the sides and little longer on time using the lever that my old Wahl had. Other than that, i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I am bald on the top, with some hair left around the sides and back.  I use this clipper with one of the attachments to cut the remaining hair to a short length.  It works great for that and does it quickly.  For my needs, this item is just what I needed for a low price.</li>
            <li> This set of clippers produces a VERY close trim, closer than I was accustomed to, and that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Works well, however I had to change the blade to 6x0 to get the desired &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; closeness.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped our old &amp;#34;balder&amp;#34; that we purchased from a big box company, so we bought this to replace it. It works great and I imagine if/when this one dies we&#x27;ll replace it with the same thing again.</li>
            <li> true to its name and mark, ive been using these clippers for the past year or so and they still cut well. be careful to push too hard though, they can snag and tear your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a beard trimmer, and to &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; my neck. The blades are sharp, which is good, but makes it a little too easy to scrape my skin.  Still, OK for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old and never cut my own hair before.  I have used this twice and I love it.  I wish I had bought one years ago.  After two hair cuts, I have saved what it would have cost me for two haircuts.  It is very easy to use.  I don&#x27;t know how I could cut myself, even if I tried.  I has a good weight (just like a professional one).  It&#x27;s not very noisy.  Not that it matters.  I only takes five minutes to do the job.  And the best part is the convenience.  I can cut my hair whenever I want to.</li>
            <li> These clippers were suppose to be new but when it arrived it was used. I added a few images in the customer image section that explains how I knew they were used. Not sure if that is the fault of Amazon, the shipping method, or just faulty product from Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been shaving my own head with buzzers on and off (mostly on) for the last 15 years and have used all types and brands of buzzers and this one is just average. I felt it gave me a slightly uneven cut even with multiple passes. The motor is a bit weaker (I know I&#x27;m comparing a HOME KIT to a PROFESSIONAL KIT) compared to my Wahl 5 Star Series Balding Clipper (clippers that I would highly recommend), but it does get the job done - barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the length of the cut with these clippers it was short but not short enough for my liking. From what I&#x27;ve gathered from Wahl customer service the blade that comes with this clipper is a 4x0 blade that cuts to .6mm. Now for a lot people that is a sufficient height, just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t like was the case that this buzzer came in. The case has no compartments that are molded to fit the buzzer snugly. It is just an empty case that allows for everything in it to just slide around. Also, neither my original or replacement clipper came with a bottle of oil. I guess these don&#x27;t come with it, even though there is a picture of a bottle of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not use these clippers again or suggest these clippers to any of my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: Amazon&#x27;s customer service was FANTASTIC when I called them about receiving a used clipper. Within 3-4 minutes of talking with the helpful and courteous customer service representative she had already put in the order for my replacement clipper with free 2 day shipping. Unfortunately, the replacement clippers they sent also looked used so I returned both and instead bought the Wahl 5 Star Series Balding Clipper that I&#x27;ve also written a review for. Check out that review if you&#x27;re interested in my thoughts on that SUPERB clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a link for the 5 Star Series Clipper: [[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair for over a decade. I tend to buy cheaper clippers, but the balder set kinda caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Used it twice and it seems to give a more even cut then my last set, the guides on the wahl set are top notch, just wish there were a few more.</li>
            <li> The package insert only shows African-American men and my husband is caucasian so I don&#x27;t know if thats why it doesnt work. It does not create a close bald/buzz cut. The metal blades scratched my husband and caused bleeding! Amazon has been great as far as returning it tho :)</li>
            <li> Use for trim-ups between regular haircuts.  It cuts nice and short if you like (and I surely do) and has attachments for many needs.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair at home. I could never find clippers that would cut my hair short enough, until now. These clippers will cut your hair so short it is almost like shaving instead of a haircut. It comes with the different guards for different lengths. We use it with no guard, because I like my hair short. BE CAREFUL around your ears with no guards it will cut skin real easy; found out the hard way. I reccommend this set to all that do their haircuts at home.</li>
            <li> This pays for itself after two uses.  This is a no brainer purchase and cuts very, very close.  Would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> THE WAHL ULTRA CLOSE BALDER IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  I WAS AMAZED AT THE RESULTS I ACHIEVED. THE BALDER ALLOWED ME TO CUT CLOSE ENOUGH SO IT WOULD NOT APPEAR AS THOUGH I HAD A \\&quot;RECEDED\\&quot; HAIRLINE. THE BALDER INCLUDED ATTACHMENTS THAT ALLOWED ME TO TRIM MY BEARD TO A VERY SHORT AND DESIRABLE LENGTH.  MY COWORKERS IMMEDIATELY NOTED HOW MUCH YOUNGER I LOOKED WITH A SHAVED HEAD AND A BEARD THAT WAS VERY SHORT IN LENGTH.    THE BALDER PURPORTS TO DO WHAT IT STATES, AND IT IS SO, SO, AS A TRIMMER TO OUTLINE EVERYTHING PERFECTION.</li>
            <li> I have a regular Wahl clipper, which worked OK, but since I&#x27;m balding on the top, I starting shaving my head, and when I knew about this \\&quot;Balder Ultra Close\\&quot; I thought I would get it. I finally got it and used it now, and I&#x27;ll tell you what: it&#x27;s not that &#x27;As Close To Shaved Head&#x27; as other reviewer comment. It just works as good as the other regular Wahl clipper, maybe a little bit better since it&#x27;s a new clipper (the other one I&#x27;ve had it for 3 years or so) but speaking of how close to the head it is the same result.     So it&#x27;s OK, it&#x27;s good device, but it doesn&#x27;t cut that close to the head to be called a Balder Ultra Close.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I buy this product. Some of them commented Amazon sent the used product. I have also felt the same when I unpack. When I lift the product first time it was sticky like someone used it already. However I could not find any hair or other signs. So be aware of that.    About the product...  I am using the trimmer first time so initially I struggled a bit. After 3 or 4 usage I am so comfortable. You cannot expect a Haircut kit to shave your head like razor. But this product does that job. Its trimming as close as razor (Not 100%, I would say 90%).    Pros  * Close trimming like razor  * Combs with different sizes  * Affordable price  * Easy to clean and maintain  * Easy to carry and store with the plastic box    Cons  * Cord (Cant expect cordless in haircut machine)  * May need to buy Oil regularly  * Check the product if it&#x27;s already used.  * Generates heat if you use this product continuously     I strongly recommend this product to others and it&#x27;s really worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> I used another Wahl haircut trimmer similar to this one for many years until I managed to break several of the comb attachments. The cost of buying the replacement attachments was about the same as the whole new set, so I figured, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper itself worked well by itself. It&#x27;s not too loud and still got a rather close trim. There&#x27;s no blade adjustment feature on this one which was a little disappointing since you can spend a few dollars more and get the adjustable clipper in another set. I did encounter an issue when I began to use the comb attachments. For some reason, the attachments didn&#x27;t quite cover the blade and caught hair in it occasionally as it was used. It may have just been my unit was off spec or it can be the model - I couldn&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the case the materials come in got a little smaller from the previous version. While I don&#x27;t have any trouble with it, you really do have to wind up the cord and cram the attachments and the clippers in to get the case to close.</li>
            <li> These clippers are awesome. Fast, powerful and give a very close cut- I would argue as close as you are going to get with a clipper. Some people complain that they are not as close as a blade but guess what? No clipper EVER will be! This is as good as you&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of cut you get from these clippers is basically like the day after a blade shave- one day&#x27;s worth of very fine stubble or thereabouts. For me this is the perfect length- I&#x27;m not a fan of the blade shave down to skin look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these clippers. They are very well made, fast, powerful and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of our old clippers. I can get a nearly clean shave on his head.</li>
            <li> I would like to see a lighter, smaller one. I use it to trim my maltipoo&#x27;s face. I really bought it for the short guard. It did the job great, but my arm and wrist was hurting before I was done. Overall it did what I wanted, and I would recommend it to my friends and family, which I already have.</li>
            <li> Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for christmas and he is very happy with it. Good price, good quality and shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> Use it to cut my hair all the time.  Works perfect.</li>
            <li> This thing is a monster, I love it. I was tired of lousy battery-charged hair clippers and they generally just don&#x27;t do the job well or fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has a number of things going for it:&lt;br /&gt;-Case it comes with is decently sized and is a hard plastic case. You can easily fit the accessories back in it without having to try to figure out how to get it to fit. Toss the stuff in, close the case, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The cleaning brush it comes with is a real actual brush. Most hair clippers come with this absurdly small useless thing that looks suitable for an archaeological dig for microscopic artifacts. This brush is a real cleaning brush, give it a few swipes and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The corded nature of it means you&#x27;ll always have full power. Not to mention when you flip the switch on this thing you get a nice solid &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; and this things roars to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as against- I can&#x27;t get a real &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34; cut out of this thing, but it&#x27;s pretty close, which is good enough for me, and it&#x27;s quick and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throwing out my old battery charging hair cutters now. They&#x27;re a waste of space compared to this thing.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, great product, I&#x27;m loving it even after all those months after purchase</li>
            <li> Very pleased. I bought one about six years ago… And it lasted me that long. You do not fix what is not broken!... I am just as happy with this one as I was with my last one. It gets very close for a shaved look without the irritation.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is in the army and he needed a new one, this was perfect ! He loves it ! Couldnt find a better deal.</li>
            <li> good clippers for the money</li>
            <li> The Balder Ultra Close is a very clean cutting shaver.  It has met my expectations.  The only complaint is it will cut you if you do not hold it at a proper angle.</li>
            <li> Works great, just wish it was cordless/battery operated.</li>
            <li> Bought my first around 15 years ago from Sears, then my second just over a year ago when the original died. This puts all other clippers I&#x27;ve owned and used to shame. This clipper is durable, and gives almost razor like results. The newer version is definitely an improvement from what I purchased years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My history with this guy is as follows -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neighborhood unofficial barber (high school and college) - shaved heads, mohawks, creative ridiculous and almost embarrassing hairstyles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal grooming - I hate shaving so use this basically as a razor 80% of the time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd purchase - the clippers were dropped several times and the shears were broken and started to cut flesh so a replacement was needed. Having used and owned other clippers decided to go back with the wahl baldfader, again, the newer product is improved which says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews indicating the machine they got was used, if that&#x27;s the case, contact AMAZON request a refund end of story. In my experience AMAZON&#x27;s customer service is top notch, on the 2 instances I&#x27;ve needed refunds or new products been sent out there has never been an issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Clippers work great and is very durable. Make sure you follow instructions and keep oiling after every use to keep the clippers sharp and fresh.</li>
            <li> This clipper set comes with six clipper guards which enables you to trim various amounts of hair off without risking a total screw up if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.  I would imagine that this clipper set and the instructions within it makes cutting someone else&#x27;s hair even easier.  Without the guard, the clippers provide a very close cut. In fact, you won&#x27;t have to shave your head at all using just the clippers.  The 1/8\\&quot; guard also provides a very close bald fade look if you want to cut your hair that close.  This kit includes five other guards if you want to leave more hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for me is that the clippers get hot very quickly, just as other reviewers had previously mentioned.  If I could, I&#x27;d give these clippers 3.5 stars, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow me to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my nephew as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it and says it works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with many attachments and it runs smooth and easy clean up with brush that&#x27;s included.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product</li>
            <li> Excellent &amp;iacute;tem</li>
            <li> the convenience of weekly hair cuts  is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I always look as if I just came from getting a haircut.&lt;br /&gt;equipment is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> You will get a close cut with this clipper. However, I assumed that the blade was adjustable like the one I replaced. If you are looking for clippers that are adjustable this one is not for you. I should have researched it more.</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl since the military. I purchased this set to replace my bald-fader set that I had since 2005. I had high expectations for this product and it delivered flawlessly. If you desire a clean cut professional look with the at home price tag these clippers and any of the Wahl professional line products are the way to go. My last set lasted me 7 years and they are still going strong. Great for bald fades for a former Army NCO like myself. Shipping on this product was amazing as well. Placed the order Thursday evening from my desk at work, it shipped 20 minutes later Friday, the next day I discovered them waiting for me at my doorstep. If you are not an Amazon Prime member you are missing out big time! The annual cost pays for itself in shipping savings alone.</li>
            <li> The clippers work great but I thought at least some of the guards would be a bit longer. I obviously over-looked the title - &amp;#34;Wahl Balder Ultra Close Haircut Kit&amp;#34;. But, I can always buy a new set of guards to suit my needs. Besides, you can beat it for the price and Wahl has always made a good, if not great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs Up Brother!!</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase. will probably be ordering another kit soon as the one i bought like 5 years ago is finally showing signs of needing a replacement.</li>
            <li> Nothing more than a glorified regular hair trimmer like the regular Wahl trimmer. It does have a little finner blade setup but it didnt trim any closer then my regular Wahl trimmer. I got a Peanut and that thing rocks.....1000 better than this balder. Get the Peanut if you want a close &#x27;day old&#x27; shave. The Peanut can cut the entire head as well. Stay away fromt he Balder.</li>
            <li> The clipper is basically a closercut model than the ones with side switch. Its similar to other kits but provides a closer cuts for those who want a close shave. It works ok but if you have sensitive skin dont get to close at first use the guide combs to avoid accidently cuts or irriation. It does a ok job and cuts closer than my previous wahl clipper. Try with the guide combs until you get use to the amount of pressure need to reduce the risk of get skin irratation.</li>
            <li> Main criteria for my barbar ( wife )is that the clipper be manageable as she stands with one hand on her walker as she trims me.The Wahl clipper is easy to hold and does a geat job.We&#x27;ve had two other clippers so we have some basis for the opinion.</li>
            <li> excellent hair cutter with powerful motor. attachments offer plenty of flexibility for hair length. perfect for close cuts to scalp.</li>
            <li> I needed some trimmer for my 3 lil boys and my husband and so far these are great. They don&#x27;t pull your hair, don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery staying  charged and not a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd set in 5 years. The closest cut available and will last as long as you take care of them.</li>
            <li> My old set of clippers needed replacing and when I got these they did not disappoint.  I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this pair for about a year and it finally broke down on me.  Not only did it break down on me but it&#x27;s become a hazard!  When I turn on the clipper the blades do not move, as if it&#x27;s glued shut.  I also purchased the Wahl lubricant spray and when I spray the lubricant onto the blades a small burst of flame comes out when I turn on the clipper.  I&#x27;m over the warranty limit (30 days) so I guess for the price 1 year is all you get out of it.  I&#x27;ve going back to the gilette fusion 5 blade and shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Wahl makes excellent clippers, so it wasn&#x27;t a hard decision to make brand-wise.  We were replacing my husband&#x27;s clippers. They are used for keeping the back of his neck tidy in between trips to the barber, plus other body hair he wishes to trim.  I do wish they had the thumb adjustment, but for the value and quality, they&#x27;ll do just fine!</li>
            <li> The clippers pull a little when they cut, and I would like to have a few more selections of length in the attachments.  Otherwise, they&#x27;re pretty good for the price.  I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple months, so I don&#x27;t know yet about durability.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers is like haveing a professional set of them in the house. When yoou turn them on they feel like a good clipper not a cheap set and all plastic. These are a great buy and work great I feel like I will have them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this for clipping my scalp. While I rarely shave my head I do keep it trim with these clippers a few times a week. Also cuts in a single pass</li>
            <li> Works great, it does not cut as close as a razor because it not a razor, but it does cut very close. Would buy it again!</li>
            <li> These clippers work wonders.  I had regular Wahl clippers before, but this is the way to go if you&#x27;re looking for a shaved head.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer does exactly as I wanted it to do and as it was advertised to do. It cuts my hair close enough that it looks like a shave without the nicks from cheap razor blades or the expense of the top of the line blades.  I take an anticoagulant making it difficult to stop the bleeding from otherwise minor nicks. I had tried other clippers which left the stubble too long.  This one has a thin blade guard and gets extremely close.  I wish it was cordless but can&#x27;t justify holding back a star for the cord.  I knew it had a cord when I bought it.  Great clipper if you want to get as close to slick as possible without using a blade.</li>
            <li> the name &amp;#34;Balder&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;ultra close&amp;#34; led me to chose this as a gift...found out too late that it does not &amp;#34;bald&amp;#34;...you must have a second razor to get the job done...I don&#x27;t like being misled.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband as a Christmas gift to replace his old razor.  He told me this one needs to be replaced because the blades are missing teeth.  He checked inside the storage box to see if maybe they broke off during shipping but didn&#x27;t find them.  It appears it was packaged with broken blades by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The original, sold in most walmarts, had a very thin and fine lower blade. This is what gives the clippers its Zero overlap quality. This item was paired with an original, and does not meet the before mentioned. The lower blade had the exact thickness of a normal clipper set and cuts just like it. I purchased this so I can get that close BIC looking appearance without having to shave.</li>
            <li> It is the closest shaver ever. If you&#x27;re bald and aiming to get the shaved look this is the machine. But it&#x27;s so close that you may cut (or definitely will cut) your self.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using it after giving it a several try. I have given it to a friend who is a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Like this clipper for its close head/beard shave. I&#x27;m pretty satisfy with this product and hope it last as my last clipper. I will definitely buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as i would like and draws blood if you aren&#x27;t very careful.  I still have to shave with an electric razor after shaving with this.  The teeth are much closer together than the standard Wahl, but you can still cut yourself with it.  It is much stronger and more resilient than the Wahls they were making 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers, best I have ever owned by far. The closest cutting clippers I have used, almost same effect as a razor. Almost! I did cut myself the first time just a little, but that was with no attachment. If you are careful this will not happen to you. Again very good price and excellent product.</li>
            <li> After many years another brand&#x27;s hair clippers finally shut down, so I went looking for a replacement and came up with this kit.  For my style, I go as close as possible and therefore use the closest comb or none at all.  This feels, looks, and sounds like a quality tool and it cuts very well.  Also, I wanted it made in the U.S.A.  This certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper.  I don&#x27;t \\&quot;shave\\&quot; my head, so I do not use this as a \\&quot;razor\\&quot;.  Instead, I prefer to trim my hair really short.  This clipper is one of a few that includes a 1/16\\&quot; (1.5 mm) adaptor (one other is the Professional Balder by Wahl for double the price).  Most usually go down to 1/8\\&quot; (3 mm; included in this kit as well). The blades are really sharp, and I did the job by myself in 15 min or so, without sweat or fear! (no hair grabbing, no discomfort).  The clipper did not get hot within this period of time; maybe just a little bit warm.  When working, it is not particularly quite, but not loud either.  I cannot attest to its durability because I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but my previous Wahl clippers have been around for more than 5 years (and without much maintenance), so I am confident this one will last for a decent amount of time as well.  One thing I noticed is that the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; plastic strip in the middle of the clipper (where the logo is located) scratches really easily (or I was not so careful with it, I don&#x27;t know!).  Not a big deal, but I thought I should mention it. Overall, if you trim your hair really close, this is a great kit at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> better than going to the barber.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this clipper because I used it before and it is cheap yet effective and yield almost bald cut. I did not open the box when it arrived because i was out of town and forgot about it. Now when I opened it few days ago, i was disappointed because the two blades were not aligned properly and the screw was loose!! I do not know if it is a manufacturing defect or someone had it before and replaced the blade or whatever. All I know is that I am not going to use it!&lt;br /&gt;and what is more frustrating that it is too late to return it according to Amazon policy!&lt;br /&gt;I will probably join other people on the site who complained that they are getting used clippers when ordered from Amazon. I think it is mostly costumers who are abusing Amazon flexible return policy; but still! I would buy clippers straight from the manufacturer to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Does what its suppose to do and if you know what you&#x27;re doing when it comes to shaving your head there should be no problems with it. Only suggestion would be if you use it alot like i do maybe buy a new one after a few years as the blades will eventually become duller. Even if you clean/lubricate them after every cut. Still, for the price its a great razor that shaves just as good as some of the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth every penny of the reasonable asking price.</li>
            <li> I wear my head bald but can&#x27;t use a razor these clippers are the next best thing I have had other clippers but these get my head tight and last two or three days before I have to clip them again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but isn&#x27;t razor close like other clippers such as Wahl Balding clippers.</li>
            <li> Wonderful this is my second one if you want the bald look with out shaving this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before schedule goods job Amazon your the best.</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week with clippers and these are the best i&#x27;ve ever used. They cut extremely close and you don&#x27;t have to go over the same area over and over. The price was really great too.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My husband got these because he does his hair at home. Lots of options. Doesn&#x27;t shut off my breaker like the previous set we had. Not as much vibration when using either.</li>
            <li> Really like how close the shave is for my husband&#x27;s chrome dome!  The edges do have a design flaw as the skin can get nicked if trying to push too hard and skin stretches.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this was to get a closer cut than a stand buzzer.  This literally cut my skin.  I tried multiple angles, multiple adjustments, and even 2 people tried to use this and it cut my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure if the blades were bent or what the problem was, but I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started self-DIY buzz-cuts about 5 years ago, after paying thousands of dollars over many years for professional barbering at $15/3weeks.  For 20 years that works out to &gt;$5,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the look, you can literally save yourself hundreds of dollars a year, plus cut your hair more often for neater appearance.  This clipper will literally pay for itself in under two months for a single person, and a even more for families, although most kids will not appreciate Dad&#x27;s DIY economizing effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade starts getting dull after about 6 haircuts, so you have to go slower and make more passes to get same result.  However, the comb and blade are easily resharpened, just google for how-to instructional videos.  They are easy to remove, but a little harder to reassemble and position properly,  There are also instructional videos explaining how to align comb when reassembling clipper after blade sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped my clipper once and broke the outermost tip off the comb - the shiny stainless steel part that holds the clip in place.  Wahl replacement combs cost half as much as this entire \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;, so I put up with the busted comb for months, then eventually replaced it with a whole new \\&quot;haircut kit\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a little disappointing that a replacement comb and blade cost nearly as much as an entire new kit.</li>
            <li> How this thing gets so many good reviews is beyond me.  I&#x27;m starting to get sick of Wahl and their mediocre products.  This one has never broken in--since day one, it&#x27;s been SUPER-painful, and immediately puts a straight cut in skin, if not marks.  It&#x27;s literally torture.  Now, if you&#x27;re looking to do some trimming with the clippers, they are so loosely attached, that they sometimes fall off, which can cause a bald spot.  I have to keep a finger on the clipper the whole time while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going with Andis or Oster brand next time.  Wahl, you&#x27;re disappointing, and I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
