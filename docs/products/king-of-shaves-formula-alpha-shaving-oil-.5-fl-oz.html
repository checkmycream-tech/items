            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two or three shaving oils and this one&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>Great for traveling, or at home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it save a lot of space.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, and the oil smells good and feels like it conditions my skin somewhat, too.</li>
            <li>My husband thinks this is the best shaving product available.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and face and just 3 drops gives me a wonderfully close and cut free shave.  </li>
            <li>King of Shaves Alpha oil has a nice consistency to it.</li>
            <li>If you want to use it without shaveing cream/gel beware if you&#x27;re blond and fair skinned though, you might not realize where you have shaved and where not... :)</li>
            <li>scrub before shaving, then splash warm water onto your face, apply about 3-4 drops into your beard or wherever you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I think it may moisturize the skin better than soap.</li>
            <li>I use shaving oil along with shaving soap, it makes shaving much better.</li>
            <li>I think what it does is allow you to shave more without getting abrasions.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, so I end up with olive oil all over the floor - and it doesn&#x27;t go away easily...</li>
            <li>This product worked just fine, it&#x27;s like many others I&#x27;ve tried, I just didn&#x27;t see anything special about it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic with electric or blade razor.  </li>
            <li>When I travel light, I always pack King of Shaves Alpha Oil.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as lather</li>
            <li>I have been cursed with the genes to allow for full beard to grow-in in about a week, but with skin that gets irritaded by the slightest razor burn.  </li>
            <li>shaving oil is essential for a really good shave.</li>
            <li>First, every real shave oil I&#x27;ve tried works better than olive oil.  </li>
            <li>Worth the time to buy them from England through King of Shaves on the internet if you can&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The problem is that it’s a bit thinner than my favorite oil and therefore the King of Shaves bottle doesn’t go as far.</li>
            <li>I tried this after reading very positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I think you get a better deal (and a better oil) with other products.</li>
            <li>When I first read about using shaving oil instead of lather in a men&#x27;s magazine, I could not imagine that working well.  </li>
            <li>but I like seeing exactly where the razor is cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>Leaving Lab Series out, I don&#x27;t think I could necessarily name a better shaving oil than this one.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with shave oil.</li>
            <li>2x better, you will actually look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves</li>
            <li>It definitely does a great job, with or without any other gels or shaving cream.</li>
            <li>you use something like a gillette, don&#x27;t expect much..</li>
            <li>LEARN TO WET SHAVE :)</li>
            <li>A few drops of this oil worked into clean, damp skin gives a smooth shave, without drying skin like soap lathers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other shaving oils (I am a devout shaving oil convert) and King of Shaves beats them all.  </li>
            <li>An older friend of ours who lives in Canada introduced us to the product.  </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend shave oil and suggest that if you haven&#x27;t shaved with it, you should try King of Shaves Alpha Shaving Oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I found it hard to wash off my hands after I put it on my face, the Pacific Shaving Company brand, (another vendor) just rinses off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I like that you can go back over the shave using only water, and the oil still holds up well for a comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a single blade, soap-n-brush man for my normal shaving, but I keep Alpha Shave Oil on hand because it is easy to pack and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Minus one for being menthol-y, though only lightly.</li>
            <li>You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am a 33 year old man and have been shaving since I was 16.  </li>
            <li>What it really does for ME is keep me from getting abrasions on my skin from the shave - not necessarily give me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>I’ve been experimenting with various shaving oils and so far I’ve tried Shave Secret (too thick), Pacific Shaving Company (too thin), Jack Black (too pricey), Bath By Bettijo (perfect), and King of Shaves Alpha Formula (second best).</li>
            <li>My favorite is Lab Series, perhaps a little more expensive but the container is larger, and there is a big difference in performance.</li>
            <li>It also travels super well since it is so small.</li>
            <li>This is mainly for wet shavers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous different products including gels, hot foam, electrics of all types with no success until finding the King of Shaves products.  </li>
            <li>He was not able to buy it locally in Canada and asked if I would buy a year&#x27;s worth and send it to him.  </li>
            <li>Even one little drop spreads over a large area and results in a no-mess, smooooooth shave.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with double-edge safety razors and Mach 3. A few drops of this oil worked into clean, damp skin gives a smooth shave, without drying skin like soap lathers. Rinse and pat dry--some oil remains and protects skin. Minus one for being menthol-y, though only lightly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic with electric or blade razor.  Worth the time to buy them from England through King of Shaves on the internet if you can&#x27;t find it on Amazon.  King of Shaves will pay the shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to shaving oil when traveling several years ago. It takes lots less space, qualifies as as one of my TSA liquids, and does the job just as well as soap. I think it may moisturize the skin better than soap.</li>
            <li> When I travel light, I always pack King of Shaves Alpha Oil. If you are unfamiliar with shaving using oil, you will be amazed at how little you need to get one of the closest shaves in your life. I&#x27;m a single blade, soap-n-brush man for my normal shaving, but I keep Alpha Shave Oil on hand because it is easy to pack and lasts a long time. It can&#x27;t be found everywhere, so stock up at Amazon. I can highly recommend shave oil and suggest that if you haven&#x27;t shaved with it, you should try King of Shaves Alpha Shaving Oil. You will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I am a 33 year old man and have been shaving since I was 16.  I have been cursed with the genes to allow for full beard to grow-in in about a week, but with skin that gets irritaded by the slightest razor burn.  I have tried numerous different products including gels, hot foam, electrics of all types with no success until finding the King of Shaves products.  The oils are the perfect product and size for the traveler. I have yet to be dissapointed by any of the products I have tried from this company.</li>
            <li> I like using this oil.  makes the hair softer and my skin ends up smoother after a shave.  Its just not very cooling as stated in the name, something I like about King of Shaves other shave gels.</li>
            <li> When I first read about using shaving oil instead of lather in a men&#x27;s magazine, I could not imagine that working well.  But I tried it, and I will never go back to messy lather.  Even one little drop spreads over a large area and results in a no-mess, smooooooth shave.  It also travels super well since it is so small.</li>
            <li> I’ve been experimenting with various shaving oils and so far I’ve tried Shave Secret (too thick), Pacific Shaving Company (too thin), Jack Black (too pricey), Bath By Bettijo (perfect), and King of Shaves Alpha Formula (second best). King of Shaves Alpha oil has a nice consistency to it. It’s not too thick and not too thin. The problem is that it’s a bit thinner than my favorite oil and therefore the King of Shaves bottle doesn’t go as far. At $6.89 for such a small amount I think you get a better deal (and a better oil) with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of this product, and others in the line. I discovered it on a trip to the UK.  It definitely does a great job, with or without any other gels or shaving cream. I like that you can go back over the shave using only water, and the oil still holds up well for a comfortable close shave. Great for traveling, or at home.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble to order this product. I don&#x27;t call it a shaving oil, it&#x27;s like shaving with nothing.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to give some protection for electric shavers. It feels just a little oily to me. The bottle is very small and I&#x27;m using more than the few recommended drops to get the protection. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I found it hard to wash off my hands after I put it on my face, the Pacific Shaving Company brand, (another vendor) just rinses off with warm water. The reason I find this an issue is, after I put the oil on my face, your hands are now oily and I have to stop to wash them with soap before i shave. Maybe just me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for a few years now since I stumbled upon it in Gibraltar once. I had an issue with occasionally ingrowing hairs; since I use this, this issue has disappeared. It&#x27;s also great for travelling as it save a lot of space. If you want to use it without shaveing cream/gel beware if you&#x27;re blond and fair skinned though, you might not realize where you have shaved and where not... :)</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as lather but I like seeing exactly where the razor is cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Must rinse, actually tap the hair off the blades.&lt;br /&gt;I use only for a one day growth, if beard is heavy or a two day growth the razor dras and is painful.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep in my travel bag but going back to traditional lather for daily use.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks this is the best shaving product available.  An older friend of ours who lives in Canada introduced us to the product.  He was not able to buy it locally in Canada and asked if I would buy a year&#x27;s worth and send it to him.  That is his birthday present every year now.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading very positive reviews. I use shaving oil along with shaving soap, it makes shaving much better. This product worked just fine, it&#x27;s like many others I&#x27;ve tried, I just didn&#x27;t see anything special about it. My favorite is Lab Series, perhaps a little more expensive but the container is larger, and there is a big difference in performance. Leaving Lab Series out, I don&#x27;t think I could necessarily name a better shaving oil than this one.</li>
            <li> I picked up some shave oil about a year ago at the drug store. Loved it. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s definitely hard to find, though- not all pharmacies carry it. After looking around a bit, I found it on Amazon and *BONUS* it&#x27;s a lot cheaper! I&#x27;ve been getting it on here ever since. I don&#x27;t get razor burn at all anymore. This stuff is great, and the oil smells good and feels like it conditions my skin somewhat, too. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely pleased with shave oil. I highly recommend it. I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to foam or gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two or three shaving oils and this one&#x27;s the best so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is a personal experience and so my review can&#x27;t tell you if it&#x27;s for you.  You&#x27;ve got to try things out for yourself and see what works for YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I won&#x27;t shave without shaving oil ever again.  What it really does for ME is keep me from getting abrasions on my skin from the shave - not necessarily give me a closer shave.  I think what it does is allow you to shave more without getting abrasions.  Therefore, you tend to wind up with a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a pre-shaving oil - let it sit and then lather up.  I, personally, would never shave with just oil - but that&#x27;s me.  I also use it in-between passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing else I&#x27;ll mention is that I&#x27;ve heard of people just using olive oil.  I tried it - and it actually works!  But, there are down-sides.  First, every real shave oil I&#x27;ve tried works better than olive oil.  Second, Olive oil gets all over the place.  I shave in the shower, so I end up with olive oil all over the floor - and it doesn&#x27;t go away easily...</li>
            <li> Wrong product - this is not the right product, avoid buying this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never had a shaving oil, GET THIS ONE NOW!&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t need shaving cream after you&#x27;ve used this..&lt;br /&gt;Face scrub before shaving, then splash warm water onto your face, apply about 3-4 drops into your beard or wherever you are shaving.&lt;br /&gt;This thing alone will make your shaving experience 2x better, you will actually look forward to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Shaves so close, I don&#x27;t need to shave for about 3 days after shaving with this!&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to include : This is mainly for wet shavers!&lt;br /&gt;If you use something like a gillette, don&#x27;t expect much.. LEARN TO WET SHAVE :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other shaving oils (I am a devout shaving oil convert) and King of Shaves beats them all.  I shave my head and face and just 3 drops gives me a wonderfully close and cut free shave.  Try this product and you&#x27;ll never use foam or gel again.</li>
            <li> shaving oil is essential for a really good shave.</li>
