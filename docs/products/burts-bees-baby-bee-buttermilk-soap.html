            <li>I have allergies and while most of the time I don&#x27;t suffer on occasion I get bouts of eczema (sp?).  </li>
            <li>It is not a cure all soap, but it is great for being gentle and non-irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a quality product.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the soap i noticed his skin became ok again.</li>
            <li>This is awesome soap, especially for a baby.</li>
            <li>I feel its safe for any age</li>
            <li>I always love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>good, it was purchased for my girl, but after I tried it, it feels really good and not dry at all, now we the familiy are using together.</li>
            <li>When I was pregnant I bought a bar of my own because I kept going and smelling the one I was given as a baby shower gift.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin soft after bath time!</li>
            <li>The look, smell, the way it lathers up so easily, and leaves the skin very clean and softer than a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be great for my sons sensitive skin, and he splashes all around the tub while bathing.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is sensitive on skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap for my daughter, It is gentle and smells so good</li>
            <li>Love it in the bath seems nice and gentle</li>
            <li>strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These bar soaps are great for sensitive skin, and are the perfect size for little hands (as opposed to using a grown-up sized bar of Dove or Ivory).  </li>
            <li>A good lather but would love more lather and a bigger bar.</li>
            <li>I also like how quickly it washes off!</li>
            <li>I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li>The best soap ever leaves your skin soft like a baby  .Recommend to all ages that want soft baby skin .Good</li>
            <li>Husband has sensitive skin (psoriasis), and this is the best soap so far.  </li>
            <li>but not tear free...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin lightly moisturized and the scent is heavenly.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great soap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product...</li>
            <li>Its fantastic.</li>
            <li>I combine this with coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees Fragrance Free lotion and neither child</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and cleans without over drying your skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this soap.</li>
            <li>The soap is smooth and the baby loves it.</li>
            <li>mild and easy to use up if no longer needed for baby.</li>
            <li>but it runs out very very fast, because you have to use a lot, mostly for hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>great smelling soap that is natural, gentle &amp; does the job.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job cleaning, and is gentle on our baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>clean baby&#x27;s hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;Of course Burt&#x27;s Bees can be found pretty much in every retail outlet (drugstores, health food stores, Target and Walmart, grocery stores, online), but I&#x27;m definitely taking advantage of this great multi-pack price!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>I love this gentle smell, my baby is</li>
            <li>It smells good, pure natural, the child with the rest assured</li>
            <li>Bought while pregnant as excitement for baby was rising, but found soap too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li>Years ago, my family got hooked on Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee after using the bar shampoo (which is no longer available) on our first born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle and soothing!</li>
            <li>It lasts a good long time too.  </li>
            <li>This really stings the eyes, I tried it and it HURT!!</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee soap is also great competition to those pricey, fancy little bath soaps one puts in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I am going to buy the tear free wash tomorrow and not use this on her anymore.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasing and the soap is gently and non-drying.  </li>
            <li>useful.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m sure anyone who does will do well with this soap.  </li>
            <li>We started using hers right away from day 1 and had no problems.</li>
            <li>Luckily we have not gotten it in our daughter&#x27;s eyes, but today I decided to test it in my own just to see how careful we should be...</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and the bar lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle yet cleansing, mildly scented and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s bees buttermilk soap is a nice gentle soap for face and/or entire body.  </li>
            <li>All I can tell you is my wife says this is soft and easy on the skin</li>
            <li>The soap has a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t lather well and leaves child&#x27;s skin dry.</li>
            <li>No rash, very gentle and</li>
            <li>The fragrance was very light and left his skin well hydrated</li>
            <li>My daughter very much, then I will come and continue to buy it for her,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>No scent, but no weird smell either.</li>
            <li>Will try again on myself post partum since the scent is lovely, and hopefully can use on baby in future too.</li>
            <li>no weird &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34</li>
            <li>so much that I ship it to her in China!</li>
            <li>I had never purchased any of their bar soaps from retail soaps,because I wasn&#x27;t aware they even made bath soaps until I cruised on  Amazon.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has super sensitive and dry skin and many soaps give her rashes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and that is the least of its other amazing properties!</li>
            <li>We got this soap as a gift at our baby shower and have continued to buy it because we like it so much.</li>
            <li>it really stung.</li>
            <li>I could get my hands on and went straight to Burt&#x27;s Baby Bees.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very moisturizing and they don&#x27;t melt in the shower.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves the soap and it is very moist.</li>
            <li>very value！</li>
            <li>Use it to wash towels and very moist.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it is gentle on your skin but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Oh, I am grateful thanks</li>
            <li>mild, gentle, does not dry out baby&#x27;s skin,</li>
            <li>I have itchy winter skin and this soap relieves it by not striping the oils out of my skin like many other soaps.</li>
            <li>Other soaps have so many chemicals it is rediculous.  </li>
            <li>I have used this to clean my baby&#x27;s cloth for several months.</li>
            <li>THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;1. bar soap is easy to use - it&#x27;s right there, no fumbling with too much or too little liquid in a bottle</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bar of this soap nearly two years ago.</li>
            <li>It was mild enough for my newborn when I started using it at 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>And the Amazon price is much better than on the corporate website, so we will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li>It washes away easily, unlike some other bar soaps I tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind of soap that doesn&#x27;t break out my little girls skin.</li>
            <li>When we switched back with this order we saw a huge improvement after only a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s delicate, smalls nice, but not overpowering and is natural.</li>
            <li>And They leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I got this soap for my son who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Most soaps leave a residue, which is why I usually use body wash, but this does not.  </li>
            <li>keeps their skin soft with no skin flare-ups!</li>
            <li>It is gentle, barely scented at all, and fits in a cup (the bar is round).&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how often you shave one bar might last as much as 4 months, so three bars, at $9.99,</li>
            <li>He is 8 months old</li>
            <li>Sometimes their skin is so sensitive and giving them a bath with this soap</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin should give it a try</li>
            <li>I know that a lot of people are sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>She loves the silky smooth feeling on her hands; even after they are dried on a towel they still feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>this so if for anyone as far as I am concerned, not just Babies.</li>
            <li>We buy all natural products and assumed that burts was still all natural but after a trip to the emergency room and some research</li>
            <li>It is relexing my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>first of my sons sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t become irritated, it stays soft and he doesn&#x27;t loose moisture.</li>
            <li>I also really used to like the classic pink baby soap bar that Johnson &amp; Johnson used to make, but stores have stopped carrying that as well!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t foam up very well but a minor detail.</li>
            <li>the slight bump in price (I&#x27;m comparing to J&amp;J) is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This soap keeps my skin soft and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>It does not completely dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>My skin did not dry out nor did cause any rashes.</li>
            <li>Not very dry.</li>
            <li>I had a bout when I first purchased this soap and was amazed when just a few days later my eczema was gone.  </li>
            <li>She is 10 months old and we are just finishing up our 2nd bar, so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>So, it their products appear to be a little on the high side, pay it!  </li>

            <li> i love this baby soap when we had diaper rash problems.</li>
            <li> do not recommend using as a hand soap, its better for diaper washing and body or face soap.</li>

            <li> We love the texture and smell of this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and while most of the time I don&#x27;t suffer on occasion I get bouts of eczema (sp?).  </li>
            <li> It is not a cure all soap, but it is great for being gentle and non-irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a quality product.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the soap i noticed his skin became ok again.</li>
            <li> This is awesome soap, especially for a baby.</li>
            <li> I feel its safe for any age</li>
            <li> I always love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> good, it was purchased for my girl, but after I tried it, it feels really good and not dry at all, now we the familiy are using together.</li>
            <li> When I was pregnant I bought a bar of my own because I kept going and smelling the one I was given as a baby shower gift.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin soft after bath time!</li>
            <li> The look, smell, the way it lathers up so easily, and leaves the skin very clean and softer than a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my sons sensitive skin, and he splashes all around the tub while bathing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is sensitive on skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> I use this soap for my daughter, It is gentle and smells so good</li>
            <li> Love it in the bath seems nice and gentle</li>
            <li> strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These bar soaps are great for sensitive skin, and are the perfect size for little hands (as opposed to using a grown-up sized bar of Dove or Ivory).  </li>
            <li> A good lather but would love more lather and a bigger bar.</li>
            <li> I also like how quickly it washes off!</li>
            <li> I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li> The best soap ever leaves your skin soft like a baby  .Recommend to all ages that want soft baby skin .Good</li>
            <li> Husband has sensitive skin (psoriasis), and this is the best soap so far.  </li>
            <li> but not tear free...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin lightly moisturized and the scent is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great soap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...</li>
            <li> Its fantastic.</li>
            <li> I combine this with coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees Fragrance Free lotion and neither child</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and cleans without over drying your skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this soap.</li>
            <li> The soap is smooth and the baby loves it.</li>
            <li> mild and easy to use up if no longer needed for baby.</li>
            <li> but it runs out very very fast, because you have to use a lot, mostly for hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> great smelling soap that is natural, gentle &amp; does the job.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning, and is gentle on our baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> clean baby&#x27;s hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of course Burt&#x27;s Bees can be found pretty much in every retail outlet (drugstores, health food stores, Target and Walmart, grocery stores, online), but I&#x27;m definitely taking advantage of this great multi-pack price!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle smell, my baby is</li>
            <li> It smells good, pure natural, the child with the rest assured</li>
            <li> Bought while pregnant as excitement for baby was rising, but found soap too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> Years ago, my family got hooked on Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee after using the bar shampoo (which is no longer available) on our first born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soothing!</li>
            <li> It lasts a good long time too.  </li>
            <li> This really stings the eyes, I tried it and it HURT!!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee soap is also great competition to those pricey, fancy little bath soaps one puts in the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I am going to buy the tear free wash tomorrow and not use this on her anymore.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasing and the soap is gently and non-drying.  </li>
            <li> useful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m sure anyone who does will do well with this soap.  </li>
            <li> We started using hers right away from day 1 and had no problems.</li>
            <li> Luckily we have not gotten it in our daughter&#x27;s eyes, but today I decided to test it in my own just to see how careful we should be...</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance and the bar lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle yet cleansing, mildly scented and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees buttermilk soap is a nice gentle soap for face and/or entire body.  </li>
            <li> All I can tell you is my wife says this is soft and easy on the skin</li>
            <li> The soap has a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t lather well and leaves child&#x27;s skin dry.</li>
            <li> No rash, very gentle and</li>
            <li> The fragrance was very light and left his skin well hydrated</li>
            <li> My daughter very much, then I will come and continue to buy it for her,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> No scent, but no weird smell either.</li>
            <li> Will try again on myself post partum since the scent is lovely, and hopefully can use on baby in future too.</li>
            <li> no weird &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34</li>
            <li> so much that I ship it to her in China!</li>
            <li> I had never purchased any of their bar soaps from retail soaps,because I wasn&#x27;t aware they even made bath soaps until I cruised on  Amazon.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has super sensitive and dry skin and many soaps give her rashes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and that is the least of its other amazing properties!</li>
            <li> We got this soap as a gift at our baby shower and have continued to buy it because we like it so much.</li>
            <li> it really stung.</li>
            <li> I could get my hands on and went straight to Burt&#x27;s Baby Bees.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very moisturizing and they don&#x27;t melt in the shower.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the soap and it is very moist.</li>
            <li> very value！</li>
            <li> Use it to wash towels and very moist.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is gentle on your skin but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Oh, I am grateful thanks</li>
            <li> mild, gentle, does not dry out baby&#x27;s skin,</li>
            <li> I have itchy winter skin and this soap relieves it by not striping the oils out of my skin like many other soaps.</li>
            <li> Other soaps have so many chemicals it is rediculous.  </li>
            <li> I have used this to clean my baby&#x27;s cloth for several months.</li>
            <li> THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;1. bar soap is easy to use - it&#x27;s right there, no fumbling with too much or too little liquid in a bottle</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bar of this soap nearly two years ago.</li>
            <li> It was mild enough for my newborn when I started using it at 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> And the Amazon price is much better than on the corporate website, so we will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> It washes away easily, unlike some other bar soaps I tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of soap that doesn&#x27;t break out my little girls skin.</li>
            <li> When we switched back with this order we saw a huge improvement after only a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s delicate, smalls nice, but not overpowering and is natural.</li>
            <li> And They leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I got this soap for my son who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most soaps leave a residue, which is why I usually use body wash, but this does not.  </li>
            <li> keeps their skin soft with no skin flare-ups!</li>
            <li> It is gentle, barely scented at all, and fits in a cup (the bar is round).&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how often you shave one bar might last as much as 4 months, so three bars, at $9.99,</li>
            <li> He is 8 months old</li>
            <li> Sometimes their skin is so sensitive and giving them a bath with this soap</li>
            <li> People with sensitive skin should give it a try</li>
            <li> I know that a lot of people are sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li> She loves the silky smooth feeling on her hands; even after they are dried on a towel they still feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> this so if for anyone as far as I am concerned, not just Babies.</li>
            <li> We buy all natural products and assumed that burts was still all natural but after a trip to the emergency room and some research</li>
            <li> It is relexing my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> first of my sons sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t become irritated, it stays soft and he doesn&#x27;t loose moisture.</li>
            <li> I also really used to like the classic pink baby soap bar that Johnson &amp; Johnson used to make, but stores have stopped carrying that as well!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam up very well but a minor detail.</li>
            <li> the slight bump in price (I&#x27;m comparing to J&amp;J) is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps my skin soft and does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> It does not completely dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> My skin did not dry out nor did cause any rashes.</li>
            <li> Not very dry.</li>
            <li> I had a bout when I first purchased this soap and was amazed when just a few days later my eczema was gone.  </li>
            <li> She is 10 months old and we are just finishing up our 2nd bar, so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> So, it their products appear to be a little on the high side, pay it!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other French milled soaps I&#x27;ve used, but I like the size and shape of the bar and the feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time so</li>
            <li> We are officially lifelong BB customers and will only use this with baby number 2 as well.</li>
            <li> I use it because I&#x27;m sensitive to harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It definitely does sting eyes really badly, so we only use it on our children from the neck down.</li>
            <li> I only used it because of an add on I needed to purchase other items.  </li>
            <li> Ordered these after we used up the tiny bar in our Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Sampler, and began using other baby soaps we&#x27;d received as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-sensitive uber dry skin.</li>
            <li> I even use them on my face and they don&#x27;t leave my face dry at all.</li>
            <li> also for dry skin I have dry skin but not when I use this.</li>
            <li> Little guy started getting rashes and skin reactions we&#x27;d never seen before - not from the other soaps, to be clear, but it seems for him the BB is so calming to the skin that it helps prevent them.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit weird honestly; also, it&#x27;s a little harsh for a toddler&#x27;s skin, leaves it very dry.</li>
            <li> So be carefull, it is really not for children at all unless you use it just on their lower body.</li>
            <li> Just a word of caution - be careful not to get it in baby&#x27;s eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> so I chose to skip Aveno or any other grocery store brands</li>
            <li> Every other soap dries me out..</li>
            <li> have to be very careful...</li>
            <li> Unlike wasteful bottles of liquid baby shampoo, those textured toddler soaps that basically dissolve in ten days, or those artificial fragrance kids body washes, Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee soaps last for weeks and weeks, even after daily use!  </li>
            <li> I got this soap when my baby was about 2 months old when I thought that J&amp;J soap was irritating his skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this instead of any other body wash!</li>
            <li> but my little one is not</li>
            <li> I guess I was impatient for baby smell.</li>
            <li> Came in a three pack, so I&#x27;ve got a few to use.</li>
            <li> Even though it sticks to the tub when dried I still give this product five stars.  </li>
            <li> and after I washed he little fingers and hands before I could rinse them off he went to rub his tired eyes, soon after he was screaming and crying.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle, calming aroma, and she loves the signature Bee imprint on the perfectly-sized round bar.</li>
            <li> This soap is very hard to find in stores and usually sells for $4.59 per bar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a subtle smell not overpoering...</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that works on my children that doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin horribly.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in a store unless you get it in a gift set.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for a friend, she said she absolutely loves it, she says she uses nothing else, great as&lt;br /&gt;A gift</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never actually written a review for a hygiene product, so here goes.  Burt&#x27;s Bees offers lots of great products, but their bar soaps are especially good.  Years ago, my family got hooked on Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee after using the bar shampoo (which is no longer available) on our first born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bar soaps are great for sensitive skin, and are the perfect size for little hands (as opposed to using a grown-up sized bar of Dove or Ivory).

            <li> I love the bert bees baby soap.</li>
            <li> great smelling soap that is natural, gentle &amp; does the job.  Doesn&#x27;t foam up very well but a minor detail.</li>
            <li> My guests loved the soap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good !i use it my own !</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be great for my sons sensitive skin, and he splashes all around the tub while bathing.

            <li> The smell is a bit weird honestly; also, it&#x27;s a little harsh for a toddler&#x27;s skin, leaves it very dry. It&#x27;s the last time I buy these soaps. I used the liquid version and it was great but it runs out very very fast, because you have to use a lot, mostly for hair. If you don&#x27;t mind paying more, and buying often, the liquid version is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and that is the least of its other amazing properties! first of my sons sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t become irritated, it stays soft and he doesn&#x27;t loose moisture. I also like how quickly it washes off!</li>
            <li> I love this soap for me! I have hyper-sensitive uber dry skin. This soap is gentle yet cleansing, mildly scented and moisturizing. A good lather but would love more lather and a bigger bar.</li>
            <li> strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I love love love this soap!!  It is great for the whole family.  It smells great and is sensitive on skin.  I have allergies to synthetic preservatives and have to stay away from a lot of brands.  This soap is the best.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Worth it for me to know that I&#x27;m putting great products on her skin (for probably the last year), that leave her smelling wonderful.  This is the only product line I use for my child&#x27;s skin care.</li>
            <li> great to wash baby with...a subtle smell not overpoering...but not tear free...it burns my babies eyes...have to be very careful...else would have given a 5*</li>
            <li> This soap smells delicious and seems to work well. It definitely does sting eyes really badly, so we only use it on our children from the neck down.</li>
            <li> It smells good,baby will like it!</li>
            <li> Not yet used. It is cost-effective</li>
            <li> Love it in the bath seems nice and gentle</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this soap. Very gentle and great smelling! Our daughter has super sensitive and dry skin and many soaps give her rashes. Not this one! We are so happy with it! When I was pregnant I bought a bar of my own because I kept going and smelling the one I was given as a baby shower gift. I guess I was impatient for baby smell. We started using hers right away from day 1 and had no problems.</li>
            <li> I love the bert bees baby soap.  It does not completely dry my skin out.  I also use it daily for cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! I bought them for my baby, however I couldn&#x27;t resist the lovely smell and decided to try them myself. They smell so good, kind of like ice cream! And They leave your skin very soft. I even use them on my face and they don&#x27;t leave my face dry at all. I will continue using this instead of any other body wash!</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome. It smells wonderful. It washes away easily, unlike some other bar soaps I tried. It was mild enough for my newborn when I started using it at 8 weeks. I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I use this myself, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Most soaps leave a residue, which is why I usually use body wash, but this does not.  It leaves my skin lightly moisturized and the scent is heavenly.  I have very sensitive skin and this has never caused a rash or itching.</li>
            <li> good, it was purchased for my girl, but after I tried it, it feels really good and not dry at all, now we the familiy are using together.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees buttermilk soap is a nice gentle soap for face and/or entire body.  Pleasant scent and no drying effects.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is gentle on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin! I even use it on my face sometimes for facial washes.</li>
            <li> Excellent .Buy it for my nephew，it&#x27;s very good as so far.</li>
            <li> This is very good, I like it</li>
            <li> Bought for cousin, he loves it.</li>
            <li> i need it .because useful.Want a discount.i will buy it once more.i love my baby and happy birthday for you!</li>
            <li> This is great for babies!  Sometimes their skin is so sensitive and giving them a bath with this soap keeps their skin soft with no skin flare-ups!</li>
            <li> We got this soap as a gift at our baby shower and have continued to buy it because we like it so much. It does a great job cleaning, and is gentle on our baby&#x27;s sensitive skin. She is 10 months old and we are just finishing up our 2nd bar, so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I got this soap when my baby was about 2 months old when I thought that J&amp;J soap was irritating his skin. Since then no problems and it lasted me over 6 months! Now he&#x27;s 11 months and I&#x27;m on soap #2. I love this soap it&#x27;s delicate, smalls nice, but not overpowering and is natural. I&#x27;ll give it to my friends for their baby showers. The only thing is that it seems to sting his eyes if he gets any in them.</li>
            <li> used this on diaper cake for baby shower.  was perfect</li>
            <li> Good soap.  I only used it because of an add on I needed to purchase other items.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m sure anyone who does will do well with this soap.  No scent, but no weird smell either. Non drying either. People with sensitive skin should give it a try</li>
            <li> All I can tell you is my wife says this is soft and easy on the skin and she has the skin you just love to touch! Just don&#x27;t let me catch you!!</li>
            <li> This soap works great for our infant&#x27;s very sensitive skin and it smells great too. Just a word of caution - be careful not to get it in baby&#x27;s eyes. it STINGS. Luckily we have not gotten it in our daughter&#x27;s eyes, but today I decided to test it in my own just to see how careful we should be...it really stung. So much so that I am going to buy the tear free wash tomorrow and not use this on her anymore.</li>
            <li> This is such a great soap. It&#x27;s natural and gentle on baby&#x27;s skin. I know that a lot of people are sensitive to fragrance but my little one is not and I LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> The soap has a nice smell but it doesn&#x27;t lather well and leaves child&#x27;s skin dry. I prefer the liquid soap/shower gel.</li>
            <li> This soap is very hard to find in stores and usually sells for $4.59 per bar.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for shaving with a mug and brush. It is gentle, barely scented at all, and fits in a cup (the bar is round).&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how often you shave one bar might last as much as 4 months, so three bars, at $9.99, could last you a year!</li>
            <li> My baby broke out using Johnson&#x27;s &amp; Johnson&#x27;s anything. I was already concerned with ingredients so I chose to skip Aveno or any other grocery store brands I could get my hands on and went straight to Burt&#x27;s Baby Bees. So glad I did! No rash, very gentle and it smells so precious! We also switched to Baby Bees shampoo, lotion &amp; diaper ointment and we are so glad we did. It lasts for a long time so the slight bump in price (I&#x27;m comparing to J&amp;J) is well worth it. My baby is now almost 3 and we are still with BB. We are officially lifelong BB customers and will only use this with baby number 2 as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...btw, anything in this line of products are fantastic!  Shampoo/conditioner, lip balm, hand lotion, etc wonderful and as they say, you get what you pay for.  So, it their products appear to be a little on the high side, pay it!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed! This soap is DOPE!  Happy scrubbing...</li>
            <li> The best soap ever leaves your skin soft like a baby  .Recommend to all ages that want soft baby skin .Good also for dry skin I have dry skin but not when I use this.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my daughter can use that doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin. It has a subtle, calming aroma, and she loves the signature Bee imprint on the perfectly-sized round bar.</li>
            <li> Even though I am not a baby I love this soap. I have itchy winter skin and this soap relieves it by not striping the oils out of my skin like many other soaps. It has a nice fragrance and the bar lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and soothing!</li>
            <li> I have used this to clean my baby&#x27;s cloth for several months. It makes me to feel safe to use it.</li>
            <li> Best soap EVER!! I like everything about it. The look, smell, the way it lathers up so easily, and leaves the skin very clean and softer than a baby&#x27;s butt. I&#x27;ll be ordering more. Its fantastic.</li>
            <li> They last forever! Love everything about this product :)</li>
            <li> Smells great. Bought while pregnant as excitement for baby was rising, but found soap too drying for my skin. Used to use it years ago with no problem, so maybe it&#x27;s a pregnancy dryness versus a change in the soap. Came in a three pack, so I&#x27;ve got a few to use. Will try again on myself post partum since the scent is lovely, and hopefully can use on baby in future too.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes it, it smells good and feel comfortable after using. I will buy it in the future and will recommend it to my friends who have children.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my grandmother can use. She has a number of skin issues and allergies, but Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Bee works on her like a charm. No reactions at all. She loves the silky smooth feeling on her hands; even after they are dried on a towel they still feel hydrated. And the Amazon price is much better than on the corporate website, so we will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Perfect - I&#x27;m big on smell and lather when it comes to soaps. I needed really gentle soap for me and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers really well.  Great for sensitive skins.  We are also using their shampoo, body lotion, and diaper ointment too.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees does not disappoint with the soap.  Even though it sticks to the tub when dried I still give this product five stars.  It is the only thing that works on my children that doesn&#x27;t dry out their skin horribly.  I combine this with coconut oil and the Burt&#x27;s Bees Fragrance Free lotion and neither child has any skin problems anymore.  It works better than the prescription lotion my son was prescribed.</li>
            <li> i love this baby soap when we had diaper rash problems. mild and easy to use up if no longer needed for baby. do not recommend using as a hand soap, its better for diaper washing and body or face soap. smells terrific.</li>
            <li> We love this soap!  The scent is light and pleasing and the soap is gently and non-drying.  It is our very favorite!</li>
            <li> LOVE BURTS BEES. WILL ORDER MORE ONCE MY PACK IS FINISHED. ITS 3 IN 1 PACK. GOOD BUY FOR ME.</li>
            <li> THE BEST.&lt;br /&gt;1. bar soap is easy to use - it&#x27;s right there, no fumbling with too much or too little liquid in a bottle&lt;br /&gt;2. mild, gentle, does not dry out baby&#x27;s skin, no flaking of baby&#x27;s skin&lt;br /&gt;3. no weird &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees&amp;#34; smell.  I love this gentle smell, my baby is oh so sniffable and soft&lt;br /&gt;4. great price and lasts</li>
            <li> Ordered these after we used up the tiny bar in our Burt&#x27;s Bees Baby Sampler, and began using other baby soaps we&#x27;d received as gifts. Little guy started getting rashes and skin reactions we&#x27;d never seen before - not from the other soaps, to be clear, but it seems for him the BB is so calming to the skin that it helps prevent them. When we switched back with this order we saw a huge improvement after only a couple weeks. It also has a very pleasant scent, and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other French milled soaps I&#x27;ve used, but I like the size and shape of the bar and the feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> good, bees is very famous brand.</li>
            <li> I think it is very necessary to use this. In order to baby&#x27;s health. Now I haven&#x27;t used it ,nothing but  I believe that it will be very good.</li>
            <li> I love these soaps. They&#x27;re very moisturizing and they don&#x27;t melt in the shower. It lasts a good while and is definitely worth the money. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Good smell, for a god night dream.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of soap that doesn&#x27;t break out my little girls skin. We buy tons of it at a time to keep it stocked up. We never leave home without it!</li>
            <li> It smells good, pure natural, the child with the rest assured</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to EVERYTHING, but we have not had any problems with any of the burt&#x27;s bees baby bee products on her.</li>
            <li> Great for my baby&#x27;s skin and it smells good. The fragrance was very light and left his skin well hydrated</li>
            <li> We love the texture and smell of this bar of soap. The yummy scent lingers after the wash. It lasts forever, so a 3-pack should be good for almost a year.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this for my granddaughter.... so much that I ship it to her in China!</li>
            <li> I have allergies and while most of the time I don&#x27;t suffer on occasion I get bouts of eczema (sp?).  I had a bout when I first purchased this soap and was amazed when just a few days later my eczema was gone.  It is not a cure all soap, but it is great for being gentle and non-irritating to the skin.  Other soaps have so many chemicals it is rediculous.  I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a quality product.  It lasts a good long time too.  Granted I am a grown up, but this so if for anyone as far as I am concerned, not just Babies.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s light and cleans without over drying your skin. I use it because I&#x27;m sensitive to harsh soaps.</li>
            <li> This soap keeps my skin soft and does not dry it out. I enjoy using this soap. This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> i like this at beginning...mild scent! but after a week of using i noticed my son skin became red and with some scattered rash. I stopped using the soap i noticed his skin became ok again.</li>
            <li> The soap is smooth and the baby loves it.</li>
            <li> This is awesome soap, especially for a baby. It lasts a long time. It is impossible to find in a store unless you get it in a gift set.</li>
            <li> My daughter had an allergic reaction to this stuff.  We buy all natural products and assumed that burts was still all natural but after a trip to the emergency room and some research, I found out that burt&#x27;s has been bought out and may not be the same stuff we used to get!</li>
            <li> I got this soap for my son who has very sensitive skin. This works great and doesn&#x27;t make his skin break out. I am a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s anyway, but I especially love their baby products.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bar of this soap nearly two years ago.I had never purchased any of their bar soaps from retail soaps,because I wasn&#x27;t aware they even made bath soaps until I cruised on  Amazon. I just finished a bar that I used for 31days. My skin did not dry out nor did cause any rashes. I feel its safe for any age and you will appreciate its qualities.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and this is no exception! It smells great and leaves my baby&#x27;s skin soft after bath time!</li>
            <li> clean baby&#x27;s hand,just do it work,clean the fungus,I think it will do it ,very  useful ,if it good like it ,</li>
            <li> Husband has sensitive skin (psoriasis), and this is the best soap so far.  I love the mild scent.</li>
            <li> I always love it. It is relexing my sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;so good to me!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the soap and it is very moist. Feel good!</li>
            <li> Really like this soap --- and  it smells great!</li>
            <li> great for my baby&#x27;s skin and does not have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Flavor fragrance！Special offer to buy, very value！</li>
            <li> And I think, is very perfect</li>
            <li> Very moist and very good, use it to wash their hands to help the baby.Tastes like.Use it to wash towels and very moist.Not very dry. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it is gentle on your skin but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my daughter, It is gentle and smells so good and my daugther hasn&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
