            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I so absolutely love these brushes..</li>
            <li>Over the years I have bought many MAC/Sephora brushes that have fell apart, so I decided why not give these</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Absolutely love these brushes and they arrived days before they we&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes</li>
            <li>I love them and their look but they all came apart.</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I just took them out of the package and they have a chemical smell, I washed the brushes up and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding thus far.  </li>
            <li>I liked them at first but, not even having them for a month........</li>
            <li>they are very soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>I needed sturdy and professional brushes for my new makeup that I purchased for the wedding and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Brush quality is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I clean them with soap and lukewarm water, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Very soft, lightweight, don&#x27;t feel cheap though nice quality</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>They are good brushes but I only use 2 of the 4.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bad brushes</li>
            <li>Other then that great product.</li>
            <li>LOVE highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I do wish the foundation brush was a little more dense, but still works nicely.</li>
            <li>and i love how soft they are.</li>
            <li>They were nice when I first got them but after wear the bristle head fell off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>but I super glued it back together, and for the price, I&#x27;d rather buy 100 more then get the sigma ones,</li>
            <li>I originally bought a single, similar brush, loved it and lost it.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a 2nd set that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>their exactly like my Sigma and Sadona Lace brushes..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d advise cleaning the brush first anyway.</li>
            <li>They are well made and put together, they did smell when I first got them</li>
            <li>The brushes blend my foundation pretty well</li>
            <li>but i think i will invest in some better quality brushes next time.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to replace it since it was such a good deal, and I actually think my foundation looks better, now that I use the different brushes to get it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Good dupes for the more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>They are SUPER soft and work very well with my liquid makeup and power!</li>
            <li>The handles were a tad loose but for the price, it was totally fine!</li>
            <li>super soft and no shedding.</li>
            <li>Other than that small issue they&#x27;re perfect.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li>No shedding so far, definately worth it.</li>
            <li>They also shipped fast from china.</li>
            <li>and I use them very often,</li>
            <li>but I loved the brush so much that I made a second purchase of a  larger,  similar set.</li>
            <li>They are decent brushes.</li>
            <li>But I will say that this applies makeup better than any other professional brush I have!</li>
            <li>I had to super glue them back together.</li>
            <li>JUST LIKE SIGMA, OR HIGH END BRUSHES.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>one the bristles completely feel off!!</li>
            <li>Ordered this a week ago and it&#x27;s already here (I live on Texas).</li>
            <li>the flat top isn&#x27;t as dense as I expected it to be but it will work for 6 dollars.</li>
            <li>So far i have been only using one brush, but it does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>The flat kabuki here does exactly what I need and does it well.</li>
            <li>I ordered these a few weeks ago and they came SO quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>These brushes are SO soft, they smell kind of weird</li>
            <li>super soft brushes and very little shedding.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super dense and leaves absolutely no streaks (I use a mix of philosophy hope in a jar and Urban Decay Naked foundation).</li>
            <li>Two of the brushes tops broke off the first time i used them while the other two have lasted, if that happens to you the detached part could always be glued back into place.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual smell like other reviews are saying.</li>

            <li> These brushes are SO soft, they smell kind of weird</li>
            <li> super soft brushes and very little shedding.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual smell like other reviews are saying.</li>
            <li> they came unglued a bit and kinda fold in half, guess i have to buy new ones or glue them,</li>
            <li> Soft on the face and provide as much or as little product as you want evenly.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft &amp; firm brushes for liquid or cream foundation.</li>
            <li> No need to go spend 28$ on a single brush if you get 4 for 7$</li>
            <li> They have a slight bigger handle then what is shown.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little earlier than expected too</li>
            <li> They arrived way before the day expected soo</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful since the brushes might detach when you&#x27;re using them.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it takes a few weeks to come in.</li>
            <li> I washed it once so far, and I was unable to get out the dried up foundation off the bristles, especially in the middle area, but this gives me an opportunity to try the other shapes.</li>
            <li> I advise to wash them before using; they had a slight smell to them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about half a year now</li>
            <li> I had a few problems with two of the handles falling out</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A few reviews said they smelled, they do when you pull them out if the packaging.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the brushes, but I gave them a try (after all, they were only 6 bucks).</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any bristles falling out, or a chemical smell that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy all those other expensive makeup brushes that you see on the market.</li>
            <li> However, one of the handle are broken and haven&#x27;t even used the brushes yet.  </li>
            <li> but I washed them with baby shampoo and the smell went away, one of them was broken</li>
            <li> So disappointed....</li>

            <li> Great brushes and you can&#x27;t best the price. I do wish the foundation brush was a little more dense, but still works nicely. Shipping only took 10 days! They smelled like permanent markers when I opened the package, but I&#x27;ve already washed them and let them air out so no big deal for me.</li>

I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t come in time for the wedding (with their listing that they&#x27;d take over a month to deliver), but they were here two weeks prior to it! I needed sturdy and professional brushes for my new makeup that I purchased for the wedding and these work perfectly. They&#x27;re great for blush, powder, bronzer, and even foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I liked them at first but, not even having them for a month........the have come unglued grom the handle.  All I have now are silver ends with the brush tops.  So disappointed....don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> These brushes were amazing for the price. super soft and no shedding. I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual smell like other reviews are saying. They also shipped fast from china. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> They were nice when I first got them but after wear the bristle head fell off the wooden handle. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> super soft brushes and very little shedding. I use it everyday. Definitely worth the money! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love love love! I was recommended these brushes through a beauty blog and I am not disappointed! They haven&#x27;t shed at all with daily use for 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve even cleaned them and no shedding!! I will be ordering a 2nd set that&#x27;s for sure. A few reviews said they smelled, they do when you pull them out if the packaging. But once you use them that smell doesn&#x27;t linger on your face from using the brushes at all. You wash them and the smell is 100% gone.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely fashion. I just took them out of the package and they have a chemical smell, I washed the brushes up and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding thus far.  However, one of the handle are broken and haven&#x27;t even used the brushes yet.  I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I so absolutely love these brushes.. they are very soft and good quality. They have a slight bigger handle then what is shown. I advise to wash them before using; they had a slight smell to them. Other then that great product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING. JUST LIKE SIGMA, OR HIGH END BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! Very soft, lightweight, don&#x27;t feel cheap though nice quality their exactly like my Sigma and Sadona Lace brushes.. I already had them for one month and I use them very often, I deep cleaned them and they did NOT shed! I love them! Great Deal amazing!</li>
            <li> LOVE highly recommend. Arrived a little earlier than expected too</li>
            <li> I was weary about getting these brushes, juse because of the price! But I will say that this applies makeup better than any other professional brush I have! I have not experienced any bristles falling out, or a chemical smell that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Ordered this a week ago and it&#x27;s already here (I live on Texas). These brushes are SO soft, they smell kind of weird but I&#x27;d advise cleaning the brush first anyway. Great buy! I can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> They are great brushes !!! They arrived way before the day expected soo thats a plus !!!!</li>
            <li> they came unglued a bit and kinda fold in half, guess i have to buy new ones or glue them,</li>
            <li> Over the years I have bought many MAC/Sephora brushes that have fell apart, so I decided why not give these (4) brushes a try for $10! I am beyond impressed. I&#x27;ve had them for about 7-8 months and nothing has fell out, and I use 2 of them every day. If you&#x27;re looking for supes, you have found them! I clean them with soap and lukewarm water, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine. I&#x27;ll probably buy another set just to have, or give as a gift! Love them</li>
            <li> So glad these brushes came!!.. the flat top isn&#x27;t as dense as I expected it to be but it will work for 6 dollars. It came a couple days after the estimated date but it came from China so I understand now. I had ordered brushes from another seller and its been 2 months and no brushes! Overall happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Some of the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> These are flipping amazing! They are well made and put together, they did smell when I first got them but I washed them with baby shampoo and the smell went away, one of them was broken but I super glued it back together, and for the price, I&#x27;d rather buy 100 more then get the sigma ones, these work just as well.</li>
            <li> Great and affordable. Arrived sooner then expected. Very happy!</li>
            <li> literally SO happy with these brushes!! They are SUPER soft and work very well with my liquid makeup and power! Also THEY CAME IN WEEKS BEFORE THE DELIVERY DATE!</li>
            <li> love theses brushes , they work amazing and no shedding</li>
            <li> So i was supposed to receive them on oct 22nd and i got them on oct 6th. Thats amazing. Brush quality is fabulous. Used them for foundation and concealer this morning and i love how soft they are. Definitly a thumbs up. No need to go spend 28$ on a single brush if you get 4 for 7$</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes! And how dense they were ! They&#x27;re perfect for my foundation and it gives me an amazing finish! Would def recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes and they arrived days before they we&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they did have a weird smell to it, but as soon as I applied my makeup it went away. I&#x27;ve been having them for 3 weeks and only shed 3 hairs. I also got them 2 weeks ahead of time</li>
            <li> They are absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend this product. They came two days before their arrival date, and when you open them, it has a somewhat of a plastic odor, but it goes away. They are easy to clean and they feel great on my face and helps me get a flawless finish. 5 STARS⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and I bought these. They are really dense and very great brushes. They pick up a lot of product. The handles were a tad loose but for the price, it was totally fine!</li>
            <li> These brushes were great! I&#x27;ve had them for about half a year now and they are still in great shape. I recommended them to all my friends. They are great quality.</li>
            <li> Good dupes for the more expensive brushes. Soft on the face and provide as much or as little product as you want evenly. Minimal brush strokes are visible and they completely go away when you set your face afterwards.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect for contouring! I use these brushes along with my mary Lou Manizer and Bahama Mama bronzed by the Balm. I&#x27;ve used dozens of different brushes for brightening and bronzing my face from Mac brushes to drug store brushes. At this price, they are a must have.</li>
            <li> Great value and outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> Great Deal. I originally bought a single, similar brush, loved it and lost it. Ordered this to replace it since it was such a good deal, and I actually think my foundation looks better, now that I use the different brushes to get it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The brushes blend my foundation pretty well but you have to be careful since the brushes might detach when you&#x27;re using them. Two of the brushes tops broke off the first time i used them while the other two have lasted, if that happens to you the detached part could always be glued back into place. They&#x27;re not bad brushes but i think i will invest in some better quality brushes next time.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love these brushes</li>
            <li> You cannot beat these brushes for the price. I ordered them after spending $30 on a Sephora brush that kept &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; all over when I used it. The flat kabuki here does exactly what I need and does it well. I&#x27;m pretty impressed by this set.</li>
            <li> Just what they say , work great !</li>
            <li> Love them! The price is amazing for the quality that you receive. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love them and their look but they all came apart. I had to super glue them back together. Other than that small issue they&#x27;re perfect. Gives the best full coverage.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes for the price. The only downside is it takes a few weeks to come in.</li>
            <li> For this price, I was expecting a low to medium quality, brush, but what I got totally exceeded my expectations. The brushes are super dense and leaves absolutely no streaks (I use a mix of philosophy hope in a jar and Urban Decay Naked foundation). I can apply the foundation to my face evenly and it&#x27;s good for build up without moving the layer underneath, which is what happens when I use my fingers sometimes. I washed it once so far, and I was unable to get out the dried up foundation off the bristles, especially in the middle area, but this gives me an opportunity to try the other shapes. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> shipping took a month. nice product.</li>
            <li> the brushes are soft and feel great, they work wonderfully too. i love them.</li>
