            <li>coats is all that&#x27;s needed to build a beautiful opaque color.</li>

            <li>I love the color,it&#x27;s perfect for the summer</li>
            <li>it keeps it bright.</li>
            <li>BRIGHT STANDS OUT.</li>
            <li>It takes a good three to four coats to match the color that it looks to be in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The Nail polish was in mint condition and the prompt shipping ,made it a joy to own.</li>
            <li>chip resistant and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>, their polishes are amazing, this is a beautiful color, kind of irredecent, recommend using 2 coats.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect summer color and because I prefer bright &amp; different colors on my toes, not my fingers, it is a great flip-flop color.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cute when you put 3 coats on it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Awesome and Pretty Color</li>
            <li>The color looked amazing</li>
            <li>Really love the bright colours that pop.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know it was going to be matte, so that would&#x27;ve been nice to know.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good color though and all you need to do to make it shiny is put a top coat over it.</li>
            <li>NICE.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and BEST COLOR EVER!</li>
            <li>It has a nice amount of sparkle to it, without being overtly glittery, and a great shade, between turquoise and royal but very saturated and bright.</li>
            <li>You do need a top coat as with many colors this bright.</li>
            <li>Oh the color is gorgeous, and the picture of it from the website is so true to life.</li>
            <li>I used two-three coats, it was percent, and dries quick!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pearlized color but still beautiful and only needs two coats to look GREAT!</li>
            <li>This is the best blue nail polish that I have found to date.  </li>
            <li>but I have no problem with that as I wouldn&#x27;t wear any nail polish without a top coat.  </li>
            <li>Lovely shade too</li>
            <li>but after i received it i realized it was more a metallic color</li>
            <li>But that is most china glaze products.</li>
            <li>So if you love China Glaze nail polish, order from this company.</li>
            <li>It has a personal meaning between my daughter &amp; I. China Glaze is great!</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that perfect summer blue shade.</li>
            <li>I love china glaze</li>
            <li>and I was very excited to receive it.</li>
            <li>This polish is super cute to wear in the summer.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap so there is no worries which is why I gave this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my niece that loves pinks and light blues.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light and iridescent.</li>
            <li>This is a great bright blue neon color, BUT it is soo sheer!</li>
            <li>but it takes too many coats to make it pretty.</li>
            <li>;-)... wish it just didn&#x27;t take so many layers of nail polish.</li>
            <li>bright blue</li>
            <li>Color is off from the picture but understandable but this is more of a glittery color and was looking more for a solid color</li>
            <li>Really nice light sky blue color with a bit of shine to it.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product overall.</li>
            <li>The color is great though it just took several coats to make it look decent.</li>
            <li>At first i was excited about this color</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!!</li>
            <li>ITS COOL TO GET OTHER BRIGHT COLORS AND DO EACH NAIL</li>
            <li>RIGHT BEFORE SUMMER.</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick and i&#x27;m in love with this blue!</li>
            <li>You do need about 2 full coats on it to really get a color.</li>
            <li>A clear top coat is needed to give it a high gloss exterior.</li>
            <li>, the first coat was</li>
            <li>However it is still a really pretty color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to test out ChinaGlaze in the store first if I plan on buying any more online...</li>
            <li>Now I know that they never show up exactly as they appear in the bottle, but this was way darker than I want, at all.</li>
            <li>This nail polish has a pretty color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never come across another nail shade as pretty as this one.  </li>
            <li>This blue will be my favorite nail color for a lifetime.</li>
            <li>This polish is so girly and pretty.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love this color, but it is VERY sheer.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more solid</li>
            <li>I purchased this polish in hopes for a pretty blue that wasn&#x27;t necessarily pastel or too bright-</li>
            <li>Although I kind of don&#x27;t like how many coats it takes to be dark enough for me.</li>
            <li>This one dries kind of dark</li>
            <li>Overall I would give this a 9 out of 10 because even though this is probably my new favorite summer polish</li>
            <li>Really like this colour and that it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping /</li>
            <li>Has a nice slight shimmer too!</li>
            <li>Words can barely describe how in love I am with this blue polish.  </li>
            <li>A DIFFERENT COLOR TRUE TO COLOR IN PICTURE.</li>
            <li>which I also tried and it made the application a bit more difficult and the polish a lot more streaky.</li>
            <li>but after the second coat, it was just right.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this shade to anyone looking for a hot summertime blue for their mani/ pedi .</li>
            <li>It took more coats with the white polish to get the same color as the actual polish by it self.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a really pretty blue.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried china glaze, you need a top coat, but regardless you should always use a base and top coat!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a glittery little transparent blue.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>white it would probably take 2-3 depending on thick/thin coats or how much visible nail line</li>
            <li>I take it with me whenever I get a professional pedicure and the technicians have no problem working with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>vibrant tropic blue.</li>
            <li>There is a very subtle shimmer in the color which only adds to its brilliant allure without dominating the finish like your typical &amp;#34;frosty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;metallic/pearled&amp;#34; looking polishes.  </li>
            <li>The color is over-the-top cute!</li>
            <li>It also requires a topcoat as it tries to look very matte, even though it&#x27;s not labeled as a matte polish.</li>
            <li>The nail polish I received seemed to be very watered down.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like having the benefits of a rich matte color with a touch of shimmer for some subtle glam and dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was really thin and chipped off easily</li>
            <li>I found myself having to use about 4-5 coats to get the color I really wanted and its a little watery.</li>
            <li>but it you put a single lair of white down first</li>

            <li> but it you put a single lair of white down first</li>
            <li> Without a white base, it&#x27;s build able, but would take about 4 coats and that&#x27;s a lot to me right</li>
            <li> It also has a matte finish but like other reviewers said, that can easily be fixed with a shiny topcoat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use it from time to time, but probably not nearly as often as I would have.</li>
            <li> so we polished her nails pink and blue.</li>
            <li> I like different shades of blue and bluish green.</li>
            <li> This has a sort of mermaid shimmer to it, and the image on the computer was a little bit brighter/more aqua than the actual color.</li>
            <li> But not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> The polish has shimmer in it which I hate but the color is so pretty and vibrant; the shimmer almost doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Shelf Life is very limited -- Keep the cap tight and you will still have it dried and sticky in 6 months -</li>
            <li> It is a very dark blue because it requires at least two coats and by then it&#x27;s just a very dark version of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too worried about it chipping because china glaze usually lasts a week with base and top coat</li>
            <li> I bought this polish a few months ago here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this colour along with the neon green kiwi koolada.</li>
            <li> In love with this color, but but but you HAVE to put at least 3 coats on this bad boy!</li>
            <li> Im not sure who to give it to yet</li>
            <li> Once I got it and put it on my nails, I realized how thin it is.</li>
            <li> The downfall is how thin the polish is.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be bubbling a little but that might just be because I didn&#x27;t use a base coat because it was just suppose to be a swatch.</li>

            <li> The color is over-the-top cute! You do need a top coat as with many colors this bright. Lots ofmcompliments. Makes me feel happy and summery!</li>
            <li> This is the best blue nail polish that I have found to date.  It is a perfect summer color and because I prefer bright &amp; different colors on my toes, not my fingers, it is a great flip-flop color.  I had no problem with it being too sheer, the first coat was but after the second coat, it was just right.  It is a matte polish but I have no problem with that as I wouldn&#x27;t wear any nail polish without a top coat.  Has a nice slight shimmer too!</li>
            <li> This has a sort of mermaid shimmer to it, and the image on the computer was a little bit brighter/more aqua than the actual color. However it is still a really pretty color</li>
            <li> I bought this polish a few months ago here on Amazon. The color looked amazing and I was very excited to receive it. Once I got it and put it on my nails, I realized how thin it is. It takes a good three to four coats to match the color that it looks to be in the bottle. It also requires a topcoat as it tries to look very matte, even though it&#x27;s not labeled as a matte polish. I&#x27;ll still use it from time to time, but probably not nearly as often as I would have. I&#x27;m definitely going to test out ChinaGlaze in the store first if I plan on buying any more online...</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty. It&#x27;s a very pearlized color but still beautiful and only needs two coats to look GREAT!</li>
            <li> In love with this color, but but but you HAVE to put at least 3 coats on this bad boy! The reason why because if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;ll look like the color is fading away! But it&#x27;s cute when you put 3 coats on it!</li>
            <li> great color! bright blue and it&#x27;s perfect for summer. the collection is discontinued so get it as soon as you can!</li>
            <li> I purchased this polish in hopes for a pretty blue that wasn&#x27;t necessarily pastel or too bright-I wanted the color that the photo of the bottle showed. Now I know that they never show up exactly as they appear in the bottle, but this was way darker than I want, at all. It is a very dark blue because it requires at least two coats and by then it&#x27;s just a very dark version of it. It also isn&#x27;t matte, which I was expecting it to be.  The staying power, as with any china glaze, was not a problem at all.</li>
            <li> Just as the product describes. Lovely shade too I am including it as a side stocking stuffer for xmas. Im not sure who to give it to yet</li>
            <li> At first i was excited about this color but after i received it i realized it was more a metallic color and personally i dont do metallic nail polish. You do need about 2 full coats on it to really get a color. But that is most china glaze products.</li>
            <li> Oh the color is gorgeous, and the picture of it from the website is so true to life. The Nail polish was in mint condition and the prompt shipping ,made it a joy to own.So if you love China Glaze nail polish, order from this company. They have a nice way of doing business!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t require a lot of coats, two if you must. Very bright. I am very pleased with this product overall.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great color and covers in just 2 coats. One of my favorites so far. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a pretty color. The downfall is how thin the polish is. I found myself having to use about 4-5 coats to get the color I really wanted and its a little watery. The price is cheap so there is no worries which is why I gave this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I received seemed to be very watered down.  The color is great though it just took several coats to make it look decent.</li>
            <li> I only bought this one for the name. It has a personal meaning between my daughter &amp; I. China Glaze is great!</li>
            <li> Shelf Life is very limited -- Keep the cap tight and you will still have it dried and sticky in 6 months -</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for this polish and finally found it by itself and not in a kit with others. This polish is super cute to wear in the summer.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful!  Great for anytime of year!</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know it was going to be matte, so that would&#x27;ve been nice to know. it&#x27;s a good color though and all you need to do to make it shiny is put a top coat over it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this colour along with the neon green kiwi koolada. Really love the bright colours that pop. This one dries kind of dark but it you put a single lair of white down first it keeps it bright. It also has a matte finish but like other reviewers said, that can easily be fixed with a shiny topcoat. Really like this colour and that it dries fast.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL COLOR. GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON IT. BRIGHT STANDS OUT. GOES ON NICE. I WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN RIGHT BEFORE SUMMER. ITS COOL TO GET OTHER BRIGHT COLORS AND DO EACH NAIL A DIFFERENT COLOR TRUE TO COLOR IN PICTURE.</li>
            <li> This is a great bright blue neon color, BUT it is soo sheer! Without a white base, it&#x27;s build able, but would take about 4 coats and that&#x27;s a lot to me right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over white it would probably take 2-3 depending on thick/thin coats or how much visible nail line you have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty color.. but I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase just for the formula.</li>
            <li> Color is off from the picture but understandable but this is more of a glittery color and was looking more for a solid color</li>
            <li> DAUGHTER LOVES THE COLOR.</li>
            <li> Words can barely describe how in love I am with this blue polish.  I am a lover of all things blue and I&#x27;ve never come across another nail shade as pretty as this one.  And I am tickled to death by the name: *Towel Boy Toy*... LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;Very vibrant tropic blue. There is a very subtle shimmer in the color which only adds to its brilliant allure without dominating the finish like your typical &amp;#34;frosty&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;metallic/pearled&amp;#34; looking polishes.  It&#x27;s like having the benefits of a rich matte color with a touch of shimmer for some subtle glam and dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The APPLICATION logistics:&lt;br /&gt;Two coats is all that&#x27;s needed to build a beautiful opaque color. No white undercoat needed in my experience. A clear top coat is needed to give it a high gloss exterior. I take it with me whenever I get a professional pedicure and the technicians have no problem working with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shade to anyone looking for a hot summertime blue for their mani/ pedi . This blue will be my favorite nail color for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This polish is so girly and pretty. I bought it for my niece that loves pinks and light blues. so we polished her nails pink and blue. She was so proud of her nails and she thinks her Aunt is the bomb dot com!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR!!!!!  IT IS TRULY AWESOME!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice amount of sparkle to it, without being overtly glittery, and a great shade, between turquoise and royal but very saturated and bright. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Very Beautiful color... but it takes too many coats to make it pretty. Goood shipping time though ;-)... wish it just didn&#x27;t take so many layers of nail polish.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!! If you&#x27;ve never tried china glaze, you need a top coat, but regardless you should always use a base and top coat! I used two-three coats, it was percent, and dries quick!! IN LOVE with the color perfect in time for Easter/spring!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. Really nice light sky blue color with a bit of shine to it.</li>
            <li> Cute. but it&#x27;s more like a glittery little transparent blue. Not the matte or neoen blue u see pictured. So not that the seller intended to mislead just that the color off the pic is different from the color you get.  I did like it tho&#x27; I love China Glaze nail polish. But not the color I expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and BEST COLOR EVER! I would totally recommend to every nail polish lover like me! Awesome and Pretty Color</li>
            <li> I love the color,it&#x27;s perfect for the summer &amp; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s that perfect summer blue shade.</li>
            <li> This color took me 4 coats to get the color that it shows. It was really thin and chipped off easily and I didn&#x27;t like it. It works well for water marbling because of the runny consistency</li>
            <li> I love china glaze, their polishes are amazing, this is a beautiful color, kind of irredecent, recommend using 2 coats. chip resistant and provides good coverage. the shipping was quick and i&#x27;m in love with this blue! recommend it to everyone who loves to use nail polish!</li>
            <li> The polish has shimmer in it which I hate but the color is so pretty and vibrant; the shimmer almost doesn&#x27;t matter. A lot of the reviews were talking about it taking a lot of coats to become opaque but for me it only took 2 coats with minimum effort. You could also use a white polish underneath to make it &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; which I also tried and it made the application a bit more difficult and the polish a lot more streaky. It took more coats with the white polish to get the same color as the actual polish by it self. It does seem to be bubbling a little but that might just be because I didn&#x27;t use a base coat because it was just suppose to be a swatch. I&#x27;m not too worried about it chipping because china glaze usually lasts a week with base and top coat and I paint my nails every 2-3 days anyway. Shipping was very good. I ordered it on Monday and it came Thursday morning. Overall I would give this a 9 out of 10 because even though this is probably my new favorite summer polish, shimmer isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m big on.</li>
            <li> I like it China Glaze does make very good nail polish I&#x27;ve used them before. I like different shades of blue and bluish green.</li>
            <li> I love this color, but it is VERY sheer. I thought it was going to be more solid but it&#x27;s light and iridescent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Although I kind of don&#x27;t like how many coats it takes to be dark enough for me. But it&#x27;s a really pretty blue. spring-ey!</li>
