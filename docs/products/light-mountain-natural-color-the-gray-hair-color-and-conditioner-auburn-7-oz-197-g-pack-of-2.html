            <li>But... it&#x27;s time to do it again and since the weather is not as warm, I have no problems doing this in the bathroom.  </li>

            <li>AND, it is completely safe, animal cruelty-free, 100% organic, etc.  </li>
            <li>If you have a shower seat or some sort of chair you can sit on in there, even better.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product-I am allergic to most cosmetics and hair dyes, so this was my only alternative.</li>
            <li>Actually, many close friends didn&#x27;t even notice that I had colored it until I called their attention to</li>
            <li>so there was a learning curve :).  </li>
            <li>Love the results.</li>
            <li>Rinsing out ALL the product was time consuming, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I am glad I do not have to deal with the chemical stuff anymore .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how great it looks.</li>
            <li>but she said it really looks GOOD.</li>
            <li>Everything wiped up easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow and use.</li>
            <li>Whether you are allergic to regular colors or not, you should try this product, because it will make your hair not only a gorgeous color, but will giveit a wonderful shine and feel!  </li>
            <li>The gray hairs color beautifully with different tones.  </li>
            <li>The ones they provide are fine, but sort of flimsy, and mine ripped.  </li>
            <li>Try it and enjoy.</li>
            <li>(yes, quite messy, but all towels wash out beautifully with no stains!)</li>
            <li>Over 10-years ago, I bought the light mountain hair-dye but was intimated after I read the instructions.  </li>
            <li>I use Light Mountain once a month</li>
            <li>After 2 months of using Light Mountain</li>
            <li>it was a little darker than I wanted but then got to the color I love!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an interesting process and very much like mud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten good at the application and barely any product falls in the sink or on my clothes during the process.  </li>
            <li>Use a good conditioner and let it stay in your hair for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally medium brown with some copper highlights but I have been getting more and more gray and especially a very large gray stripe of hair where you would wear a head band.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy, but time consuming, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful, deep brown tone with some dark reddish highlights, but mostly browns.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they developed a henna product that works on all gray hair!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a deal to apply but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Second, buy your own gloves.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing my own gloves for future use.    </li>
            <li>Really wanted to make my natural auburn look nice again and</li>
            <li>I and used to love how henna made my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, this smelled like spinach or wet grass, easy to deal with and a ton better</li>
            <li>The color is every bit as pretty as with the toxic stuff which I used years ago until I read up  on it.  </li>
            <li>This got me on the road to finding natural alternatives - and ultimately to Light Mountain hair colors.  </li>
            <li>Having a stylist do it for you is definitely the easiest way to go if you are able to do so.    </li>
            <li>First, do it in the tub with a shower mirror.  </li>
            <li>exactly (I did let the henna &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; as well).</li>
            <li>but this was my first time with henna</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did, I will never go back to the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me about Light Mt. Natural Color and that it can color the gray and I decided to try the Auburn Henna.</li>
            <li>Avoid washing the hair with shampoo for the first 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>Finally the hair feels healthy and not fried.</li>
            <li>My natural color is a faded auburn, and the Light Mountain color looked very natural but made my hair more lively and intensely colored.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that since it works with the color already in your hair, there are highlights and various shades going on (NOT streaking by any means - but beautiful and completely natural looking tone varieties).  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stress too much about getting the henna on your skin, just use a facial scrub AFTERWARDS and that will remove most traces of henna.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the regular chemical box stuff seemed to make more of a stained mess.</li>
            <li>Very pretty results - looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I mix up the henna in large Pyrex mixing bowls.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.      </li>
            <li>It really does work, and your hair - as well as your health - will thank you for it.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH easier to rinse out the henna if you work conditioner into your hair.  </li>
            <li>Followed the instructions and really like the results.  </li>
            <li>Rinsing the product out of your hair is a pain in the butt, using conditioner really helps out.  </li>
            <li>I really like the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Light Mountain Henna products for several years.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The color takes very well.</li>
            <li>The whole process is lengthy so allot yourself plenty of time.  </li>
            <li>It could be that I did not use as much heat.</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews sooo, ok heres the real deal.</li>
            <li>I also still had some of my old, chemical color left on the bottom half of my hair - this is blended in perfectly now with the tones in the upper parts</li>
            <li>which you then have to clean up with bleach later.  </li>
            <li>It is a messy experience and takes an hour or more, but the results are natural looking and well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I used saran wrap along with the plastic bag that comes with the package and it keep most of it from running down my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Next time I plan to cure the red for 3 hours - to get more of a copper color.</li>
            <li>My gray (I don&#x27;t have much) was covered completely!</li>
            <li>Looking for a more natural way of covering the grey hair, I decided to give henna a second try.</li>
            <li>The extra step is so worth it, my gray is completely covered</li>
            <li>After applying the first step I got scared because my hair looked orange, but it&#x27;s the second step that tones it to  </li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, cut the time required in half and don&#x27;t use heat.</li>
            <li>The first day my hair felt very gritty</li>
            <li>However this second time that I have used the product, my hair was not as soft as the first batch.  </li>
            <li>I recently developed an allergy to hair coloring products -</li>
            <li>I have old hair as I call it.</li>
            <li>Looks natural to me without looking like</li>
            <li>my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>The application is definitely MESSY but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li>She was surprised I did it because I always talk about never coloring my hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>It is natural and cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>I mean, it is really the only healthy way to color your hair.    </li>
            <li>The only down side is, my bathroom is wrecked each time I use Light Mountain.</li>
            <li>But after running various &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair colors like NatureTint, etc., through the SKin Deep database,  I turned to Light Mountain, which had absolutely no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I put nutmeg in the 2nd step to help with the smell and use Trader Joes Conditioner with the 2nd step, which really helps to get it out of your hair.</li>
            <li>and I get compliments daily on the color and how natural it looks!</li>
            <li>It is now back to the natural brown tones I used to have.  </li>
            <li>When I was using chemical hair dye I had patches of red, itchy skin on my scalp and neck, this has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit messy and time consuming but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the effort and mess!</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally brown with about 40% white coming in (not grey, my genes take me directly to white).  </li>

            <li> My gray (I don&#x27;t have much) was covered completely!</li>
            <li> Looking for a more natural way of covering the grey hair, I decided to give henna a second try.</li>
            <li> The extra step is so worth it, my gray is completely covered</li>
            <li> After applying the first step I got scared because my hair looked orange, but it&#x27;s the second step that tones it to  </li>
            <li> If your hair is fine, cut the time required in half and don&#x27;t use heat.</li>
            <li> The first day my hair felt very gritty</li>
            <li> However this second time that I have used the product, my hair was not as soft as the first batch.  </li>
            <li> I recently developed an allergy to hair coloring products -</li>
            <li> I have old hair as I call it.</li>
            <li> Looks natural to me without looking like</li>
            <li> my hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The application is definitely MESSY but the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> It looks 100% natural.</li>
            <li> She was surprised I did it because I always talk about never coloring my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> It is natural and cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> I mean, it is really the only healthy way to color your hair.    </li>
            <li> The only down side is, my bathroom is wrecked each time I use Light Mountain.</li>
            <li> But after running various &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair colors like NatureTint, etc., through the SKin Deep database,  I turned to Light Mountain, which had absolutely no harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I put nutmeg in the 2nd step to help with the smell and use Trader Joes Conditioner with the 2nd step, which really helps to get it out of your hair.</li>
            <li> and I get compliments daily on the color and how natural it looks!</li>
            <li> It is now back to the natural brown tones I used to have.  </li>
            <li> When I was using chemical hair dye I had patches of red, itchy skin on my scalp and neck, this has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit messy and time consuming but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the effort and mess!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally brown with about 40% white coming in (not grey, my genes take me directly to white).  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO allergic reactions whatsoever - but more than that, my hair, which had gotten dry and dull from all the coloring over the years, is now soft, silky and shiny - without putting any other sorts of products in it to make it so (like conditioners or sprays)!  </li>
            <li> It sucks all the moisture right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> You may even be able to find a stylist to color it for you with this product, though I would suggest mixing it yourself at home prior to your appointment so you can allow it to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for at least 2 to 3 hours prior to applying it, as the directions suggest (I did this, and consequently did not have to keep it as long on my hair as you otherwise have to do if you don&#x27;t let it sit for a few hours.)  </li>
            <li> It is a messy process (the biggest and main downside).    </li>
            <li> I have long hair and only need to use 1/2 of the product in the box at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to come back and let you know how long it lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you have previously colored hair, as long as you&#x27;ve waited for at least as long as the directions tell you to before you color with this, it will be fine.    </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle after years of regular hair dye abuse.</li>
            <li> I love the color, it covers my gray longer than conventional hair colors or expensive beauty salons do.  </li>
            <li> but as it turned grey I thought I had to give up using henna.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have very short hair, I only used half a package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t need distilled water unless the water in your area is very hard, or has a funny taste.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna give the black a try next.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair only once a week so it should last for a while.</li>
            <li> You also minimize the amount of goop liable to get all over your floor, sink, tiles, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only messy because of the texture.  </li>
            <li> I know this all sounds scary but knowing you are avoiding all those chemicals on your head that will leach inside is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> so my roots never really show.  </li>
            <li> Colors the grey very well, but difficult to get those stubborn sideburn ones.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first -</li>
            <li> Their hennas are top quality, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but so are other hair dye products.  </li>
            <li> The color does not fade into some other color and there is no build-up of color on the ends.  </li>
            <li> A small price to pay for looking 10 years younger and avoiding harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It was indeed MESSY if you weren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> I cut a plastic lawn trash bag in half and cover my bathroom counter with it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cover your clothes with a towel, wear a black shirt and just let the henna fall where it may.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you will need 2 black shirts, because there are 2 rinses.  </li>
            <li> I used all of step one, but less than half of step two and kept it in my hair for about forty-five miutes.</li>
            <li> And dark brown is VERY dark - verging on black, with hints of green.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the plastic cap included in the box, instead wrap your head tightly in plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit messy and smelly but avoiding chemicals...</li>
            <li> I was a teenager (that was a few decades ago).</li>
            <li> It was messy, just like I remembered and doing it, and doing it twice was twice the hassle but</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s messy (VERY MESSY)</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, this product works, but is very messy.  </li>
            <li> Yup, it is very messy</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with henna and tap water in San Diego, but I should have known better because the tap water tasted really bad - verging on undrinkable.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use shampoo for at least 24 hours and you&#x27;re set.  </li>
            <li> They are serious about no metal - heat the water to boiling in a glass measuring cup in the microwave - don&#x27;t use an electric teakettle with a metal heating element.  </li>
            <li> rinses out prematurely - not recommended - not full coverage - itches scalp!!!</li>
            <li> process is difficult and messy to apply to hair.</li>
            <li> You need to do your roots every four to six weeks at least anyway with chemical colors!  </li>
            <li> Just rinse out the worst of it, then add a palmful of conditioner and that will make it much easier to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate my gray, I actually like it, but I wanted a change</li>
            <li> unfortunately it also did not cover gray hair as was advertised</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they developed a henna product that works on all gray hair!  It&#x27;s a bit of a deal to apply but it&#x27;s worth it.  The color is every bit as pretty as with the toxic stuff which I used years ago until I read up  on it.  Then I used henna until my hair was all gray, but this henna works beautifully on gray hair.  It also improves the condition and manageability.  I cut a plastic lawn trash bag in half and cover my bathroom counter with it.  I use disposable plastic bowls and afterwards I wrap everything up in the lawn bag and throw it out.  My hairdresser said she could tell this is a good product.  After applying the first step I got scared because my hair looked orange, but it&#x27;s the second step that tones it to  the color you desire.  Try it and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I recently developed an allergy to hair coloring products - I discovered a chemical in ALL (even EcoColors) called DDP which is actually dangerous to your health and for those who develop an allergy to it (as I did), can even be life-threatening.  Mine sent me to the emergency with a swollen head, face and neck.  This got me on the road to finding natural alternatives - and ultimately to Light Mountain hair colors.  I was skeptical at first - I saw Henna on others that was, well, orange and streaky.  I was worried this might be the case.  Not So!      In fact, the color in this came out BEAUTIFUL.  It is a wonderful, deep brown tone with some dark reddish highlights, but mostly browns.  And my hair and scalp feel WONDERFUL.  There is absolutely NO allergic reactions whatsoever - but more than that, my hair, which had gotten dry and dull from all the coloring over the years, is now soft, silky and shiny - without putting any other sorts of products in it to make it so (like conditioners or sprays)!  This has truly made my hair gorgeous, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!  My hair is naturally brown with about 40% white coming in (not grey, my genes take me directly to white).  It is now back to the natural brown tones I used to have.  I especially like the fact that since it works with the color already in your hair, there are highlights and various shades going on (NOT streaking by any means - but beautiful and completely natural looking tone varieties).  I also still had some of my old, chemical color left on the bottom half of my hair - this is blended in perfectly now with the tones in the upper parts, you can&#x27;t see a line or a difference at all.  So if you have previously colored hair, as long as you&#x27;ve waited for at least as long as the directions tell you to before you color with this, it will be fine.    Whether you are allergic to regular colors or not, you should try this product, because it will make your hair not only a gorgeous color, but will giveit a wonderful shine and feel!  AND, it is completely safe, animal cruelty-free, 100% organic, etc.  I mean, it is really the only healthy way to color your hair.    Now you do need to color it fully about every four weeks - but so what?  You need to do your roots every four to six weeks at least anyway with chemical colors!  You may even be able to find a stylist to color it for you with this product, though I would suggest mixing it yourself at home prior to your appointment so you can allow it to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for at least 2 to 3 hours prior to applying it, as the directions suggest (I did this, and consequently did not have to keep it as long on my hair as you otherwise have to do if you don&#x27;t let it sit for a few hours.)  The colors also come out deeper this way.  Having a stylist do it for you is definitely the easiest way to go if you are able to do so.    If you do choose to do it yourself at home, as I&#x27;ve done, a few suggestions (others have made some of these, I reiterate because they really will make life easier for you):    First, do it in the tub with a shower mirror.  If you have a shower seat or some sort of chair you can sit on in there, even better.  This way you minimize the amount of goop which may get on you (you can rinse it off immediately in there) and therefore the possibility of accidentally coloring your skin.  You also minimize the amount of goop liable to get all over your floor, sink, tiles, etc. which you then have to clean up with bleach later.  trust me on this.  It is a messy process (the biggest and main downside).    Second, buy your own gloves.  The ones they provide are fine, but sort of flimsy, and mine ripped.  I now have an orange thumb.  I will be purchasing my own gloves for future use.    Third, use Vaseline around your hairline and on your ears (and maybe on your hands!) to keep the color from staining your face, ears or neck.  It really does work.      So overall, my advice is: USE THIS PRODUCT.  It really does work, and your hair - as well as your health - will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, this product works, but is very messy.  I mix up the henna in large Pyrex mixing bowls.  They are serious about no metal - heat the water to boiling in a glass measuring cup in the microwave - don&#x27;t use an electric teakettle with a metal heating element.  And you don&#x27;t need distilled water unless the water in your area is very hard, or has a funny taste.  I had a bad experience with henna and tap water in San Diego, but I should have known better because the tap water tasted really bad - verging on undrinkable.  Don&#x27;t use the plastic cap included in the box, instead wrap your head tightly in plastic wrap.  Then you can just go about your business without worrying about drips.  Don&#x27;t cover your clothes with a towel, wear a black shirt and just let the henna fall where it may.  I&#x27;ve gotten good at the application and barely any product falls in the sink or on my clothes during the process.  Don&#x27;t take the shirt off until you&#x27;re in the shower, rinsing.  Yes, you will need 2 black shirts, because there are 2 rinses.  It is MUCH easier to rinse out the henna if you work conditioner into your hair.  Just rinse out the worst of it, then add a palmful of conditioner and that will make it much easier to rinse.  Don&#x27;t stress too much about getting the henna on your skin, just use a facial scrub AFTERWARDS and that will remove most traces of henna.  Don&#x27;t use shampoo for at least 24 hours and you&#x27;re set.  And dark brown is VERY dark - verging on black, with hints of green.  Not the best color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product-I am allergic to most cosmetics and hair dyes, so this was my only alternative. If your hair is fine, cut the time required in half and don&#x27;t use heat. My color lasts for 3 months. Worth the effort and mess! (yes, quite messy, but all towels wash out beautifully with no stains!)</li>
            <li> process is difficult and messy to apply to hair. unfortunately it also did not cover gray hair as was advertised</li>
            <li> I am allergic to hair dye (makes my hair fall out), so I use this instead.  It is a messy experience and takes an hour or more, but the results are natural looking and well worth the effort.  I have long hair and only need to use 1/2 of the product in the box at a time.</li>
            <li> I had never used henna before. But after running various &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair colors like NatureTint, etc., through the SKin Deep database,  I turned to Light Mountain, which had absolutely no harmful ingredients. I did the strand test and the patch test and followed the instructions exactly (I did let the henna &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; as well). My gray (I don&#x27;t have much) was covered completely! My natural color is a faded auburn, and the Light Mountain color looked very natural but made my hair more lively and intensely colored. Actually, many close friends didn&#x27;t even notice that I had colored it until I called their attention to it.&lt;br /&gt;Since I have very short hair, I only used half a package.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt those who rated this product unfavorably actually did a strand test, which is really essential.</li>
            <li> I really liked the auburn henna. My gray is a beautiful coppery color.  I&#x27;m gonna give the black a try next.  I allowed the henna to cure for 3 hours for steps 1 and 2. I left step 1 in for about 30 min. and step 2 about 45 min. I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s messy (VERY MESSY) but this was my first time with henna so there was a learning curve :).  Followed the instructions and really like the results.  My hair does pull red so I used no heat with step 2 and the color took with no problem.  Rinsing the product out of your hair is a pain in the butt, using conditioner really helps out.  Give yourself plenty of time  - this takes a lot longer than chemical treatments.  Very pretty results - looks very natural.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful discovery, I wish I would have tried sooner.  Over 10-years ago, I bought the light mountain hair-dye but was intimated after I read the instructions.  Years go by and after years of chemical abuse to my hair I decided to just go for it!  I&#x27;m so glad I did, I will never go back to the chemicals.  It&#x27;s an interesting process and very much like mud.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell and actually liked it.  I applied it outside, with the help of my husband.  But... it&#x27;s time to do it again and since the weather is not as warm, I have no problems doing this in the bathroom.  It&#x27;s only messy because of the texture.  Honestly, the regular chemical box stuff seemed to make more of a stained mess.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER dyed my hair, so it took from June until today to actual try this product. I had read other reviews sooo, ok heres the real deal. It was indeed MESSY if you weren&#x27;t careful. Everything wiped up easy. To me, this smelled like spinach or wet grass, easy to deal with and a ton better then the smelly hair salons I have passed. Easy to follow and use. I have old hair as I call it. Not alot of gray. Really wanted to make my natural auburn look nice again and indeed it DID. Will be using this product again. Love the results. Looks natural to me without looking like I dyed my hair and basically well conditioned with shine. I used all of step one, but less than half of step two and kept it in my hair for about forty-five miutes. Rinsing out ALL the product was time consuming, but not horrible. I really like the results. I froze the rest of my product to use next time. I believe this product is excellent and great for people who have allergies like I do. No problems.</li>
            <li> The extra step is so worth it, my gray is completely covered and I get compliments daily on the color and how natural it looks!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a bit messy and smelly but avoiding chemicals...well worth it!!!!  I would suggest lathering your hairline with Vaseline and also your tub or sink if it&#x27;s white porceline bc it will stain your tub.  The first day my hair felt very gritty so next time I knew to keep rinsing and rinsing my hair and I even used a conditioner on it.  Give it time after about 2 days the color I wanted came out.  Day 1 and 2 it was a little darker than I wanted but then got to the color I love!!!  I know this all sounds scary but knowing you are avoiding all those chemicals on your head that will leach inside is so worth it.  Use a good conditioner and let it stay in your hair for several minutes.  It is just really gritty but that&#x27;s OK it&#x27;s all natural and so much better for you and YOU&amp;#34;RE WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for anyone with sensitivity to chemical hair color. Even though my hair is 75% gray the coverage was perfect. I use Light Mountain once a month so my roots never really show.  My hair was dry and brittle after years of regular hair dye abuse. After 2 months of using Light Mountain my hair was shiny and soft. When I was using chemical hair dye I had patches of red, itchy skin on my scalp and neck, this has completely cleared up.  The only down side is, my bathroom is wrecked each time I use Light Mountain. Best to apply just before cleaning day. A small price to pay for looking 10 years younger and avoiding harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I now by this product in a 3 pack, even though I only need 1/4 cup per step, on my shoulder length hair to do my roots, every 3 weeks. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for awhile now and it works great every time. I put nutmeg in the 2nd step to help with the smell and use Trader Joes Conditioner with the 2nd step, which really helps to get it out of your hair. Once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy, but time consuming, so plan accordingly.</li>
            <li> Last time I used henna I was a teenager (that was a few decades ago). Since then I have been using the chemical stuff you get at health food stores. Looking for a more natural way of covering the grey hair, I decided to give henna a second try. I am surprised how great it looks. The application is definitely MESSY but the results are fantastic. I am glad I do not have to deal with the chemical stuff anymore .</li>
            <li> I used to henna my hair 20 years ago but as it turned grey I thought I had to give up using henna. A friend told me about Light Mt. Natural Color and that it can color the gray and I decided to try the Auburn Henna. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t do either the sensitivity or the strip tests. I somehow trusted the universe on this one. My hair is naturally medium brown with some copper highlights but I have been getting more and more gray and especially a very large gray stripe of hair where you would wear a head band. I don&#x27;t hate my gray, I actually like it, but I wanted a change I and used to love how henna made my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cured both the red henna and indigo for an hour then I applied the red for 15 minutes. Then I rinsed and applied the indigo for about 45 minutes. I rinsed and used conditioner to get the tangles out since you can&#x27;t shampoo. It was messy, just like I remembered and doing it, and doing it twice was twice the hassle but the results... Ooh la la! It looks 100% natural. I did miss my temples so BE SURE TO GET THE HENNA ON YOUR TEMPLES! I still have some gray on the temples and my forehead. Even with that mistake, it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of compliments, even from my friend who is also gray and knows that I am proud of my gray. She was surprised I did it because I always talk about never coloring my hair but she said it really looks GOOD. I didn&#x27;t realize I was buying 2 at one time but I&#x27;m glad I did. Next time I plan to cure the red for 3 hours - to get more of a copper color. I usually wash my hair only once a week so it should last for a while. I&#x27;ll have to come back and let you know how long it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Light Mountain Henna products for several years. Their hennas are top quality, and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. Now that my hair is getting grayer, I decided to try Color the Gray!. This two step package for gray hair works great. It successfully covers gray hair and lasts about a month before I need to color again.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy and time consuming but well worth it.  I love the color, it covers my gray longer than conventional hair colors or expensive beauty salons do.  It makes my hair soft and does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I add a tablespoon of olive oil and an egg to both powders and let them sit overnight. If not,&lt;br /&gt; It sucks all the moisture right out of my hair. The color takes very well.</li>
            <li> rinses out prematurely - not recommended - not full coverage - itches scalp!!!</li>
            <li> This hair coloring system is the best product for the hair, no damage.  Yup, it is very messy but so are other hair dye products.  The color does not fade into some other color and there is no build-up of color on the ends.  Avoid washing the hair with shampoo for the first 24 hours.  The gray hairs color beautifully with different tones.  The dye does not stain the skin or towels.  I have not had any skin irritation either.  The whole process is lengthy so allot yourself plenty of time.  Finally the hair feels healthy and not fried.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now and love it!  It is natural and cruelty-free.  The auburn comes out nice on my brown hair.  However this second time that I have used the product, my hair was not as soft as the first batch.  It could be that I did not use as much heat. I used saran wrap along with the plastic bag that comes with the package and it keep most of it from running down my face and neck.  I would also suggest using latex gloves rather than the gloves that come with the kit.  I added paprika and olive oil to stage 2 mixture and allowed both mixtures to sit 2-3 hours before applying.  Colors the grey very well, but difficult to get those stubborn sideburn ones.  Thanks for a great product and will buy again!</li>
