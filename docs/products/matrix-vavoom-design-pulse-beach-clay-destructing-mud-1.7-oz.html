            <li>This smells nice and works fairly well to give my hair a &#x27;piecey&#x27; look.  </li>
            <li>but when my roommate let me try this i fell in love!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Works great on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Uhhh this works for fair skin better than it does for darker skin.</li>
            <li>Works great, awesome control and leaves the dry hair look that you want.</li>
            <li>Great clay that dries clear (mud colored) holds great day-long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t turn your head into a helmet.</li>
            <li>So far this has been the best clay that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>Does an okay job.</li>
            <li>Edge control does a better job for cheaper</li>
            <li>The product that was sold to me was not a valid authentic Matrix Design Pulse product.</li>
            <li>I love that this product doesn&#x27;t require melting with a blowdryer--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I switched because I will never use d:</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight with a sting hold!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product that I ever used was</li>
            <li>so excited that i can buy this product online!</li>
            <li>since my Rough Clay was discontinued, I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect replacement product, something comparable to take its place.</li>
            <li>The hold is also great, I found it holds better then American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>(Easy to apply and work into hair)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Washes out easily, holds all day.</li>
            <li>Strong hold without sticky mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping for a high hold, matte clay that is good for the \\&quot;bed-head\\</li>
            <li>The best way to use this product (for men) would be to blow dry a quick style and then use this product afterwards for a strong hold, textured, matte finish.</li>
            <li>This allows for your hairstyle to last all day and gives it a great look/</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy</li>
            <li>It works great in short hair to create mega texture and punky styles.</li>
            <li>But if I don&#x27;t find something more exact, then this will be my go-to product</li>
            <li>I have special needs hair.  </li>
            <li>I never had the right product until now!</li>
            <li>Package came in a timely manner, and when I unscrewed the cap, I did not shriek in terror of serpents, but dipped my fingers into that soft balm, to create a nice hairdo with my/their/our muss.</li>
            <li>As a male with short hair, I was very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>This makes it very manageable and easy to apply and create any style I want.</li>
            <li>Although, I would not recommend this product, since there are so many others that do the same thing with MUCH higher hold( see Bed Head for Men Matte Seperation Wax OR Mitch Reformer) and smell so much better.</li>
            <li>i have really curly/kinky hair and ever since i went natural, i could never have my edges look nice</li>
            <li>No flakes, residue or buildup of any kind after daily use.</li>
            <li>Your hair stays matte, with great \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; texture, but the hold just wasn&#x27;t there for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, decent product minus the smell.</li>
            <li>I have only used American Crew - Fiber for the last 10 years, but do to the &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; or the weight its only good when my hair is a perfect length range.</li>
            <li>I started using this brand&#x27;s other product, a paste, which is also pretty good...</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and for people with fine hair and a busy schedule this is a treasure.</li>
            <li>when I first opened it up.</li>
            <li>I thought that was pretty unprofessional</li>
            <li>I own a variety of products and I must say that this is probably one of my favourite products and is comparable to Redken Rough Clay 20.</li>
            <li>I had left the cap off of it the first day to find out if it was authentic or not.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s actually just normal clay, like the kind found in kitty litter, with no pH content.</li>
            <li>back with lots of length and texture on top that I style into a Nick Wooster-esque quiff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trick at first is not using too much.  </li>
            <li>However, it does have strong hold and will last all day!</li>
            <li>When you open it up you smell a strong, pungent odor, it&#x27;s very creamy(not</li>
            <li>You can use it for building body, giving the pieces look and adding texture to straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This also helps hold a curl from a heated iron well, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to go from straight to curly.  </li>
            <li>It has a very creamy texture in your hands but hardens once you put it in your hair.</li>
            <li>Anyway, don&#x27;t put too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ve found a product that resembles Redken Rough Clay 20 more than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>this is one of the few products that i actually love using in my hair, it makes it look exactly how i want it to</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It provides more natural lift and volume than any other product I have used.  </li>
            <li>For about a year, the Rough Clay and a light spritz of hairspray were all the product I needed.</li>
            <li>The product feels very soft and creamy when I spread it through my hands, and it hardens as I apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>Matrix also puts an ingredient in to this product that if left open over night you will see red dots form on top of the product from a process called oxidization.</li>
            <li>And on top of that it works the same as any other hair wax or paste out there.</li>
            <li>but this product seems to have more of a dull sheen to it in comparison, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I find it easier to just spray hairspray onto my fingers and piecing out my hair that way instead, so i dont really use this product regularly.</li>
            <li>It can really gunk up hair if overused start off with tiny amount and add as needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for ripping me and countless others off....</li>
            <li>, they were always wild.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad replacement at all and, in my estimation, is about 75% similar to Rough Clay, perhaps</li>
            <li>fi Extreme Hold Styling Creme prior to this but stopped because d:fi turns super chunky and sticky when it gets old.</li>
            <li>I love the messy top look on myself, but I have difficult hair.</li>
            <li>It thought it would be some major holding</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive than this Beach Clay and other products, but you also get more than twice the amount</li>
            <li>It was bland and not as pungent as the real deal.</li>

            <li> So for when my barber cuts my hair to short or I go too long without a cut</li>
            <li> This product is pretty thick</li>
            <li> i use this to lay my edges flat and it works !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve scoured the internet searching message boards and forums and reading what others who were similarly smitten with Rough Clay 20 have taken to using since it was taken off shelves.</li>
            <li> The Vavoom product arrived promptly and was larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> If you like your hair to look dry after styling then this is for you.</li>
            <li> And then the unthinkable happened: Redken discontinued Rough Clay</li>
            <li> * Soft and creamy in hands, turns hard in hair.</li>
            <li> but I didnt want to go through the trouble of sending it back just because of that.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite have the reworkable hold that the Rough Clay was known for, but it comes admirably close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Redken&#x27;s Rough Clay 20.I bought a jar of that stuff every other time I got my hair cut for around $15, give or take.</li>
            <li> What first led me to believe it was a fake was the smell.</li>
            <li> I tried the other one in there line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair that is cut very short on the sides/</li>
            <li> Trick is to put a little in when you&#x27;re hair is just about dry but also a little... moist?  </li>
            <li> You know who you are, and yes it&#x27;s weird that we can see straight to your scalp through the comb marks made 8 hours ago.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark hair thus does not blend well.</li>
            <li> I have tried pomade in the past and while it worked well, buy the end of the day my heavy thick hair was back to flat.  </li>
            <li> After a craniotomy and radiation treatments, I have at least two bald spots to hide, and one of them in gargantuan.  </li>
            <li> Use a little of this product when your hair is still damp and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently, I&#x27;m still searching for something a little closer.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product a few months ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy and refuse to \\&quot;prime\\&quot; my hair product.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this did not do the job.</li>
            <li> Very small amount required&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This product sucks, your about to pay $15-$20 literally for a teaspoon of product!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find someone had rubbed their finger in it</li>
            <li> Avoid looking like an idiot with crunchy wet-looking hair all day, and replace your gel/hairspray with this product.  </li>

            <li> This smells nice and works fairly well to give my hair a &#x27;piecey&#x27; look.  I was disappointed to find someone had rubbed their finger in it though when I first opened it up. I thought that was pretty unprofessional but I didnt want to go through the trouble of sending it back just because of that.  This product is pretty thick so when I try to apply it, it pulls on my hair which I dont like.  I find it easier to just spray hairspray onto my fingers and piecing out my hair that way instead, so i dont really use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> I have tried pomade in the past and while it worked well, buy the end of the day my heavy thick hair was back to flat.  This stuff is amazing!  You can use it for building body, giving the pieces look and adding texture to straight hair.  This also helps hold a curl from a heated iron well, but I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to go from straight to curly.  For some waves and finger curls it is great.  I can literally reboost the body of my hair by scrunching or rubbing my fingers over scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick at first is not using too much.  It can really gunk up hair if overused start off with tiny amount and add as needed.  I do finish styling with a blasting spray (hairspray)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Uhhh this works for fair skin better than it does for darker skin. I have a darker complexion sort of like Gabby Union so I have to actually brush the product on ( I use it for my edges)  for it to blend. Does an okay job. Edge control does a better job for cheaper</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Just wet your hands a little first and then rub it in your palms and run your hands through your hair. Shape and go! Stays all day.</li>
            <li> As a male with short hair, I was very impressed with this product. I own a variety of products and I must say that this is probably one of my favourite products and is comparable to Redken Rough Clay 20. The product feels very soft and creamy when I spread it through my hands, and it hardens as I apply it to my hair. This makes it very manageable and easy to apply and create any style I want. The hold is also great, I found it holds better then American Crew Fiber. It gives my hair a pieced out look and a matte finish. The best way to use this product (for men) would be to blow dry a quick style and then use this product afterwards for a strong hold, textured, matte finish. This allows for your hairstyle to last all day and gives it a great look/feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;* Strong hold without sticky mess.&lt;br /&gt;* Soft and creamy in hands, turns hard in hair. (Easy to apply and work into hair)&lt;br /&gt;* Lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;* Very small amount required&lt;br /&gt;* Makes hair appear thicker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;* None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must! The only disappointment is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner.</li>
            <li> Avoid looking like an idiot with crunchy wet-looking hair all day, and replace your gel/hairspray with this product.  You know who you are, and yes it&#x27;s weird that we can see straight to your scalp through the comb marks made 8 hours ago.  Use a little of this product when your hair is still damp and your hair will stay where you want it and best of all still look like hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Just enough hold without actually looking like you&#x27;re using product. Washes out easily, holds all day. I started using this brand&#x27;s other product, a paste, which is also pretty good...but this product seems to have more of a dull sheen to it in comparison, which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best hair product on the market.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product a few months ago and I forgot to leave a review on it. The product that was sold to me was not a valid authentic Matrix Design Pulse product. I had left the cap off of it the first day to find out if it was authentic or not. What first led me to believe it was a fake was the smell. It was bland and not as pungent as the real deal. Matrix also puts an ingredient in to this product that if left open over night you will see red dots form on top of the product from a process called oxidization. No dots were found on my product what so ever the following morning after leaving it open overnight. Why you ask? Because it&#x27;s actually just normal clay, like the kind found in kitty litter, with no pH content. I tested it myself. There was no evidence of oxidization because the product was voided of the ingredient. Thanks for ripping me and countless others off....</li>
            <li> this is one of the few products that i actually love using in my hair, it makes it look exactly how i want it to and it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy</li>
            <li> this product is amazing! i have really curly/kinky hair and ever since i went natural, i could never have my edges look nice, they were always wild. but when my roommate let me try this i fell in love! so excited that i can buy this product online! i use this to lay my edges flat and it works !</li>
            <li> Great product , works perfect</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the style as claimed.</li>
            <li> use this product all the time in my hair</li>
            <li> I was looking to find a replacement for redkin 20 paste.  Tried this one and it is very similar on look feel and texture.</li>
            <li> I have special needs hair.  After a craniotomy and radiation treatments, I have at least two bald spots to hide, and one of them in gargantuan.  I started wearing hats all the time because I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to do anything, until I received a sample of the Design Pulse Beach Clay.  My hair loves this stuff!  I have volume, my bald spots are invisible, and I don&#x27;t have to wear hats anymore unless I want to.  I can&#x27;t believe Matrix discontinued this stuff, so I stocked up.  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> Then, you must try this.  My hair is very thin and I could never get it to hold the volume beyond a couple of hours.  A friend recommend this to me and it not only holds it will rehold after a night of sleep.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair lift at the scalp and texturizes the ends.  I tried the other one in there line and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Works great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this product! It works great in short hair to create mega texture and punky styles. It has a very creamy texture in your hands but hardens once you put it in your hair. I love that this product doesn&#x27;t require melting with a blowdryer--I&#x27;m lazy and refuse to \\&quot;prime\\&quot; my hair product. It&#x27;s also very easy to work with and doesn&#x27;t turn your head into a helmet. However, it does have strong hold and will last all day! As an added bonus, there is no greasy feel or buildup in your hair--it even washes out without shampoo! Amazing product. I was using d:fi Extreme Hold Styling Creme prior to this but stopped because d:fi turns super chunky and sticky when it gets old. I&#x27;m so glad I switched because I will never use d:fi again after trying Design Pulse Beach Clay! Love this product!</li>
            <li> This product sucks, your about to pay $15-$20 literally for a teaspoon of product! And on top of that it works the same as any other hair wax or paste out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair that is cut very short on the sides/back with lots of length and texture on top that I style into a Nick Wooster-esque quiff. I purchased this product hoping for a high hold, matte clay that is good for the \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; look. When you open it up you smell a strong, pungent odor, it&#x27;s very creamy(not a clay at all), when you put it in your hair it gets sticky. Your hair stays matte, with great \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; texture, but the hold just wasn&#x27;t there for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, decent product minus the smell. Although, I would not recommend this product, since there are so many others that do the same thing with MUCH higher hold( see Bed Head for Men Matte Seperation Wax OR Mitch Reformer) and smell so much better.</li>
            <li> I used regular gel for the longest time but disliked the slick back wet look and just couldn&#x27;t find anything better.  This product holds it up nicely!  Trick is to put a little in when you&#x27;re hair is just about dry but also a little... moist?  Anyway, don&#x27;t put too much, otherwise you&#x27;ll get a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product. If you like your hair to look dry after styling then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Keeps hair in shape all day.</li>
            <li> So far this has been the best clay that I&#x27;ve purchased. Works great, awesome control and leaves the dry hair look that you want.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair clay...it&#x27;s light weight with a sting hold!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works well on my hair</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair thus does not blend well. It thought it would be some major holding but it didn&#x27;t.  I have thick hair and this did not do the job.</li>
            <li> I love the messy top look on myself, but I have difficult hair. I have only used American Crew - Fiber for the last 10 years, but do to the &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34; or the weight its only good when my hair is a perfect length range. So for when my barber cuts my hair to short or I go too long without a cut I never had the right product until now! My barber had a test size and after 1 use I came on here and bought 2 bottles. Great product!</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s good.  Package came in a timely manner, and when I unscrewed the cap, I did not shriek in terror of serpents, but dipped my fingers into that soft balm, to create a nice hairdo with my/their/our muss.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product that I ever used was Redken&#x27;s Rough Clay 20.I bought a jar of that stuff every other time I got my hair cut for around $15, give or take. For about a year, the Rough Clay and a light spritz of hairspray were all the product I needed. And then the unthinkable happened: Redken discontinued Rough Clay 20!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that how it always goes? You find the perfect product, and then it is discontinued and disappears forever. Had I know it was being discontinued, I would&#x27;ve bought thirty or forty jars of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since my Rough Clay was discontinued, I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect replacement product, something comparable to take its place. I&#x27;ve scoured the internet searching message boards and forums and reading what others who were similarly smitten with Rough Clay 20 have taken to using since it was taken off shelves. Several people suggested this Matrix product, so I decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the closest to the Redken product that I&#x27;ve found, both in its consistency and how it looks/feels in your hair. It doesn&#x27;t quite have the reworkable hold that the Rough Clay was known for, but it comes admirably close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I&#x27;m still searching for something a little closer. But if I don&#x27;t find something more exact, then this will be my go-to product and I will be very pleased. It&#x27;s not a bad replacement at all and, in my estimation, is about 75% similar to Rough Clay, perhaps more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update: June 22, 2015**&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve found a product that resembles Redken Rough Clay 20 more than anything else I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s called [[ASIN:B00999CJES Star Wax | Premium Pomade, Clay, by Star Pro Line - 5 fl oz / 150 mL]] made by Star Pro Line. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than this Beach Clay and other products, but you also get more than twice the amount so there&#x27;s definitely value. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great clay that dries clear (mud colored) holds great day-long. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year. No flakes, residue or buildup of any kind after daily use.</li>
            <li> The Vavoom product arrived promptly and was larger than I expected.  It provides more natural lift and volume than any other product I have used.  It lasts all day, and for people with fine hair and a busy schedule this is a treasure.</li>
