    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Some of the best incense I have bought.</li>
            <li>Great for meditation.</li>
            <li>All the ones ive tried are great.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and they never disappoint.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>The smell has lingered for about two hours  (and counting) and it is so pleasant.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good burn time.</li>
            <li>Colored sand in a cute glass container can work great for this.</li>
            <li>Great scent woodsy with some zest, really enjoy this line.</li>
            <li>Really nice and lots safer than most incense.</li>
            <li>I love the incense.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent just a lil sweetness to it.</li>
            <li>But, also having more, hm, elegant smells.</li>
            <li>My all-time favorite incense.  </li>
            <li>Enjoyed but a bit overpriced for the amount of incense you receive.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite incense because its notes are light, woody and not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>it is important to take greater care in handling them as they break quite easily.</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasant blend of patchouli and other earthy scents, subtler than most patchouli products and agreeably long-burning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent started off sweet and woody, then there was a lovely note of something like eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and even though I&#x27;ve ordered the same brand and scent, but the longer ones give off a more pleasant and sweeter scent.</li>
            <li>Moss Garden has been a particular favorite of mine for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, slightly sweet, calm and soothing in nature and has really lovely shifting layers of scent to discover.</li>
            <li>Like their Autumn Leaves, it is a richly evocative scent.</li>
            <li>Very easy to break, short burn life, and scent is ok.</li>
            <li>At the very end of the burn time, I got a strong woodsmoke note.  </li>
            <li>and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>They give me a feeling of ancient, exotic (fill in the blank)....</li>
            <li>This is my next favorite incense, next to Eternal Treasure:)</li>
            <li>Has been a favorite of mine for a long time...</li>
            <li>Took me awhile to smell the scent of this incense at first because this is the first time I have ever burned incense; however, I walked back into my room after being gone for about 10 minutes and my room smelled like a sweet forest.</li>
            <li>I found this nice and light enough to use often, low smoke and not as sweet as some other Shoyeido Incense I have tried.</li>
            <li>What I also like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t get very smokey.</li>
            <li>Fairly reasonable price the amount of incense.</li>
            <li>However,  the price point for the 35 stick package makes this a great way to try it yourself before jumping in with the larger, more expensive bundles.  </li>
            <li>But Shoyeido&#x27;s consistent quality and experimentation fun is enough to give MOSS GARDEN four stars.</li>
            <li>(this is going to sound silly, but honestly envokes a \\&quot;play-doh\\&quot; like smell).  </li>
            <li>This lasted about an hour, far more than I expected from reviews.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I have been experimenting with scent combinations, using MOSS GARDEN as a surprisingly flexible base, one of which Morning Star&#x27; s JASMINE has been a nice adjunct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and delicate but not weak.</li>
            <li>Very palatable smell, unlike the usual over-powering cloying odor of most incense.</li>
            <li>Scent is a very subjective preference,  as subjective as favorite guitar picks (you guitarists know what I mean).  </li>
            <li>Very light, delicate scent with powdery notes.</li>
            <li>The packages don&#x27;t contain so much that your &amp;#34;married&amp;#34; to a scent forever but enough</li>
            <li>It is usually more expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Scent is subtle but definitely noticeable and has very calming effect that both my husband and I love.</li>
            <li>Not strong at all, but it took the fresh edge off of the scent.  </li>
            <li>So in truth, I had eagerly bought Shoyeido&#x27;s MOSS GARDEN based on the general reviews and found that I simply didn&#x27;t care for its scent</li>

            <li> This incense was a huge surprise to me after I spent a measly 3 bucks on it. It&#x27;s smooth, slightly sweet, calm and soothing in nature and has really lovely shifting layers of scent to discover. This is not \\&quot;hand dipped\\&quot; hippie patchouli, it&#x27;s refined and delicate and a completely different experience. Everyone who likes incense should try it and it deserves a place in every incense collection.</li>
            <li> Took me awhile to smell the scent of this incense at first because this is the first time I have ever burned incense; however, I walked back into my room after being gone for about 10 minutes and my room smelled like a sweet forest. I loved it. The smell has lingered for about two hours  (and counting) and it is so pleasant.</li>
            <li> Some of the best incense I have bought. It has a grounding scent that also is not intrusive. Great for meditation. What I also like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t get very smokey. I used to use the Satya Sai Baba brand a lot but I find that I have to have the windows wide open or the room  gets a bit hard to breath in. With Shoyeido that is not a problem,  though you should ventilate because it is something burning.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts anywhere from 20-30 min.</li>
            <li> Great scent woodsy with some zest, really enjoy this line. It is usually more expensive but worth every penny. Nice and delicate but not weak.</li>
            <li> I love the incense. All the ones ive tried are great. They give me a feeling of ancient, exotic (fill in the blank)....and the price is right. The packages don&#x27;t contain so much that your &amp;#34;married&amp;#34; to a scent forever but enough so you&#x27;ve got it for a while.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite incense because its notes are light, woody and not at all overwhelming.  If you are not used to japanese incense it is important to take greater care in handling them as they break quite easily.

            <li> Great item. Always a pleasure to use theae. Has a great smell and they never disappoint. Recommend item</li>
            <li> Very easy to break, short burn life, and scent is ok.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent just a lil sweetness to it. Good burn time. Fairly reasonable price the amount of incense. Just right.</li>

No.  But Shoyeido&#x27;s consistent quality and experimentation fun is enough to give MOSS GARDEN four stars.</li>
            <li> This lasted about an hour, far more than I expected from reviews.  I had it nestled in a bit of salt, totally upright in a draft-free room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent started off sweet and woody, then there was a lovely note of something like eucalyptus.  However, a sour base note started to emerge that I did not care for.  Not strong at all, but it took the fresh edge off of the scent.  At the very end of the burn time, I got a strong woodsmoke note.  It was a little headache inducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will burn half sticks in the future to avoid the headache and scent fatigue.</li>
