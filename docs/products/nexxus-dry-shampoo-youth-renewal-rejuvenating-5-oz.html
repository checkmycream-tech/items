            <li>anyways this one leaves your scalp smelling great, its pricey though</li>
            <li>GREAT.</li>
            <li>does have some stickum factor, which is great if you&#x27;re putting your hair up or curling it after application.</li>
            <li>If you want to run to the store Saturday and don&#x27;t want to take a shower--it works great.  </li>
            <li>It does have a pleasant smells which you may or may not like.</li>
            <li>but it also works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling overly textured which is nice.</li>
            <li>This product might have a good name (and I like Nexxus</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li>people asking what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is one of the more expense cans of DS in my closet I tend to use it sparingly, but when I do I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes my hair look clean.  </li>
            <li>product does what it says it will do, and is great in that respect, but you have to be willing to smell like &amp;#34;That Woman</li>
            <li>My bed pillows absorbed the scent overnight :-P</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine!</li>
            <li>While the smell is pretty amazing, it doesn&#x27;t actually do a good job soaking up oil.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s so strong that you start to taste it</li>
            <li>works well, smells ok</li>
            <li>, I have gotten many uses out of it because I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love what it does, but the scent lingers.  </li>
            <li>I had much better luck</li>
            <li>Perfect for those days when you only realize after your shower that you should have washed your hair.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>It is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, however.</li>
            <li>The best dry shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>BEST DRY SHAMPOO OUT THERE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this gives you the most product per can, works extremely well, and smells GREAT!</li>
            <li>As a full time student during the day with a part time job, this stuff is awesome for running from one place to the next.  </li>
            <li>plenty of it, your hair becomes manageable again, your hair will feel strong, your hair will smell like fresh, warm sugar cookies...</li>
            <li>No residue, which is what I&#x27;ve experienced with most of the dry shampoo products.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great</li>
            <li>Overall, really great product and</li>
            <li>But just saying to those who have great hair the next day after washing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an emergency product - it&#x27;s really only good for one day.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean, without the flaky or tacky buildup.  </li>
            <li>(And what has youth renewal got to do with clean hair?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>This one smells the best and is the least mattefying, but is probably the stickiest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well - much better than I would have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>By far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best dry shampoo I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo, smells amazing</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t have strayed from the dove brand which works super well.</li>
            <li>That is more than I can say for most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>It is right in the middle in terms of price and the smell is just fabulous - give it a try!!</li>
            <li>This by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any of the stores near me.</li>
            <li>And, while the smell is strong, it at least smells good</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair pretty fresh between washings.</li>
            <li>Tried other dry shampoos and this has been the best one!!!</li>
            <li>I just spray it on, rub it into my scalp a few times, and not only does my hair look like I just washed it, but it smells literally delicious.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>But this factor is actually good if you want a DS with a little bit of hold to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff cleans my hair really well, but has a very strong smell and sometimes leaves white residue when I&#x27;m getting to the bottom of the can.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately, I am not.</li>
            <li>next omg i love this one...</li>
            <li>This product works well, but the scent is very overpowering!  </li>
            <li>It seems to make my hair feel more dry, and it does leave a powdery finish (that needs to be rubbed in).</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>this dry shampoo makes it more greasy.</li>
            <li>I paid 5 times more for this product than I did for the Tresemme Dry Shampoo</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>In The Elevator Who Puts On Too Much Perfume&amp;#34; all day (and all night) long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really, really works.</li>
            <li>Not luster by any means, but better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I mean really amazing, but if anything it is a bit strong, so hold your breath when applying in an open</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a dry shampoo (Tresemme) that works really well for me, but I read about this one in a magazine and figured if my cheap brand worked as well as it does, then Nexxus will be awesome....hardly.</li>
            <li>No nasty residue and works perfectly in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge dry shampoo fan and have tried just about every brand out there.</li>
            <li>So I look older, a look I am trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Ok ive tried different types of dry shampoos but</li>
            <li>I have tried several dry shampoos and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The powder is so fine that even my dark roots don&#x27;t show it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, just not a great price</li>
            <li>When I bought this dry shampoo for the first time I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect...</li>
            <li>usually order 2-3 cans to make sure I&#x27;m never without it...</li>
            <li>I really tried everything else and only this shampoo does the job.</li>
            <li>If Nexxus would calm the scent down (A LOT)</li>
            <li>A lot of dry shampoos leave a white residue that you have to really work to get out..</li>
            <li>All dry shampoos make your hair stiff like cheap hairspray.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wearing it down, you won&#x27;t have as much bounce and volume because the stickum will texturize your strands a bit.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair fluffy and smelling great, and the pearl in the powder means that you don&#x27;t get that dreaded matte look that is so common with other dry shampoos.  </li>

            <li> Nexxus Dry Shampoo does exactly what it is supposed to do: transform your flat, slightly greasy, and unruly hair into something not only you will remember fondly...</li>
            <li> Other than the nice smell, I am not impressed by it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the drug store brands and few high end</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo, this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some other brands that cost me about 4 to 8 dollars and some of them left a white powdery residue</li>
            <li> I use this at times when I am too busy/tired to get around to washing my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo for years now - I&#x27;ve bought cheap brands and also expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am a dry aerosol shampoo addict.</li>
            <li> But if you have greasy hair I would not suggest getting this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have curly and dry hair</li>
            <li> it just becomes dry, frizzy, and brittle looking.</li>
            <li> This brand doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue even when I over spray a little in one area.</li>
            <li> ; I use a lot of their other hair products), but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> It does make it look thicker, but it just matts it down.</li>
            <li> It gives your hair that just-washed appearance, but leaves your head smelling like you sprayed half a bottle of perfume on it.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t wash it everyday or else</li>
            <li> and I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It leaves it limp, weird and gross.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you get what you pay for ladies!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my hair and the product does not work well with it.</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair with a specific Loreal product which I have been unable to find again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powder, duh.</li>
            <li> would be very unhappy if this scent sat near me in a restaurant or on a plane.</li>
            <li> My hair looks worse then if I didn&#x27;t wash it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this is not the one for me.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Do we get dirty hair with age?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a reeeeally bad scent, but I have allergies and it can make me sneeze if I am having an allergy flare up.  </li>
            <li> This product is a terrible disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the worst product ever  </li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

            <li> works well, smells ok, I have gotten many uses out of it because I use it sparingly. Creates body on regular days, saves me on non-wash days.</li>
            <li> Tried other dry shampoos and this has been the best one!!!</li>
            <li> After reading through the great reviews, I decided to purchase this item. Other than the nice smell, I am not impressed by it at all. It seems to make my hair feel more dry, and it does leave a powdery finish (that needs to be rubbed in). I really wanted to love this. But unfortunately, I am not.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  It leaves my hair fluffy and smelling great, and the pearl in the powder means that you don&#x27;t get that dreaded matte look that is so common with other dry shampoos.  I&#x27;m devastated that Nexxus is discontinuing this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff cleans my hair really well, but has a very strong smell and sometimes leaves white residue when I&#x27;m getting to the bottom of the can. It is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found, however. And, while the smell is strong, it at least smells good and I get compliments and people asking what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing. That is more than I can say for most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Great price great product! Love it. A lot of dry shampoos leave a white residue that you have to really work to get out.. this product does not! I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite dry shampoo ever. No nasty residue and works perfectly in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I use this at times when I am too busy/tired to get around to washing my long hair.  it works and simplifies my life when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge dry shampoo fan and have tried just about every brand out there. I find myself brand hopping a lot and came across this product. Not only does it smell great but it also works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling overly textured which is nice. I also didn&#x27;t notice a lot of the white powder residue that some have. Overall, really great product and i will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have 3 cans of this. I purchased it because of the name. My hair looks worse then if I didn&#x27;t wash it. It does make it look thicker, but it just matts it down. It also makes it look gray. So I look older, a look I am trying to avoid. Sadly, this is not the one for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine! It leaves my hair pretty fresh between washings. It does have a pleasant smells which you may or may not like.</li>
            <li> BEST DRY SHAMPOO OUT THERE! I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this gives you the most product per can, works extremely well, and smells GREAT! It&#x27;s a little pricey, but you get what you pay for ladies!</li>
            <li> Love what it does, but the scent lingers.  It&#x27;s not a reeeeally bad scent, but I have allergies and it can make me sneeze if I am having an allergy flare up.  It really works well.  Leaves hair feeling clean, without the flaky or tacky buildup.  Will continue to buy, even though scent can cause me to sneeze, because I do not use that often.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo out there. I really tried everything else and only this shampoo does the job. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the great reviews it got in a beauty magazine.  While the smell is pretty amazing, it doesn&#x27;t actually do a good job soaking up oil.  Shouldn&#x27;t have strayed from the dove brand which works super well.</li>
            <li> By far the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used yet. I&#x27;ve tried all of the drug store brands and few high end and this beats all.</li>
            <li> Ok ive tried different types of dry shampoos but next omg i love this one... it doesnt leave you with that white powder on your hair and it also removes that \\&quot;hair\\&quot; smell.. you know the one... anyways this one leaves your scalp smelling great, its pricey though</li>
            <li> I am a dry aerosol shampoo addict. This product was 1 of 3 that I purchased simultaneously. The others were &#x27;Amika&#x27; and &#x27;Not Your Mother&#x27;s&#x27; brands. This one smells the best and is the least mattefying, but is probably the stickiest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smells GREAT. I mean really amazing, but if anything it is a bit strong, so hold your breath when applying in an open area.&lt;br /&gt;-All aerosol DS tends to matte your hair. It&#x27;s powder, duh. This one still leaves a bit of shine. Not luster by any means, but better than other brands I have tried. And it doesn&#x27;t create a white film of tiny dust particles!&lt;br /&gt;-It does have some stickum factor, which is great if you&#x27;re putting your hair up or curling it after application. If you&#x27;re wearing it down, you won&#x27;t have as much bounce and volume because the stickum will texturize your strands a bit. But this factor is actually good if you want a DS with a little bit of hold to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is one of the more expense cans of DS in my closet I tend to use it sparingly, but when I do I&#x27;m very pleased and if I had deep pockets I&#x27;d keep a dozen cans on hand.</li>
            <li> This somehow makes my hair look and feel dirtier.</li>
            <li> When I bought this dry shampoo for the first time I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect... I just picked on. And oooh...was I happy..!!! Exhilarated, I-rule-the-world-excited, I-hit-the-jackpot-happy... Simply put.&lt;br /&gt;This Nexxus Dry Shampoo does exactly what it is supposed to do: transform your flat, slightly greasy, and unruly hair into something not only you will remember fondly... Your hair gets volume again...plenty of it, your hair becomes manageable again, your hair will feel strong, your hair will smell like fresh, warm sugar cookies... I&#x27;ve gotten complements everywhere...!!!&lt;br /&gt;I usually order 2-3 cans to make sure I&#x27;m never without it... It&#x27;s awesome...!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dry shampoo for years now - I&#x27;ve bought cheap brands and also expensive brands. This by far is my favorite. It is right in the middle in terms of price and the smell is just fabulous - give it a try!!</li>
            <li> If you wake up and your hair is greasy and looks greasy this dry shampoo makes it more greasy. Not sure if it&#x27;s my hair and the product does not work well with it. But if you have greasy hair I would not suggest getting this dry shampoo. If you don&#x27;t have greasy hair maybe this will work for you? But just saying to those who have great hair the next day after washing it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!  I bought it immediately on the spot (with my amazon iphone app) after I saw how well it worked on my coworkers hair; it smells like candy and it does its job one hundred times over.  As a full time student during the day with a part time job, this stuff is awesome for running from one place to the next.  I just spray it on, rub it into my scalp a few times, and not only does my hair look like I just washed it, but it smells literally delicious.  I get compliments all the time on the smell.  If you&#x27;re looking for a dry shampoo, this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but the scent is very overpowering!  It gives your hair that just-washed appearance, but leaves your head smelling like you sprayed half a bottle of perfume on it.  The scent is nice, but it&#x27;s so strong that you start to taste it and you worry that everyone in the room with you is tasting it too!  If Nexxus would calm the scent down (A LOT) I would buy it again, but not until they do.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. I have curly and dry hair so I can&#x27;t wash it everyday or else it just becomes dry, frizzy, and brittle looking. The spray also smells very good! I&#x27;ve used some other brands that cost me about 4 to 8 dollars and some of them left a white powdery residue and I would have to end up washing my hair, which defeated the purpose. This brand doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue even when I over spray a little in one area. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product, just not a great price but I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any of the stores near me.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.  I had much better luck \\&quot;rejuvenating\\&quot; my hair with a specific Loreal product which I have been unable to find again.</li>
            <li> This product is a terrible disappointment. The smell is overpowering and it leaves a gritty feel to your hair. I paid a lot for it and wish I hadn&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t have time to wash your hair, wear a scarf. Don&#x27;t bother with this. (And what has youth renewal got to do with clean hair? Do we get dirty hair with age?)</li>
            <li> I have tried several dry shampoos and this is my favorite.  It smells good and makes my hair look clean.  The powder is so fine that even my dark roots don&#x27;t show it.  All dry shampoos make your hair stiff like cheap hairspray.  If you want it to feel squeaky clean--then wash it.  If you want to run to the store Saturday and don&#x27;t want to take a shower--it works great.  It was also a life saver after a Keratin treatment (can&#x27;t wash hair for 72H).</li>
            <li> Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it says it will do, and is great in that respect, but you have to be willing to smell like &amp;#34;That Woman In The Elevator Who Puts On Too Much Perfume&amp;#34; all day (and all night) long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;-- It works really well - much better than I would have imagined.&lt;br /&gt;-- Perfect for those days when you only realize after your shower that you should have washed your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s more of an emergency product - it&#x27;s really only good for one day. Reapplying it for a second day does not yield the same results as the initial application, nor would I expect it to.&lt;br /&gt;-- The fragrance: It is definitely not for everyone. For me, it is simply too heavy and overpowering and it does not dissipate much over time. My bed pillows absorbed the scent overnight :-P&lt;br /&gt;I would be very unhappy if this scent sat near me in a restaurant or on a plane.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work my hair still was oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dry shampoo (Tresemme) that works really well for me, but I read about this one in a magazine and figured if my cheap brand worked as well as it does, then Nexxus will be awesome....hardly. It doesn&#x27;t lift my hair at all and it looks the same as it does when I don&#x27;t wash it for a day. I paid 5 times more for this product than I did for the Tresemme Dry Shampoo and I wasted my money. This product might have a good name (and I like Nexxus; I use a lot of their other hair products), but it did nothing for my hair. Save your money and buy the Tresemme.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best dry shampoo I have found.  It really, really works. No residue, which is what I&#x27;ve experienced with most of the dry shampoo products.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo, smells amazing</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the worst product ever  I think it makes your hair look ten times dirtier.  It leaves it limp, weird and gross.  Awful.</li>
