    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is the perfect combination of strength and gentleness.</li>
            <li>Wonderful price.  </li>
            <li>and this is great--</li>
            <li>A great product and it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the side of your shirt.</li>
            <li>Hope this one will not be discontinued because it is very effective.</li>
            <li>This product is very pleasant and nice to use.</li>
            <li>Works great in the humid Virginia summer, and scent is just right - not too strong.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and this roll-on is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I have tried different scents, but like the Powder the best.</li>
            <li>I have honestly missed a day and stayed odor free.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - wish more stores would carry it but am glad Amazon does.</li>
            <li>Deodorant had come out thru the roller ball and the top was full.</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s fine and dandy</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that someone cares about the consumers that fall into the cracks of the large mass market stores.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and it works just as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The roll-ons provided, were very fresh.  </li>
            <li>This should probably be 1 Star instead of 2, but I imagine the actual product would be nice - if I could use it!</li>
            <li>, they could get dressed right away!</li>
            <li>Not always bone dry, but to me odor free is more important.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, works well, and smells nice without being too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough..</li>
            <li>I like the Dove roll-on product (i.e., the deodorant itself) a lot better than the solid stick.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me, you really want something that&#x27;s going to work.</li>
            <li>REALLY  works for me.</li>
            <li>It fits very snugly, and therefore will not roll (or even budge) without a lot of pressure/friction.  </li>
            <li>Stores like Kroger and Walmart don&#x27;t want to special order products that only cater to a handful of customers instead of the masses.</li>
            <li>works well and is mild at the same time  </li>
            <li>We depend on Amazon for many products that we use on a daily basis that I can&#x27;t find in local stores.</li>
            <li>It has a light powdery fragrance and doesn&#x27;t conflict with any other fragrance you may be wearing.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth the time to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>The roller ball is too large and will not move to properly dispense the deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It never fails and convinces me that &amp;#34;1/4 moisturizer deodorant&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t an empty slogan.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, applying the necessary pressure is not at all comfortable for sensitive armpit skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Dove roll-on is the only deodorant that works for me AND doesn&#x27;t dry the bejesus out of my underarms.  </li>
            <li> After rolling it around for quite a long time and feeling no dampness, I tested the ball itself by making a mark on it with a Sharpie marker.</li>

            <li> And yes, it goes on wet.</li>

            <li> other deodorants give me boils under my arms</li>
            <li> and I can use due to allergies to chemicals in other deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Some had leaked out on to other items.</li>
            <li> reason, I think, is because it has 22% active ingredient in it.</li>
            <li> I still remember the old commercial where the person put on the roll-on deodorant, then flapped their arms like the chicken dance until their underarms were dry.</li>
            <li> I have come to rely on and trust Dove products so this has been a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I know because I have stood in almost every store and pharmacy reading labels because it is so hard to find some place that carries Dove roll on.</li>
            <li> This product, it seems, is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> no matter how hard I tried (used both thumbs shoving) to move the ball, it wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> A roll on type is hard to come by for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s nearly impossible to roll even with the requisite assault on the armpits, and I&#x27;d have to roll the ball forward with my hand, which resulted in liquid deodorant all over my hand.  </li>

            <li> Dove roll-on is the only deodorant that works for me AND doesn&#x27;t dry the bejesus out of my underarms.  It is the perfect combination of strength and gentleness. It never fails and convinces me that &amp;#34;1/4 moisturizer deodorant&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t an empty slogan.  When I couldn&#x27;t find this deodorant in stores anymore imagine my panic - I thought Dove stopped making it.  But low and behold I found and can buy it here on Amazon so tend to buy three to five at a time just.in.case. That&#x27;s how much I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and this roll-on is no exception.  The scent is light and it works just as advertised.  I have tried different scents, but like the Powder the best.</li>
            <li> I still remember the old commercial where the person put on the roll-on deodorant, then flapped their arms like the chicken dance until their underarms were dry. Then they put on the stick deodorant and, voila!, they could get dressed right away! Well, that&#x27;s fine and dandy if all you want from your antiperspirant/deodorant is a time saver. But if you&#x27;re like me, you really want something that&#x27;s going to work. And [[ASIN:B0011Z3X7U Dove Roll-On, Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Powder 2.5 fl oz (73 ml)]] REALLY  works for me. All day. And sometimes into the next day. Even in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reason, I think, is because it has 22% active ingredient in it. Even the over-the-counter brands that claim to be prescription strength usually only have 18 to 20%. I know because I have stood in almost every store and pharmacy reading labels because it is so hard to find some place that carries Dove roll on. In my town, only CVS has it, and when I find it in stock I would buy every one they had. I never thought to look on-line! I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they stop making it. I have honestly missed a day and stayed odor free. Not always bone dry, but to me odor free is more important. And yes, it goes on wet. But it&#x27;s worth the time to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> This product is very pleasant and nice to use. It has a light powdery fragrance and doesn&#x27;t conflict with any other fragrance you may be wearing.</li>
            <li> This product, it seems, is hard to find.  The roll-ons provided, were very fresh.  No dryness.  Did not lose the odor.</li>
            <li> the only deodorant that i can use,it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it keeps me fresh.all day. other deodorants give me boils under my arms</li>
            <li> This should probably be 1 Star instead of 2, but I imagine the actual product would be nice - if I could use it! The dispenser is defective. The roller ball is too large and will not move to properly dispense the deodorant. After rolling it around for quite a long time and feeling no dampness, I tested the ball itself by making a mark on it with a Sharpie marker. Sure enough.. no matter how hard I tried (used both thumbs shoving) to move the ball, it wouldn&#x27;t budge. I then used a sharp knife and went around the entire edge. This let it move a tiny bit but then it stopped again. I&#x27;ve tried using a knife to trim and move things around, but I simply can&#x27;t get it to work properly. I have come to rely on and trust Dove products so this has been a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I like the Dove roll-on product (i.e., the deodorant itself) a lot better than the solid stick.  It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, works well, and smells nice without being too overpowering.  However, the dispenser is TERRIBLE.  The ball part of the roll on is just a smidgen too big for the bottle.  It fits very snugly, and therefore will not roll (or even budge) without a lot of pressure/friction.  Needless to say, applying the necessary pressure is not at all comfortable for sensitive armpit skin.  Sometimes it&#x27;s nearly impossible to roll even with the requisite assault on the armpits, and I&#x27;d have to roll the ball forward with my hand, which resulted in liquid deodorant all over my hand.  I suffered through for a couple of weeks before finally tossing the thing in frustration.  While I didn&#x27;t absolutely hate it while I used it (to the extent it was usable), I do not recommend this product unless Dove updates the container.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - wish more stores would carry it but am glad Amazon does.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price.  Hard to find in the store.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is great--works well and is mild at the same time  I can only find it on line a few places...</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my daughter and I can use due to allergies to chemicals in other deodorants.  We depend on Amazon for many products that we use on a daily basis that I can&#x27;t find in local stores. Stores like Kroger and Walmart don&#x27;t want to special order products that only cater to a handful of customers instead of the masses. It is nice to know that someone cares about the consumers that fall into the cracks of the large mass market stores.</li>
            <li> A roll on type is hard to come by for whatever reason. Hope this one will not be discontinued because it is very effective.</li>
            <li> Defective roller bottle won&#x27;t dispense deodorant.</li>
            <li> A great product and it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on the side of your shirt. Works great in the humid Virginia summer, and scent is just right - not too strong.</li>
            <li> Deodorant had come out thru the roller ball and the top was full. Some had leaked out on to other items. Won&#x27;t order this again.</li>
