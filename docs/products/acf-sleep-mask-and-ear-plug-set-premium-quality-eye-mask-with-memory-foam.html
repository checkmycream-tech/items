            <li>It is very comfortable and keeps ALL light out!</li>
            <li>I love the ACF sleep mask.</li>
            <li>but since I &#x27;m not wearing this contraption to sleep and the intended target love it here</li>
            <li>It has some really great padding though and really forms to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not too impressed with it acting as a sleep aid.  </li>
            <li>Love this mask.  </li>
            <li>It helps me sleep better..</li>
            <li>Comfortable, adjustable with velcro, effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d expect them to last a week at best.  </li>
            <li>I really love this..</li>
            <li>I sleep a lot better with this mask, you see nothing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i came across this product on my reviewers website</li>
            <li>This mask is sooooo comfortable!  </li>
            <li>I do wish it came with a travel bag to protect it from hotel germs, but still giving it 5 stars for such an awesome mask!</li>
            <li>It cuts into the top of my ears, so I have to wear it on top of my ears.</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask and ear plug set.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>This is the nicest, most comfortable eye mask I have every used!</li>
            <li>I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li>I would buy again, but make sure you hand wash it a couple of times before using to eliminate some of the dye.</li>
            <li>Ive had many sleep masks.....</li>
            <li>Feels nice but still it lets in light through the bottom from the elevation caused by the nose.</li>
            <li>best sleep mask on the market currently!</li>
            <li>Awesome for taking a nap in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel its worth docking a star for that since the main reason I bought this was for the sleep mask, which is excellent.</li>
            <li>good fit, true to description.</li>
            <li>Great product, very soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>is very comfortable, however I could see light coming through the bottom of my nasal bone (top of your nose)</li>
            <li>plugs are fine not the greatest as the are individual.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and blocks the light out.</li>
            <li>The material its made of stays very cool from the time you put it on until the time you take it</li>
            <li>This is one of the more comfortable sleep masks I have tried.</li>
            <li>Soft material, great quality.</li>
            <li>Love the way it fits over my eyes without crushing my lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable and the material it&#x27;s made from works pretty good to keep my face and eyes from getting overly sweaty.  </li>
            <li>This blocks out ALL of the light from when he is up getting dressed, not to mention how comfortable it is!</li>
            <li>Was able to sleep soundly on an airplane using this, and not have any issue.</li>
            <li>The velcro straps are easy to adjust and the padding adds a good mount of padding around the eye area, without adding too much pressure.</li>
            <li>i would rather have ones on strings as these are easy to lose.</li>
            <li>This will be easy to pack in a travel bag.  </li>
            <li>The ear plugs are disposable, the good kind, but definitely only one time use.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my eyes do not touch the inside of the mask, I also love the large size of the mask itself, it covers most of my face.</li>
            <li>It has great contours that fit the ridges of your nose, and it completely blocks out light.</li>
            <li>If you have to have it dark when you sleep this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best..</li>
            <li>With a slight tweak in design this could be the best mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased ( which is probably in the 50 range over the years).  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>I must say they are very soft and cushy and I really like the eye holes.</li>
            <li>This mask is super soft and comfortable to wear, so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li>In bright light it does not make as tight a seal (if you will) to block all light, but when in dim light it is perfect!  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Doesnt really fit my face, lets a lot of light in but is still comfortable.</li>
            <li>It leaks light like a sieve at the nose.  </li>
            <li>The strap is adjustable and allows you to create a custom fit for your head size.  </li>
            <li>It was INCREDIBLY comfortable, and I tested it with the lights on, and couldnt get any light unless I tried at it.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy but keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>Does let some light around the nose.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit well, so the light comes in, lots of it, around the nose</li>
            <li>Keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>The light still comes through the bottom of the mask.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>They are just the cheap disposable foam type.  </li>
            <li>Blocks out all light and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Fantastic sleep mask that comes with a lifetime guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Blocks all light but weightless</li>
            <li>The design allows it to fit snugly around the eyes to block light without putting pressure on the eyes themselves.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one because of bulky borders which should fit my face well.</li>
            <li>Fits comfortable and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable and stays on.  </li>
            <li>The mask is comfy, and it blocks the light well.</li>
            <li>- Light can come through the nose area  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t block out ALL the light</li>
            <li>It fits really comfortable and enjoy the memory foam feel.</li>
            <li>In addition it is light weight.......</li>
            <li>The mask is really comfortable to wear while sleeping</li>
            <li>but my children insist on leaving the hall light on &amp; this makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is wonderfully contoured with what feels like a firmly packed gel that molds to your face.  </li>
            <li>light seeps in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask does not block 100% of all light as it does not contour to my face perfectly, there is a small gap of light that comes in from below.  </li>
            <li>Wanting a quick 10-20 min nap isn&#x27;t easy with afternoon distractions.</li>
            <li>The mask is amazing though, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>people wear them all night from what I&#x27;ve read, but for me a quick couch nap is fine.</li>
            <li>how unique.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found this product..</li>
            <li>Was so excited when I put this on to have the blackout effect.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my son, he likes it because it totally blocks out the neighbors bright light.</li>
            <li>They did come with a set of ear plugs that were not anything special.  </li>
            <li>Some light comes in from the bottom, otherwise it is comfortable and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>and I have had a lot more nights of restful sleep thanks to this mask.</li>
            <li>Product was pretty much as represented and is a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li>Thanks ACF for much better sleeping nights.</li>
            <li>Nice soft material.</li>
            <li>Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li>stylish, easy to put it on, relaxing, made of  soft material</li>
            <li>It really blocks out everything and the mask is super comfortable!</li>
            <li>The nose piece just didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li>blocks the light way better than my old sleeping mask!</li>
            <li>While it is great for sleeping on my side, it stays in place, and is comfortable there is still small gaps around the nose that let light in.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>I have several different &amp;#34;blinders&amp;#34; and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I received it super quick, and today was the 1st chance I had to try it out</li>
            <li>Super comfy,  </li>
            <li>The most comfortable sleep mask i have so far</li>
            <li>Very nice quality.. seems to leak in a little light, but could be me face shape.</li>
            <li>It blocks out light fairly well due to the contour of the face-side of the mask.  </li>
            <li>I love my new sleep mask</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, comfortable and blocks all light.</li>
            <li>It did a good job at keeping the light out - I gained a few extra hours of precious sleep because of it!</li>
            <li>and this helps block light very well.</li>
            <li>really blocks the light</li>
            <li>It lets in a lot of light around your nose which defeats the whole purpose</li>
            <li>Highest quality materials and construction, providing a soft comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li>I find it most useful in the early morning.</li>
            <li>It is of a very basic kind.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li>this is , so far, my favorite one.  </li>
            <li>and I also found that if I put my mature skin cream on  I could put this over the top of my eyes for a relaxing break.</li>
            <li>feels very comfortable on and has indents for my eyes so its not pressing on my eye lids like so many other masks.&lt;br /&gt;ear</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Nice notch for the nose, great thick memory like foam for around the eyes, large enough to not let any light in.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and the length could be adjusted according to your head size easily.</li>
            <li>Super comfy, helps eliminate light more than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear mask and definitely keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>In my experience, only Hearos sleep masks block out all light (while also keeping eyelids free of compression), but their foam rubber padding deteriorates after a while.  </li>
            <li>well made and shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>The mask is very soft and light weight, and it is designed so that it does not put pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li>Other than that very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable and fits to anyone because it has a velcro closing in the back.</li>
            <li>It keeps out the light better than any other mask that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>but this really helps block that &amp;#34;morning&amp;#34; sun until I am ready to wake up!!</li>
            <li>The ACF sleep mask works well enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>As it ships now semi close, but no cigar (if you want complete light blockage)..</li>
            <li>Basic, comfortable, does the job!</li>
            <li>The mask is padded with a soft foam, almost like memory foam, and has molded spots for your eyes and nose which make it extremely comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is so light and soft</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried a sleeping mask.</li>
            <li>We get the sun first thing.</li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t move around while sleeping.</li>
            <li>I used this eye mask for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Only wish is that the logo be a bit more discreet..</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, and I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>it will allow you to get much needed rest along the way!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this mask at first.</li>
            <li>Very neat!  </li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Most regular sleep masks don&#x27;t fit well, are uncomfortable and let light in; this sleep mask has an adjustable band to securely and comfortably fit around you head and cups your eyes in a soft, comfortable manner.</li>
            <li>Very helpful item,thank you very much.</li>
            <li>There is nothing special with the packaging just a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>The mask is super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Package arrived very quickly, even though I&#x27;d opted for only the free standard shipping.  </li>
            <li>Since I work nights and my master bedroom is almost entirely windowed the sun shining through in the morning has been a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It still works reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>Very comfy.</li>
            <li>I really like to shape/cushion around the eye area.</li>
            <li>It definitely blocks out light but nothing than that.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>But overall comfortable.</li>
            <li>really i need like that since one year</li>
            <li>It also blackouts the lights very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Conforms to your face so really comfy at night.</li>
            <li>and this is really helping me stay asleep until my alarm goes off.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a comfortable mask that doesn&#x27;t feel like the generic type you get everywhere..</li>
            <li>What I really like about the mask is the cushion around the eyes....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It did not cover light entirely.</li>
            <li>the back strap is adjustable to fit your head well.</li>
            <li>so I dont feel it as much.  </li>
            <li>This shipped really fast</li>
            <li>The mask has a velcro adustable strap so it really is one-size fits all.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use an eye mask when I get migraines - to shut out the light.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with a case as some have indicated - but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>The real draw here is the mask - and</li>
            <li>fast  shipping</li>
            <li>This shipped really fast</li>
            <li>I really dig these.  </li>
            <li>, the gel form support around the eyes make it very comfy.</li>
            <li>So far so good just wish no light would come in through my nose area</li>
            <li>Compare to other sleep mask, this one gives you better sleep and doesnt give you any mark around your eyes when you remove it.</li>
            <li>I was actually JUST complaining to my husband that my current sleep mask bothers my eye lashes (I&#x27;m super sensitive about anything touching my eyes)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised by the absolute comfort and darkness this provides!  </li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable and stays on all night without feeling tight.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and stays in place all night long!</li>
            <li>Also it comes with only one pair, so if you&#x27;re traveling you&#x27;re going to need to supplement the earplugs to have enough for your trip, but totally do able.  </li>
            <li>the ear plugs are a plus (roll them in your fingers to make them fit easier, they will slowly expand and block some sound).</li>
            <li>I love that you can open your eyes if necessary -</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to Everyone</li>
            <li>Seems high quality, and has indentations for your eyes.</li>
            <li>To me the nose area could use a little more padding on the sides.  </li>
            <li>I was so lucky that I got a coupon for this right when our curtain was ripped down</li>
            <li>This mask is very comfy and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other masks in the past and this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li>It works really well in dim light, allowing you to sleep even though other activity might otherwise keep you up.</li>
            <li>This mask is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as far as comfort, but I had to drop the stars because the ink they use on the elastic band is not color fast and my pillow case is permanently discolored from its use (went to bad with damp hair).</li>
            <li>It blocks out light but does not compress your eyelids due to the design of the mask.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other eye covers I have used still let in some sun light.</li>
            <li>There is still a little amount of light coming from the nose area but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>Now, my husband is a snorer, so I sleep with earplugs nightly, but the mask was new.</li>
            <li>This is to be expected, but the amount of light that comes in is miniscule, and the material is completely blackout.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable and the only light that gets in is the 2 small spots near my nose</li>
            <li>ACF Sleep Mask &amp; Ear Plug Set is very soft.</li>
            <li>All the sleep masks I&#x27;ve seen at local retailers have been very cheap looking and often more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li>If the nose were cut out higher or thicker foam were used beneath the eye cups (especially to the sides of the nose)</li>
            <li>and ive been able to sleep past 5am.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel it does exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>it are pretty low quality and can be bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>In order to see any light I have to peer down my nose</li>
            <li>My one complaint (which also applies to many other brands of sleep mask) is that the padding around the bridge of the nose doesn&#x27;t completely block out all light.</li>
            <li>Now I dont have to force the significant other to sleep when I do, I can just put this baby on and off to dreamland!</li>
            <li>I nap in the middle of the day with these and some earplugs and even though I live in a very noisy, loud environment and sleep as if it were 4AM.</li>
            <li>Still has a little light that gets through at nose, but if I choose to tighten it to the point of being snug the gap disappears.</li>
            <li>Wow this is such a high quality mask!  </li>
            <li>Brought this for my 9 year old, her old one broke apart</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and padded</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please send me the case as soon as possible, because I paid for the whole package</li>
            <li>The sun shines directly in my bedroom window in the morning</li>
            <li>soft.</li>
            <li>I have a four-month old baby girl</li>
            <li>The indentation is only very slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so soft would buy it again.</li>
            <li>my 6-year old tried it -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several sleep masks but the contour memory foam really makes this stand out.  </li>
            <li>so it is completely adjustable.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a simple little mask that won&#x27;t weigh you down or slip and slide --- this one is good to go.</li>
            <li>I wore this through a long international flight and several hostels to block out light.</li>
            <li>My biggest issues with previous masks has been that they do not block out enough light.  </li>
            <li>not the usual mask...very comfortable inside for eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure is that what you have to do to prevent light from coming in?</li>
            <li>I especially like that you can open your eyes since the eye holes are so large and recessed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not used the ear plugs because I live in a very quiet household.</li>
            <li>I recommend this sleep mask because the material used is very soft and having a velcro closing in the back so it will adjust to anyones head size.</li>
            <li>It has a very premium feel to it and best of all did NOT have the bad chemical/plastic smell on it like similar products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>I barely feel it when it is on</li>
            <li>UPDATE: within two months destroyed completely and start coloring white clothes... did not expect that from that priced product!!!</li>
            <li>Not tight enough around head....</li>
            <li>However, other household members have used it without complaints and find it very comfy.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s better than just regular flat sleep masks but those round borders make it fit not ideally.</li>
            <li>it blocks light very well at the eyes but not at the nose which makes it useless</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use earplugs because I like a little noise when I doze off, but they appear to be pretty</li>
            <li>, she loves it, it covers her eyes very well and is dark just they way she likes it.  </li>
            <li>I dont have black out curtains so during the summer months i dont get much sleep because of the sunlight.</li>
            <li>A little light would shine through the bottom of my mask, perhaps the padding on the bottom can be beefed up a little.</li>
            <li>The materials are good, however the design is bad.</li>
            <li>This may be comfortable on Asian women with small flatter noses (like my wife) but not on average sized non-Asians.</li>

            <li> It is very comfortable and keeps ALL light out!</li>
            <li> I love the ACF sleep mask.</li>
            <li> but since I &#x27;m not wearing this contraption to sleep and the intended target love it here</li>
            <li> It has some really great padding though and really forms to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not too impressed with it acting as a sleep aid.  </li>
            <li> Love this mask.  </li>
            <li> It helps me sleep better..</li>
            <li> Comfortable, adjustable with velcro, effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d expect them to last a week at best.  </li>
            <li> I really love this..</li>
            <li> I sleep a lot better with this mask, you see nothing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i came across this product on my reviewers website</li>
            <li> This mask is sooooo comfortable!  </li>
            <li> I do wish it came with a travel bag to protect it from hotel germs, but still giving it 5 stars for such an awesome mask!</li>
            <li> It cuts into the top of my ears, so I have to wear it on top of my ears.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask and ear plug set.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest, most comfortable eye mask I have every used!</li>
            <li> I have grown to love it.</li>
            <li> I would buy again, but make sure you hand wash it a couple of times before using to eliminate some of the dye.</li>
            <li> Ive had many sleep masks.....</li>
            <li> Feels nice but still it lets in light through the bottom from the elevation caused by the nose.</li>
            <li> best sleep mask on the market currently!</li>
            <li> Awesome for taking a nap in the middle of the day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel its worth docking a star for that since the main reason I bought this was for the sleep mask, which is excellent.</li>
            <li> good fit, true to description.</li>
            <li> Great product, very soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> is very comfortable, however I could see light coming through the bottom of my nasal bone (top of your nose)</li>
            <li> plugs are fine not the greatest as the are individual.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and blocks the light out.</li>
            <li> The material its made of stays very cool from the time you put it on until the time you take it</li>
            <li> This is one of the more comfortable sleep masks I have tried.</li>
            <li> Soft material, great quality.</li>
            <li> Love the way it fits over my eyes without crushing my lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable and the material it&#x27;s made from works pretty good to keep my face and eyes from getting overly sweaty.  </li>
            <li> This blocks out ALL of the light from when he is up getting dressed, not to mention how comfortable it is!</li>
            <li> Was able to sleep soundly on an airplane using this, and not have any issue.</li>
            <li> The velcro straps are easy to adjust and the padding adds a good mount of padding around the eye area, without adding too much pressure.</li>
            <li> i would rather have ones on strings as these are easy to lose.</li>
            <li> This will be easy to pack in a travel bag.  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs are disposable, the good kind, but definitely only one time use.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my eyes do not touch the inside of the mask, I also love the large size of the mask itself, it covers most of my face.</li>
            <li> It has great contours that fit the ridges of your nose, and it completely blocks out light.</li>
            <li> If you have to have it dark when you sleep this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best..</li>
            <li> With a slight tweak in design this could be the best mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased ( which is probably in the 50 range over the years).  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> I must say they are very soft and cushy and I really like the eye holes.</li>
            <li> This mask is super soft and comfortable to wear, so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> In bright light it does not make as tight a seal (if you will) to block all light, but when in dim light it is perfect!  </li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Doesnt really fit my face, lets a lot of light in but is still comfortable.</li>
            <li> It leaks light like a sieve at the nose.  </li>
            <li> The strap is adjustable and allows you to create a custom fit for your head size.  </li>
            <li> It was INCREDIBLY comfortable, and I tested it with the lights on, and couldnt get any light unless I tried at it.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> Does let some light around the nose.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit well, so the light comes in, lots of it, around the nose</li>
            <li> Keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> The light still comes through the bottom of the mask.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> They are just the cheap disposable foam type.  </li>
            <li> Blocks out all light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sleep mask that comes with a lifetime guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Blocks all light but weightless</li>
            <li> The design allows it to fit snugly around the eyes to block light without putting pressure on the eyes themselves.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one because of bulky borders which should fit my face well.</li>
            <li> Fits comfortable and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable and stays on.  </li>
            <li> The mask is comfy, and it blocks the light well.</li>
            <li> - Light can come through the nose area  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t block out ALL the light</li>
            <li> It fits really comfortable and enjoy the memory foam feel.</li>
            <li> In addition it is light weight.......</li>
            <li> The mask is really comfortable to wear while sleeping</li>
            <li> but my children insist on leaving the hall light on &amp; this makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is wonderfully contoured with what feels like a firmly packed gel that molds to your face.  </li>
            <li> light seeps in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask does not block 100% of all light as it does not contour to my face perfectly, there is a small gap of light that comes in from below.  </li>
            <li> Wanting a quick 10-20 min nap isn&#x27;t easy with afternoon distractions.</li>
            <li> The mask is amazing though, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> people wear them all night from what I&#x27;ve read, but for me a quick couch nap is fine.</li>
            <li> how unique.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this product..</li>
            <li> Was so excited when I put this on to have the blackout effect.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son, he likes it because it totally blocks out the neighbors bright light.</li>
            <li> They did come with a set of ear plugs that were not anything special.  </li>
            <li> Some light comes in from the bottom, otherwise it is comfortable and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> and I have had a lot more nights of restful sleep thanks to this mask.</li>
            <li> Product was pretty much as represented and is a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li> Thanks ACF for much better sleeping nights.</li>
            <li> Nice soft material.</li>
            <li> Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li> stylish, easy to put it on, relaxing, made of  soft material</li>
            <li> It really blocks out everything and the mask is super comfortable!</li>
            <li> The nose piece just didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li> blocks the light way better than my old sleeping mask!</li>
            <li> While it is great for sleeping on my side, it stays in place, and is comfortable there is still small gaps around the nose that let light in.</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> I have several different &amp;#34;blinders&amp;#34; and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> I received it super quick, and today was the 1st chance I had to try it out</li>
            <li> Super comfy,  </li>
            <li> The most comfortable sleep mask i have so far</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.. seems to leak in a little light, but could be me face shape.</li>
            <li> It blocks out light fairly well due to the contour of the face-side of the mask.  </li>
            <li> I love my new sleep mask</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, comfortable and blocks all light.</li>
            <li> It did a good job at keeping the light out - I gained a few extra hours of precious sleep because of it!</li>
            <li> and this helps block light very well.</li>
            <li> really blocks the light</li>
            <li> It lets in a lot of light around your nose which defeats the whole purpose</li>
            <li> Highest quality materials and construction, providing a soft comfortable fit.  </li>
            <li> I find it most useful in the early morning.</li>
            <li> It is of a very basic kind.</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> this is , so far, my favorite one.  </li>
            <li> and I also found that if I put my mature skin cream on  I could put this over the top of my eyes for a relaxing break.</li>
            <li> feels very comfortable on and has indents for my eyes so its not pressing on my eye lids like so many other masks.&lt;br /&gt;ear</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Nice notch for the nose, great thick memory like foam for around the eyes, large enough to not let any light in.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and the length could be adjusted according to your head size easily.</li>
            <li> Super comfy, helps eliminate light more than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear mask and definitely keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> In my experience, only Hearos sleep masks block out all light (while also keeping eyelids free of compression), but their foam rubber padding deteriorates after a while.  </li>
            <li> well made and shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li> The mask is very soft and light weight, and it is designed so that it does not put pressure on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Other than that very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable and fits to anyone because it has a velcro closing in the back.</li>
            <li> It keeps out the light better than any other mask that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> but this really helps block that &amp;#34;morning&amp;#34; sun until I am ready to wake up!!</li>
            <li> The ACF sleep mask works well enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> As it ships now semi close, but no cigar (if you want complete light blockage)..</li>
            <li> Basic, comfortable, does the job!</li>
            <li> The mask is padded with a soft foam, almost like memory foam, and has molded spots for your eyes and nose which make it extremely comfortable to wear at night.  </li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is so light and soft</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried a sleeping mask.</li>
            <li> We get the sun first thing.</li>
            <li> Soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t move around while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I used this eye mask for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> Only wish is that the logo be a bit more discreet..</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, and I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> it will allow you to get much needed rest along the way!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mask at first.</li>
            <li> Very neat!  </li>
            <li> fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Most regular sleep masks don&#x27;t fit well, are uncomfortable and let light in; this sleep mask has an adjustable band to securely and comfortably fit around you head and cups your eyes in a soft, comfortable manner.</li>
            <li> Very helpful item,thank you very much.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special with the packaging just a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> The mask is super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Package arrived very quickly, even though I&#x27;d opted for only the free standard shipping.  </li>
            <li> Since I work nights and my master bedroom is almost entirely windowed the sun shining through in the morning has been a huge problem.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It still works reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> Very comfy.</li>
            <li> I really like to shape/cushion around the eye area.</li>
            <li> It definitely blocks out light but nothing than that.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> But overall comfortable.</li>
            <li> really i need like that since one year</li>
            <li> It also blackouts the lights very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Conforms to your face so really comfy at night.</li>
            <li> and this is really helping me stay asleep until my alarm goes off.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a comfortable mask that doesn&#x27;t feel like the generic type you get everywhere..</li>
            <li> What I really like about the mask is the cushion around the eyes....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It did not cover light entirely.</li>
            <li> the back strap is adjustable to fit your head well.</li>
            <li> so I dont feel it as much.  </li>
            <li> This shipped really fast</li>
            <li> The mask has a velcro adustable strap so it really is one-size fits all.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use an eye mask when I get migraines - to shut out the light.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a case as some have indicated - but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> The real draw here is the mask - and</li>
            <li> fast  shipping</li>
            <li> This shipped really fast</li>
            <li> I really dig these.  </li>
            <li> , the gel form support around the eyes make it very comfy.</li>
            <li> So far so good just wish no light would come in through my nose area</li>
            <li> Compare to other sleep mask, this one gives you better sleep and doesnt give you any mark around your eyes when you remove it.</li>
            <li> I was actually JUST complaining to my husband that my current sleep mask bothers my eye lashes (I&#x27;m super sensitive about anything touching my eyes)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised by the absolute comfort and darkness this provides!  </li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable and stays on all night without feeling tight.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable and stays in place all night long!</li>
            <li> Also it comes with only one pair, so if you&#x27;re traveling you&#x27;re going to need to supplement the earplugs to have enough for your trip, but totally do able.  </li>
            <li> the ear plugs are a plus (roll them in your fingers to make them fit easier, they will slowly expand and block some sound).</li>
            <li> I love that you can open your eyes if necessary -</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to Everyone</li>
            <li> Seems high quality, and has indentations for your eyes.</li>
            <li> To me the nose area could use a little more padding on the sides.  </li>
            <li> I was so lucky that I got a coupon for this right when our curtain was ripped down</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfy and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other masks in the past and this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li> It works really well in dim light, allowing you to sleep even though other activity might otherwise keep you up.</li>
            <li> This mask is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as far as comfort, but I had to drop the stars because the ink they use on the elastic band is not color fast and my pillow case is permanently discolored from its use (went to bad with damp hair).</li>
            <li> It blocks out light but does not compress your eyelids due to the design of the mask.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other eye covers I have used still let in some sun light.</li>
            <li> There is still a little amount of light coming from the nose area but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> Now, my husband is a snorer, so I sleep with earplugs nightly, but the mask was new.</li>
            <li> This is to be expected, but the amount of light that comes in is miniscule, and the material is completely blackout.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and the only light that gets in is the 2 small spots near my nose</li>
            <li> ACF Sleep Mask &amp; Ear Plug Set is very soft.</li>
            <li> All the sleep masks I&#x27;ve seen at local retailers have been very cheap looking and often more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li> If the nose were cut out higher or thicker foam were used beneath the eye cups (especially to the sides of the nose)</li>
            <li> and ive been able to sleep past 5am.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel it does exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> it are pretty low quality and can be bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> In order to see any light I have to peer down my nose</li>
            <li> My one complaint (which also applies to many other brands of sleep mask) is that the padding around the bridge of the nose doesn&#x27;t completely block out all light.</li>
            <li> Now I dont have to force the significant other to sleep when I do, I can just put this baby on and off to dreamland!</li>
            <li> I nap in the middle of the day with these and some earplugs and even though I live in a very noisy, loud environment and sleep as if it were 4AM.</li>
            <li> Still has a little light that gets through at nose, but if I choose to tighten it to the point of being snug the gap disappears.</li>
            <li> Wow this is such a high quality mask!  </li>
            <li> Brought this for my 9 year old, her old one broke apart</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and padded</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please send me the case as soon as possible, because I paid for the whole package</li>
            <li> The sun shines directly in my bedroom window in the morning</li>
            <li> soft.</li>
            <li> I have a four-month old baby girl</li>
            <li> The indentation is only very slight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is so soft would buy it again.</li>
            <li> my 6-year old tried it -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several sleep masks but the contour memory foam really makes this stand out.  </li>
            <li> so it is completely adjustable.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a simple little mask that won&#x27;t weigh you down or slip and slide --- this one is good to go.</li>
            <li> I wore this through a long international flight and several hostels to block out light.</li>
            <li> My biggest issues with previous masks has been that they do not block out enough light.  </li>
            <li> not the usual mask...very comfortable inside for eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure is that what you have to do to prevent light from coming in?</li>
            <li> I especially like that you can open your eyes since the eye holes are so large and recessed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not used the ear plugs because I live in a very quiet household.</li>
            <li> I recommend this sleep mask because the material used is very soft and having a velcro closing in the back so it will adjust to anyones head size.</li>
            <li> It has a very premium feel to it and best of all did NOT have the bad chemical/plastic smell on it like similar products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I barely feel it when it is on</li>
            <li> UPDATE: within two months destroyed completely and start coloring white clothes... did not expect that from that priced product!!!</li>
            <li> Not tight enough around head....</li>
            <li> However, other household members have used it without complaints and find it very comfy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s better than just regular flat sleep masks but those round borders make it fit not ideally.</li>
            <li> it blocks light very well at the eyes but not at the nose which makes it useless</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use earplugs because I like a little noise when I doze off, but they appear to be pretty</li>
            <li> , she loves it, it covers her eyes very well and is dark just they way she likes it.  </li>
            <li> I dont have black out curtains so during the summer months i dont get much sleep because of the sunlight.</li>
            <li> A little light would shine through the bottom of my mask, perhaps the padding on the bottom can be beefed up a little.</li>
            <li> The materials are good, however the design is bad.</li>
            <li> This may be comfortable on Asian women with small flatter noses (like my wife) but not on average sized non-Asians.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why sleeping masks and have always seemed useless to me until this one, I can finally fall asleep in the middle of the day or if someone leaves the light on at night.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I waited such a long time to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> It looks like it could last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I will be taking a trip soon and hope it will help for the long flight.</li>
            <li> was a gift for my sister and I expected to received with its case but only came with the ear plugs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask left a black imprint on our white sheets.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a white male and this pushes hard on my nose because it only carves out a groove without an extrusion.  </li>
            <li> strap is very uncomfortable, presses in to top of ear.</li>
            <li> I generally do not have trouble falling asleep but will be flying overnight to Europe this summer and thought this might be necessary to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> in less than two weeks the elastic has stretched way out.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to last more than a few weeks :(  </li>
            <li> The velcro tab on back makes it adjustable for tightness or to make it less tight.</li>
            <li> At first, I was not impressed with the bumpy inside lining</li>
            <li> I would recommend any other mask with sharper edges and thinner (even with thinner borders you can still open/close eyes)  </li>
            <li> so I choose to have it a little loose.</li>
            <li> I recently started working a late night shift</li>
            <li> The mask keeps it dark and stays off my eyes.</li>
            <li> Squashes your nose, which is not a very comfortable feeling when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> so your eyelashes don&#x27;t get matted down.  </li>
            <li> This mask fits well around the eyes but has a slight gap around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I prefer them to be less fabric when I sleep</li>
            <li> It works well, but leaves black marks on my pillow.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a wide nose and it is cutout for a really small nose.</li>
            <li> It is a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just a little added bonus.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with previous masks, but this rubs my nose raw.</li>
            <li> Because of this it does not fit firmly across his eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve had it a few nights</li>
            <li> No light peeks through.</li>
            <li> I found the eye and nose areas were not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I will see if I get used to it after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping till now .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use a CPAP mask that I wear under this. I have no problem with previous masks, but this rubs my nose raw. I tried it again after my nose healed and it happened again. I am in the process of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;When I wore it without the CPAP it worked good. I never tried all night.</li>
            <li> Appears to be doing the job. I will be taking a trip soon and hope it will help for the long flight. It will be tested then. Thanks</li>
            <li> This mask is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far as far as comfort, but I had to drop the stars because the ink they use on the elastic band is not color fast and my pillow case is permanently discolored from its use (went to bad with damp hair).</li>
            <li> There were no earplugs but that is not what I was looking for when purchasing this product. I recently started working a late night shift and I have had a lot more nights of restful sleep thanks to this mask. It is comfortable and the only light that gets in is the 2 small spots near my nose but this doesn&#x27;t disturb my sleep. I barely feel it when it is on and I am very comfortable when sleeping on my side with the mask on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain. Wanting a quick 10-20 min nap isn&#x27;t easy with afternoon distractions. ACF Sleep Mask is lightweight, provides enough darkness, and isn&#x27;t hot.&lt;br /&gt;Some people wear them all night from what I&#x27;ve read, but for me a quick couch nap is fine.</li>
            <li> strap is very uncomfortable, presses in to top of ear.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated.  Comfortable to wear mask and definitely keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> Package arrived very quickly, even though I&#x27;d opted for only the free standard shipping.  Product was pretty much as represented and is a pretty good value.  My one complaint (which also applies to many other brands of sleep mask) is that the padding around the bridge of the nose doesn&#x27;t completely block out all light. It still works reasonably well.  In my experience, only Hearos sleep masks block out all light (while also keeping eyelids free of compression), but their foam rubber padding deteriorates after a while.  The ACF sleep mask works well enough that I&#x27;ll keep using it until something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Great mask. Very comfy. Still has a little light that gets through at nose, but if I choose to tighten it to the point of being snug the gap disappears. I don&#x27;t like Wye masks super right so I choose to have it a little loose. I&#x27;ve been using it a month and it&#x27;s holding up well...unlike others I have tried that fall apart or have bad elastic stamps.</li>
            <li> Great quality, blocks out a lot of light and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This Sleeping Mask is one of the best and most comfortable I have ever used, it doesn&#x27;t let any light in and my eyelashes do not touch the inside. It is very comfortable. In order to see any light I have to peer down my nose and that&#x27;s why sleeping masks and have always seemed useless to me until this one, I can finally fall asleep in the middle of the day or if someone leaves the light on at night. It feels very comfortable on your face. I would highly recommend it to Everyone</li>
            <li> I love the ACF sleep mask. I have dry eyes and they help at night and I can use my hot/cold packs with this mask.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my 9 year old, her old one broke apart, she loves it, it covers her eyes very well and is dark just they way she likes it.  I tried it on and of course I&#x27;m much larger person and it felt good to the skin and the memory foam effect is very comfortable, however I could see light coming through the bottom of my nasal bone (top of your nose) but since I &#x27;m not wearing this contraption to sleep and the intended target love it here goes my five star review, after all if my Princess is happy, the King it is so much so!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mask at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about it. This mask is very comfortable and fits to anyone because it has a velcro closing in the back. I have not used the ear plugs because I live in a very quiet household. I recommend this sleep mask because the material used is very soft and having a velcro closing in the back so it will adjust to anyones head size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good. I really like to shape/cushion around the eye area. It makes a huge difference. Compare to other sleep mask, this one gives you better sleep and doesnt give you any mark around your eyes when you remove it.</li>
            <li> The materials are good, however the design is bad. Squashes your nose, which is not a very comfortable feeling when trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> While it is great for sleeping on my side, it stays in place, and is comfortable there is still small gaps around the nose that let light in.</li>
            <li> Great product, very soft and comfortable!</li>
            <li> Everything as advertised, very good service, on time and a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Good eye coverage. It&#x27;s soft and padded so you hardly know you have it on.</li>
            <li> With a slight tweak in design this could be the best mask I&#x27;ve ever purchased ( which is probably in the 50 range over the years).  Unfortunately it&#x27;s not.  It leaks light like a sieve at the nose.  If the nose were cut out higher or thicker foam were used beneath the eye cups (especially to the sides of the nose) it would be close to perfect.  As it ships now semi close, but no cigar (if you want complete light blockage)..</li>
            <li> The sleep mask package didn&#x27;t come with a dust bag like shown in the images below.  In addition to that, I didn&#x27;t receive ear plugs in my package either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried out the mask to see if it helps at all.  It definitely blocks out light but nothing than that.  It has some really great padding though and really forms to the eyes.  However, I&#x27;m not too impressed with it acting as a sleep aid.  It&#x27;s not necessarily a terrible product but it isn&#x27;t an incredible product either.</li>
            <li> Slept like a baby. There is a like outside my bedroom window and this helped a lot! I could have blocked the window somehow but would have been ugly with an ac in the window so this did the trick. Very comfortable!</li>
            <li> My biggest issues with previous masks has been that they do not block out enough light.  This mask is awesome!  It blocks out light but does not compress your eyelids due to the design of the mask.  It is also very comfortable!</li>
            <li> not the usual mask...very comfortable inside for eyes.  how unique.  thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use. Ive used it 2 days in a row now and ive been able to sleep past 5am. I dont have black out curtains so during the summer months i dont get much sleep because of the sunlight. This is great for those months. Or when i want to nap during the day. It doesnt bother me at all even when i sleep on my stomach. I havent used the ear plugs just because i find those yucky to use.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered! my husband needed this!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the mask semi regularly and it has already begun to tear at the seams. I didn&#x27;t expect it to last forever but I expected it to last more than a few weeks :(  Super comfy, helps eliminate light more than any other I&#x27;ve used. I wish the ear plugs were different, maybe connected to the mask it&#x27;s self. However, it&#x27;s just a personal preference. You get what you see in the photo and they work great. No more waking up with lines across your face!  I purchased with a coupon code and I provided my honest opinion. I would repurchase even without code.</li>
            <li> Love this mask.  It has a very premium feel to it and best of all did NOT have the bad chemical/plastic smell on it like similar products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  The strap is adjustable and allows you to create a custom fit for your head size.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Good quality comfortable. Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> The Sleep mask is a good product and it came on time, but it didn&#x27;t come with the case, like is shown in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift for my sister and I expected to received with its case but only came with the ear plugs.&lt;br /&gt;Please send me the case as soon as possible, because I paid for the whole package and like I said, I wanted to give it to my sister for her birthday. Look forward to hear for you soon.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra.</li>
            <li> I was so lucky that I got a coupon for this right when our curtain was ripped down and I didnt have a way to hang it back up. I tried out the mask and ear plugs that night. Now, my husband is a snorer, so I sleep with earplugs nightly, but the mask was new. It was INCREDIBLY comfortable, and I tested it with the lights on, and couldnt get any light unless I tried at it. I slept with it easily, and it stayed perfectly in place. The reason I only gave it 4 stars was that the ear plugs left A LOT to be desired, and I could hear things like my husband shuffling around the bed, let alone his snoring. I put them in my emergency over night bag, and switched to my usual ones. The mask is amazing though, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Basic, comfortable, does the job! Nothing fancy but keeps the light out. Used it on a plane ride perfectly!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my eyes do not touch the inside of the mask, I also love the large size of the mask itself, it covers most of my face.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son, he likes it because it totally blocks out the neighbors bright light.</li>
            <li> Wow this is such a high quality mask!  It really blocks out everything and the mask is super comfortable!</li>
            <li> This mask is super soft and comfortable to wear, so glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> Mask is made for a small nose. My husband has a wide nose and it is cutout for a really small nose. Because of this it does not fit firmly across his eyes and forehead. He can do use this so its sitting in the package it came in.</li>
            <li> Love it! It helps me sleep better..</li>
            <li> Does let some light around the nose.  But overall comfortable.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, adjustable with velcro, effective. Big</li>
            <li> good fit, true to description. I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit well, so the light comes in, lots of it, around the nose</li>
            <li> Some light comes in from the bottom, otherwise it is comfortable and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and blocks the light out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work so GOOD üëç really i need like that since one year and finally i got it ...</li>
            <li> I generally do not have trouble falling asleep but will be flying overnight to Europe this summer and thought this might be necessary to have on hand. I tested it one night when my husband decided to read while I needed to sleep. While there is a gap at the edge around my nose it was not enough to bother me. The mask is very soft and light weight, and it is designed so that it does not put pressure on your eyes. I will try to update this after my travels.</li>
            <li> ACF Sleep Mask &amp; Ear Plug Set is very soft. It also blackouts the lights very well. Honestly speaking, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great mask!  It was very comfortable to use. It did a good job at keeping the light out - I gained a few extra hours of precious sleep because of it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great eyemask. Keeps the light out. Conforms to your face so really comfy at night.</li>
            <li> The light still comes through the bottom of the mask. If I bring it down, it covers my nose and make it hard to breathe.</li>
            <li> love this!! feels very comfortable on and has indents for my eyes so its not pressing on my eye lids like so many other masks.&lt;br /&gt;ear plugs are fine not the greatest as the are individual. i would rather have ones on strings as these are easy to lose. Other than that very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This mask fits well around the eyes but has a slight gap around the nose area. It is very comfortable. There is no pressure put on the eyes.</li>
            <li> Great mask around the eyes.  But I&#x27;m a white male and this pushes hard on my nose because it only carves out a groove without an extrusion.  It makes the tip of my nose sore.  This may be comfortable on Asian women with small flatter noses (like my wife) but not on average sized non-Asians.</li>
            <li> So far so good just wish no light would come in through my nose area</li>
            <li> Great mask. It is comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t slip. The sun shines directly in my bedroom window in the morning and this is really helping me stay asleep until my alarm goes off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this locally for quite awhile.  Since I work nights and my master bedroom is almost entirely windowed the sun shining through in the morning has been a huge problem.  All the sleep masks I&#x27;ve seen at local retailers have been very cheap looking and often more expensive than this one.  When I was given a chance to get this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review I had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve had it a few nights I can&#x27;t find a bad thing to day about it.  The mask is padded with a soft foam, almost like memory foam, and has molded spots for your eyes and nose which make it extremely comfortable to wear at night.  I was worried that it might slide around on my face as I toss and turn but it seems to stay perfectly in place thanks to the adjustable strap and the molding feature I mentioned.  I was also worried about the mask making me sweat and that hasn&#x27;t been an issue either.  The material its made of stays very cool from the time you put it on until the time you take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I think I should mention is that the ear plugs that come with this mask are the type you see in stores for $1 for a pack of 20 or so.  They are just the cheap disposable foam type.  I use this same type of ear plug at work and we toss them after a day of use.  I haven&#x27;t used the ones included with this mask but I&#x27;d expect them to last a week at best.  I don&#x27;t feel its worth docking a star for that since the main reason I bought this was for the sleep mask, which is excellent.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> very good quality .. blocked light</li>
            <li> I really love this..I have been looking for a comfortable mask that doesn&#x27;t feel like the generic type you get everywhere..Hands down this is the best..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my face!! Great product</li>
            <li> it feels really nice and thats the reason why i decided to buy it. it blocks light very well at the eyes but not at the nose which makes it useless</li>
            <li> Perfect! Gets all areas of the eyes covered. Unlike other eye covers I have used still let in some sun light. With this sleep mask you can assure to get a good nights sleep. Also the straps are not bothersome at all. I have tried others that would get in the way, this product does not. Very great, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the product and sleeping wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Once i put this on it was so easy to sleep! No light peeks through.</li>
            <li> I have several different &amp;#34;blinders&amp;#34; and this one is the best.  A++++</li>
            <li> I use his when I&#x27;m sleeping in the car. At first, I was not impressed with the bumpy inside lining but then I got used to it. It looks like it could last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Blocks out all light and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Soothing to the eyes and confortable</li>
            <li> Nice!&lt;br /&gt;and well-fit my face line.&lt;br /&gt;it totally block lights, and noises.&lt;br /&gt;recommend 100%&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was chosen to test this product and provide my unbiased product review. This sleep mask is so light and soft I barley notice its on. If you have to have it dark when you sleep this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> They sent me a email  . As soon as i got it . I try to use the code to get tbis item for 1.94 . But code did not work .</li>
            <li> Highest quality materials and construction, providing a soft comfortable fit.  Lightweight and stays in place.  Lots of eye room.  Fantastic sleep mask that comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I am very pleased that I purchased this and would recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is one of the more comfortable sleep masks I have tried. I like that it is adjustable, but my hair kept getting caught in the Velcro.</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable and soft to the touch. However you should note it may not work well for all face and nose sizes. I found it a bit snug around the nose area, so I could have used a bigger cut out. However, other household members have used it without complaints and find it very comfy. The velcro straps are easy to adjust and the padding adds a good mount of padding around the eye area, without adding too much pressure. The mask blocks out light well and the ear plugs are a great fit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this sleeping mask.. It is the best mask I have ever tried.  The mask is super soft and silky. People worry that is not comfortable but it really is... The mask is adjustable. I sleep a lot better with this mask, you see nothing. This mask helps when you want to get a good night&#x27;s rest. This also comes with headphones, The headphones aren&#x27;t that great but don&#x27;t let that discourage you. I am so glad i came across this product on my reviewers website and I got a good discount on it. Thanks ACF for much better sleeping nights.</li>
            <li> Nice soft material. The eye hole cut outs make it nice so the material is not touching your eye lids. The ear plugs that come with it are your ordinary foam safety plugs. The velcro tab on back makes it adjustable for tightness or to make it less tight.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. We have a day sleeper in the home and this helps block light very well.</li>
            <li> Wow this mask is just about perfect. It has great contours that fit the ridges of your nose, and it completely blocks out light. Now I dont have to force the significant other to sleep when I do, I can just put this baby on and off to dreamland!</li>
            <li> I found the eye and nose areas were not comfortable. I would like to retrn it</li>
            <li> Soft material, great quality. Blocks all light but weightless so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on. No marks on face after a night of sleep.</li>
            <li> This mask is sooooo comfortable!  I was skeptical because of the low price, but took a chance since it looks puffy and cushiony while allowing room for your eyelashes, and eyes, to move during REM sleep.  I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised by the absolute comfort and darkness this provides!  I do wish it came with a travel bag to protect it from hotel germs, but still giving it 5 stars for such an awesome mask!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Love the way it fits over my eyes without crushing my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of sleep masks over the years and this one is by far and away the best one I&#x27;ve used.  The design allows it to fit snugly around the eyes to block light without putting pressure on the eyes themselves.  It&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable and the material it&#x27;s made from works pretty good to keep my face and eyes from getting overly sweaty.  Would definitely recommend both the product and the company.  They have great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried a sleeping mask. Overall, I feel it does exactly what it said it would do. I find it most useful in the early morning. Our bedroom windows face east. We get the sun first thing. The mask keeps it dark and stays off my eyes. There is nothing rubbing on them when I open them.</li>
            <li> in less than two weeks the elastic has stretched way out. It cuts into the top of my ears, so I have to wear it on top of my ears. But the worst is that it started dying my pillowcase and the stain does not come out with normal washing.</li>
            <li> Stained my pillow cases with blue/black ink.</li>
            <li> really blocks the light makes it a breeze to sleep during the day</li>
            <li> Does the trick!  Soft and comfortable and doesn&#x27;t move around while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this product.. I was actually JUST complaining to my husband that my current sleep mask bothers my eye lashes (I&#x27;m super sensitive about anything touching my eyes)...then I saw this product. I love love love it! Thank you for making a great product.</li>
            <li> Tried these to review and give my honest opinion. I paid a discount price for this sleeping mask. What I really like about the mask is the cushion around the eyes....I thought that no light would get in,but I had to pull real tight for that to happen. I am not sure is that what you have to do to prevent light from coming in? I know I could not have this on all night because I would have a headache. Would I buy this again????? I don&#x27;t think so. But I must say I get headaches when I have something around my head or face. So that may be the problem.....so that micght be just my problem. I must say they are very soft and cushy and I really like the eye holes. I think one would have to try for themselves</li>
            <li> This mask is awesome. It&#x27;s very comfortable and it does a great job keeping the light out.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing sleep mask I have ever used. I received it super quick, and today was the 1st chance I had to try it out and I was amazed!  It is very soft, comfortable and blocks all light. Most regular sleep masks don&#x27;t fit well, are uncomfortable and let light in; this sleep mask has an adjustable band to securely and comfortably fit around you head and cups your eyes in a soft, comfortable manner. I have no idea why I waited such a long time to make this purchase. Every item I have ever received from ACF has been superb, but by far this is the BEST!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things, HIGHLY recommend!!</li>
            <li> Best mask, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Expansive not always is the best (check the cheaper one I bought). I ordered this one because of bulky borders which should fit my face well. Yes, it&#x27;s better than just regular flat sleep masks but those round borders make it fit not ideally. I would recommend any other mask with sharper edges and thinner (even with thinner borders you can still open/close eyes)  UPDATE: within two months destroyed completely and start coloring white clothes... did not expect that from that priced product!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected. Received product for discount to provide honest feedback. Aplus shipper and great product. Cant complain at all. Will buy again at full price.</li>
            <li> soft. stays in place. blocks the light way better than my old sleeping mask! the concave design of the eye holes allows your eye freedom of movement, too!</li>
            <li> Doesnt really fit my face, lets a lot of light in but is still comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fits comfortable and blocks out all light. I&#x27;ve tried several other masks in the past and this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li> Best sleep mask ever!  I work 5pm -5am graveyards and was having trouble sleeping during the day until I got this mask!  Super comfy,  well made and shipped super fast.  I&#x27;m ordering another one for a backup!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask and ear plug set.  They fit great, are good quality and help with a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Love this mask! I don&#x27;t feel clausterphobic with bit on.</li>
            <li> I paid $1 for it. It looks good. It did not cover light entirely. I could still see under my eyes. I have never used any ear mask before so it could be a standard design. Ear plug set is useless. It is of a very basic kind.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  I didn&#x27;t need the ear plugs...but this really helps block that &amp;#34;morning&amp;#34; sun until I am ready to wake up!!</li>
            <li> to be transparent, i received this product for $1 as a promo. however, that does not take away from the quality. i never had a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sleep mask before. this one has elevated cups that go over your eye socket so it doesn&#x27;t take your eye so it feels great. the back strap is adjustable to fit your head well. good product!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.. seems to leak in a little light, but could be me face shape. Seems high quality, and has indentations for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Awesome! I love it! It is very comfortable and keeps ALL light out!</li>
            <li> I used this eye mask for the first time today.  It is a little bulky.  I prefer them to be less fabric when I sleep so I dont feel it as much.  I will see if I get used to it after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product through a discount/promo amount.</li>
            <li> Was so excited when I put this on to have the blackout effect. Extremely comfortable and stays on.  The eye cutouts inside and.fantastic so no pressure.  Only wish is that the logo be a bit more discreet..</li>
            <li> Very helpful item,thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is the nicest, most comfortable eye mask I have every used!</li>
            <li> This is review is for the ACF sleep mask &amp; ear plug set. I have a four-month old baby girl so I use this sleep mask to take a nap with her during the day. The mask is comfy, and it blocks the light well. There is still a little amount of light coming from the nose area but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase, and I would recommend this product.  Pros: - Blocks the light - Quality material with memory foam - Light weight, which is ideal for traveling - Lifetime warranty  Cons: - Light can come through the nose area  Disclaimer: I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping till now . I use to get disturb with small noise. But when i started using ACF Sleep mask and Ear Plug it eliminated all the background noises. It works for me..</li>
            <li> It lets in a lot of light around your nose which defeats the whole purpose</li>
            <li> Blocks out all the sunlight!</li>
            <li> My husband and I are on different sleep schedules. This blocks out ALL of the light from when he is up getting dressed, not to mention how comfortable it is! I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and adjustable. Great value.</li>
            <li> Works great and blocks out most light that can come in. Comfortable and stays in place all night long!</li>
            <li> Bulky, Ugly and very uncmfortable- too heavy</li>
            <li> The mask is amazing!  It works really well in dim light, allowing you to sleep even though other activity might otherwise keep you up. In bright light it does not make as tight a seal (if you will) to block all light, but when in dim light it is perfect!  Was able to sleep soundly on an airplane using this, and not have any issue. The ear plugs are disposable, the good kind, but definitely only one time use. Also it comes with only one pair, so if you&#x27;re traveling you&#x27;re going to need to supplement the earplugs to have enough for your trip, but totally do able.  Seriously recommend this to anyone traveling- or with a partner who stays up late watching movies or playing on their phone- it will allow you to get much needed rest along the way!</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfy and soft. It doesn&#x27;t block out ALL the light but it comes awful darn close. I especially like that you can open your eyes since the eye holes are so large and recessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use earplugs because I like a little noise when I doze off, but they appear to be pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a simple little mask that won&#x27;t weigh you down or slip and slide --- this one is good to go.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to wear, even while sleeping on my side. A little light would shine through the bottom of my mask, perhaps the padding on the bottom can be beefed up a little. I wore this through a long international flight and several hostels to block out light. The included earplugs are useless, I wouldn&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li> Very soft and the length could be adjusted according to your head size easily. I like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and ended up keeping it for myself. I am not one to use masks for sleeping but, there have been times where i want to take a nap in the daytime before having to do something and this mask makes it easier to fall asleep quicker making for a more effective rest. I would totally recommend this..... the ear plugs are a plus (roll them in your fingers to make them fit easier, they will slowly expand and block some sound).</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable and stays on all night without feeling tight.  I forget that I&#x27;m wearing it.  It blocks out light fairly well due to the contour of the face-side of the mask.  There is a small indention for the bridge of your nose.  The indentation is only very slight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does not block 100% of all light as it does not contour to my face perfectly, there is a small gap of light that comes in from below.  This is to be expected, but the amount of light that comes in is miniscule, and the material is completely blackout.  I nap in the middle of the day with these and some earplugs and even though I live in a very noisy, loud environment and sleep as if it were 4AM.</li>
            <li> The mask left a black imprint on our white sheets. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works well, but leaves black marks on my pillow.  I have washed it and hope that will take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mask at first. The nose piece just didn&#x27;t fit right. It felt like I was being suffocated. I kept using it anyways. I have grown to love it. It fits really comfortable and enjoy the memory foam feel. The bad news is it stains my pillowcase and sheets. It doesn&#x27;t come out either. So what was a good product has permanently ruined my sheets and pillow case when contacted with moisture. I would buy again, but make sure you hand wash it a couple of times before using to eliminate some of the dye.</li>
            <li> Ive had many sleep masks.....this is , so far, my favorite one.  Because it has the cavity for ur eyes, my eyes are not all smashed up when i awake. In addition it is light weight.......which is another big plus.  Thx,  Rick.</li>
            <li> Feels nice but still it lets in light through the bottom from the elevation caused by the nose. Also it had a horrible smell from the memory foam that required several days of airing out.</li>
            <li> This is so soft would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shipped really fast and I was eager to use.  The mask has a velcro adustable strap so it really is one-size fits all.  I tried it, my husband tried it and my 6-year old tried it - it fit each of us perfectly.  I regularly use an eye mask when I get migraines - to shut out the light.  My husband prefers to wear one to sleep on the nights I stay up to watch TV in bed.  This mask is very comfortable.  I&#x27;ve tried several sleep masks but the contour memory foam really makes this stand out.  I love that you can open your eyes if necessary - as the contoured design allows for a lot of room in the eye area.  It didn&#x27;t come with a case as some have indicated - but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  This will be easy to pack in a travel bag.  It did come with a set of your run-of-the-mill ear plugs - but that&#x27;s just a little added bonus.  The real draw here is the mask - and it does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The mask is really comfortable to wear while sleeping and I also found that if I put my mature skin cream on  I could put this over the top of my eyes for a relaxing break. To me the nose area could use a little more padding on the sides.  The memory foam makes a big difference.  They did come with a set of ear plugs that were not anything special.  The head band portion has a smaller loop velcro so it is completely adjustable.  There is nothing special with the packaging just a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Very neat!  Adjustable to fit your head perfectly.  Designed so you can open your eyes without hitting the mask.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> wonderful product! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> good  item  fast  shipping</li>
            <li> Like a baby....best sleep mask on the market currently!</li>
            <li> This shipped really fast and I was eager to use.Absolutely amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I&#x27;ve never used a sleeping mask before but my children insist on leaving the hall light on &amp; this makes a world of difference.  It&#x27;s is wonderfully contoured with what feels like a firmly packed gel that molds to your face.  I don&#x27;t sleep with the earplugs but I will take them to the range.</li>
            <li> stylish, easy to put it on, relaxing, made of  soft material , ear blogs work great , no complains, looks great and does the job perfectly, flexable material. thank you for letting me test your product</li>
            <li> Perfect, adjust to any size.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask is great quality.  There are foam inserts that go around your eyes so your eyelashes don&#x27;t get matted down.  The ear plugs that come with it are pretty low quality and can be bought at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, poor quality</li>
            <li> I really dig these.  Awesome for taking a nap in the middle of the day.  Nice notch for the nose, great thick memory like foam for around the eyes, large enough to not let any light in.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Also comes with lifetime warranty.</li>
            <li> Not tight enough around head....light seeps in.</li>
            <li> helps me sleep easier at night. i only leave one ear plug in case something happens at night!</li>
            <li> I love this mask! It is so lightweight and it does not suffocate you. It keeps out the light better than any other mask that I have tried. The ear plugs are just regular orange ear plugs no big deal.</li>
            <li> I love my new sleep mask and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The most comfortable sleep mask i have so far, the gel form support around the eyes make it very comfy.</li>
