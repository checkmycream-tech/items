            <li>Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this product</li>

            <li>This covergirl bronzer is a breathtaker, I love it when I use it to contour.</li>
            <li>love it&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I kept putting on more, don&#x27;t do this.</li>

            <li>love it, will always buy</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love to use this as a contour.</li>
            <li>also it is way better than sleek if you are plannign to get sleek</li>
            <li>I love the bronzy look on my face...</li>
            <li>but I love using this to bronze my face.</li>
            <li>This color works perfect for me-I&#x27;m a deep cocoa complexion</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Still love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I did find that oils tend to collect on top</li>
            <li>and I have to scape the top of the product off to get it on my brush</li>
            <li>Have to use the right brush to pick up a good amount of product.</li>
            <li>Color was a good choice for my pecan complexion and the price was right.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Appreciated the fact that it is fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I can throw everything else away because this is the perfect shade on my med-bronze skin - a little goes a long way and the look is natural and enhances my skin tone perfectly plus it looks great on me.  </li>
            <li>The bronzer is nice, it shows up really good only when I highlight my face.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented, easy to apply and the color is absolutely stunning on my skin!</li>
            <li>the contour looked beautiful so this product is universal and fantastic.</li>
            <li>Just love the simply beautiful addition this bronzer makes on my make up, not too dark not too light</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, stays on all day and the compact lasts forever.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is suburb, it has no crazy smell, and I love how it has a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>But I am light skinned</li>
            <li>I did not believe the you tubers when they said that it was a brilliant contouring powder on dark skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This is also amazing for natural on-the-go looks.</li>
            <li>You really couldn&#x27;t see any bronze it acted more like a powder foundation</li>
            <li>but this won&#x27;t let me because I love it so much</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>a warmer shade wearas sleek is cool</li>
            <li>it gives me a really summer bronze look :)</li>
            <li>Rich color, very warm dark brown.</li>
            <li>This has been touted as one of the best bronzers for brown girls (and really is) but realistically can be used on any tone dependent upon how heavy of hand is used</li>
            <li>What can i say, the queen collection works for my African American skin so perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Yessssssss this bronzer gave me my lifeeee its very easy to use not messy at all..</li>
            <li>Great for medium to dark skin tones.</li>
            <li>and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</li>
            <li>Great bronzer for dark skin.</li>
            <li>Its a great product I use it to bronze my face on light make up days or to contour for more dramatic nights or special events.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>personally use this to contour and its effective on my NW47 skin without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li>Its so worth the hype.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying over a $40 bronzer.</li>
            <li>, just right.</li>
            <li>I bet you this collection has the right shade for you.</li>
            <li>I am a dark skinned women and it is great for contouring it really slims my nose and brings out my cheekbones</li>
            <li>so if you are not caramel at all but true dark skinned girl this would be perfect for you the shimmer is very pretty just too dark</li>
            <li>so what&#x27;s the point of buying more expensive stuff when you have something great like this</li>
            <li>This bronzed absolutely lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li>One for your vanity, one for your makeup bag and a backup just in case your friend wants to try it!</li>
            <li>This is my first</li>
            <li>Thanks a million Queen!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see it at first</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is for me darker skin Afican American.</li>
            <li>most girls on youthube use it for that same purpose.</li>
            <li>i love it, especially for contouring</li>
            <li>This color ebony is really good for African american women.</li>
            <li>Perfect bronzer if your new to highlighting and contouring or if you just want a Nice glow after you applied your base makeup i would really recommend this for women of color</li>
            <li>but Amazon has a pretty reasonable price point.</li>
            <li>/blusher especially when I am wearing bold color eyeshadows and don&#x27;t want anything to bold on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Not only is this product inexpensive, but it works well and looks great on my dark complexion.</li>
            <li>Not as dark as I would like but overall product is great.</li>
            <li>Warning if you are deep brown contour first then use this as a bronzer if you are medium to light you can use it by itself</li>
            <li>It gives me such a beautiful glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or caked on.</li>
            <li>My other makeup products are higher end Fashion Fair, Mac (lots of mac), Urban Decay, Smashbox, etc.</li>
            <li>Just a little is necessary for a great contoured look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it really is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>I looked in a mirror during the day and it was very visible.</li>
            <li>That was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Contouring with this bronzer fits my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li>I heard about this on YouTube and since it was very inexpensive and I&amp;#34;m just learning how to contour, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and then put this on top to set it- wayyyyyy more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole highlighting and contouring routine</li>
            <li>but I find that issue even with high end powders.  </li>
            <li>However considering the cost, I still say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and just use a sponge and a little more effort to lift and apply.</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I really wish it was in my near by stores</li>
            <li>because it is rare but it would  work for all skin tone actually.</li>
            <li>I could not find this at my local drugstore the price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li>I know theres some people who love a super dramatic contour.</li>
            <li>By itself, it makes for a nice daily contour in that it&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable but not exactly an over-the-top &amp;#34;beat face&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering again ;)</li>
            <li>It blends in like a dream and look so natural!</li>
            <li>Im VERY aware of how CG will suddenly pull products without warning from the Queen line, so I might actually stock up on these just in case.</li>
            <li>It adds a hint of natural looking richness to your highlighted areas.</li>
            <li>I have some Mac powders that are so old</li>
            <li>I place it around the perimeter of my face and it makes it looks so natural</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure it will take me a while to hit pan.</li>
            <li>Lovely bronzer, very reddish brick undertone so be careful, not a true dark brown</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly, and they even threw a little sample eye shadow in there!</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it&#x27;s not dark enough and doesn&#x27;t snow up on my skin.</li>

            <li> I love this Bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is a must for women if color:) I am telling you ....</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer.</li>
            <li> and I can see why people love it.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this product</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money trying something that I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> but it is okay</li>
            <li> This covergirl bronzer is a breathtaker, I love it when I use it to contour.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I kept putting on more, don&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> Nice color match...goes on smooth</li>
            <li> love it, will always buy</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a contour.</li>
            <li> also it is way better than sleek if you are plannign to get sleek</li>
            <li> I love the bronzy look on my face...</li>
            <li> but I love using this to bronze my face.</li>
            <li> This color works perfect for me-I&#x27;m a deep cocoa complexion</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Still love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I did find that oils tend to collect on top</li>
            <li> and I have to scape the top of the product off to get it on my brush</li>
            <li> Have to use the right brush to pick up a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> Color was a good choice for my pecan complexion and the price was right.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Appreciated the fact that it is fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I can throw everything else away because this is the perfect shade on my med-bronze skin - a little goes a long way and the look is natural and enhances my skin tone perfectly plus it looks great on me.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer is nice, it shows up really good only when I highlight my face.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented, easy to apply and the color is absolutely stunning on my skin!</li>
            <li> the contour looked beautiful so this product is universal and fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just love the simply beautiful addition this bronzer makes on my make up, not too dark not too light</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, stays on all day and the compact lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is suburb, it has no crazy smell, and I love how it has a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> But I am light skinned</li>
            <li> I did not believe the you tubers when they said that it was a brilliant contouring powder on dark skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This is also amazing for natural on-the-go looks.</li>
            <li> You really couldn&#x27;t see any bronze it acted more like a powder foundation</li>
            <li> but this won&#x27;t let me because I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> a warmer shade wearas sleek is cool</li>
            <li> it gives me a really summer bronze look :)</li>
            <li> Rich color, very warm dark brown.</li>
            <li> This has been touted as one of the best bronzers for brown girls (and really is) but realistically can be used on any tone dependent upon how heavy of hand is used</li>
            <li> What can i say, the queen collection works for my African American skin so perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Yessssssss this bronzer gave me my lifeeee its very easy to use not messy at all..</li>
            <li> Great for medium to dark skin tones.</li>
            <li> and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for dark skin.</li>
            <li> Its a great product I use it to bronze my face on light make up days or to contour for more dramatic nights or special events.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> personally use this to contour and its effective on my NW47 skin without looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> Its so worth the hype.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying over a $40 bronzer.</li>
            <li> , just right.</li>
            <li> I bet you this collection has the right shade for you.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned women and it is great for contouring it really slims my nose and brings out my cheekbones</li>
            <li> so if you are not caramel at all but true dark skinned girl this would be perfect for you the shimmer is very pretty just too dark</li>
            <li> so what&#x27;s the point of buying more expensive stuff when you have something great like this</li>
            <li> This bronzed absolutely lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> One for your vanity, one for your makeup bag and a backup just in case your friend wants to try it!</li>
            <li> This is my first</li>
            <li> Thanks a million Queen!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see it at first</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is for me darker skin Afican American.</li>
            <li> most girls on youthube use it for that same purpose.</li>
            <li> i love it, especially for contouring</li>
            <li> This color ebony is really good for African american women.</li>
            <li> Perfect bronzer if your new to highlighting and contouring or if you just want a Nice glow after you applied your base makeup i would really recommend this for women of color</li>
            <li> but Amazon has a pretty reasonable price point.</li>
            <li> /blusher especially when I am wearing bold color eyeshadows and don&#x27;t want anything to bold on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product inexpensive, but it works well and looks great on my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I would like but overall product is great.</li>
            <li> Warning if you are deep brown contour first then use this as a bronzer if you are medium to light you can use it by itself</li>
            <li> It gives me such a beautiful glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or caked on.</li>
            <li> My other makeup products are higher end Fashion Fair, Mac (lots of mac), Urban Decay, Smashbox, etc.</li>
            <li> Just a little is necessary for a great contoured look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but it really is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> I looked in a mirror during the day and it was very visible.</li>
            <li> That was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Contouring with this bronzer fits my skin tone very well.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on YouTube and since it was very inexpensive and I&amp;#34;m just learning how to contour, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and then put this on top to set it- wayyyyyy more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole highlighting and contouring routine</li>
            <li> but I find that issue even with high end powders.  </li>
            <li> However considering the cost, I still say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and just use a sponge and a little more effort to lift and apply.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I really wish it was in my near by stores</li>
            <li> because it is rare but it would  work for all skin tone actually.</li>
            <li> I could not find this at my local drugstore the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li> I know theres some people who love a super dramatic contour.</li>
            <li> By itself, it makes for a nice daily contour in that it&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable but not exactly an over-the-top &amp;#34;beat face&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering again ;)</li>
            <li> It blends in like a dream and look so natural!</li>
            <li> Im VERY aware of how CG will suddenly pull products without warning from the Queen line, so I might actually stock up on these just in case.</li>
            <li> It adds a hint of natural looking richness to your highlighted areas.</li>
            <li> I have some Mac powders that are so old</li>
            <li> I place it around the perimeter of my face and it makes it looks so natural</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure it will take me a while to hit pan.</li>
            <li> Lovely bronzer, very reddish brick undertone so be careful, not a true dark brown</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly, and they even threw a little sample eye shadow in there!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it&#x27;s not dark enough and doesn&#x27;t snow up on my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this bronzer, from the Covergirl Queen collection, to any woman of color because sometimes it is hard to find the right shade...</li>
            <li> I have a collection of pinkish, reddish and brownish bronzer//blushes that I had to combine to achieve a blush color I could live with - but alone each was either too red, too pink or too brown and a complete waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> , it never leaves my house, it is always housed in my makeup organizers atop my vanity along with all of my other products and this is the only only that is having this happening.</li>
            <li> No really, this is definitely my go to bronzer</li>
            <li> So long as CG keeps making this, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy it, the bronzer is a grey tone</li>
            <li> Its not too dark where it look fake yet dark enough to do its magic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use for face contouring, but the color is not saturated enough on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Beautifully subtle and soft contouring was acheived by a relative makeup novice.............</li>
            <li> and I find the tone a little to red for me.</li>
            <li> Way darker in person than I expected.</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> and shes Asian with pale skin and</li>
            <li> and I want to try other products</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve done that before--&amp;#34;d&#x27;oh&amp;#34;), how it gets dark, rough, and difficult to lift with a brush</li>
            <li> Use a big fluffy brush when applying it so you can deposit the color a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> As expected since already previously owned it.</li>
            <li> Consider myself to be medium dark, bronze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too dark, but I knew that when I ordered &amp; I ordered it for contour.</li>
            <li> but this one is way to dark?</li>
            <li> Makes me look orange is way too dark.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up that well on dark skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dark caramel skin but in the winter I admit it may be less caramel .</li>
            <li> I would NOT use this as a face powder or as a typical bronzer.</li>
            <li> It is beginning to dry out in the middle making it crumble &amp; difficult to use.</li>
            <li> dont waste money on mac</li>
            <li> short of a year) and the poor quality is showing.</li>
            <li> Now, I wear this just about everyday to contour my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a VERY slight hint of shimmer, but nothing noticeable to anyone else.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to find the Queen collection locally</li>
            <li> Unfortunately since it does not seem to last</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cute</li>
            <li> When I want that dramatic Kim K. type of contour use the Black Opal foundation stick in Black Walnut, buff that out some</li>
            <li> You can build it up a little for drama or keep it subtle.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is hard</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the product being too shimmery</li>
            <li> Hands down!!!</li>
            <li> This was the missing piece to my face and makeup kit!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no glitter effect, but a subtle bronzing.</li>
            <li> I do as well at times, but this stuff is so subtle for my NW45 skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way less expensive any way!</li>
            <li> I probably shouldn&#x27;t be using any longer but even those don&#x27;t have this issue, so at not even a year I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong with this collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry</li>
            <li> and I must say, being on the bandwagon doesn&#x27;t feel bad.  </li>
            <li> its too bad</li>
            <li> anything bad happens looooveeeee this bronzer!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Rich color, very warm dark brown. Contains glitter. Glitter DOES transfer.</li>
            <li> As expected since already previously owned it. Just love the simply beautiful addition this bronzer makes on my make up, not too dark not too light, just right.</li>
            <li> This has been touted as one of the best bronzers for brown girls (and really is) but realistically can be used on any tone dependent upon how heavy of hand is used when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use this to contour and its effective on my NW47 skin without looking unnatural. Goes on smooth, stays on all day and the compact lasts forever. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s difficult to find the Queen collection locally but Amazon has a pretty reasonable price point. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love it I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores! I will buy it again !</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bronzer. It just make me glow</li>
            <li> You really couldn&#x27;t see any bronze it acted more like a powder foundation</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m nw45 in mac. The bronzer is nice, it shows up really good only when I highlight my face. So if you are darker than nw45 it may not be visible as it is not very deep in color.</li>
            <li> Really suitable  for my complexion. Consider myself to be medium dark, bronze. Not too shimmery or glittery on the skin. Nice glow.</li>
            <li> Love using it for contouring!!!</li>
            <li> Its a great product I use it to bronze my face on light make up days or to contour for more dramatic nights or special events.  I cant complain! So far, so good!</li>
            <li> great color and gives a nice glow too</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.  It is my every day go to.</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for a bronzer that shows up on my reddish caramel complexion. This does not contain a mountain of glitter and shows up on African-American skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product to contour my face, especially cheeks and nose. Its not too dark where it look fake yet dark enough to do its magic.  Have to use the right brush to pick up a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer I recommend to any woman of color. I&#x27;m new to makeup and I want to try other products but this won&#x27;t let me because I love it so much so what&#x27;s the point of buying more expensive stuff when you have something great like this and I bought a back up!</li>
            <li> I love this Bronzer. Great for medium to dark skin tones. Use a big fluffy brush when applying it so you can deposit the color a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I did not believe the you tubers when they said that it was a brilliant contouring powder on dark skin but it really is. Beautifully subtle and soft contouring was acheived by a relative makeup novice.............me!</li>
            <li> This is a must for women if color:) I am telling you ....you can not go wrong with this collection. It provides a flawless coverage I am blown away by the result. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This bronzed absolutely lives up to the hype! It is very pigmented, easy to apply and the color is absolutely stunning on my skin! It has a some sparkle to it but still works beautifully as a contour powder. I suggest you by 3: One for your vanity, one for your makeup bag and a backup just in case your friend wants to try it! This is officially a staple of my makeup collection and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!</li>
            <li> I love how this bronzer looks on my skin! I have tan/olive skin with warm undertone and this ebony color is amazing! A little goes a long way, so I&#x27;m sure it will take me a while to hit pan. The pigmentation is suburb, it has no crazy smell, and I love how it has a hint of shimmer. I definitely recommend this bronzer, from the Covergirl Queen collection, to any woman of color because sometimes it is hard to find the right shade...I bet you this collection has the right shade for you.</li>
            <li> great product. would totally recommend~~~~ same quality as mac bronzer!... dont waste money on mac this is the best... t</li>
            <li> Lovely bronzer, very reddish brick undertone so be careful, not a true dark brown like I was hoping for.great eyeshadow colour too. Blends beautifully And great price point too. Get this. U won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> Great for a drugstore brand! It gives my skin a nice pop of color. I used to use the discontinued MAC Deeper Refined Bronze and this substitute will have to do. It&#x27;s way less expensive any way!</li>
            <li> I am a NW45 with Mac costmetics and I use this products to contoring and it looks amazing .</li>
            <li> i was watching youtube videos on contouring and ordered this bronzer&lt;br /&gt;it turned out to become very handy&lt;br /&gt;am loving it</li>
            <li> Nice. But I am light skinned and I find the tone a little to red for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect ! This gives me a beautiful flawless finish !</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product to see what all the hype was about and I must say, being on the bandwagon doesn&#x27;t feel bad.  I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It&#x27;s a very nice product.  I use mine for contouring.  Some have complained about the product being too shimmery but I didn&#x27;t have that experience.  There is some shimmer but nothing that deters me from using it.</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer. This is my first and I can see why people love it. It adds a hint of natural looking richness to your highlighted areas. It shows up great in pictures.</li>
            <li> Omg I&#x27;m so in love with this product I ordered it and it came two days later, along with that I&#x27;m a caramel colored girl so this adds a nice sun kissed looked to my skin and can also be used for contouring I love it so much</li>
            <li> Update (5/30/16): I&#x27;ve had this product almost 1yr (about 20days short of a year) and the poor quality is showing. It is beginning to dry out in the middle making it crumble &amp; difficult to use. It almost looks like what happens if you drop water in a makeup powder pan (i&#x27;ve done that before--&amp;#34;d&#x27;oh&amp;#34;), how it gets dark, rough, and difficult to lift with a brush but that&#x27;s not the case here. I haven&#x27;t hit pan yet (the metal pan it sits on isn&#x27;t showing), it never leaves my house, it is always housed in my makeup organizers atop my vanity along with all of my other products and this is the only only that is having this happening. My other makeup products are higher end Fashion Fair, Mac (lots of mac), Urban Decay, Smashbox, etc. I have some Mac powders that are so old I probably shouldn&#x27;t be using any longer but even those don&#x27;t have this issue, so at not even a year I&#x27;m a little disappointed. However considering the cost, I still say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and just use a sponge and a little more effort to lift and apply. Unfortunately since it does not seem to last I probably would not buy it again.  This is great for contouring. I use it over my cream foundation stick (that I contour with) to give a softer appearance in the daytime, around the bridge of my nose, and perimeter of my face. I&#x27;m a MAC nw45 and this is a great contour shade. You can build it up a little for drama or keep it subtle. There&#x27;s no glitter effect, but a subtle bronzing. I would NOT use this as a face powder or as a typical bronzer. It&#x27;s just too dark, but I knew that when I ordered &amp; I ordered it for contour.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole highlighting and contouring routine so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money trying something that I wasn&#x27;t sure about. Not only is this product inexpensive, but it works well and looks great on my dark complexion.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I thought Ebony bronze would be great for me but unfortunately it&#x27;s not dark enough and doesn&#x27;t snow up on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Not as dark as I would like but overall product is great.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It&#x27;s a great shade for women of color. I use this bronzed to contour my cheeks. It was kind of hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this much as I thought I would but it is okay I need to experiment with it further.</li>
            <li> Great product and &amp;#34;the price was right.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good color for my skin type!</li>
            <li> This covergirl bronzer is a breathtaker, I love it when I use it to contour. Is a must have every one that loves makeup needs to keep in her makeup box.</li>
            <li> Color was a good choice for my pecan complexion and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry Cover Girl but this one is way to dark? Makes me look orange is way too dark.</li>
            <li> What can i say, the queen collection works for my African American skin so perfectly.  its too bad I can only find this brand online and not in the stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing&lt;br /&gt;I love it&lt;br /&gt;The color on my skin tone</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great price, came lightning fast, packaged well, very easy to build and PERFECT FOR CONTOURING:)</li>
            <li> I have a collection of pinkish, reddish and brownish bronzer//blushes that I had to combine to achieve a blush color I could live with - but alone each was either too red, too pink or too brown and a complete waste of my money.  Finally with the Queen Collection Ebony Bronze #120 I can throw everything else away because this is the perfect shade on my med-bronze skin - a little goes a long way and the look is natural and enhances my skin tone perfectly plus it looks great on me.  Thanks a million Queen!</li>
            <li> Boy do I loveeee this!!!!!! This was the missing piece to my face and makeup kit!! I promise you need this in your collection of makeup goodies!</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for dark skin. I couldn&#x27;t see it at first so I kept putting on more, don&#x27;t do this. I looked in a mirror during the day and it was very visible. Just a little is necessary for a great contoured look.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....really enjoy how it shows up on my skin</li>
            <li> I have dark caramel skin but in the winter I admit it may be less caramel . Way darker in person than I expected. I&#x27;m also mixed so if you are not caramel at all but true dark skinned girl this would be perfect for you the shimmer is very pretty just too dark maybe I can wear it in the summer.</li>
            <li> It great . I love the fact that this is for me darker skin Afican American. because it is rare but it would  work for all skin tone actually.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was shipped quickly, and they even threw a little sample eye shadow in there! That was greatly appreciated. I will definitely be ordering again ;)</li>
            <li> Nice color match...goes on smooth</li>
            <li> Great bronzer! Looks wonderful on my skin. Appreciated the fact that it is fairly inexpensive. I would recommend for women of color.</li>
            <li> Just what i want and what i thought it would be. great price!!!! it gives my skin an extra glow. i will be buying again soon.</li>
            <li> love it, will always buy</li>
            <li> Great coverage with the right, dense brush. There&#x27;s a VERY slight hint of shimmer, but nothing noticeable to anyone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bronzer as an all over powder and I absolutely love it. It gives me such a beautiful glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or caked on. I can use just this without foundation and it evens out my complexion. Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutley amazing!!! Hands down!!! I heard of this product through someone named ColoredBeautiful on Youtube and she uses it as a blusher. I am a brown skin Afro-American woman and when I tell you this bronzer makes my skin look flawless - whoo!!! If only you knew!!! Lol...No really, this is definitely my go to bronzer/blusher especially when I am wearing bold color eyeshadows and don&#x27;t want anything to bold on the cheeks. This is also amazing for natural on-the-go looks. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!!!!</li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.  It warms up your face and goes on really nice.  This color ebony is really good for African american women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing bronzer and really good for contouring. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this bronzer!!!!!!! Didnt get what everyone was talking about when they&#x27;d use it on the YT, but NOW I do! Its so worth the hype. I know theres some people who love a super dramatic contour. I do as well at times, but this stuff is so subtle for my NW45 skin. It blends in like a dream and look so natural! I find it best for those days at the office when I want to give my face dimension without looking overly made up. I even use it as a shadow in my crease for a neutral office look. Adds the perfect amount of warmth. So long as CG keeps making this, I will continue to buy it. Im VERY aware of how CG will suddenly pull products without warning from the Queen line, so I might actually stock up on these just in case.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Apply to cheek area over foundation  and you will have an instant glow!</li>
            <li> Heard about this product and yes I see reason for the hype. Can be used to contour or as a blush. Love. Well pigmented</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t show up that well on dark skin.  I bought this to use for face contouring, but the color is not saturated enough on dark skin.</li>
            <li> Yessssssss this bronzer gave me my lifeeee its very easy to use not messy at all..i couldn&#x27;t find this bronzer at no wal-mart no drugs stores. But i knew amazon would have it..THANKS</li>
            <li> I really love this product! Definitely would recommend this to anyone especially if your African American. I have used it as a bronzer and a contour.</li>
            <li> Perfect bronzer if your new to highlighting and contouring or if you just want a Nice glow after you applied your base makeup i would really recommend this for women of color but my bestfriend used it too and shes Asian with pale skin and the contour looked beautiful so this product is universal and fantastic. I really wish it was in my near by stores but that&#x27;s ok!</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a contour. it is wonderful! it looks amazing against a highlight. that is all.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing.  Contouring with this bronzer fits my skin tone very well. I am a brown skin African American with yellow undertone in my skin.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer for most WOC! Will always repurchase! Works well in contrast with Ben nye banana powder. Warning if you are deep brown contour first then use this as a bronzer if you are medium to light you can use it by itself</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it 5 stars I touched the screen and I don&#x27;t know what happened I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is a very warm tone so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear. It is literally a holy grail product i&#x27;m not even kidding i have ordered 2 backups and im going to get another 10! just incase anything bad happens looooveeeee this bronzer!!! also it is way better than sleek if you are plannign to get sleek don&#x27;t buy it, the bronzer is a grey tone it&#x27;s not cute this bronzer is a warmer shade wearas sleek is cool</li>
            <li> I love the bronzy look on my face...I use it to contour with. most girls on youthube use it for that same purpose. Its really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer gives me a nice glow! I place it around the perimeter of my face and it makes it looks so natural</li>
            <li> Great for women of color! I&#x27;m NC45 in MAC but I love using this to bronze my face. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying over a $40 bronzer.</li>
            <li> i love it, especially for contouring it gives me a really summer bronze look :)</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer! I am using it in the winter and it compliments my make up perfectly. The price is perfect and I found it to be cheaper to buy on Amazon. I can&#x27;t wait to use this in the summer!!!!!</li>
            <li> beautiful color, texture and the price point makes this an affordable product for everyone. This color works perfect for me-I&#x27;m a deep cocoa complexion and this makes me glow! Love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this! Goes on amazingly on my nc45 skin.will repurchase over abd over again</li>
            <li> I could not find this at my local drugstore the price is right. This bronzer is hard I find myself scrapping it to get a good amount on my brush. Still love it</li>
            <li> This bronzer adds the perfect glow to my skin and I love it.  I did find that oils tend to collect on top and I have to scape the top of the product off to get it on my brush but I find that issue even with high end powders.  This is definitely my go to bronzing/contouring powder.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is great for my skin! I am a dark skinned women and it is great for contouring it really slims my nose and brings out my cheekbones</li>
            <li> I didnt think this was going to be this good. I really loved it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on YouTube and since it was very inexpensive and I&amp;#34;m just learning how to contour, I decided to try it. Now, I wear this just about everyday to contour my cheeks and nose. By itself, it makes for a nice daily contour in that it&#x27;s subtle yet noticeable but not exactly an over-the-top &amp;#34;beat face&amp;#34; effect. When I want that dramatic Kim K. type of contour use the Black Opal foundation stick in Black Walnut, buff that out some and then put this on top to set it- wayyyyyy more dramatic effect. Flawless!!!!! Here is a picture of me with the bronzer by itself (no Black Opal foundation stick underneath)...</li>
            <li> Package was opened when I recieved it ?! Ugh !!!</li>
