            <li>What a great product!</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is the best spray on toner (as opposed to the type that you swab onto your face with a cotton ball to remove any traces of makeup or soap residue).</li>
            <li>It feels and smells wonderful as you spray it on.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it smells!!!</li>

            <li>and this line is great for me.</li>
            <li>It works great with the cleansing milk or cleansing cream.</li>
            <li>This falls in the GREAT category.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>And I found it at a great price here...</li>
            <li>I read a lot of great reviews</li>
            <li>They feel great on the skin and are made with good ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use this after cleaning my face with an Olay Pro-X scrubber and exfoliating cleanser (Dr. H&#x27;s exfoliating cleaner is also good) and follow-up with either the Dr. H Quince cream or the Clinique \\&quot;Even Better\\&quot; cream.</li>
            <li>This is a good toner.</li>
            <li>That should tell you how good it is.</li>
            <li>and I put Normalizing day oil over it which smells good in of itself.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Dr. Hauschka makes great products and I love ever one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Hauschka products!</li>
            <li>Will buy for sure!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>so your skin really absorbs all the wonderful things in the toner.  </li>
            <li>I love this toner.  </li>
            <li>And I have to give all the credit to this wonderful product, because it&#x27;s the only thing in my routine that I&#x27;ve changed.</li>
            <li>Priced lower than dept store products and better for u</li>
            <li>This is one of my top 5.</li>
            <li>I feel so confident now.</li>
            <li>I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>A million times better than all of those toxic toners too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this Dr Hauschka clarifying toner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and does a great job of balancing my skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that this product is in a spray bottle because it goes further, however it just doesn&#x27;t smell that great...</li>
            <li>In general, the Hauschka toner is a great product.  </li>
            <li>so having the alcohol in this product is fine for me.</li>
            <li>great for your skin and easy to put on fast in the morning when getting ready.</li>
            <li>This really is the most refreshing product I have ever used on my face</li>
            <li>I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this, but I was VERY pleasantly suprised!</li>
            <li>I got used to it after a couple of days, but again I really liked the smell of the Facial Toner better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as pleasant as the Facial Toner.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these products are fabulous for me!!</li>
            <li>Not a bad product though.</li>
            <li>Too mild for my combo skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different toners and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This really freshens, hydrates, tones, helps to tighten pores and keep hour skin balanced and free from oils/congestion.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t like kissing me with this stuff on my face full force ;-)</li>
            <li>Light cream, skin can breathe.u skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried toners without alcohol, but this one is far better.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This clarifying toner tightened my pores right up, and suppressed break-outs.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Second, the scent is very strong and herbal.</li>
            <li>My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I think it contains a little bit of alcohol, which is a good thing for oily skin.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m here today to buy my second bottle.</li>
            <li>This definitely made my face seem 10x more clearer.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the starter or travel set to use the products first.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like the first step in the moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I grew up under a certain school of thinking: it doesn&#x27;t work unless it hurts.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with normal-to-oily, oily or very oily skin.    </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t like how pungent it really was.</li>
            <li>Its pricey for a toner, but I consider it a necessary extravagance/investment in my sound health and appearance.  </li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s pricey but it lasts a long time and it leaves skin smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li>I got a set of Dr. Hauschka facial skin care products as a Christmas present and fell in love with the line.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help clear my blackheads or clogged pores for the price tag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and does clear your skin out.</li>
            <li>combination of oily T-Zone and dry elsewhere, adult acne, now fighting both wrinkles and breakouts at the same time; plus I am allergic and chemically sensitive to many cosmetics and skin care products.</li>
            <li>My skin has been clear for months!</li>
            <li>It has also helped clear up my skin and make it look healthier!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to point to any toner as the reason for my clearing skin, but I don&#x27;t find toner a hassle in the skin care routine</li>
            <li>I had to let the smell air out for a while before going near my hubby.</li>
            <li>I used the same product from a smaller sample bottle and it smelled fantastic, so maybe in smaller concentrations (as a mist)</li>
            <li>this is natural cosmetics&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two months, I have most definitely noticed a difference in my normal-to-oily skin after using this day and night.</li>
            <li>My skin is not only almost blemish-free, but it&#x27;s so so soft too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff (and the empty first bottle I saved to used for my organic apple cider vinegar &amp; lemon DIY toner).</li>
            <li>I think this would be great for oily skin, but I have dry skin and this dried it out even worse.</li>
            <li>I typically do not take the time to write a review unless something is exceptionally good or bad.  </li>

            <li> this thing has made my skin so rough and has caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> Other toners don&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other toners that burned and felt like a chemical peel because &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; was drilled into me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down to half of a bottle left, not too bad and it was worth all the money!</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will spray this on and pat it down with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s too expensive!</li>
            <li> I press just a bit of this toner into my skin after cleansing (I don&#x27;t even waste a cotton ball -- just spray into my hand &amp; apply with fingers).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be too harsh on your face!</li>
            <li> The one complaint I have is the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong -</li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed this time.  </li>
            <li> Got the set for &amp;#34;impure skin&amp;#34; for my daughter, who was taking antibiotics for her acne (VERY BAD IDEA)  </li>
            <li> Horrible scent.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this toner.  The cheapest I have found it anywhere</li>
            <li> Very Very good service.  The products were described as ad.  It also had  a long expired date.  Thank you so much. I will purchase  from you again in the future.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I recently reluctantly switched from stealing my mom&#x27;s (this is actually Katy C. Ameglio&#x27;s daughter) Facial Toner to this, because my skin is oily. I was reluctant to switch because the Facial Toner worked so well for me. But since I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two months, I have most definitely noticed a difference in my normal-to-oily skin after using this day and night. My skin is not only almost blemish-free, but it&#x27;s so so soft too! And I have to give all the credit to this wonderful product, because it&#x27;s the only thing in my routine that I&#x27;ve changed. It&#x27;s not too drying when I use it at night without a moisturizer (like Dr. Hauschka recommends). The one complaint I have is the smell of the product. It&#x27;s not as pleasant as the Facial Toner. This may be a matter of personal preference. I got used to it after a couple of days, but again I really liked the smell of the Facial Toner better. But hey, what&#x27;s a little smell when it comes with such glorious results? :) I&#x27;m here today to buy my second bottle. I would recommend this to anyone with normal-to-oily, oily or very oily skin.    -Daughter of Katy C. Ameglio</li>
            <li> I press just a bit of this toner into my skin after cleansing (I don&#x27;t even waste a cotton ball -- just spray into my hand &amp; apply with fingers).  My skin has been clear for months!</li>
            <li> Dr. Hauschka makes great products and I love ever one I&#x27;ve used.  I have sensitive skin and these products are fabulous for me!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I noticed a night and day difference in my skin.  Love Dr. Hauschka products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by acne ever since I went through puberty, this works wonders. I like to spray this on my face twice daily before putting on some serum and moisturizer. This definitely made my face seem 10x more clearer. Once in a while I will spray this on and pat it down with a cotton pad. Don&#x27;t be too harsh on your face! I&#x27;ve had this for about 5 months now and I&#x27;m down to half of a bottle left, not too bad and it was worth all the money!</li>
            <li> this thing has made my skin so rough and has caused breakouts. never again will i use this.</li>
            <li> This is a great products from a great line of products. It works great and is not sticky like some toners. I have really oily skin and this line is great for me. I recommended it. To test the line for you I recommend getting the starter or travel set to use the products first.</li>
            <li> I got a set of Dr. Hauschka facial skin care products as a Christmas present and fell in love with the line. I have always had problem skin: combination of oily T-Zone and dry elsewhere, adult acne, now fighting both wrinkles and breakouts at the same time; plus I am allergic and chemically sensitive to many cosmetics and skin care products. I find that I can tolerate Dr. Hauschka products without reacting. This clarifying toner tightened my pores right up, and suppressed break-outs. I noticed a difference when I briefly stopped using the product. I wish there was a cheaper alternative, but I haven&#x27;t found one, and I looked. Other toners don&#x27;t do the trick. I use this after cleaning my face with an Olay Pro-X scrubber and exfoliating cleanser (Dr. H&#x27;s exfoliating cleaner is also good) and follow-up with either the Dr. H Quince cream or the Clinique \\&quot;Even Better\\&quot; cream. Best skin I have had in years.</li>
            <li> This is a good toner. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I have two problems with it though that made me decide not to re-purchase. First, it&#x27;s too expensive! You can find similar products out there for a fraction of its cost. Second, the scent is very strong and herbal. While I understand it&#x27;s a plant based product and therefore it smells as such, I didn&#x27;t like how pungent it really was. I had to let the smell air out for a while before going near my hubby. He didn&#x27;t like kissing me with this stuff on my face full force ;-)</li>
            <li> Horrible scent. Smells like tomato sauce.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful toner. Have been using it for the last 25 years. That should tell you how good it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this product is in a spray bottle because it goes further, however it just doesn&#x27;t smell that great... I used the same product from a smaller sample bottle and it smelled fantastic, so maybe in smaller concentrations (as a mist) it&#x27;s different. Meh. It still does the trick and I put Normalizing day oil over it which smells good in of itself. Not a bad product though.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Light cream, skin can breathe.u skin feels smooth and soft. Priced lower than dept store products and better for u</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big believer in Dr. Hauschka products. Been using them for years. They feel great on the skin and are made with good ingredients.</li>
            <li> When I feel/see a red bump, A.K.A potential zit, coming on, I nuke it with this.  Next day, bump is gone.    I also used this and mix it w/the Dr. H&#x27;s face oil to make it easier to apply to the face.</li>
            <li> I use several of Dr. Hauschka&#x27;s products. This is one of my top 5. It works great with the cleansing milk or cleansing cream.</li>
            <li> this toner is of the highest quality and purity.  I like the way it is applied by spraying onto the skin.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this, but I was VERY pleasantly suprised! This really is the most refreshing product I have ever used on my face and I love how it smells!!! It has also helped clear up my skin and make it look healthier! I use this with Dr. Hauschka cleansing milk and normalizing day oil. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001V9LUR6 Dr. Hauschka Clarifying Toner, 3.4-Ounce Box]][[ASIN:B001V9LULM Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil, 1.0-Ounce Box]]I use Dr. Hauschka Clarifying toner every day and it helps to keep my skin balanced. I had oily skin and rosacea, but since I started using this product along with Dr. Hauschka normalizing day oil my skin improved a lot. It looks healthy and beautiful. I feel so confident now. Thank you, Dr. Hauschka!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff (and the empty first bottle I saved to used for my organic apple cider vinegar &amp; lemon DIY toner). I have oily skin so having the alcohol in this product is fine for me. I find it refreshing. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever be able to point to any toner as the reason for my clearing skin, but I don&#x27;t find toner a hassle in the skin care routine and I do think it helps balance my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife is like it very much in two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- it is perfectly suited to her&lt;br /&gt;- this is natural cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in germany quality</li>
            <li> I think this would be great for oily skin, but I have dry skin and this dried it out even worse. It contains alot of alcohol.</li>
            <li> Too mild for my combo skin. Didn&#x27;t really help clear my blackheads or clogged pores for the price tag. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different toners and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s natural and does a great job of balancing my skin after cleansing.  It says just to spray on but I actually use it with a cotton ball at night after I cleanse to remove any leftover dirt or makeup.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and works wonderfully.  My siblings are now using this because of me.</li>
            <li> I typically do not take the time to write a review unless something is exceptionally good or bad.  This falls in the GREAT category.  You spritz on your face and press into the skin so your skin really absorbs all the wonderful things in the toner.  It almost feels like the first step in the moisturizing.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> great for your skin and easy to put on fast in the morning when getting ready. highly recommended for everyone.</li>
            <li> I grew up under a certain school of thinking: it doesn&#x27;t work unless it hurts. I&#x27;ve used other toners that burned and felt like a chemical peel because &amp;#34;no pain, no gain&amp;#34; was drilled into me for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Dr. Hauschka Clarifying Toner. Why? Because I had tried the cleanser and was amazed. I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong - and I was right. The thing actually works! A million times better than all of those toxic toners too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Yes it&#x27;s pricey but it lasts a long time and it leaves skin smooth and radiant.</li>
            <li> Best toner for combination skin! I think it contains a little bit of alcohol, which is a good thing for oily skin. I have tried toners without alcohol, but this one is far better. It&#x27;s gentle and does clear your skin out. Will buy for sure!</li>
            <li> Great product. Hauschka is wonderful for problem skin. Got the set for &amp;#34;impure skin&amp;#34; for my daughter, who was taking antibiotics for her acne (VERY BAD IDEA)  and she dropped the anti biotics and her skin has been great every since. Then started my teenage son on the same regimen, and he never got acne.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it for a couple of years now and my face looks great!</li>
            <li> Disappointed this time.  Have used this product for several years, but this last bottle smells odd.  Tried to return it, but cannot.  Am wondering if this is either an expired product or even a counterfeit.  In general, the Hauschka toner is a great product.  Won&#x27;t order it on-line again.</li>
            <li> What a great product! It is worth the price.  However, I found this company to have the fairest prices for Dr Hauschka&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I love this Dr Hauschka clarifying toner.  In my opinion it is the best spray on toner (as opposed to the type that you swab onto your face with a cotton ball to remove any traces of makeup or soap residue). This really freshens, hydrates, tones, helps to tighten pores and keep hour skin balanced and free from oils/congestion.  It feels and smells wonderful as you spray it on.  Its pricey for a toner, but I consider it a necessary extravagance/investment in my sound health and appearance.  And I found it at a great price here...and I&#x27;m grateful for it.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my skin. I read a lot of great reviews but it did nothing to help. I tried it for 4 months with no luck. I know everyone is different so this may work for you.</li>
