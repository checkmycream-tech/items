            <li>It is a nice clean scent that I enjoy very much.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having this scent in my collection of colognes.  </li>
            <li>I would describe the sent as very fresh and clean, on the lighter side but defiantly has a manly aroma.</li>

            <li>Nothing special about this perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells great, however I am a very acne prone individual and when using this, the point of application quickly develops rampaging acne.</li>
            <li>- Average price on Amazon, I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a great discount, but its the correct product!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I like this one a lot more than the Beckham because the scent lasts pretty much all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sort of a fresh, soapy scent I guess....</li>

            <li> It smells great, however I am a very acne prone individual and when using this, the point of application quickly develops rampaging acne. Now I am full of scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the scent is great, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a classic scent.  Clean scent with a little sweetness.  Can be worn during the day or night.  Great price and value.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having this scent in my collection of colognes.  It is a nice clean scent that I enjoy very much.</li>
            <li> The title of this review pretty much sums up what I think of it.  It&#x27;s effing amazing.  I wore this on me and my fiancee&#x27;s first date.  Notice how she&#x27;s my fiancee now.  Trust me guys the ladies will be all over you with this stuff. GET IT!!</li>
            <li> Perfect price for size. Only problem was my fault. I ordered wrong cologne!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this just nose, but this product seems diluted so much that there is no particular fragrance smell left.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother who was looking to find a cologne that he liked.  I haven&#x27;t smelled this, but he says that he likes it and would keep buying it.  If you know that you want to wear this fragrance, then you don&#x27;t want to buy the 1 ounce bottle.  For twice the price you can get nearly three and a half times as much elsewhere on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very lovely smell. One of the few perfumes that lasts very long on me. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> smells great love this bought this for my husband for his birthday and I love this scent. Can&#x27;t say more its good</li>
            <li> Its a decent cologne but not as I expected. Based on too many reviews I ordered this for my husband on his birthday. I is ok, not great cologne as I said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the smell of this.  It&#x27;s not my personal best, but it&#x27;s not bad at all either.  Sort of a fresh, soapy scent I guess....I would recommend for self or as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne available for the price.  I have been using it for years and glad to see it available on Amazon as it is getting hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes, and I&#x27;ve been wearing it off and on for the last ten years. I tend to switch between this and David Beckham&#x27;s flagship cologne. I like this one a lot more than the Beckham because the scent lasts pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a fruity scent with hints of spice and cinnamon, and my wife says it smells great -- and her opinion is gold to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, try it out, it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but still one of my go-to&#x27;s. You won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
            <li> Refreshing cologne.  Would recommend this cologne for someone who does not want an overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I could pick up my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne here and for such a great price as well!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this cologne in the 8th grade and wanted to buy some still smells great I always wear when I out on the town.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to try and he loved it. I would describe the sent as very fresh and clean, on the lighter side but defiantly has a manly aroma. Also, it was a great deal! Shipped quickly,without problems and was a great price.</li>
            <li> I use to were this stuff in High School and I still love it.  Saw a good price for it and Im glad I got some more.</li>
            <li> I only gotten a couple compliments off this cologne. I still like it tho.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this perfume.</li>
            <li> - Average price on Amazon, I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a great discount, but its the correct product!&lt;br /&gt;- Been wearing Tommy cologne for a couple years&lt;br /&gt;- Not too strong, just enough of a fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;d try it at the store in person before ordering considering the price&lt;br /&gt;- Larger bottle is a better value</li>
            <li> this was a xmas gift for my brother the cologne king. He is very happy with the product &amp; I with the price</li>
