            <li>Said it looks like it cost alot more than it did.</li>
            <li>may stay better on thicker hair.</li>

            <li>It is a lovely comb and made very well.  </li>
            <li>I got Married on June 16 2012!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>The tiara was nice, not too big or gaudy.</li>
            <li>They packaged it very, very well.</li>
            <li>Was shipping very fast and packed well.</li>
            <li>It matched the description exactly.</li>
            <li>This is really pretty</li>
            <li>In dark hair it will stand out nicely.</li>
            <li>The image makes the tiara look larger than it truly is, but the product dimensions are accurate.</li>
            <li>Looked expensive worth the price  better then the bridal shops that charge 50-200 dollars more</li>
            <li>One thing I found interesting is that the comb is in the center of the tiara instead of on the ends.</li>

            <li>the next time I am shopping for something special.</li>

            <li>I had the same experience as pretty much everyone else.</li>
            <li>It is much smaller that it seems in the picture, i would be aware of this, its a shame because its looks well done</li>
            <li>Note, I used other combs to hold in the French Twist then used this as decoration on top.  </li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and was wrapped so carefully.  </li>
            <li>This piece really made the final touch to the updo on my wedding</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Only one little rhinestone had fallen off when I opened the package, and it was easy to put it back on.</li>
            <li>It does sparkle, but it is small enough and on my head, in dark hair, it had just enough pop to be pretty and eye-catching without looking over the top.</li>

            <li> This comb is very delicate and pretty.  It is somewhat flexible so it can be bent along the hair. It sparkles beautifully..</li>
            <li> Comb was perfect for a French Twist.  Note, I used other combs to hold in the French Twist then used this as decoration on top.  It could not hold all of my thick hair.  But was beautiful for my wedding!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wedding in September, but I haven&#x27;t worn it yet. One thing I found interesting is that the comb is in the center of the tiara instead of on the ends. I&#x27;m hoping it serves the purpose! It looks just like the picture, so you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hello.  I purchased this for my wedding.  It was lovey.  A little smaller then I had hoped.  I wanted it to go in the side. And it would only stay in front.  But it looke good like that so  I was happy!  I got Married on June 16 2012! Lol.  And this comb was $60 Cheaper  then David&#x27;s bridal.  It is smaller but very pretty.  So I was happy!!!</li>

            <li> I was a little worried when ordering that this item would look too \\&quot;bling\\&quot; and not pretty enough for my wedding... But I needn&#x27;t have worried. It does sparkle, but it is small enough and on my head, in dark hair, it had just enough pop to be pretty and eye-catching without looking over the top. Loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I hoped this would be a keepsake from the wedding, but it broke within a few days after the wedding. Good thing I don&#x27;t believe in omens.</li>

            <li> this piece is absolutely gorgeous. I am very pleased with my purchase and I know it will compliment my dress well on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Purchased this tiara for my granddaughter to wear to her senior prom. She loved it. What girl does not want to be a princess for the evening.</li>
            <li> cannot wear as pictured!</li>
            <li> This is really pretty but I mistakenly thought it was going to look like the one they showed in Gwen&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a lot smaller than that one but it is nice.</li>
            <li> Shipping and customer service was excellent.  The comb holds tight. Wish it was just a hair larger, but that is my fault for not looking closer.</li>
            <li> The tiara was nice, not too big or gaudy. I would have liked the finish to look more antiqued but it was sparkly and new. In dark hair it will stand out nicely.</li>
            <li> The bridal comb was beautiful and will go well with the veil I chose for my wedding.  I received the product very promptly and in good order.  I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and selected this hair piece as part of my wedding ensemble.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as pretty much everyone else. The image makes the tiara look larger than it truly is, but the product dimensions are accurate. I really like the tiara. It looks simple and elegant and adds a nice amount of sparkle. The item was packaged carefully, so there were no damages. Also, it&#x27;s very malleable, so you can shape it however you want.</li>
            <li> My daughter wore this on her wedding day two weeks ago. It was beautiful on her and complimented her wedding gown perfectly.  It is a lovely comb and made very well.  I will remember Bling Jewerly the next time I am shopping for something special.</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and was wrapped so carefully.  It was more beautiful than I thought it would be.  It will make for a stunning bride!</li>
            <li> Had no idea how to put it on my head. it was quite small as well. returned</li>
            <li> It shipped out fast. They packaged it very, very well. Only one little rhinestone had fallen off when I opened the package, and it was easy to put it back on. I am extremely excited about wearing this for my wedding in 3 months!</li>
            <li> I bought this for and shipped to a friend in another state for her wedding. So, I haven&#x27;t actually laid hands on it, but she says it&#x27;s beautiful! Perfect for what she wants without being too fancy or tacky-looking. Perfect size. Said it looks like it cost alot more than it did. I&#x27;ll find out more after she actually uses it in a few weeks and will update if there are any negative aspects. But I don&#x27;t expect there to be according to her enthusiasm for it. Was shipping very fast and packed well.</li>
            <li> Pretty comb but doesn&#x27;t hold as well in my thin hair.  Looks great and very nicely made but may stay better on thicker hair.</li>
