            <li>great product, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>(Although it&#x27;s fine without!)</li>
            <li>The stuff we buy at wal-greens or cvs works way better.</li>
            <li>I started adding this to my bath salt mixture and really like it, great for soaking in after a run</li>
            <li>These are fine, but costly for the amount in this bag.</li>
            <li>really good quality, basic mineral salt.</li>
            <li>Their products are top quality, reasonably priced, and a quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>eat this stuff, but one quick taste and you know its endowed with minerals.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>

            <li>This is exactly what I wanted after spending some time hanging out in a salt grotto.</li>
            <li>but it dissolves quickly in hot water.</li>
            <li>This salt was bought to add to my hot tub.  </li>

            <li>very happy,i will buy again</li>
            <li>Quality products, fast delivery and reasonable pricing.  </li>
            <li>Very salty.</li>
            <li>So far this has been the only thing to make any difference other than occasional prescriptions for prednisone  which provided temporary relief at best.</li>
            <li>I was actually itch free last night.</li>
            <li>Bath with this salt makes my skin very soft and tender.</li>
            <li>Definitely felt a difference in my skin after first use.</li>
            <li>I prefer to have only natural ingredients in any of my skincare, hair care etc products and this is the one I really like.</li>
            <li>take bathes with it- natural antifungal</li>
            <li>So far it does seem to be helping.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>This helped me tremendously, relieved my itching and calmed down the inflammation.</li>
            <li>I use these salts a little differently than most: I use them as a facial and scalp scrub.</li>
            <li>I took a bath the other day and it helped my skin so much.</li>

            <li> I took a bath the other day and it helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I tried taking a hammer to a small portion of it, but that didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to plain old Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll mix a small batch at a time using almond or coconut oil, and some essential oils, and then gently massage it into my skin for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this had a bunch of other stuff mixed into the salt</li>
            <li> San Francisco Bath Salt supplies me with various salts including Dead Sea Salt.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea whether it is doing anything or not, as I have only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and the product didn&#x27;t have any weird smell or anything to complain about.  </li>
            <li> The redness is fading and it has become significantly less flaky  and inflamed.</li>
            <li> Take a 20-30 minutes bath with that - your dead skin cells will fall off...</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive bag of Dead Sea salt and happened upon this product.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> No added scents, just course dead sea salt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical or anything, but it does what I need, scrubs me.  </li>
            <li> Use it in the bath at least once a week when I have time for a bath rather than a shower.</li>
            <li> The salt is the size of pebbles, and useless to me.  </li>
            <li> I have been itchy and uncomfortable for weeks because of the withdrawals from the steroid creams I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> They do have a faint scent, but it isn&#x27;t unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Came quickly. Great price!</li>

            <li> Great quality product</li>
            <li> I am using the sea salt in bath water.  I have no idea whether it is doing anything or not, as I have only used it a few times.  The company sent the product in a timely manner and it was just as stated when I purchased it.  Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I have ordered it second time and will order it again. I prefer to have only natural ingredients in any of my skincare, hair care etc products and this is the one I really like. Bath with this salt makes my skin very soft and tender. I would recommend this salt to anyone as it can&#x27;t harm but only benefit.</li>
            <li> I order this periodically, because it helps remove toxins from your body.  It soothes my arthritis, and relaxes me.  Use it in the bath at least once a week when I have time for a bath rather than a shower.</li>
            <li> I use these salts a little differently than most: I use them as a facial and scalp scrub. I&#x27;ll mix a small batch at a time using almond or coconut oil, and some essential oils, and then gently massage it into my skin for a few minutes. The size/texture of the grain is perfection and it always leaves my skin feeling invigorated/glowing, plus (in the case of scalp scrubs) it helps keep the dandruff in check.</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Excellent product.  What else can I say!</li>
            <li> Excellent and prontly service</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all.  The stuff we buy at wal-greens or cvs works way better.</li>
            <li> Wonderful salts.  Very fast delivery.</li>

            <li> Definitely felt a difference in my skin after first use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted after spending some time hanging out in a salt grotto. What can I say about a five pound bag of salt? It was&#x27;t as big as I thought, and I use about a cup at a time. The quality is good--I like the coarse stuff but it dissolves quickly in hot water. I add a drop or two of essential oil to the bath, but I prefer to add it myself rather than get scented salt. (Although it&#x27;s fine without!) I didn&#x27;t think this had a bunch of other stuff mixed into the salt like I saw in a couple reviews. It was pretty clean. I will reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> great product. take bathes with it- natural antifungal</li>
            <li> very happy,i will buy again</li>
            <li> Quality products, fast delivery and reasonable pricing.  It was a nice surprise to receive a free sample of French Grey Salt with my order and I plan to order again soon.</li>
            <li> I needed some bath salts to help with a skin condition I have but I am allergic to perfumes. This is perfect and is helping with itching and peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I have been soaking my hands in a solution of water and 1/2 cup of salt and it has greatly improved psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This salt was bought to add to my hot tub.  It arrived as stated and is working great!</li>
            <li> really good quality, basic mineral salt.</li>
            <li> Very salty. What can I say? It helps me keep my psoriasis in check.&lt;br /&gt;Dont eat this stuff, but one quick taste and you know its endowed with minerals.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff Maynard.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  When they listed coarse salt, I pictured kosher salt which is also called course.  The salt is the size of pebbles, and useless to me.  I tried taking a hammer to a small portion of it, but that didn&#x27;t really work.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good quality salts and good sturdy packaging with zip top.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my psoriasis. So far it does seem to be helping. The redness is fading and it has become significantly less flaky  and inflamed. No added scents, just course dead sea salt. I have used countless prescription cortisone creams and over the counter remedies. None of them seem to do anything to affect it. So far this has been the only thing to make any difference other than occasional prescriptions for prednisone  which provided temporary relief at best.I would recommend  this to anyone dealing with skin issues.</li>
            <li> I am currently going through topical steroid withdrawals for my steroid induced eczema and its been a nightmare for me, yes it&#x27;s a thing. Look it up!! I took a bath the other day and it helped my skin so much. I have been itchy and uncomfortable for weeks because of the withdrawals from the steroid creams I have used over the years. This helped me tremendously, relieved my itching and calmed down the inflammation. I was actually itch free last night. Thank you so much, I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> great product, exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I started adding this to my bath salt mixture and really like it, great for soaking in after a run</li>
