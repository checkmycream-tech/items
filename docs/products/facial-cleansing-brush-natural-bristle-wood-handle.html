            <li>Honest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy in the shower and does a great job!</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>If you use an exfoliant, you&#x27;re basically scraping away the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>the scrubbing is more beneficial than any cream could be.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Great brush that is not harsh on my face.</li>
            <li>easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Perfect facial brush, it has just the right feel and stiffness.  </li>
            <li>Best little face brush around.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after brushing, it has really made a nice difference in my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>the bristles are firm but not too scratchy,  Perfect for my face.</li>
            <li>Brush it lightly before you shower, and whatever you do, don&#x27;t use soap to wash your face...just rinse it.</li>
            <li>Even with an extremely light touch.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this facial brush!</li>
            <li>Works great for dry brushing my face every morning!</li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>Overall its a good investment</li>
            <li>Well first of all, you can brush lightly.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and care for, though I would buy a new one every six months for the sake of cleanliness.</li>
            <li>I liked it because is not soft and can clean my pores in</li>
            <li>I have used it for a few months and it is still doing great.</li>
            <li>I brush my face almost every day and have used it both wet and dry; either way, I get excellent results.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great for that -- exactly what I wanted: a good stiff brushing with a small brush.</li>
            <li>Love this facial brush!</li>
            <li>Not recommended using it as a facial brush much better for foot brush but not to your face.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates my skin, leaving it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Second, most beauty routines are much harsher than a bit of brushing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, but not on any kind of consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of dry brushing my face with this brush, I noticed my skin looked great -- pores were almost invisible, skin was fresh and glowing.</li>
            <li>You gently brush your face.</li>
            <li>It is very well made but I was hoping for a stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li>; doesn&#x27;t mean it is good for you.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin which I exfoliate using many other methods, none of which hurt and redden the skin like this</li>
            <li>Not only have the bristles stayed in place, the entire brush is solid and well made -- a good quality</li>
            <li>the product is fine - I found a natural bristle with a bigger head and a longer handle -</li>
            <li>Love this little brush.</li>
            <li>skin is very soft and that&#x60;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always had excessively large pores on my face, especially my nose.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve also tried using a dry Buff-Puff Sensitive in the same manner: It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and its flexibility seems to make it a little more practical.</li>
            <li>Some bristles fall out, but nothing major.</li>
            <li>Apparently &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li>(This is my general standard for all personal bath care items including luffas, back scrubbers, sponges, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;It may feel a little rough at first but just put a little soap and water on it and&lt;br /&gt;rub</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really unpleasant on the skin and my skin is to the point where it&#x27;s starting to thin.  </li>
            <li> I use to dry brush daily.</li>
            <li> I always rinse the dead skin cells off with water afterwards and my face always feels so soft.</li>
            <li> It has helped the dry skin on my nose.</li>
            <li> I use it as a dry brush before cleansing my face</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for dry brushing my neck, not my face.</li>
            <li> It works, just need to let it dry out.</li>
            <li> I tried to used it for at least 2 weeks trying to get use to it, but it is too rough on my face even when I gently rub it into my face.</li>
            <li> Brushing is actually less harsh than what folks normally do to their face.</li>
            <li> So maybe leave it on the bathroom sink to dry if not it stays wet</li>
            <li> No, the bristles are not too rough as some reviewers have claimed.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel a teeny bit harsh to me; even if I brush lightly, it&#x27;s hard to get them into the crevices on the sides of my nose (where I was really hoping to see improvement to my pores) without having to push hard enough to hurt.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t prove that the change is due to brushing</li>
            <li> Try the Olay, Clarsonic or other rotating brush instead with some Murad exfoliating cleanser, or any cleanser for that matter.  </li>
            <li> My face is briefly a little red after using it, but i also apply some pressure and go over areas a few times.  </li>
            <li> Not to soft or hard!</li>
            <li> I have a Bass body brush</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get used to using a firm brush on one&#x27;s face</li>
            <li> I got tough italian skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, but not too firm.  </li>
            <li> use it, gets the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> the way I keep.&lt;br /&gt;I need to buy another one, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Wasted money.  </li>
            <li> few reviewers seemed worried about using a stiff brush on the face.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to press down hard.</li>
            <li> If you steam your pores, you&#x27;re traumatizing your skin with excessive heat.</li>
            <li> It is very stiff and damaging.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product because it is very harsh on one&#x27;s face and poor quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the face brush to keep by my sink for washing my face at night, but in less than a week of use it started shedding bristles like crazy.</li>
            <li> I am extremely annoyed by the misleading &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> skip the expensive creams and use a brush like this .</li>
            <li> awful brush.  </li>

            <li> Love this facial brush!</li>
            <li> Great face brush. Also makes a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Great brush that is not harsh on my face. It has helped the dry skin on my nose. Takes no time to use. I use it as a dry brush before cleansing my face</li>
            <li> Love this little brush. the bristles are firm but not too scratchy,  Perfect for my face. My skin feels so smooth after brushing, it has really made a nice difference in my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Ive noticed my skin clearing up. Not for sensitive skin though. I got tough italian skin.</li>
            <li> A wonderful beauty product. No, the bristles are not too rough as some reviewers have claimed. Your face is not a floor; you should not be scrubbing it. You gently brush your face. I brush my face almost every day and have used it both wet and dry; either way, I get excellent results. Easy to clean and care for, though I would buy a new one every six months for the sake of cleanliness. (This is my general standard for all personal bath care items including luffas, back scrubbers, sponges, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This does a great job.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, but not on any kind of consistent basis.  I use it maybe a couple times a week when i feel i need to exfoliate.  The bristles are firm, but not too firm.  It&#x27;s not really unpleasant on the skin and my skin is to the point where it&#x27;s starting to thin.  My face is briefly a little red after using it, but i also apply some pressure and go over areas a few times.  I always rinse the dead skin cells off with water afterwards and my face always feels so soft.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this facial brush! It&#x27;s all natural and works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;It may feel a little rough at first but just put a little soap and water on it and&lt;br /&gt;rub on your arm until you feel it soften up, it refreshes your face each time&lt;br /&gt;you use it, gets the dead skin off. I use an all organic goats milk soap that&lt;br /&gt;I love called&#x27; Grandma&#x27;s Beauty Bar&#x27; a great combo with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! I ordered another for the body.</li>
            <li> Perfect facial brush, it has just the right feel and stiffness.  Dries quickly and seems very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I liked it because is not soft and can clean my pores in a deep way.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very soft and that&#x60;s the way I keep.&lt;br /&gt;I need to buy another one, I use it everyday and I need to replace it soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy I bought :-)</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said the bristles fell out. I&#x27;ve had this brush about six months and that hasn&#x27;t happened to mine. Not only have the bristles stayed in place, the entire brush is solid and well made -- a good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for dry brushing my neck, not my face. It&#x27;s been great for that -- exactly what I wanted: a good stiff brushing with a small brush. Recently, however, I thought I&#x27;d try it on my face too. It takes a few tries to get used to using a firm brush on one&#x27;s face but I must say the results are amazing. I&#x27;d always had excessively large pores on my face, especially my nose. After a few weeks of dry brushing my face with this brush, I noticed my skin looked great -- pores were almost invisible, skin was fresh and glowing. Even the age lines on my face seemed diminished. I can&#x27;t prove that the change is due to brushing but I don&#x27;t know what else could explain the improvement, so I plan to keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few reviewers seemed worried about using a stiff brush on the face. Well first of all, you can brush lightly. You don&#x27;t need to press down hard. Second, most beauty routines are much harsher than a bit of brushing. If you use an exfoliant, you&#x27;re basically scraping away the top layer of skin. If you use a peel, you&#x27;re dissolving it away. If you steam your pores, you&#x27;re traumatizing your skin with excessive heat. If you scrub with a wash cloth, you&#x27;re pulling and stretching your skin (don&#x27;t do that!). And if you use soap...well all I can say is NEVER use soap on your face! Brushing is actually less harsh than what folks normally do to their face. It&#x27;s just unfamiliar. Brush it lightly before you shower, and whatever you do, don&#x27;t use soap to wash your face...just rinse it. That&#x27;s all it needs. Honest.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry brushing my face every morning!</li>
            <li> the product is fine - I found a natural bristle with a bigger head and a longer handle - it&#x27;s a guy thing</li>
            <li> It works, just need to let it dry out. So maybe leave it on the bathroom sink to dry if not it stays wet and the bristles don&#x27;t have the same effect. Overall its a good investment</li>
            <li> Best little face brush around.  It&#x27;s fast and easy in the shower and does a great job!</li>
            <li> I tried to used it for at least 2 weeks trying to get use to it, but it is too rough on my face even when I gently rub it into my face. Not recommended using it as a facial brush much better for foot brush but not to your face.</li>
            <li> amazing brush, amazing quality. what else can i say. best tool to use for skin care.  want good skin? skip the expensive creams and use a brush like this . the scrubbing is more beneficial than any cream could be. trust me.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> The bristles feel a teeny bit harsh to me; even if I brush lightly, it&#x27;s hard to get them into the crevices on the sides of my nose (where I was really hoping to see improvement to my pores) without having to push hard enough to hurt. I&#x27;m going to keep using them for a while, though, as others have said that they soften up a bit, and your skin gets used to it. But I&#x27;ve also tried using a dry Buff-Puff Sensitive in the same manner: It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and its flexibility seems to make it a little more practical. We shall see.</li>
            <li> Great brush. It really exfoliates my skin, leaving it smooth and soft. Some bristles fall out, but nothing major. I have used it for a few months and it is still doing great.</li>
            <li> It served it&#x27;s purpose for about a month. The wooden handle evently became water logged and fall apart!!!</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face and I believe my skin is improving - time will tell.</li>
            <li> It is very well made but I was hoping for a stiffer bristle. Nice design and a good size. easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have a Bass body brush and I love it. I keep the body brush in the shower and use it every day. I bought the face brush to keep by my sink for washing my face at night, but in less than a week of use it started shedding bristles like crazy. Every time I washed my face I had to pick dozens of bristles off the soap and out of the sink. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use to dry brush daily. Not to soft or hard! Just right! Perfect  Brussels</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product because it is very harsh on one&#x27;s face and poor quality. Lack of product quality shows as soon as product is being used.</li>
            <li> awful brush.  wish i could have returned it.</li>
            <li> This was touted as safer and gentler for your facial skin that the synthetic brushes (such as on a Clarsonic, Olay, et al).  It is very stiff and damaging.  I have normal skin which I exfoliate using many other methods, none of which hurt and redden the skin like this does.  Even with an extremely light touch.  Apparently &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean it is good for you.  I am extremely annoyed by the misleading &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34;.  Wasted money.  Try the Olay, Clarsonic or other rotating brush instead with some Murad exfoliating cleanser, or any cleanser for that matter.  Your face will thank you.</li>
