            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>She advised me to use the lotion after each shower, but said there was an especially important step.</li>
            <li>These lotions are a bit sticky, but they smell great.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this amazing product!</li>

            <li>Good moisturizer</li>
            <li>Good moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>The shaman in me can tell that the ingredients here are superior and well thought out.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, softening lotion.  </li>
            <li>It was soothing and had a good consistency and did moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Good non greasy lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on sore muscles too.</li>
            <li>But for those who like tea tree smell I think it&#x27;s a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li>This is a really good lotion.</li>
            <li>I found it not too greasy and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Good luck! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>And after more research, found out that Tea Tree Oil can greatly help cure this issue.</li>
            <li>and it sure does smell like tea tree oil which doesnt smell great.</li>
            <li>Works great, better than the prescription antibiotic creams my dermatologist prescribed.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Customers love this finishing cream!</li>
            <li>great lotion, but warning about the strong smell</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is fairly large, which makes it a great value for the money!</li>
            <li>Product is amazing</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil really works great for me!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves kind of a film on youre skin.</li>
            <li>Kind of like when you don&#x27;t take a shower for a while</li>
            <li>No matter what kind of lid you have on a bottle you will never get everything out unless you take of the lid.</li>
            <li>Feels so nice and silky on my skin and there&#x27;s no greasy reside.</li>
            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>It feels nice and seems to work well, but I find the very strong scent a bit off-putting.  </li>
            <li>If you do not like the Tea Tree smell, you will not like it because it has a very strong smell that lingers.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent (tea tree, kind of minty/herbal)...</li>
            <li>and though it works just as well it does not smell pleasant at all, lol] and leaves your skin soft up to 24 hours if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just so strong!</li>
            <li>The lotion worked great at first.</li>
            <li>I gave this product four stars because it worked great on me at first.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty great.</li>
            <li>This product is nice and may be a bit strong for some.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lotion and it soaks in fast</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil is amazing and to have it in a lotion form is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I had a bout with foliculitis on my legs, and tea tree is all that helps (better than prescriptions).  </li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil has been proven to heal many things</li>
            <li>love tee tree oil&lt;</li>
            <li>i love this lotion</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I like tea tree for its many benefits.  </li>
            <li>ask for more with this product.</li>
            <li>I love tea tree oil</li>
            <li>It seems to have a bit more staying power than some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels better</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave you with an overwhelming medicine-like scent of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not going to knock a star off because of the pump top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible or anything, just not a scent</li>
            <li>The best advice I can give is to be open to experimenting until you find what works for you.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning this lotion does have a potent odor, but you get used to it after a while.  </li>
            <li>more acne on my buttocks</li>
            <li>but could smell better</li>
            <li>so I have to twist the top off to use the lotion.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased 3 bottles.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the tea tree oil isn&#x27;t overwhelming and  the effects are felt immediately.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I found this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t care &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I totally love this cream.</li>
            <li>and the scent does not linger more than an hour or 2.</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for years but have never been able to find prices that come close to what it is sold for here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my families favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Smell is not that great unless you really like the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>works well goes on smooth, great product helps smooth skin great moistening of the skin and helps with itching of dry skin</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like lotions with a strong odor you might not like this lotion, but I love the strong minty, tea tree smell.</li>
            <li>Over the course of three or four WEEKS, I tried many lotions, including ones that were alcohol free with shea and/or coco butter, and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion, dries fast - absorbs and moisturizes the skin, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the greatest of scent but it leaves my skin super super soft.</li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions, and this one has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li>This is some really strongly scented lotion.  </li>
            <li>One is that the smell is rather strong.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed how quickly my skin began to feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I used Curel brand previously, as that is readily available anywhere and works awesome</li>
            <li>Has a cool burning clean feeling sensation like most any tee tree oil product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best lower priced natural body lotion products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I will never not have this stuff available in my house.</li>
            <li>I am a person who must have lotion available at all times.</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance, not over powering.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the amazing shopping experience.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great moisturizer doesn&#x27;t burn or sting if you put on open cracks in the skin or leave any oily feeling</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and hydrated, it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Body and skin types vary a great deal and issues with skin and the digestive system seem to be unique for every individual.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s very useful</li>
            <li>tea tree is incredibly soothing, and i went from dreading the every other day shave to not minding it all now that the razor burn is a non issue.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a strong fragrance, and although it&#x27;s not unpleasant, I prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li>The tea tree scent is very refreshing and moisture gets locked in for hours leaving my hands smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>Part of successful, personal experimentation is being observant and patient.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this lotion because I liked the Tea Tree/Mint fragrance, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found it kept my skin mosturized all day!  </li>
            <li>My elbows are super smooth.  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels wonderful, very soothing, and has helped my skin a great deal after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li>Good enough lotion</li>
            <li>I say its ok because i did not find it much moisterizing</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>I explained (didn&#x27;t show her) about my rash and search for some kind of natural treatment.</li>
            <li>is good, but could be better&lt;br /&gt;can not find a larger size on amazon</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel cool and tingly, and even makes my rashes go away.</li>
            <li>Has a pretty strong minty smell.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, the pump is still usable without the rest of it, but it squirts in every direction</li>
            <li>word of caution: this method worked for me and I was lucky.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which I really like.</li>
            <li>So good for dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>I have a very oily face and this is the first lotion that seems to provide some oil control (and I have tried so many -</li>
            <li>First of It came without a package, just the bottle!</li>
            <li>and actually my skin feels better!</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry itchy or red skin!</li>
            <li>originally purchased this lotion because I started tanning as I am going on vacation, and instead of looking orange from bronzers, I wanted a strong anti-aging lotion that would keep my skin young and fresh.</li>
            <li>The smell TO ME, is fresh...</li>
            <li>but this works just as well and is more natural.  </li>
            <li>It was worth four stars because after a year of trying all kinds of lotions this lotion made my skin feel the closest it could to what my skin used to be.</li>
            <li>but the smell to me is a bit too powerful, it does fade after time</li>
            <li>I should have asked for another PA, NP, or MD, but I left in disgust and sought a cure on my own.</li>
            <li>Within minutes of using this lotion the itching was better, and the rash healed up completely.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it to me.</li>
            <li>: MUST use daily to be effective-</li>
            <li>Made from tea tree oil and other good stuff.  </li>
            <li>So, if something doesn&#x27;t feel right, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous, better than many of the more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m not using any harsh ingredients or chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and continued use has stopped my problem entirely.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies it helps with eczema, psoriasis, and any other skin conditions</li>
            <li>but it helps my son&#x27;s super dry winter skin better than even coconut oil.</li>
            <li>After doing my own research, I came to the conclusion that it was a fugal/yeast infection from my hands being wet all the time.</li>
            <li>The lotion does have a ... sappy feeling when first applied.  </li>
            <li>AND THIS LOTION KEEPS MY HANDS FEELING SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li>At first it smells kinda like some sort on liniment but goes away.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and everyone loves it!  </li>
            <li>I have now enjoyed similar results with the skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have only gone thru one bottle (I have since ordered more)</li>
            <li>very creamy lotion, me and wife like it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, works well, and has that whole tea tree thing going for it.</li>
            <li>At first time I used it</li>
            <li>so I need a good, heavy moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>This is really a nice value for the size and price of the lotion compared to other brands on the market.  </li>
            <li>product really has a clean scent, helps to keep me fresh and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and has helped clear up acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely on hot days to cool down and refresh.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this lotion for years now and it works great at keeping my skin soft even during harsh MN winters.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly cooling effect, which is nice for hot days.</li>
            <li>this does not irritate my sensitive skin, soaks in quickly and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>However, the lotion quickly soaks in, and the sticky feeling fades away, leaving your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but this lotion keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m going to order two more bottles, since I know my skin will still be dry once the heat goes on for winter.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because I really like tea tree products and don&#x27;t mind the smell.  </li>
            <li>but has an unusual smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very earthy.</li>
            <li>It made her skin much smoother and helped take care of the itching.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I apply it on my legs and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>but it feels very oily compared to the Vaseline lotion.  </li>
            <li>I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion at a Whole Foods store and would not have known to try it if a employee in their health foods section hadn&#x27;t recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I buy this lotion on Amazon now because the closest Whole Foods store to me is an hour a way</li>
            <li>The pump came cracked which I did&#x27;t mind too much</li>
            <li>I guess, and very minty because of the tea tree.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and provided some &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; moisture and provided some odor control.</li>
            <li>Works very well keeps my skin hydrated and the smell is Devine.</li>
            <li>All that&#x27;s left is soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft supple clean and clear.</li>
            <li>more bumps all over my arms from reactions to chemicals in other lotions</li>
            <li>I think the Nature&#x27;s Gate left my hands feeling more moisturized in general</li>
            <li>I have had other lotions that actually say they last 24 hours and didn&#x27;t, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion really does (and it doesn&#x27;t even advertise that part - what great modesty).</li>
            <li>Which that&#x27;s an ounce more than the average water bottle at the grocery store</li>
            <li>My only complaint about this lotion is that the smell is sort of potent and not one that I am in love with.  </li>
            <li>Not sure that it&#x27;s all that effective at calming irritation or getting rid of itching.</li>
            <li>I was worried, because along with being particularly dry, my skin is pretty darn sensitive...and can break out or even react to many facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Really, couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>&quot; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LOTION</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommenad this product too highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it everyday and has for many years, It is much easier to order on line direct from the factory than in the market and also fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>This really helps with SUPER dry skin without being overkill.</li>
            <li>It was really weird, nothing I had ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It definitely was worth me trying.</li>
            <li>, it is a viable option for keeping dry skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for dry skin especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this lotion in my home.</li>
            <li>The redness and bumps started reaching up my middle finger on left hand and the nail started to come free from the nail bed.</li>
            <li>After paying so much money on medical bills from the surgery of having our son, I was really trying to avoid going to the doctors.</li>
            <li>I just have super dry skin</li>
            <li>I ended up cut all the dead nail away on my middle finger so that it stays dry and the lotion can take effect better, but I feel positive that my nail will grow back and be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>This lotion replaced the &amp;#34;Naked Bee&amp;#34; brand in my home because it is more soothing; furthermore, it has a more natural fragrance as opposed to an artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it is natural!</li>
            <li>The rash was gone completely within 3 or 4 weeks even though it had covered 20-25% of my body!</li>
            <li>[if the lotion is not too old, got a real old one once at a store</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>Several years ago I broke out with a rash that quickly spread all over my legs and back.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally for my feet (as I typically use almond oil for the rest of my body, but oil feels too slimy for my shoes).</li>
            <li>My wife and I discovered this lotion years ago at one of our local health food organic markets but the price there is very high.</li>
            <li>All it does is moisturize; it doesn&#x27;t seem that it actually nourishes all that much.</li>
            <li>Again, doesn&#x27;t bother me because it works, and really the only person that would smell it just a bit is my husband.</li>
            <li>lotion works very well for both of us, non irritating, very moisturizing, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from multiple skin ailments including fine lines on my face, dry skin (especially on my face), eczema on my arms and acne on my bum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is tingle a little but feel cool and relax..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve also been cleaning up anything having to do with my skin and going for the natural route in general.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you&#x27;ll feel greasy all day long</li>
            <li>and my hands are completely back to normal.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Vaseline Total Moisture Lotion but decided to try the Nature&#x27;s Gate instead.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the odor, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you will probably love this lotion because in all other areas it seems to work extremely well for daily or sporadic use.</li>
            <li>This lotion may be a tad thick for some but any oily feeling will dissipate quickly, and because of the richness of the lotion it really does last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, really doesn&#x27;t do anything!!</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my face roseaca and acne, and general condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, my skin is sensitive and prone to dryness at the slightest dehydration or abuse especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a rich lotion, it only takes a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change but feels soothing for sure.</li>
            <li>This step involves using a soft, natural, bristle brush and gently dry brushing my affected skin before the shower and again during the shower using only hypo-allergenic glycerin soap.</li>
            <li>I ordered this after searching high and low for an organic lotion for DRY skin.</li>
            <li>This one smells of tea tree oil, so it must contain at least enough to benefit the skin, unlike some products that claim to contain certain things &amp; have very little.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while now and noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t itch, become irritated &amp; this has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it gets absorbed or not.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that if it had the tea tree oil smell at least it could have that cool sensation that methol gives.</li>
            <li>live in the desert where it is very dry and bot deal with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I use this after showering because I wrestle a lot and it seems to really cut down on skin infections.</li>
            <li>My skin was as hydrated and soft as it used to be before I started having the dry skin issue a year ago.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It decreased my acne and also cured a strange red patch on my face that I have tried many products on (fungal cream, lotions, antibacterial creams, acne cream, various essential oils - none worked, but this lotion did).</li>
            <li>But you will find yourself using less than most lotions, less re-applications, and less at each application.  </li>

            <li> This is a good, softening lotion.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good on sore muscles too.</li>

            <li> And after more research, found out that Tea Tree Oil can greatly help cure this issue.</li>
            <li> and it sure does smell like tea tree oil which doesnt smell great.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than the prescription antibiotic creams my dermatologist prescribed.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Customers love this finishing cream!</li>
            <li> great lotion, but warning about the strong smell</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is fairly large, which makes it a great value for the money!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil really works great for me!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves kind of a film on youre skin.</li>
            <li> Kind of like when you don&#x27;t take a shower for a while</li>
            <li> No matter what kind of lid you have on a bottle you will never get everything out unless you take of the lid.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice and silky on my skin and there&#x27;s no greasy reside.</li>
            <li> Nice scent</li>
            <li> It feels nice and seems to work well, but I find the very strong scent a bit off-putting.  </li>
            <li> If you do not like the Tea Tree smell, you will not like it because it has a very strong smell that lingers.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent (tea tree, kind of minty/herbal)...</li>
            <li> and though it works just as well it does not smell pleasant at all, lol] and leaves your skin soft up to 24 hours if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just so strong!</li>
            <li> The lotion worked great at first.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars because it worked great on me at first.</li>
            <li> Its really pretty great.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion and it soaks in fast</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is amazing and to have it in a lotion form is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I had a bout with foliculitis on my legs, and tea tree is all that helps (better than prescriptions).  </li>

            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I like tea tree for its many benefits.  </li>
            <li> ask for more with this product.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil</li>
            <li> It seems to have a bit more staying power than some I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but my skin feels better</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave you with an overwhelming medicine-like scent of tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not going to knock a star off because of the pump top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible or anything, just not a scent</li>
            <li> The best advice I can give is to be open to experimenting until you find what works for you.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning this lotion does have a potent odor, but you get used to it after a while.  </li>
            <li> more acne on my buttocks</li>
            <li> but could smell better</li>
            <li> so I have to twist the top off to use the lotion.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased 3 bottles.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the tea tree oil isn&#x27;t overwhelming and  the effects are felt immediately.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I found this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t care &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I totally love this cream.</li>
            <li> and the scent does not linger more than an hour or 2.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for years but have never been able to find prices that come close to what it is sold for here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my families favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Smell is not that great unless you really like the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> works well goes on smooth, great product helps smooth skin great moistening of the skin and helps with itching of dry skin</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like lotions with a strong odor you might not like this lotion, but I love the strong minty, tea tree smell.</li>
            <li> Over the course of three or four WEEKS, I tried many lotions, including ones that were alcohol free with shea and/or coco butter, and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, dries fast - absorbs and moisturizes the skin, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the greatest of scent but it leaves my skin super super soft.</li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions, and this one has not disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This is some really strongly scented lotion.  </li>
            <li> One is that the smell is rather strong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how quickly my skin began to feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I used Curel brand previously, as that is readily available anywhere and works awesome</li>
            <li> Has a cool burning clean feeling sensation like most any tee tree oil product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the best lower priced natural body lotion products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will never not have this stuff available in my house.</li>
            <li> I am a person who must have lotion available at all times.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance, not over powering.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the amazing shopping experience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great moisturizer doesn&#x27;t burn or sting if you put on open cracks in the skin or leave any oily feeling</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and hydrated, it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Body and skin types vary a great deal and issues with skin and the digestive system seem to be unique for every individual.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s very useful</li>
            <li> tea tree is incredibly soothing, and i went from dreading the every other day shave to not minding it all now that the razor burn is a non issue.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a strong fragrance, and although it&#x27;s not unpleasant, I prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li> The tea tree scent is very refreshing and moisture gets locked in for hours leaving my hands smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Part of successful, personal experimentation is being observant and patient.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion because I liked the Tea Tree/Mint fragrance, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found it kept my skin mosturized all day!  </li>
            <li> My elbows are super smooth.  </li>
            <li> This lotion feels wonderful, very soothing, and has helped my skin a great deal after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Good enough lotion</li>
            <li> I say its ok because i did not find it much moisterizing</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> I explained (didn&#x27;t show her) about my rash and search for some kind of natural treatment.</li>
            <li> is good, but could be better&lt;br /&gt;can not find a larger size on amazon</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel cool and tingly, and even makes my rashes go away.</li>
            <li> Has a pretty strong minty smell.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, the pump is still usable without the rest of it, but it squirts in every direction</li>
            <li> word of caution: this method worked for me and I was lucky.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which I really like.</li>
            <li> So good for dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and this is the first lotion that seems to provide some oil control (and I have tried so many -</li>
            <li> First of It came without a package, just the bottle!</li>
            <li> and actually my skin feels better!</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy or red skin!</li>
            <li> originally purchased this lotion because I started tanning as I am going on vacation, and instead of looking orange from bronzers, I wanted a strong anti-aging lotion that would keep my skin young and fresh.</li>
            <li> The smell TO ME, is fresh...</li>
            <li> but this works just as well and is more natural.  </li>
            <li> It was worth four stars because after a year of trying all kinds of lotions this lotion made my skin feel the closest it could to what my skin used to be.</li>
            <li> but the smell to me is a bit too powerful, it does fade after time</li>
            <li> I should have asked for another PA, NP, or MD, but I left in disgust and sought a cure on my own.</li>
            <li> Within minutes of using this lotion the itching was better, and the rash healed up completely.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it to me.</li>
            <li> : MUST use daily to be effective-</li>
            <li> Made from tea tree oil and other good stuff.  </li>
            <li> So, if something doesn&#x27;t feel right, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous, better than many of the more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m not using any harsh ingredients or chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and continued use has stopped my problem entirely.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies it helps with eczema, psoriasis, and any other skin conditions</li>
            <li> but it helps my son&#x27;s super dry winter skin better than even coconut oil.</li>
            <li> After doing my own research, I came to the conclusion that it was a fugal/yeast infection from my hands being wet all the time.</li>
            <li> The lotion does have a ... sappy feeling when first applied.  </li>
            <li> AND THIS LOTION KEEPS MY HANDS FEELING SOFT AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> At first it smells kinda like some sort on liniment but goes away.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and everyone loves it!  </li>
            <li> I have now enjoyed similar results with the skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have only gone thru one bottle (I have since ordered more)</li>
            <li> very creamy lotion, me and wife like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, works well, and has that whole tea tree thing going for it.</li>
            <li> At first time I used it</li>
            <li> so I need a good, heavy moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice value for the size and price of the lotion compared to other brands on the market.  </li>
            <li> product really has a clean scent, helps to keep me fresh and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and has helped clear up acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely on hot days to cool down and refresh.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this lotion for years now and it works great at keeping my skin soft even during harsh MN winters.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly cooling effect, which is nice for hot days.</li>
            <li> this does not irritate my sensitive skin, soaks in quickly and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> However, the lotion quickly soaks in, and the sticky feeling fades away, leaving your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> but this lotion keeps my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to order two more bottles, since I know my skin will still be dry once the heat goes on for winter.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I really like tea tree products and don&#x27;t mind the smell.  </li>
            <li> but has an unusual smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very earthy.</li>
            <li> It made her skin much smoother and helped take care of the itching.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I apply it on my legs and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> but it feels very oily compared to the Vaseline lotion.  </li>
            <li> I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion at a Whole Foods store and would not have known to try it if a employee in their health foods section hadn&#x27;t recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion on Amazon now because the closest Whole Foods store to me is an hour a way</li>
            <li> The pump came cracked which I did&#x27;t mind too much</li>
            <li> I guess, and very minty because of the tea tree.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and provided some &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; moisture and provided some odor control.</li>
            <li> Works very well keeps my skin hydrated and the smell is Devine.</li>
            <li> All that&#x27;s left is soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin is soft supple clean and clear.</li>
            <li> more bumps all over my arms from reactions to chemicals in other lotions</li>
            <li> I think the Nature&#x27;s Gate left my hands feeling more moisturized in general</li>
            <li> I have had other lotions that actually say they last 24 hours and didn&#x27;t, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion really does (and it doesn&#x27;t even advertise that part - what great modesty).</li>
            <li> Which that&#x27;s an ounce more than the average water bottle at the grocery store</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this lotion is that the smell is sort of potent and not one that I am in love with.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that it&#x27;s all that effective at calming irritation or getting rid of itching.</li>
            <li> I was worried, because along with being particularly dry, my skin is pretty darn sensitive...and can break out or even react to many facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Really, couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> &quot; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LOTION</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommenad this product too highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it everyday and has for many years, It is much easier to order on line direct from the factory than in the market and also fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> This really helps with SUPER dry skin without being overkill.</li>
            <li> It was really weird, nothing I had ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It definitely was worth me trying.</li>
            <li> , it is a viable option for keeping dry skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for dry skin especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this lotion in my home.</li>
            <li> The redness and bumps started reaching up my middle finger on left hand and the nail started to come free from the nail bed.</li>
            <li> After paying so much money on medical bills from the surgery of having our son, I was really trying to avoid going to the doctors.</li>
            <li> I just have super dry skin</li>
            <li> I ended up cut all the dead nail away on my middle finger so that it stays dry and the lotion can take effect better, but I feel positive that my nail will grow back and be perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> This lotion replaced the &amp;#34;Naked Bee&amp;#34; brand in my home because it is more soothing; furthermore, it has a more natural fragrance as opposed to an artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it is natural!</li>
            <li> The rash was gone completely within 3 or 4 weeks even though it had covered 20-25% of my body!</li>
            <li> [if the lotion is not too old, got a real old one once at a store</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Several years ago I broke out with a rash that quickly spread all over my legs and back.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my feet (as I typically use almond oil for the rest of my body, but oil feels too slimy for my shoes).</li>
            <li> My wife and I discovered this lotion years ago at one of our local health food organic markets but the price there is very high.</li>
            <li> All it does is moisturize; it doesn&#x27;t seem that it actually nourishes all that much.</li>
            <li> Again, doesn&#x27;t bother me because it works, and really the only person that would smell it just a bit is my husband.</li>
            <li> lotion works very well for both of us, non irritating, very moisturizing, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from multiple skin ailments including fine lines on my face, dry skin (especially on my face), eczema on my arms and acne on my bum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is tingle a little but feel cool and relax..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also been cleaning up anything having to do with my skin and going for the natural route in general.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you&#x27;ll feel greasy all day long</li>
            <li> and my hands are completely back to normal.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Vaseline Total Moisture Lotion but decided to try the Nature&#x27;s Gate instead.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the odor, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you will probably love this lotion because in all other areas it seems to work extremely well for daily or sporadic use.</li>
            <li> This lotion may be a tad thick for some but any oily feeling will dissipate quickly, and because of the richness of the lotion it really does last.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, really doesn&#x27;t do anything!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my face roseaca and acne, and general condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, my skin is sensitive and prone to dryness at the slightest dehydration or abuse especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a rich lotion, it only takes a little to go a long way.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change but feels soothing for sure.</li>
            <li> This step involves using a soft, natural, bristle brush and gently dry brushing my affected skin before the shower and again during the shower using only hypo-allergenic glycerin soap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after searching high and low for an organic lotion for DRY skin.</li>
            <li> This one smells of tea tree oil, so it must contain at least enough to benefit the skin, unlike some products that claim to contain certain things &amp; have very little.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while now and noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t itch, become irritated &amp; this has a cooling effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it gets absorbed or not.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that if it had the tea tree oil smell at least it could have that cool sensation that methol gives.</li>
            <li> live in the desert where it is very dry and bot deal with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use this after showering because I wrestle a lot and it seems to really cut down on skin infections.</li>
            <li> My skin was as hydrated and soft as it used to be before I started having the dry skin issue a year ago.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It decreased my acne and also cured a strange red patch on my face that I have tried many products on (fungal cream, lotions, antibacterial creams, acne cream, various essential oils - none worked, but this lotion did).</li>
            <li> But you will find yourself using less than most lotions, less re-applications, and less at each application.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t have to use as much because a little bit of this lotion goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Worth the small difference in price if you need real dry skin</li>
            <li> However the scent and feeling don&#x27;t last long after application.  </li>
            <li> I wondered why my lotion bottle wasn&#x27;t lasting as long, the culprit, my husband.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and although i would not use this thickness of cream on my face, the few times i have i have never reacted negatively to Nature&#x27;s Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value - Not very inexpensive, this is true.  </li>
            <li> It makes it inconvenient but at least the lotion works great.</li>
            <li> , my skin between my fingers got really red, dry, itchy, and bumpy.</li>
            <li> I know what its like to suffer from dry hands which are a constant discomfort if not treated and</li>
            <li> In the six months I&#x27;ve used it I had fewer dry skin problems and no spots of fungus, although the key months of February-April (when winter and heated buildings finish their onslaught on the skin) are yet to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for about a month, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference as far as the what makes my skin break out (which could be due to a number of things), and the smell isn&#x27;t my cup of tea (quite medicinal with a little minty freshness thrown in), but it definitely didn&#x27;t harm my skin or make it worse.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin moist for a long time.  </li>
            <li> like that it works for a long duration.</li>
            <li> And while it smells quite &amp;#34;tea-tree-ish&amp;#34;, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li> Love the product, as it is thin but not too thin so it does absorb properly, and I am actually using it on a recent tattoo, as tea tree has healing components.</li>
            <li> If you have oilier skin or don&#x27;t live in a dry area you may want something a little lighter, but Nature&#x27;s Gate has a wide selection of lotions that would work for you.</li>
            <li> After one use that night and another use in the morning, the red bumpy areas between my fingers started getting smoother and less red, and NO ITCHING.</li>
            <li> The lotion does have a faint tea tree odor, but not as strong as the oil itself,and I think it&#x27;s a relaxing, herbal sort of smell, not really a problem.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products and nothing seemed to totally sooth my skin.  </li>
            <li> Turns out it works well for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> and it called my attention because the description said it was for really dry skin.</li>
            <li> dry out my skin even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tea tree helps with fungus and dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is applied after the shower when skin is completely dry.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this lotion by a friend to help heal dry, cracked skin.</li>
            <li> It is not too oily when applied to the skin and seems to take care of my dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who does not mind the smell of tea tree oil and has dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had some dry spots that nothing seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> This is my go-to for winter irritated, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems to penetrate the very dry skin on my hands and last longer than the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I got this because my skin started breaking out on my arms due to some changes in skin routine, and I realized that I might be a little too sensitive for things from fragrance stores (Boooo on that.)</li>
            <li> and I feel like my hands are constantly washing something (bottles, aspirator and medicine dropper when he got sick, pump equipment, washing my hands after diaper changes, and more)</li>
            <li> My skin was dry from the long cold winter, but the Tea Tree Oil Lotion has made my skin soft &amp; moist and ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion after trying tea tree oil for my very dry and cracking hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used heavy night creams that didn&#x27;t last as long!</li>
            <li> A thorough washing will remove it soon after but it only needs a little time to sink in and then it doesn&#x27;t feel like the moisture is washing away.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works well, a little goes a long way and it will keep your skin hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this as a solution but the results were minimal.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars for not absorbing.</li>
            <li> : It took me a few weeks, but I actually like the smell of tea tree oil now.  </li>
            <li> I get very dry and chapped hand in fall and winter and this lotion was a miracle for my hands!</li>
            <li> A lot of product for the money because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Minor differences in bodies can mean lotions have different effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not something I&#x27;d use just on my hands, but I like to slather this thick lotion on my legs and arms when my skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;THIS LOTION WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE IN CORRECTING AND GETTING RID OF EXTREMELY DRY,FLAKY,CRACKED,IRRITATED SKIN PROBLEMS THAT ARE CAUSED BY WEATHER CHANGES, SKIN ALLERGIES,EVEN INFECTIONS OR SKIN IRRITATIONS.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I gave away all my other lotions.</li>
            <li> Other than the acne my skin feels and appears smoother.</li>
            <li> Other lotions moisture, but this one soothes, and my skin heals noticeably faster when I use it.</li>
            <li> this stuff QUENCHES dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> the only negative is the Brand name  itself, as i think of a hippy cult when i type Nature&#x27;s Gate</li>
            <li> The one possible negative is the scent.  </li>
            <li> so I think for the average person</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent - This lotion has a slight herbal scent but not perfume-y in any way.  </li>
            <li> and I was less itchy almost immediately.</li>
            <li> crack  less or split less.</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy, and stays that way throughout the day...</li>
            <li> and you rub your skin long enough you get tiny little rolls of dirty skin</li>
            <li> Works good on those annoying chicken skin like  bumps on upper arms and mystery rashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick lotion, so a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now, and my face is softer and less irritated than before.</li>
            <li> As for the acne I think it does help a little.</li>
            <li> I use this at night because it does leave my skin a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I swear this caused me to break out into little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> However, it does leave a little greasiness on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason it gets three stars is because it came out of the box broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must-have during the winter, although I still use it all year round.</li>
            <li> There is a touch of sandalwood but to smell the lotion&#x27;s scent at any time a few minutes after applying you have to have your nose to your skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks,  it is working and i will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> The second issue is that the pump was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to pull the pump out of the bottle every time I&#x27;ve used it, which has been somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil helped but was messy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have symptoms of eczema during the cold dry months and other lotions do not help with the dry cracking skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and I live in Chicago where the winter wind is dry and brutal</li>
            <li> This lotion is very heavy to the point where it feels a little bit sticky when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like that this helps to keep me from smelling bad in the summer heat, not to sound as if I have poor hygiene because that isn&#x27;t the</li>
            <li> It was extremely uncomfortable, it felt like it was burning while being itchy at the same time.</li>
            <li> ill definitely keep this in my house at all time and WILL be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have really hard water</li>
            <li> This lotion was the only thing that stopped the itching from driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Which I seem to be suffering of lately.</li>
            <li> I have turned to organic lotions since I noticed that the common brands (Aveeno, Lubriderm, etc.)</li>
            <li> Also I had a weird rash thing behind my ear that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after applying the lotion to it daily after three days it was gone.br /</li>
            <li> Also I had a weird rash thing behind my ear that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after applying the lotion to it daily after three days it was gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion to prevent skin from cracking or at least help it</li>
            <li> No more infection!</li>
            <li> So I tried it mean while Amazon restocked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean it is a body lotion.</li>
            <li> I STOCK UP ON THIS LOTION DURING THE WINTER FOR MY HANDS THAT TEND TO GET EXTREMELY DRY AND FLAKY DURING THE COLD WEATHER</li>
            <li> see Malcom Gladwell&#x27;s book \\&quot;Blink\\&quot;)a subtle intelligence and memory that we access without realizing it.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the ingredients list and thought I was purchasing a product with no added artificial fragrance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and tea tree isn&#x27;t a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> I was having the worst time with dry, itchy skin this winter, especially after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but my pump came broken.</li>
            <li> Pieces of it had broken off and I can&#x27;t use it at all.</li>
            <li> But people said their acne cleared up, wheras mine got worse.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four though because sometimes the nozzle is defective but I am doubtful that this is due to Amazon.</li>
            <li> The results were startling for me.</li>
            <li> I had horrible \\&quot;pregnancy rash\\&quot; during my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the artificial smell of cinnamon/sandalwood, you might like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> If artificial fragrances bother, stay away from this lotion.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it feels cold going on</li>
            <li> I would say this is a mediocre moisturizer!</li>
            <li> the ladies at Sephora are sick of me asking for samples).</li>
            <li> hate to use the words &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And unfortunately I hate the smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product.  I was having a problem with itchy legs and this totally works.</li>
            <li> Love the product, as it is thin but not too thin so it does absorb properly, and I am actually using it on a recent tattoo, as tea tree has healing components. It&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it gets three stars is because it came out of the box broken. The pump was shattered into 4 pieces. Luckily, the pump is still usable without the rest of it, but it squirts in every direction and so I have to block it with my hand or it gets all over.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this stuff. I will definitely be buying this again. It&#x27;s a great lotion and it soaks in fast and it&#x27;s so healing. I will never not have this stuff available in my house. Tea Tree oil is amazing and to have it in a lotion form is fabulous. I just had a baby 4 months ago and I feel like my hands are constantly washing something (bottles, aspirator and medicine dropper when he got sick, pump equipment, washing my hands after diaper changes, and more), my skin between my fingers got really red, dry, itchy, and bumpy. It was extremely uncomfortable, it felt like it was burning while being itchy at the same time. Over the course of three or four WEEKS, I tried many lotions, including ones that were alcohol free with shea and/or coco butter, and nothing helped. The redness and bumps started reaching up my middle finger on left hand and the nail started to come free from the nail bed. After paying so much money on medical bills from the surgery of having our son, I was really trying to avoid going to the doctors. After doing my own research, I came to the conclusion that it was a fugal/yeast infection from my hands being wet all the time. And after more research, found out that Tea Tree Oil can greatly help cure this issue. Now, I&#x27;m not a doctor, but this stuff cured me and it was SUCH a relief. I one-day ordered it and started using it the night I got it. After one use that night and another use in the morning, the red bumpy areas between my fingers started getting smoother and less red, and NO ITCHING. It was a miracle! It&#x27;s been a week now and my hands are completely back to normal. No more infection! YAY! If you&#x27;d like to see the difference, I&#x27;m posting a picture of the before and the morning after I started using it. I ended up cut all the dead nail away on my middle finger so that it stays dry and the lotion can take effect better, but I feel positive that my nail will grow back and be perfectly fine. Thank you for this amazing product! Like i said, I will definitely keep this in my house at all time and WILL be buying again. Hope this review helps others out there. Good luck! &#x3D;)ill definitely keep this in my house at all time and WILL be buying again. Hope this review helps others out there. Good luck! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  I had a bout with foliculitis on my legs, and tea tree is all that helps (better than prescriptions).  Tea tree soap in the shower, then this lotion after.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed how quickly my skin began to feel softer and smoother. The tea tree oil really works great for me!</li>
            <li> I use this product during the winter when my skin needs some extra help. Tea Tree Oil has been proven to heal many things and it is natural! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I received it in the mail, and LOVE IT!!!! The smell TO ME, is fresh... not overpowering at all! Thanks for a wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It seems to penetrate the very dry skin on my hands and last longer than the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a strong fragrance, and although it&#x27;s not unpleasant, I prefer fragrance free.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s very useful so i bought it .I love tee tree oil&lt;br /&gt;so i love this lotion</li>
            <li> I originally bought this lotion because I liked the Tea Tree/Mint fragrance, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found it kept my skin mosturized all day!  I have had other lotions that actually say they last 24 hours and didn&#x27;t, but Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion really does (and it doesn&#x27;t even advertise that part - what great modesty).</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I really like tea tree products and don&#x27;t mind the smell.  I carefully read the ingredients list and thought I was purchasing a product with no added artificial fragrance.  This is not the case.  If you don&#x27;t mind the artificial smell of cinnamon/sandalwood, you might like this lotion.  If artificial fragrances bother, stay away from this lotion.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but has an unusual smell.</li>
            <li> I now how tea tree smells, so that doesn&#x27;t throw me.  The lotion does have a ... sappy feeling when first applied.  However the scent and feeling don&#x27;t last long after application.  Good moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the scent (tea tree, kind of minty/herbal)... this does not irritate my sensitive skin, soaks in quickly and feels moisturizing. My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I use this daily.  It leaves the skin moist for a long time.  It&#x27;s a must-have during the winter, although I still use it all year round.</li>
            <li> I use this to reduce razor burn on my neck after shaving and it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree is incredibly soothing, and i went from dreading the every other day shave to not minding it all now that the razor burn is a non issue.</li>
            <li> Good enough lotion but I can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions, and this one has not disappointed me. If you don&#x27;t like lotions with a strong odor you might not like this lotion, but I love the strong minty, tea tree smell. It&#x27;s very earthy. I have very dry skin, and I live in Chicago where the winter wind is dry and brutal so I need a good, heavy moisturizing lotion. This lotion is very heavy to the point where it feels a little bit sticky when you put it on your skin. However, the lotion quickly soaks in, and the sticky feeling fades away, leaving your skin soft and moisturized. The moisture is long-lasting too. This lotion is perfect for me. If you have oilier skin or don&#x27;t live in a dry area you may want something a little lighter, but Nature&#x27;s Gate has a wide selection of lotions that would work for you. They&#x27;re not all listed on Amazon so I would recommend checking their website. I love them. They are my go-to brand for body lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves kind of a film on youre skin. I&#x27;m not sure if it gets absorbed or not.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;THIS LOTION WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE IN CORRECTING AND GETTING RID OF EXTREMELY DRY,FLAKY,CRACKED,IRRITATED SKIN PROBLEMS THAT ARE CAUSED BY WEATHER CHANGES, SKIN ALLERGIES,EVEN INFECTIONS OR SKIN IRRITATIONS. I STOCK UP ON THIS LOTION DURING THE WINTER FOR MY HANDS THAT TEND TO GET EXTREMELY DRY AND FLAKY DURING THE COLD WEATHER AND THIS LOTION KEEPS MY HANDS FEELING SOFT AND SMOOTH ALL WINTER LONG.\\&quot; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS LOTION TO EVERYONE IT&#x27;S WONDERFUL AND LIKE I SAID IT WORKS LIKE A MIRACLE.</li>
            <li> First of It came without a package, just the bottle! has no expiration date on it!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks, really doesn&#x27;t do anything!! I stopped using it and actually my skin feels better!</li>
            <li> I like tea tree for its many benefits.  I just don&#x27;t want to be overwhelmed by it.  This is some really strongly scented lotion.  It feels nice and seems to work well, but I find the very strong scent a bit off-putting.  I will look for another variety from Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice value for the size and price of the lotion compared to other brands on the market.  This one smells of tea tree oil, so it must contain at least enough to benefit the skin, unlike some products that claim to contain certain things &amp; have very little.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a while now and noticed my skin doesn&#x27;t itch, become irritated &amp; this has a cooling effect. I like that this helps to keep me from smelling bad in the summer heat, not to sound as if I have poor hygiene because that isn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;This product really has a clean scent, helps to keep me fresh and cool, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and has helped clear up acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t ask for more with this product.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil it is a very good product. I would recommend it to anyone who has irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and one for myself after trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it works for a long duration.</li>
            <li> I have really hard water but this lotion keeps my skin super soft. At first it smells kinda like some sort on liniment but goes away.</li>
            <li> I am a person who must have lotion available at all times. insert immature joke here. Anyway, my skin is sensitive and prone to dryness at the slightest dehydration or abuse especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent - This lotion has a slight herbal scent but not perfume-y in any way.  There is a touch of sandalwood but to smell the lotion&#x27;s scent at any time a few minutes after applying you have to have your nose to your skin.  I am a waiter and I can use this at work it doesn&#x27;t interfere smell-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel- This lotion may be a tad thick for some but any oily feeling will dissipate quickly, and because of the richness of the lotion it really does last.  A thorough washing will remove it soon after but it only needs a little time to sink in and then it doesn&#x27;t feel like the moisture is washing away.  Lasting power to heal and moisturize here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function - Already covered some of this but yes in my opinion this brand is the best I have found.  I used Curel brand previously, as that is readily available anywhere and works awesome but this works just as well and is more natural.  The shaman in me can tell that the ingredients here are superior and well thought out.  My skin is sensitive and although i would not use this thickness of cream on my face, the few times i have i have never reacted negatively to Nature&#x27;s Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value - Not very inexpensive, this is true.  But you will find yourself using less than most lotions, less re-applications, and less at each application.  Worth the small difference in price if you need real dry skin relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - Lotion lovers (you can&#x27;t help yourself can you, sophomorics?) rejoice and replace your current lotion with this one.  I know what its like to suffer from dry hands which are a constant discomfort if not treated and the only negative is the Brand name  itself, as i think of a hippy cult when i type Nature&#x27;s Gate but you must tell yourself that a name is superficial but the efficacy is skin deep.skin deep.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought it for my grandchild&#x27;s eczema and it worked wonders. It made her skin much smoother and helped take care of the itching.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion because it smelled great.  Turns out it works well for dry skin.  It is very soothing and everyone loves it!  Highly recommended.  The price is fabulous, better than many of the more expensive lotions.</li>
            <li> This is a good, softening lotion.  It seems to have a bit more staying power than some I&#x27;ve tried.  The one possible negative is the scent.  If you do not like the Tea Tree smell, you will not like it because it has a very strong smell that lingers.  Other than that, it is a viable option for keeping dry skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I get very dry and chapped hand in fall and winter and this lotion was a miracle for my hands! I keep the bottle in my office and use it several times on daily basis. The tea tree scent is very refreshing and moisture gets locked in for hours leaving my hands smooth and soft. I will definitely continue buying this brand</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo version of this product several years ago and was amazed at how it relieved itching and soothed the scalp. I have now enjoyed similar results with the skin moisturizer. I cannot recommenad this product too highly. By all means try it.</li>
            <li> I have only gone thru one bottle (I have since ordered more) but my skin feels better then it has in forever!!!!  It has all but healed the cracks on my feet.  My elbows are super smooth.  Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I got this because my skin started breaking out on my arms due to some changes in skin routine, and I realized that I might be a little too sensitive for things from fragrance stores (Boooo on that.) Not only that, but I&#x27;ve also been cleaning up anything having to do with my skin and going for the natural route in general. When I saw this, I thought that the Tea Tree Oil could have a soothing effect for me. After using it for about a month, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference as far as the what makes my skin break out (which could be due to a number of things), and the smell isn&#x27;t my cup of tea (quite medicinal with a little minty freshness thrown in), but it definitely didn&#x27;t harm my skin or make it worse. It was soothing and had a good consistency and did moisturize well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think that lotion like this is a totally personal choice, because everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently. I didn&#x27;t have any specific issues with the product but would probably try something else when I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> I wondered why my lotion bottle wasn&#x27;t lasting as long, the culprit, my husband.&lt;br /&gt;We live in the desert where it is very dry and bot deal with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion works very well for both of us, non irritating, very moisturizing, clean smell.</li>
            <li> I was having the worst time with dry, itchy skin this winter, especially after shaving.  This lotion was the only thing that stopped the itching from driving me crazy.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave you with an overwhelming medicine-like scent of tea tree oil.  It&#x27;s very light and continued use has stopped my problem entirely.  Would recommend to anyone with dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This is a rather generic lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t go on that well either.  All it does is moisturize; it doesn&#x27;t seem that it actually nourishes all that much.</li>
            <li> Minor differences in bodies can mean lotions have different effects. For me, this lotion seems to help.  In the six months I&#x27;ve used it I had fewer dry skin problems and no spots of fungus, although the key months of February-April (when winter and heated buildings finish their onslaught on the skin) are yet to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, and tea tree isn&#x27;t a terrible odor. I&#x27;ll buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a rich lotion, it only takes a little to go a long way. Was very impressed.</li>
            <li> i have temporary excema, it only shows in the winter. I say its ok because i did not find it much moisterizing and it sure does smell like tea tree oil which doesnt smell great. I was hoping that if it had the tea tree oil smell at least it could have that cool sensation that methol gives. it still left my skin looking scaly. never get scaly skin. I think my body is just telling me i need to get back on that coco butter lol</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for dry skin especially in the wintertime.  I apply it on my legs and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pump bottle. It holds eighteen ounces of lotion. Which that&#x27;s an ounce more than the average water bottle at the grocery store holds.&lt;br /&gt;  I like this lotion a lot and it called my attention because the description said it was for really dry skin. Which I seem to be suffering of lately. I have turned to organic lotions since I noticed that the common brands (Aveeno, Lubriderm, etc.) dry out my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this lotion as a second option because Amazon ran out of the Lily of the Dessert lotion. So I decided to try this because if it worked it ouwld be cheaper than Lily of the Dessert. So I tried it mean while Amazon restocked.&lt;br /&gt;  The lotion worked great at first.My skin was as hydrated and soft as it used to be before I started having the dry skin issue a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;  But after three weeks I noticed when I showered or touched water the water would just slide off. It felt as if I had a coat of oil on my skin and so the water would just run off. It was really weird, nothing I had ever experienced. Then I noticed when I would rub my skin some skin particles would roll of. Kind of like when you don&#x27;t take a shower for a while and you rub your skin long enough you get tiny little rolls of dirty skin particles.&lt;br /&gt;  I gave this product four stars because it worked great on me at first. It definitely was worth me trying.I just wish it would of kept working. I&#x27;m also not going to knock a star off because of the pump top. No matter what kind of lid you have on a bottle you will never get everything out unless you take of the lid. Or it&#x27;s a tub with a lid container.&lt;br /&gt;  I definitely would encourage people to give if a try. Every one is different and so things work differently on every one. It was worth four stars because after a year of trying all kinds of lotions this lotion made my skin feel the closest it could to what my skin used to be. I just have super dry skin so I think for the average person this would probably work.&lt;br /&gt;  Also I had a weird rash thing behind my ear that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after applying the lotion to it daily after three days it was gone.br /&gt;  Also I had a weird rash thing behind my ear that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after applying the lotion to it daily after three days it was gone.</li>
            <li> very creamy lotion, me and wife like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff works well, a little goes a long way and it will keep your skin hydrated all day long.  If you use too much, you&#x27;ll feel greasy all day long so don&#x27;t load it on, there is just simply no need to do so.  My only complaint about this lotion is that the smell is sort of potent and not one that I am in love with.  It&#x27;s not terrible or anything, just not a scent I would go out of my way to wear.  If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, then you will probably love this lotion because in all other areas it seems to work extremely well for daily or sporadic use.</li>
            <li> This lotion replaced the &amp;#34;Naked Bee&amp;#34; brand in my home because it is more soothing; furthermore, it has a more natural fragrance as opposed to an artificial fragrance. It&#x27;s a thick lotion, so a little does go a long way. Also, the bottle is fairly large, which makes it a great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I use this in my massage business for feet and hands. The tea tree helps with fungus and dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! Leaves skin feeling cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have symptoms of eczema during the cold dry months and other lotions do not help with the dry cracking skin.  I decided to try this as a solution but the results were minimal.  I normally use the Vaseline Total Moisture Lotion but decided to try the Nature&#x27;s Gate instead.  I think the Nature&#x27;s Gate left my hands feeling more moisturized in general and I like the fact that it does not contain petroleum but it feels very oily compared to the Vaseline lotion.  It is definitely not a solution for eczema (for me anyway).</li>
            <li> This has helped somewhat with my grandsons excema.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  One of the better - if not best - moisturizers out there.  Also, delivery is prompt and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Has a pretty strong minty smell.  Seems to work well and keep skin hydrated throughout the day but the smell to me is a bit too powerful, it does fade after time but I still smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Several years ago I broke out with a rash that quickly spread all over my legs and back. The HMO physician I went to see was zero help and unsympathetic. I should have asked for another PA, NP, or MD, but I left in disgust and sought a cure on my own. Guess what? This lotion was part of that cure. I found Nature&#x27;s Gate Tea Tree lotion at a Whole Foods store and would not have known to try it if a employee in their health foods section hadn&#x27;t recommended it to me. I explained (didn&#x27;t show her) about my rash and search for some kind of natural treatment. She advised me to use the lotion after each shower, but said there was an especially important step. This step involves using a soft, natural, bristle brush and gently dry brushing my affected skin before the shower and again during the shower using only hypo-allergenic glycerin soap. The lotion is applied after the shower when skin is completely dry. The results were startling for me. The rash reduced in redness and I was less itchy almost immediately. The rash was gone completely within 3 or 4 weeks even though it had covered 20-25% of my body! I buy this lotion on Amazon now because the closest Whole Foods store to me is an hour a way and I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution: this method worked for me and I was lucky. Body and skin types vary a great deal and issues with skin and the digestive system seem to be unique for every individual. The best advice I can give is to be open to experimenting until you find what works for you. Part of successful, personal experimentation is being observant and patient. You should also trust your instincts or intuition. Rather than being some esoteric or mystical power, intuition is actually (so I&#x27;ve read -- see Malcom Gladwell&#x27;s book \\&quot;Blink\\&quot;)a subtle intelligence and memory that we access without realizing it. So, if something doesn&#x27;t feel right, don&#x27;t do it. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I can feel the lotion washing off me at night when i take a shower. It&#x27;s powerful, works well, and has that whole tea tree thing going for it.</li>
            <li> I learned about pharmaceutical grade  Tea Tree Oil 20 years ago from Dr. Martin Gallagher, Jeannette Pa.. He was way before his time in knowledge of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; things to help our bodies. I had athlete&#x27;s foot and he told me to use Tea Tree Oil. It Worked ! When I saw this lotion I wanted to try it. I love it. I use it every night after my bath. My skin was dry from the long cold winter, but the Tea Tree Oil Lotion has made my skin soft &amp; moist and ready for summer. It has a light fragrance, not over powering. I will buy it again. Thinking of giving some as gifts this Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had horrible \\&quot;pregnancy rash\\&quot; during my last pregnancy.  I tried every lotion out there.  Even those recommended by the dermatologist didn&#x27;t help.  Within minutes of using this lotion the itching was better, and the rash healed up completely.  I also use it on my daughter when she had eczema.  Helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning this lotion does have a potent odor, but you get used to it after a while.  OH, I just remembered, I have problems with acne and I don&#x27;t remember why but I started using it on my face at night.  Works great, better than the prescription antibiotic creams my dermatologist prescribed.  I gave away all my other lotions.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this lotion by a friend to help heal dry, cracked skin. It works!  I had tried other products and nothing seemed to totally sooth my skin.  I have been using for about a month and hope it will continue it&#x27;s healing \\&quot;powers\\&quot; throughout the winter!  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works well goes on smooth, great product helps smooth skin great moistening of the skin and helps with itching of dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my face roseaca and acne, and general condition of my skin. I have been using it for a few weeks now, and my face is softer and less irritated than before. As for the acne I think it does help a little. Other than the acne my skin feels and appears smoother. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the odor, but I can live with that. Its worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients in this lotion.  It is not too oily when applied to the skin and seems to take care of my dry, itchy skin.  I also like the tea tree oil smell.  Would recommend this to anyone who does not mind the smell of tea tree oil and has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Yeah this is rad. Feels so nice and silky on my skin and there&#x27;s no greasy reside. The smell is also quite pleasant. This really helps with SUPER dry skin without being overkill.</li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from multiple skin ailments including fine lines on my face, dry skin (especially on my face), eczema on my arms and acne on my bum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to use the words &amp;#34;cure all&amp;#34; but for me that&#x27;s what this lotion is. I put it everywhere and my skin is soft supple clean and clear. I feel my face firming when I put it on (AVOID THE EYES). If you have never looked up the benefits of Tea Tree Oil which is one of the ingredients in this lotion now is the time to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this lotion because I started tanning as I am going on vacation, and instead of looking orange from bronzers, I wanted a strong anti-aging lotion that would keep my skin young and fresh. IT DOES THIS TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a summary of the pros and cons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like the smell&lt;br /&gt;great daily lotion&lt;br /&gt;excellent anti-aging uses&lt;br /&gt;no more acne on my buttocks&lt;br /&gt;soft skin&lt;br /&gt;no more bumps all over my arms from reactions to chemicals in other lotions&lt;br /&gt;vegan/cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;full ingredient list on bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: MUST use daily to be effective- I recommend 2X daily. BEAUTY IS A COMMITMENT&lt;br /&gt;Some people will not like the minty smell&lt;br /&gt;it feels cold going on&lt;br /&gt;price is good, but could be better&lt;br /&gt;can not find a larger size on amazon</li>
            <li> great lotion, but warning about the strong smell</li>
            <li> The lotion seems to be working. I ordered this lotion to prevent skin from cracking or at least help it&lt;br /&gt;to crack  less or split less.</li>
            <li> I had some dry spots that nothing seemed to help.  Tried several different lotions with no luck.  I use this at night because it does leave my skin a little oily.  After a few weeks,  it is working and i will continue to use it.  I gave it 4 stars for not absorbing.</li>
            <li> Really, couldn&#x27;t live without. So good for dry itchy skin.  Also a wonderful moisturizer. Have ordered again, &amp; again. Even have son using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the amazing shopping experience. Customers love this finishing cream! I&#x27;ll buy again for sure !!!</li>
            <li> Good non greasy lotion but could smell better</li>
            <li> A very nice moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Product is amazing but my pump came broken. The pump came cracked which I did&#x27;t mind too much but it also doesn&#x27;t pop up so I have to twist the top off to use the lotion. It makes it inconvenient but at least the lotion works great.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased 3 bottles.  This is my go-to for winter irritated, dry skin.  The smell of the tea tree oil isn&#x27;t overwhelming and  the effects are felt immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect lotion to use in winter! It&#x27;s definitely not something I&#x27;d use just on my hands, but I like to slather this thick lotion on my legs and arms when my skin gets dry. And while it smells quite &amp;#34;tea-tree-ish&amp;#34;, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long. It&#x27;s also quite a big container for the money you pay, so it will surely last me several winters.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m female writing this on my husband&#x27;s account.) I ordered this after searching high and low for an organic lotion for DRY skin. I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s technically a body lotion, but decided to try it on my face anyway. I was worried, because along with being particularly dry, my skin is pretty darn sensitive...and can break out or even react to many facial moisturizers. I must say: this stuff QUENCHES dry skin!!! I don&#x27;t know if my face has ever stayed this moisturized with anything else! It is slightly greasy, and stays that way throughout the day...but the point is, it STAYS. I&#x27;ve used heavy night creams that didn&#x27;t last as long! It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; greasy or shiny on your skin, you can just feel it if you wipe your face...but this is no issue for me because it truly works so well. I am SO glad I found this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Last thing I&#x27;ll mention: it does have a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell to it---sort of grassy I guess, and very minty because of the tea tree. Again, doesn&#x27;t bother me because it works, and really the only person that would smell it just a bit is my husband. He doesn&#x27;t care &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> At first time I used it I didn&#x27;t like the smell&lt;br /&gt;after using a couple time I get use to it and&lt;br /&gt;I love it is tingle a little but feel cool and relax..&lt;br /&gt;Great product ever..</li>
            <li> I totally love this cream. It&#x27;s not too thick and not too thin. A bit \\&quot;waxy\\&quot; but it spreads well and absorbs well. I like the tea tree scent (some people don&#x27;t like it at all) and the scent does not linger more than an hour or 2. It&#x27;s lovely on hot days to cool down and refresh. Not sure that it&#x27;s all that effective at calming irritation or getting rid of itching. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle cure for those ailments. It&#x27;s by far the best lower priced natural body lotion products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Awesome moisturizer and all the benefits of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for anyone with sensitive skin or allergies it helps with eczema, psoriasis, and any other skin conditions it&#x27;s great moisturizer doesn&#x27;t burn or sting if you put on open cracks in the skin or leave any oily feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, dries fast - absorbs and moisturizes the skin, but I don&#x27;t like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review: It took me a few weeks, but I actually like the smell of tea tree oil now.  It&#x27;s good on sore muscles too.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion. It&#x27;s soothing on my skin. However, I have two issues with it. One is that the smell is rather strong. The second issue is that the pump was broken when I received it. Pieces of it had broken off and I can&#x27;t use it at all. I&#x27;ve had to pull the pump out of the bottle every time I&#x27;ve used it, which has been somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> These lotions are a bit sticky, but they smell great.  Diluting them with spring water helped.</li>
            <li> Has a cool burning clean feeling sensation like most any tee tree oil product. Its really pretty great.</li>
            <li> Other lotions moisture, but this one soothes, and my skin heals noticeably faster when I use it. I think the antiseptic property is what helps my skin to heal.</li>
            <li> My wife and I discovered this lotion years ago at one of our local health food organic markets but the price there is very high. We have been using this product for years but have never been able to find prices that come close to what it is sold for here on Amazon. This is my families favorite lotion. I gave it a four though because sometimes the nozzle is defective but I am doubtful that this is due to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this originally for my feet (as I typically use almond oil for the rest of my body, but oil feels too slimy for my shoes). It works very well, and provided some &amp;#34;non-oily&amp;#34; moisture and provided some odor control. However, after reading another reviewer&#x27;s comments, I hesitantly decided to try it on my face, and I&#x27;m very impressed. I have a very oily face and this is the first lotion that seems to provide some oil control (and I have tried so many - the ladies at Sephora are sick of me asking for samples). It decreased my acne and also cured a strange red patch on my face that I have tried many products on (fungal cream, lotions, antibacterial creams, acne cream, various essential oils - none worked, but this lotion did). I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent [if the lotion is not too old, got a real old one once at a store and though it works just as well it does not smell pleasant at all, lol] and leaves your skin soft up to 24 hours if you don&#x27;t sweat a lot. Great lotion &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t know Tea Tree smell before I bought it. And unfortunately I hate the smell. But for those who like tea tree smell I think it&#x27;s a good moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry itchy or red skin! Works good on those annoying chicken skin like  bumps on upper arms and mystery rashes!</li>
            <li> This is a really good lotion. My skin is smooth and hydrated, it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;My only complain is the smell. I don&#x27;t mind the sandalwood smell, it&#x27;s just so strong! But you get use to it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! I work outdoors and in the summer I get heat rash. After I shower I put this lotion on and it calms my heat rash. It makes my skin feel cool and tingly, and even makes my rashes go away. It moisturizes my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which I really like. Plus, I don&#x27;t have to use as much because a little bit of this lotion goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We call this the &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34; lotion in my house. You can smell the tea tree upon applying, but the scent does dissipate. It has a slightly cooling effect, which is nice for hot days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion after trying tea tree oil for my very dry and cracking hands. The tea tree oil helped but was messy to use. This lotion feels wonderful, very soothing, and has helped my skin a great deal after only a few days of use. Now I&#x27;m going to order two more bottles, since I know my skin will still be dry once the heat goes on for winter. The lotion does have a faint tea tree odor, but not as strong as the oil itself,and I think it&#x27;s a relaxing, herbal sort of smell, not really a problem.</li>
            <li> Works very well keeps my skin hydrated and the smell is Devine. A lot of product for the money because a little goes a long way. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this after showering because I wrestle a lot and it seems to really cut down on skin infections.</li>
            <li> Smell is not that great unless you really like the smell of tea tree oil. I found it not too greasy and feels good on the skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m not using any harsh ingredients or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My husband uses it everyday and has for many years, It is much easier to order on line direct from the factory than in the market and also fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> This product is nice and may be a bit strong for some. I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I swear this caused me to break out into little bumps all over my face. I wish it didn&#x27;t. Everyone else doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with it at all! I mean it is a body lotion. But people said their acne cleared up, wheras mine got worse. I used a mixture of the papya and tea tree oil on my face...hmmm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is great for the body! Leaves skin so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Made from tea tree oil and other good stuff.  Works as promised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this lotion in my home. Not the greatest of scent but it leaves my skin super super soft. The scent goes away soon after applying. All that&#x27;s left is soft healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a mediocre moisturizer! haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic change but feels soothing for sure. However, it does leave a little greasiness on my face. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t show, but I just feel it and i don&#x27;t like it. So I only use it at night for extra moisture</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It smells like Tea Tree Oil but it helps my son&#x27;s super dry winter skin better than even coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this lotion for years now and it works great at keeping my skin soft even during harsh MN winters.</li>
