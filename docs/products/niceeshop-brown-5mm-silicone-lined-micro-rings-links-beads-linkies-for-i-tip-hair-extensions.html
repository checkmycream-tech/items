            <li>i just love them thank you</li>
            <li>Excellent for extensions, use only once!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not in LOVE with it, but it is silicone lined</li>
            <li>This is a lifetime supply, but that&#x27;s ok too.</li>
            <li>The silicone lining is awesome, it totally reduces the amount of hair pulled out while removing them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will work great!1</li>
            <li>most def will buy again.</li>
            <li>in beauty supply shops and even MORE from pet suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>i will be ordering from this company again for sure.</li>
            <li>(once i run out) :)</li>
            <li>These are great and hold in to your hair very well.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and I still have many more when the mood strikes to put in an extension again.</li>
            <li>Other than that they work great!</li>
            <li>This product came in the mail very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use even without the applicator too.</li>
            <li>and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>these to attach feathers to dogs hair or to human hair - they work great and stay in forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great, but I really wish the whole package was all brown like the title says.</li>
            <li>pretty satisfied</li>
            <li>i mostly love how fast the order got to me.  </li>
            <li>I tried the screw beads before but this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>its totally great!they are very cheap and worth the money...</li>
            <li>they are and VERY reasonably priced!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>oh and the reason i bought them for was because i install feathers in my hair and these were the exact ones i saw on tv</li>
            <li>but they lok pretty legit.</li>
            <li>I was glad to have purchased extra of these!</li>
            <li>They work very well and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>thank you sossososoooo much.....</li>
            <li>They hold really well on to the hair.  </li>
            <li>The beads with feathers slipped out pretty easily even after hard clamping with pliers.</li>
            <li>Although I think next time I will order the beads that are longer so they&#x27;ll sit a little better in my hair.</li>
            <li>While I find I can re-use the beads about 2 or 3 times, the feathers last much longer.</li>
            <li>The only problem is if you don&#x27;t put the tinsel right next to the silicone, they fall out.</li>
            <li>The rubber inside makes it easier on your hair and they are really easy to clap down!!  </li>

            <li> WoW - nearly drove myself crazy trying to find krimpers for feathers!!&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and have no use for the blonde/yellow beads.</li>
            <li> but other than that i would definetly buy it again!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m honestly disappointed, but I only use 6 beads at a time, so I&#x27;m not too upset about it.</li>
            <li> I just bent up a piece of thin wire</li>
            <li> They can be really expensive in the salons.</li>
            <li> Not one bad thing to say.</li>
            <li> and i pulled a couple hairs out :(</li>

            <li> Just what I needed to put hair extensions in my clients hair. Good price for a good lot &amp; they work great!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Not one bad thing to say. I would recommend this. I use it to put feathers in my hair and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use these for feather extensions and tinsel and I love these beads. They&#x27;re small and discreet and can&#x27;t be seen if put close to the scalp. The only problem is if you don&#x27;t put the tinsel right next to the silicone, they fall out. Other than that they work great!</li>

            <li> Excellent for extensions, use only once!</li>
            <li> I still give this a four because perhaps it is my fault that I didn&#x27;t know how big 5mm was, but these beads are still too big and end up showing through my hair when i pick it up in a pony tail. So I&#x27;m not in LOVE with it, but it is silicone lined which was what I was looking for. Just a warning to look at sizes before you buy.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my color extensions instead of paying $5 each to have them put in at the salon, and they work great.  The rubber inside makes it easier on your hair and they are really easy to clap down!!  This is a lifetime supply, but that&#x27;s ok too.</li>
            <li> My Daughter is \\&quot;feathering\\&quot; every girl in our town (I swear)....she uses these in that process.  They work very well and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> we have looked alllllll over for these beads....we just thought what a rip off people were charging $12  a feather.... now my daughter has brought much joy to many friends with no charge.... thank you sossososoooo much.....dragon mama</li>
            <li> These micro-rings are way better quality than the ones I got from the wig store! The silicone lining is awesome, it totally reduces the amount of hair pulled out while removing them. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> they got here faster then i thought!! and they are the same color as shown in the picture.. haven&#x27;t used them yet but they lok pretty legit. I&#x27;m sure they will work great!1 all for a great price. pretty satisfied</li>
            <li> My daughter loves hair feather! They can be really expensive in the salons. I order all my feathers and supplies here on amazon. The beads retail for $32 beauty store. They have worked well. I have even used a single bead multiple times!</li>
            <li> I loved these silicone lined beads.  They hold really well on to the hair.  I tried the screw beads before but this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> i mostly love how fast the order got to me.  haven&#x27;t trie dthe product yet, but the silicone inserts works well on my maniquins most def will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have had them in my hair for three weeks already. Only three of them have fallen out only because I didn&#x27;t tighten it correctly. It was worth it.</li>
            <li> enough to do to tons of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Nice color not noticeable with brunette hair.&lt;br /&gt;best product for the money.</li>
            <li> The beads with feathers slipped out pretty easily even after hard clamping with pliers. I could pull them out in the shower after a day</li>
            <li> I was glad to have purchased extra of these! While I find I can re-use the beads about 2 or 3 times, the feathers last much longer. They are a great color and blend well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm! It&#x27;s really easy to use even without the applicator too. I just bent up a piece of thin wire and they worked just fine. Now I can stick all sorts of stuff in my hair! :D</li>
            <li> WoW - nearly drove myself crazy trying to find krimpers for feathers!!&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE in beauty supply shops and even MORE from pet suppliers.&lt;br /&gt;Here they are and VERY reasonably priced!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use these to attach feathers to dogs hair or to human hair - they work great and stay in forever.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE you Amazon - these things ROCK!!!</li>
            <li> order came on time  but had to be picked up and signed for at post office, that was kind of a hassle for a 5 dollar product but came as described.  i will be ordering from this company again for sure.</li>
            <li> i liked that it gripped the hair so it stayed in for a long time. eventually it started sliping and i pulled a couple hairs out :( but other than that i would definetly buy it again! (once i run out) :)</li>
            <li> These are great and hold in to your hair very well. I was very happy with this product and did not know what to expect. They are easy to use and I still have many more when the mood strikes to put in an extension again.</li>
            <li> The beads I received were all different colors. They work great, but I really wish the whole package was all brown like the title says. I have dark hair and have no use for the blonde/yellow beads. I&#x27;m honestly disappointed, but I only use 6 beads at a time, so I&#x27;m not too upset about it. Although I think next time I will order the beads that are longer so they&#x27;ll sit a little better in my hair.</li>
