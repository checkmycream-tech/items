            <li>I love, love, love Sleek Look by Matrix.</li>
            <li>My hair is always silky and smooth and couldn&#x27;t be anymore manageable!  </li>
            <li>I was always told to use more than one shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Eh, nothing outstanding to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Including many U.S.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>matrix smoothing system 2 conditioner works great and leaves my hair very soft and shinny.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job than the $23 tube of Enjoy (tm)</li>
            <li>I always shop for the best price on Amazon &amp; have received great service, even from the 3rd party sellers (pay attention to shipping charges from 3rd parties).</li>
            <li>I have tried so many smooth products and non frizzy products</li>
            <li>it easy when it is untangled so easily.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t brush as easily either after conditioning....left a bit tangled.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair that knots easily</li>
            <li>So smooth that it can be tricky trying to put it up in clips that doesn&#x27;t slide out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using Sleek Look for almost 15 years and my hair always looks silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Also it smells really lovely and fresh.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get it completely smooth and frizz-free, but it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li>and I loved the scent &amp; that it left my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real straight and can look puffy and fly away sometimes.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes your hair nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>I first started using this product about 2-3 years ago after a good friend of mine with similar textured hair suggested it, and people actually complimented me on how good and healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product especially if you get highlights pretty often .</li>
            <li>Hair Mask which is only good for about 10 applications.</li>
            <li>I used a cocktail worth of things, but this is an important part of the cocktail.</li>
            <li>Without it my hair is super frizzed out.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to spend money on a product, it&#x27;s going to be the conditioner because that is by far the most important step in maintaining curly hair.</li>
            <li>It might be more effective if used with the other Matrix Sleek products in a system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;that keeps my hair nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it flat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and feel it&#x27;s worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other products promising the world, &amp; always come back to this one - still the BEST!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best for when my hair is beginning to to look dry and needs some extra TLC.  </li>
            <li>For many years prior to the release of SLEEK LOOK, I had tried dozens of conditioners in attempts to manage my fine, brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Pricier but worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products including salon and drugstore brands, and I&#x27;ve found that this one works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I tried Sleek for a while, and found that it does nothing more for my hair than most other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I can feel the difference in my hair right after washing off this product.</li>
            <li>It made it feel super soft and moisturized, especially after I showered, and I loved that.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry, brittle hair really soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>highly recommend (the original orange bottle</li>
            <li>One of the other one I use which is also excellent is the Paul Mitchell extra strength shampoo and the conditioner which I highly recommend as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It is better when you use it with the same brand shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so your hair does better than just using the same one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more frizzy and unmanageable, and I can&#x27;t stand it, so I&#x27;m going back to it despite the price.</li>
            <li>My hair is something I&#x27;m pretty picky about</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well and keeps your hair feeling smooth and not dried out.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>But now that a year has gone by, I can definitely tell a huge difference in my hair after switching.</li>
            <li>, it makes the bathtub really slippery.</li>
            <li>I got very speedy shipment and delivery.</li>
            <li>and this conditioner really does make my hair silky.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Used this product for years and it is gentle but cleans.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the entire SLEEK LOOK line but have used the conditioner and shampoo routinely since the company first created them, and can say that beyond a doubt they are some of the best hair products on the market for smoothing troubled hair and leaving normal hair soft and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>It is discontinues and we are always looking for the older versions.</li>
            <li>, I was sent older style bottle</li>
            <li>I mainly use the shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, it is the only conditioner I have used for several years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner if you are needing something that smooths out your hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying the shampoo along with it.</li>
            <li>Product smelled old!!  </li>
            <li>I have over-processed, thick, curly hair which tends to have a mind of its own and this conditioner helps keep me sane.</li>
            <li>I have colored blonde hair and this is the only conditioner that makes my hair feel smooth and adds to the health of my hair.</li>
            <li>The Beauty Supply salesperson said it was the best conditioning product by Purology (tm) and that I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Sleek Look works much better than any conditioner I have tried in the past 15 years.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is the best product for people who have very dry tangled hair and hard to comb after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Used with the shampoo, it makes my hair very soft and naturally shiny</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and gives it a lustre.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it to have a fruity smell, but its scent is actually very subtle and most adults might prefer it just the way it is!  </li>
            <li>have intermittently tried other conditioners that make huge promises but they all fall short in comparison.</li>
            <li>But now it seems like a completely different product or a new formula.</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t mess with success.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair past my booty and needed something that would make my hair more shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the prices here are hard to beat and certainly make it more affordable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li>Although sometimes hard to find in stores, definitely worth ordering offline!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it every time I  shampoo as my hair can get to soft and loose</li>
            <li>I have crazy out of control hair and this certainly helps to smooth it out.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> Although sometimes hard to find in stores, definitely worth ordering offline!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it every time I  shampoo as my hair can get to soft and loose</li>
            <li> I have crazy out of control hair and this certainly helps to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than many of the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; products which don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Also, when I rubbed the conditioner in, I felt tiny hard crystal-like pieces in my hair which I thought was glass or plastic at first.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every penny (you can even just buy the conditioner and use your normal shampoo and it will still help your hair.)</li>
            <li> I have super thick long hair and my hair is on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great, does the job.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It also makes it sleek and shiny, but the only downside is that I havent noticed any less breakage or less split ends, but I havent found a conditioner that really makes a difference with that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not unhappy with it, but I&#x27;m not willing to fork over my hard earned money for a product that doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and color it every 5 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried local conditioners and after 5 years of use, sleek look conditioner is STILL preferred over all other conditioners.  </li>

            <li> I have long and very thick, very coarse, mainly 3C hair with some other textures mixed in.</li>
            <li> this one actually works and does not weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a poor recent graduate, and while this definitely isn&#x27;t the most expensive item on the market, it was a bit over my budget.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product for a very long time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still have half of this bottle left.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this conditioner to me since my hair was very dry.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is very long, below her butt, and brushing out snarls and tangles was overwhelming and painful before we found this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair rough and very dry and the product smells like Plastic/clay.</li>
            <li> Works a little bit but not the same at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like tiny hard sugar crystals in the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> oh just be careful</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day, and I never have a problem with dryness.</li>
            <li> All other shampoos and conditioners build up in my hair, but not this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair past my booty.</li>
            <li> However, about a year ago, I switched to Tresemme and tried out a few other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> This appears the conditioner is made by the Matrix Sleek line yet the odor is a little displeasing.  </li>

            <li> My stylist recommended this product a few years ago and I have used it off and on since then.</li>
            <li> live in HOT HUMID nasty Florida</li>
            <li> A really small amount of it does wonders to my hair, and the brushing process takes less than a minute.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner is less than to be desired!</li>
            <li> Has heavy, thick, black hair and conditioner leaves less \\&quot;frizzled\\&quot; hair even after hair dries.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t, but still hard pieces ~ as if the manufacturer missed a step in the mixing process.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have to say Matrix&#x27;s Sleek Look Conditioned is better than any conditioner I have ever tried. It does a better job than the $23 tube of Enjoy (tm) Hair Mask which is only good for about 10 applications. I recenlty paid $14 for a 2oz sample bottle of the Pureology Nanoworks conditioner. The Beauty Supply salesperson said it was the best conditioning product by Purology (tm) and that I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed. She was very wrong. The effects of that conditioner are not impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrix Sleek Look works much better than any conditioner I have tried in the past 15 years. It is less expensive than many of the \\&quot;high end\\&quot; products which don&#x27;t work as well. I have been using the SLEEK LOOK since it came out- which was probably 10 years ago. For many years prior to the release of SLEEK LOOK, I had tried dozens of conditioners in attempts to manage my fine, brittle hair. When I discovered SLEEK LOOK shampoo and conditioner, I literally felt I was saved by a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have intermittently tried other conditioners that make huge promises but they all fall short in comparison. I have fine, wavy hair that knots easily if I do not use both the SLEEK LOOK shampoo and conditioner regularly. My girlfriend has thick wavy hair and also loves the SLEEK LOOK shampoo and conditioner. It controls frizz and tangles for both of us. I have not tried the entire SLEEK LOOK line but have used the conditioner and shampoo routinely since the company first created them, and can say that beyond a doubt they are some of the best hair products on the market for smoothing troubled hair and leaving normal hair soft and tangle-free.

            <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair past my booty. It&#x27;s not real straight and can look puffy and fly away sometimes. This conditioner makes my hair very smooth and shiny. So smooth that it can be tricky trying to put it up in clips that doesn&#x27;t slide out of my hair. I highly recommend this conditioner if you are needing something that smooths out your hair. Smells nice too :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is discontinues and we are always looking for the older versions.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner after my stylist recommended it for my split ends. It makes my dry, brittle hair really soft and smells great. It also makes it sleek and shiny, but the only downside is that I havent noticed any less breakage or less split ends, but I havent found a conditioner that really makes a difference with that anyway so I still use this daily, i love it, oh just be careful, it makes the bathtub really slippery.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I shampoo every other day, and I never have a problem with dryness. Used with the shampoo, it makes my hair very soft and naturally shiny (although I use semi-permanent color.) I&#x27;ve never noticed any residue either. Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the prices here are hard to beat and certainly make it more affordable. I got very speedy shipment and delivery.</li>
            <li> We tried numerous conditioners on my daughter&#x27;s hair... Her hair is very long, below her butt, and brushing out snarls and tangles was overwhelming and painful before we found this conditioner.  We think you&#x27;ll love it, too!  I would prefer it to have a fruity smell, but its scent is actually very subtle and most adults might prefer it just the way it is!  It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Amazon from Deal Seekers and it is definitely not what I was expecting. The conditioner leaves my hair rough and very dry and the product smells like Plastic/clay. I asked for a refund and offered to send it back so they could smell it for themselves, but they only offered a 50% refund and didn&#x27;t request a return. I would not order this product from Deal Seekers.</li>
            <li> I used this product for quite a while before but I stopped using it because it is very expensive and they don&#x27;t sell it around the stores around me. On Amazon you even have to pay tax on the top of the price that they sell in Beauty supply stores. Other than that it is the best product for people who have very dry tangled hair and hard to comb after shampooing. It sure makes it ea.sy it easy when it is untangled so easily. I surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase Matrix Sleek from Ulta years ago and I loved the scent &amp; that it left my hair looking healthy. But now it seems like a completely different product or a new formula. Also, when I rubbed the conditioner in, I felt tiny hard crystal-like pieces in my hair which I thought was glass or plastic at first. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t, but still hard pieces ~ as if the manufacturer missed a step in the mixing process. They&#x27;re like tiny hard sugar crystals in the entire bottle.  My hair didn&#x27;t brush as easily either after conditioning....left a bit tangled. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this conditioner to me since my hair was very dry.  It makes my hair smooth, shiny, and soft to the touch.  I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it conditions my hair. I have super thick long hair and my hair is on the dry side. I can feel the difference in my hair right after washing off this product. It makes my hair feel soft and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I pay a bit more for this brand, but it rinses off great and makes my hair easy to comb after showering.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  I spend lots of money on really expensive top of the line conditioners and I always go back to this.  I have over-processed, thick, curly hair which tends to have a mind of its own and this conditioner helps keep me sane. My hair is smooth and soft and manageable. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and color it every 5 to 6 weeks. This is the best Conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Product smelled old!!  Not the bottle in picture, I was sent older style bottle</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, use it after my wen hair care!!! Without it my hair is super frizzed out. I recommend this to everyone.  Pricier but worth it and won&#x27;t do without</li>
            <li> I have very thick, blonde-highlighted hair, and Sleek Look is the only conditioner I ever use! I love how it hydrates without making my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Sleek Look by Matrix. All other shampoos and conditioners build up in my hair, but not this one. I have been using Sleek Look for almost 15 years and my hair always looks silky smooth.</li>
            <li> matrix smoothing system 2 conditioner works great and leaves my hair very soft and shinny.  don&#x27;t use it every time I  shampoo as my hair can get to soft and loose it&#x27;s body but it&#x27;s the best for when my hair is beginning to to look dry and needs some extra TLC.  about every 3rd wash.  I also use use matrix biolage hydratherapie conditioner and switch off with these two products.</li>
            <li> I use this product for years now, and love it! My hear are long, really thin and prone to tangling. Prior to learning about this conditioner, I used to spend a lot of time trying to de-tangle hair after washing them (especially after they were exposed to sea water). A really small amount of it does wonders to my hair, and the brushing process takes less than a minute. Also it smells really lovely and fresh. The 33.8 bottle size saves a lot of money too (compared to what I used to pay for a smaller bottles in my hair salon or supermarket).</li>
            <li> I have very long hair past my booty and needed something that would make my hair more shiny and silky. This product did that. Helps with the tangles too. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and feel it&#x27;s worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> This appears the conditioner is made by the Matrix Sleek line yet the odor is a little displeasing.  The shampoo smells amazing but the conditioner is less than to be desired!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this to me a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been addicted ever since.  I can&#x27;t wash my hair with anything else.  Sleek is the perfect name for this product.  My hair is always silky and smooth and couldn&#x27;t be anymore manageable!  I will keep using this product for a very long time!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! It makes my hair super soft and silky. Although sometimes hard to find in stores, definitely worth ordering offline!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I have very long and dry hair and this conditioner really does make my hair silky.  It is better when you use it with the same brand shampoo.  I was always told to use more than one shampoo/conditioner so your hair does better than just using the same one.  This is one of 3 types of shampoo/conditioners I use.  One of the other one I use which is also excellent is the Paul Mitchell extra strength shampoo and the conditioner which I highly recommend as well.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use with Sleek #1 and have for years.  Best my hair has felt and so manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long and very thick, very coarse, mainly 3C hair with some other textures mixed in. I&#x27;ve tried many, many products including salon and drugstore brands, and I&#x27;ve found that this one works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried so far. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s my holy grail product. It doesn&#x27;t get it completely smooth and frizz-free, but it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve gotten. It might be more effective if used with the other Matrix Sleek products in a system. I first started using this product about 2-3 years ago after a good friend of mine with similar textured hair suggested it, and people actually complimented me on how good and healthy my hair looked. It made it feel super soft and moisturized, especially after I showered, and I loved that. However, about a year ago, I switched to Tresemme and tried out a few other cheaper brands. I&#x27;m a poor recent graduate, and while this definitely isn&#x27;t the most expensive item on the market, it was a bit over my budget. But now that a year has gone by, I can definitely tell a huge difference in my hair after switching. It&#x27;s much more frizzy and unmanageable, and I can&#x27;t stand it, so I&#x27;m going back to it despite the price. If I&#x27;m going to spend money on a product, it&#x27;s going to be the conditioner because that is by far the most important step in maintaining curly hair. I guess you can&#x27;t mess with success.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product a few years ago and I have used it off and on since then. It&#x27;s a great product especially if you get highlights pretty often . My hair is naturally dark brown and I highlight it every 6 weeks to keep it blonde. This conditioner works really well and keeps your hair feeling smooth and not dried out. I highly suggest buying the shampoo along with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years &amp; it does the very best job on frizzy type unmanageable hair.  I guess the manufacturer wanted to re-invent the wheel on this one &amp; came out with a newer version - which I heard, but have not tried, is NOT the same.  I&#x27;ve tried so many other products promising the world, &amp; always come back to this one - still the BEST! I can actually get a comb sliding through my hair after using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend (the original orange bottle formula)this product!  P.S. I always shop for the best price on Amazon &amp; have received great service, even from the 3rd party sellers (pay attention to shipping charges from 3rd parties).</li>
            <li> Product works, but not well enough to justify the price paid. I have very thick, long, curly hair that has been colored.  I have tried a myriad of different products in my lifetime, always looking for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;.  I tried Sleek for a while, and found that it does nothing more for my hair than most other products I&#x27;ve used.  Thus, I cannot say that I would buy this product again. I&#x27;m not unhappy with it, but I&#x27;m not willing to fork over my hard earned money for a product that doesn&#x27;t impress me.</li>
            <li> The Matrix Sleek Look line is by far the best line I&#x27;ve ever used. I mainly use the shampoo &amp; conditioner. It will work for anyone, but especially if you have curly hair prone to frizz, like mine, you want to try it. I worked in a beauty supply store for a while so I&#x27;ve tried it all, and have not found any store level or salon level product that compares. Especially good for color treated hair to help moisturize. Expensive but worth every penny (you can even just buy the conditioner and use your normal shampoo and it will still help your hair.) I love it!</li>
            <li> This is sometimes hard to find in the stores. I love this conditioner, it is the only conditioner I have used for several years. Well worth the money. I have crazy out of control hair and this certainly helps to smooth it out. I used a cocktail worth of things, but this is an important part of the cocktail.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have been using it for years. It makes my hair soft and gives it a lustre.</li>
            <li> It is good for my hair</li>
            <li> Eh, nothing outstanding to say about this product. Not bad, not great, does the job.&lt;br /&gt;But I went back to Nexxus Humetrex Conditioner instead.&lt;br /&gt;Still have half of this bottle left.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m told anyway,, The conditioner is ordered in the U.S. and \\&quot;drop shipped\\&quot; to South America by my freight forwarder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried local conditioners and after 5 years of use, sleek look conditioner is STILL preferred over all other conditioners.  Including many U.S. brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked what was liked best about this conditioner and the following items were mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Has heavy, thick, black hair and conditioner leaves less \\&quot;frizzled\\&quot; hair even after hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad this conditioner isn&#x27;t sold in Colombia.  Although it might be, haven&#x27;t checked lately.</li>
            <li> I have colored blonde hair and this is the only conditioner that makes my hair feel smooth and adds to the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner in the past and I decided to start using it again. It really is great for my curly hair. It definitely makes your hair nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I wish Matrix would not have discontinued it. Please get them to bring this formula back on the market.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 5+ years and it is the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many smooth products and non frizzy products&lt;br /&gt;and this one actually works and does not weigh down my hair&lt;br /&gt;I live in HOT HUMID nasty Florida and this is the only thing&lt;br /&gt;that keeps my hair nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it flat&lt;br /&gt;in the process.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product at a great price. My hair is something I&#x27;m pretty picky about and I am perfectly happy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like salon quality purchase. Diluted conditioner. Works a little bit but not the same at all. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years and it is gentle but cleans.  I straighten my hair and color it so need something kind to wash with.</li>
