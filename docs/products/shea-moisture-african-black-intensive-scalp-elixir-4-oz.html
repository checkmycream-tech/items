    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome if you&#x27;ve got an itchy scalp and can&#x27;t contain those fingers&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great scalp moisture for men as well!</li>
            <li>Very happy now!</li>
            <li>guess what, this is the BEST product I have ever used on my scalp.</li>
            <li>but this elixir is the best I have ever ran across.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for those suffering with eczema</li>
            <li>Great product for dermatitis!  </li>
            <li>This pairs great with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliant</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>The reviews were great.  </li>
            <li>I spray it between my braids twice a week and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great</li>
            <li>This combo works amazing!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff brilliant to stop the itching in my scalp I tent to put this on in the morning.</li>
            <li>This brand makes good conditioners though.</li>
            <li>This is good as a refresher</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I got a prescription for the non-steroid cream and this spray does better on the eczema than the prescription!</li>
            <li>After using this product for over a month, it has worked amazingly.  </li>
            <li>I hope these products continue to be available, because they work great for me.</li>
            <li>It took about three uses of the s/c/elixir before he saw the amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Any product that contains Shea butter is perfect for me and my natural loced hair&lt;</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>Once shaken, it looks really magical, haha.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make more products with willow bark.</li>
            <li>I use this for scalp irritations and it always makes it feel better.</li>
            <li>My Dermatologist has even given up on me as she says there is nothing more she can give me.  </li>
            <li>cover the crack with a spritz of this spray, top it with a zinc oxide ointment like Burt&#x27;s Bees diaper rash cream or your drugstore zinc ointment for under $7.</li>
            <li>AND, in reading the label - this truly IS sulfate free.  YAY!    </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s chemical free!</li>
            <li>It works like magic to quell the nagging itchiness and to moisturize his flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I again suggest SM and this time he was more receptive.  </li>
            <li>More water based.</li>
            <li>so you can use it at anytime and many times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>No odor or residue after, which I love.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this would be a nice way to calm my scalp between showers</li>
            <li>Very mild.</li>
            <li>I use to use Tea Tree Oil on my scalp and it works fine as well</li>
            <li>Then the product would be sound.</li>
            <li>SheaMoisture&#x27;s website has free shipping on $35+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 30 yrs of eczema is over--steroid free without parabens.</li>
            <li>But this product did a great job of ridding of the itch without the after burning sensation that Scalpicin left.</li>
            <li>This spray isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>used this a lot more when I first got the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>product is REALLY worth it!</li>
            <li>However, with each use, the itching diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great spray when my hair is in braids and my scalp gets dry.</li>
            <li>But, it is not an elixir that treats true scalp issues.    </li>
            <li>fast shipping love the product</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it though, as the good stuff forms a sediment down at the bottom.</li>
            <li>The fragrance dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product; a shea butter product that stops the itch instantly, without an over bearing odor.</li>
            <li>This potion keeps my husband&#x27;s itchy scalp calm.  </li>
            <li>This natural remedy worked much better.  </li>
            <li>But, they can and very cleverly write it in WITHOUT A PERCENTAGE!</li>
            <li>Oh, that&#x27;s right, because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.    </li>
            <li>Again, I wanted this product to be great, but it simply falls way, way short.    </li>
            <li>I have really itchy eczema on the back of my head that flares up once in a while, and this product is amazing at relieving the itch.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water and the product has 0 scent.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it actually made my scalp even MORE itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big Shea Moisture fan (I use the Manuka Honey s/c/mask) and have been using their products for about a year and really love them.  </li>
            <li>I used this product to try and reduce the pain from the hot spots that I get as a result of having Seborrheic Dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Love it, it not only gives your hair that fast moisture</li>
            <li>I live in an area with very hot and humid summers</li>
            <li>It actually makes my flakes more prominent and makes it harder for me to remove them when I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>but I needed something in between washes as I only wash my hair every other day and when I&#x27;m extra flakey and itchy this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I truly think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on because of how cheap it is (relative to the size and all organics of it).</li>
            <li>As my scalp has cleared up, I don&#x27;t really need it as much.</li>
            <li>I really bought this for my skin.</li>
            <li>Yea.... Um this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I know other reviewers have stated that this product has truly helped them with their scalp problems, but for me this product is more of a nuisance rather than a reliever.</li>
            <li>I do this because washing your hair less often &#x3D; better hair.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I think this is a mostly aqueous (water) solution and nothing more.</li>
            <li>Yet, Tea Tree Oil is listed on the packaging label as one of the main reasons why this product would work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works super well for just starting out on dandruff treatment</li>
            <li>I definitely will purchase more of this in the future it was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend these products and the elixir in particular.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it is a little strange&lt;</li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff and it really makes his hair soft after use.</li>
            <li>After lots of looking on the internet and even going to a dermatologist, I was told I had scalp inflammation from many years of perms and just plain over processing of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All the Walgreens in my area have stopped selling this as Shea Moisture has come out with 2 new lines of hair care.</li>
            <li>closed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After long exposure to water, I use 2 spritzes of the spray, top with the zinc oxide ointment and a dry skin lotion.</li>
            <li>Instantly the itch stopped and by the next morning my scalp was no longer red and most of the flakiness was gone.  </li>
            <li>My scalp gets very itchy and flaky, but not dry.</li>
            <li>While I was jumping for joy and anxiously awaiting the arrival of this spray, it has turned out to be a major let down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mixed-race man with dry skin, so a lot of hair products don&#x27;t work right for me.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and provides instant comfort to sufferers of Psoriasis and other skin and scalp disorders.</li>
            <li>I mention &#x27;clear&#x27; because oils have colors as well.</li>
            <li>This product has 0 grainy feeling and is completely clear.</li>
            <li>and I do applaud the company for putting no harsh chemicals in the product.</li>
            <li>Then, put a whole bunch of essential oils (tea tree, lavender, burdock root, neem oil, ect.)</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural</li>
            <li>Nothing, so far, has taken away the itch.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hair elixer because I keep my natural hair braided and after about a week I begin to see danduff flakes.  </li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t believe this was true in the other review I had read!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost $30 with tax for the same size, but it does have a higher concentration of essential oils and Salycilic Acid -- 2%)</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for relaxed hair (unless you blow dry immediately after) but it really does wonders.</li>
            <li>My scalp is always itchy and dry so this really helped ease the itch.</li>
            <li>But again, nothing incredibly major.</li>
            <li>The essential oils only work in relatively high concentrations.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a \\&quot;general</li>
            <li>5 drops of tea tree oil can take over an entire room, yet there&#x27;s no hint of it in a CLEAR 4 oz bottle?</li>
            <li>Finally, the bottle itself is not conducive to spraying onto your scalp directly.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next day with the bleeding crack completely</li>
            <li>I had to deep condition my hair and lather it with coconut oil before my hair was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li>have been chemical free a little over a year now and opted to wear sew ins which can still cause my scalp to dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition with the African black soap... shampoo and conditioner, then spray this on my scalp while my hair is still wet, and it INSTANTLY feels better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave a weird film on your hair, so don&#x27;t get super ovezealous if your hair is freshly cleaned</li>
            <li>and I mean huge odors/fragrances (tea tree oil and seem oil as examples).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference fruition other products I use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my (normally dry and frizzy) hair really soft too.  </li>
            <li>My bleached hair, which is very dry and tends to be frizzy was soft and shiny without being greasy when I combed it through.  </li>

            <li> I had to deep condition my hair and lather it with coconut oil before my hair was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> have been chemical free a little over a year now and opted to wear sew ins which can still cause my scalp to dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition with the African black soap... shampoo and conditioner, then spray this on my scalp while my hair is still wet, and it INSTANTLY feels better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave a weird film on your hair, so don&#x27;t get super ovezealous if your hair is freshly cleaned</li>
            <li> and I mean huge odors/fragrances (tea tree oil and seem oil as examples).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference fruition other products I use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my (normally dry and frizzy) hair really soft too.  </li>
            <li> My bleached hair, which is very dry and tends to be frizzy was soft and shiny without being greasy when I combed it through.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, charcoal powder is deep black, so if this product is perfectly clear, it must have trace amounts.</li>
            <li> Therefore ALL ingredients listed after it must have extremely trace amounts -- Tea Tree Oil (a known great essential oil for scalp problems and the worst part is, it&#x27;s very inexpensive essential oil.</li>
            <li> The only thing that has ever helped my dry scalp in the winter.</li>
            <li> It works while hair is wet, but it has water as a main ingredient, so I don&#x27;t use it on dry Black hair.</li>
            <li> It does provide a tiny bit of comfort due to the aloe.</li>
            <li> And the other 1% is various vitamins and minerals AND SALICYLIC ACID.</li>
            <li> Seriously embarrassing, and it was really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and the indredients</li>
            <li> He then lets his hair air dry.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his dry, itchy and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> However, this worked wonders on my dry scalp, which was always itchy and flaky.</li>
            <li> While I still do feel as though this product is pretty much a waste of money for those of whom have true scalp issues, Shea Moisture does leave out all bad, synthetic products.</li>
            <li> So, if the 3rd ingredient listed contains such a small amount, imagine the rest of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> purchased the entire black soap line from SheaMoisture</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It smells like African black soap.</li>
            <li> It was hard to spray on my scalp where I needed it, but I ended up saving the old Scalpicin bottle and just swapped products and everything turned out like a charm!</li>
            <li> Your hair dries as if you had only sprayed a little water in this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS expensive but really, really worth it&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist, and spent loads of time and $$ searching for scalp relief.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said my scalp also has small red scales.</li>
            <li> (like there is in every other type of dandruff/scalp treatment).</li>
            <li> used it in conjunction with the other SheaMoisture products&lt;</li>
            <li> but i do suffer from eczema on other part of my body.</li>
            <li> Then put Salicylic Acid at 2% as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> &quot; so it&#x27;s extemely hard to get to the scalp even with short hair.</li>
            <li> It constantly burns and if I scratch to hard, it bleeds and then flakes up to form a scalp.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s by definition of Aloe, less than 1%, probably much less.    </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale then went back and bought 6 more bottles after I saw what it did for the eczema and horrific dandruff</li>
            <li> He also uses the SM Black Soap shampoo and conditioner and he uses this elixir after shampooing when his hair is damp.  </li>
            <li> Elixir\\&quot; is just not true.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have had the worst sore spot in the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I kinda wish it was a little moisturizing, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Nothing debilitating, but my scalp itches all year round.</li>
            <li> But, Aveda&#x27;s product comes with relatively harsh preservatives and the ingredient \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> If they revamp the formula, it would truly be a blessing even if it meant the price to go up, in my humble opinion.    </li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all he needs.  </li>
            <li> He massages the elixir into the roots of his hair and then lets it sit for a few minutes before combing his damp hair into the desired style.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make his hair look oily and it takes a few minutes to soak in, but after that, it&#x27;s undetectable.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I do itch it, some flakes come down usually.</li>
            <li> &quot; Unfortunately, this product was a major flop.    </li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s 2%.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product, it&#x27;s really harsh!</li>
            <li> After using these three products for a month, he has no more itches.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be hard to find at stores anymore.</li>
            <li> and even have a hard time sleeping at night</li>
            <li> no good.  </li>
            <li> because I was so sick and tired of constantly having dandruff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you have to go through a transition period where you&#x27;re basically a greaseball.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s useless in preventing dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The spray and the shampoo help to relieve these random tender spots and the irritation throughout my scalp</li>
            <li> And these products aren&#x27;t expensive either.  </li>
            <li> It also fails to reduce the pain in any way.</li>
            <li> I have to use my wife&#x27;s conditioner or my scalp itches like crazy.</li>
            <li> Seems almost impossible considering 6-7 ingredients produce pungent/aromatic scents</li>
            <li> it is so bad.  </li>
            <li> but it lasts as well and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> I sprayed this all over my scalp and not being dramatic, but this elixir is a wonder!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product as it does almost nothing to stop the itching.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> While I was jumping for joy and anxiously awaiting the arrival of this spray, it has turned out to be a major let down. I have been examined thoroughly both by lab tests and by a renowned dermologist and both say my scalp has some psoriasis and dandruff. Nothing debilitating, but my scalp itches all year round. Also, when I do itch it, some flakes come down usually. My dermatologist said my scalp also has small red scales. But again, nothing incredibly major. Altogether though, my scalp itches all year. So, I was finally hoping to find my \\&quot;Holy Grail.\\&quot; Unfortunately, this product was a major flop.    I am an ingredient junkie and I do applaud the company for putting no harsh chemicals in the product. Sadly, I think this is a mostly aqueous (water) solution and nothing more. Please let me explain before you disagree.    The first ingredient is water and the product has 0 scent. Seems almost impossible considering 6-7 ingredients produce pungent/aromatic scents and I mean huge odors/fragrances (tea tree oil and seem oil as examples). Yet, Tea Tree Oil is listed on the packaging label as one of the main reasons why this product would work. 5 drops of tea tree oil can take over an entire room, yet there&#x27;s no hint of it in a CLEAR 4 oz bottle? I mention &#x27;clear&#x27; because oils have colors as well. Also, CHARCOAL POWDER is listed before the essential oils. This product has 0 grainy feeling and is completely clear. Obviously, charcoal powder is deep black, so if this product is perfectly clear, it must have trace amounts. Therefore ALL ingredients listed after it must have extremely trace amounts -- Tea Tree Oil (a known great essential oil for scalp problems and the worst part is, it&#x27;s very inexpensive essential oil. *Tea Tree, Plantain Enzyme and Shea ALL come after charcoal powder.    And to the people who do get relief, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because you probably get relief from the Aloe because it&#x27;s soothing. Same reason why we put Aloe on sunburns. But to call this an \\&quot;Intensive Scalp Elixir\\&quot; is just not true. It does provide a tiny bit of comfort due to the aloe. But, it is not an elixir that treats true scalp issues.    The bottom line is I truly think this company is playing its customers for fools. I think it&#x27;s almost all water and aloe vera juice and that&#x27;s it. Neither of which do a lick to cure or even stop itchy scalp. Here&#x27;s where the bombshell is people: Aloe Vera Leaf Juice is 99% water! And the other 1% is various vitamins and minerals AND SALICYLIC ACID. Notice how there is no mention of percentage of Salicylic Acid (like there is in every other type of dandruff/scalp treatment). Usually it&#x27;s 2%. But, they can and very cleverly write it in WITHOUT A PERCENTAGE! Why? Because it&#x27;s by definition of Aloe, less than 1%, probably much less.    So, if the 3rd ingredient listed contains such a small amount, imagine the rest of the ingredients. I truly think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on because of how cheap it is (relative to the size and all organics of it). Instead, \\&quot;Shea Moisture\\&quot; why don&#x27;t you actually put your name brand - Shea Butter Extract - as the 2nd ingredient? Then, put a whole bunch of essential oils (tea tree, lavender, burdock root, neem oil, ect.) while remaining all organic? The essential oils only work in relatively high concentrations.    Then the product would be sound. Then put Salicylic Acid at 2% as the active ingredient. Then, you&#x27;d actually do your customers a service. I feel like the money I paid for this was stolen because it&#x27;s (probably) 99% water.    Finally, the bottle itself is not conducive to spraying onto your scalp directly. It&#x27;s just a \\&quot;general sprayer,\\&quot; so it&#x27;s extemely hard to get to the scalp even with short hair. (See Aveda Scalp Remedy. That is the only product that has worked for me. It&#x27;s almost $30 with tax for the same size, but it does have a higher concentration of essential oils and Salycilic Acid -- 2%) But, Aveda&#x27;s product comes with relatively harsh preservatives and the ingredient \\&quot;fragrance.\\&quot; Again, I wanted this product to be great, but it simply falls way, way short.    While I still do feel as though this product is pretty much a waste of money for those of whom have true scalp issues, Shea Moisture does leave out all bad, synthetic products. If they revamp the formula, it would truly be a blessing even if it meant the price to go up, in my humble opinion.    Post Scriptum: The first FIVE ingredients do NOTHING (except the small percentage of Salicylic Acid) to stop/help/prevent scalp issues. Why would you put Willow Bark in? It acts similarly to aspirin, not anti-dandruff and the like. Oh, that&#x27;s right, because it&#x27;s pretty inexpensive.    Kudos if you read all of this. Prospective customers with \\&quot;real\\&quot; scalp issues, I would recommend staying away. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff and it really makes his hair soft after use. This pairs great with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome if you&#x27;ve got an itchy scalp and can&#x27;t contain those fingers&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the entire black soap line from SheaMoisture because I was so sick and tired of constantly having dandruff. Seriously embarrassing, and it was really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I used this a lot more when I first got the shampoo and conditioner. As my scalp has cleared up, I don&#x27;t really need it as much. However, it was a LIFESAVER in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair every 5-6 days. I do this because washing your hair less often &#x3D; better hair. Unfortunately, you have to go through a transition period where you&#x27;re basically a greaseball. This stuff works soooo well for relieving the itch&lt;br /&gt;Spray it wherever it itches. Be generous. Make sure you shake it though, as the good stuff forms a sediment down at the bottom. Once shaken, it looks really magical, haha.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a weird film on your hair, so don&#x27;t get super ovezealous if your hair is freshly cleaned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;Works super well for just starting out on dandruff treatment&lt;br /&gt;I used it in conjunction with the other SheaMoisture products&lt;br /&gt;It IS expensive but really, really worth it&lt;br /&gt;It smells like African black soap. I love the smell, but it is a little strange&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive on Amazon. SheaMoisture&#x27;s website has free shipping on $35+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is REALLY worth it!</li>
            <li> It did what it promised my scalp feels moisturized (by the way I have 4c hair)</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Make more products with willow bark. Great exfoliant</li>
            <li> Great scalp moisture for men as well!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Appears to be hard to find at stores anymore. I hope the company never discontinues it!</li>
            <li> fast shipping love the product</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have dry scalp and the indredients inside help relieve my scalp</li>
            <li> Love this stuff brilliant to stop the itching in my scalp I tent to put this on in the morning. I definitely will purchase more of this in the future it was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> love it! helps my scalp iritation</li>
            <li> I use this for scalp irritations and it always makes it feel better. This is my third bottle, and I am a regular customer now.</li>
            <li> I have to use my wife&#x27;s conditioner or my scalp itches like crazy. I was very disappointed in this product as it does almost nothing to stop the itching. I have tried it several times either at night or in the morning so I feel like I have given it a chance. I have even used it repeatedly during the day but if it works at all it does not last. I like that it is natural but if it does not work i should just use dirt.</li>
            <li> This has not worked as well I I had hoped.  The reviews were great.  I have psoriasis and, although, along with the spray of the same product, I have gotten rid of the flakes and plaque, I have not gotten rid of the itchiness.  I itch 24/7 and even have a hard time sleeping at night it is so bad.  I have tried over 25 different types of shampoos and sprays and creams.  Nothing, so far, has taken away the itch.  My Dermatologist has even given up on me as she says there is nothing more she can give me.  Edit.  After using this product for over a month, it has worked amazingly.  It takes away the plaque AND itching.  Very happy now!</li>
            <li> This is a great spray when my hair is in braids and my scalp gets dry. I find it irregularly at the store so I decided to purchase it online. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for relaxed hair (unless you blow dry immediately after) but it really does wonders.</li>
            <li> My hair itched incessantly. I sprayed this all over my scalp and not being dramatic, but this elixir is a wonder!!! Instant relief. This will be a staple in my product collection.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very itchy and flaky, but not dry. I live in an area with very hot and humid summers and I was hoping this would be a nice way to calm my scalp between showers but unfortunately it actually made my scalp even MORE itchy. This brand makes good conditioners though.</li>
            <li> I really bought this for my skin. Every season change, the eczema on my hands flares up in itching, skin cracks and sometimes infections. For $12 at Walgreens, I decided to give this a try as opposed to the $50 steroid cream that doesn&#x27;t have a generic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My technic: cover the crack with a spritz of this spray, top it with a zinc oxide ointment like Burt&#x27;s Bees diaper rash cream or your drugstore zinc ointment for under $7. Seal the crack with a bandage and go to sleep. I woke up the next day with the bleeding crack completely closed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After long exposure to water, I use 2 spritzes of the spray, top with the zinc oxide ointment and a dry skin lotion. I use Kiss My Face Honey and Calendula body lotion. This combo works amazing! My 30 yrs of eczema is over--steroid free without parabens. I am giving the spray a try on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I got a prescription for the non-steroid cream and this spray does better on the eczema than the prescription! All the Walgreens in my area have stopped selling this as Shea Moisture has come out with 2 new lines of hair care. They pulled some existing product and replaced this one. Boo.</li>
            <li> I had been using Scalpicin forever because I have issues with an itchy scalp, even with SheaMoisture shampoo and conditioner. But this product did a great job of ridding of the itch without the after burning sensation that Scalpicin left. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the spray bottle. It was hard to spray on my scalp where I needed it, but I ended up saving the old Scalpicin bottle and just swapped products and everything turned out like a charm!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair elixer because I keep my natural hair braided and after about a week I begin to see danduff flakes.  This is good as a refresher but it&#x27;s useless in preventing dandruff.  Would not recommend because it doesn&#x27;t do what the bottle says it does.  You can also purchase this at Target stores for the same price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite what I thought it would be. I was looking for moisture assistance</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target along with the shampoo and conditioner. I have really itchy eczema on the back of my head that flares up once in a while, and this product is amazing at relieving the itch.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of stuff in the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; shampoo aisles - I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist, and spent loads of time and $$ searching for scalp relief. A lot of the shampoos and products advertise that they are soothing and sulfate-free (I think the sulfates aggravate the itch) but when I read the label, they have still used sulfate-like products.  Sadface.    One day, I happened across this line of products in the \\&quot;ethnic hair\\&quot; section of Target.  I shampoo and condition with the African black soap... shampoo and conditioner, then spray this on my scalp while my hair is still wet, and it INSTANTLY feels better.  The shampoo and conditioner leave my (normally dry and frizzy) hair really soft too.  AND, in reading the label - this truly IS sulfate free.  YAY!    I hope these products continue to be available, because they work great for me.</li>
            <li> I have tender spots and spots that are sometimes visibly red and irritated throughout my scalp. I&#x27;ve never gotten a diagnosis but i do suffer from eczema on other part of my body. The spray and the shampoo help to relieve these random tender spots and the irritation throughout my scalp</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and provides instant comfort to sufferers of Psoriasis and other skin and scalp disorders.</li>
            <li> Amazing product; a shea butter product that stops the itch instantly, without an over bearing odor. Any product that contains Shea butter is perfect for me and my natural loced hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This product and the matching shampoo are wayyy to drying for my hair.  After using this, my hair just broke and broke and broke!  I had to deep condition my hair and lather it with coconut oil before my hair was back to normal.  Do not use this product, it&#x27;s really harsh!</li>
            <li> The only thing that has ever helped my dry scalp in the winter. The only local place (Walgreens) had it for a short time, but I can not find locally anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale then went back and bought 6 more bottles after I saw what it did for the eczema and horrific dandruff I have.  Instantly the itch stopped and by the next morning my scalp was no longer red and most of the flakiness was gone.  My bleached hair, which is very dry and tends to be frizzy was soft and shiny without being greasy when I combed it through.  I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo and treatment out there including one from Aveda which cost almost $30 also my dermatologist prescribed some cream but nothing has made a difference like this.  I&#x27;d use it just for the way it leaves my hair even if I didn&#x27;t have dandruff.  Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough and I love that it&#x27;s chemical free!</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have had the worst sore spot in the top of my head. It constantly burns and if I scratch to hard, it bleeds and then flakes up to form a scalp. After lots of looking on the internet and even going to a dermatologist, I was told I had scalp inflammation from many years of perms and just plain over processing of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been chemical free a little over a year now and opted to wear sew ins which can still cause my scalp to dry out.&lt;br /&gt;After looking through Walgreens and running across this product, I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Well guess what, this is the BEST product I have ever used on my scalp. I spray it between my braids twice a week and my scalp feels great. I use to use Tea Tree Oil on my scalp and it works fine as well but this elixir is the best I have ever ran across.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product line for ethnic women.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those suffering with eczema</li>
            <li> This potion keeps my husband&#x27;s itchy scalp calm.  It works like magic to quell the nagging itchiness and to moisturize his flaky scalp.  He also uses the SM Black Soap shampoo and conditioner and he uses this elixir after shampooing when his hair is damp.  Just a few drops is all he needs.  He massages the elixir into the roots of his hair and then lets it sit for a few minutes before combing his damp hair into the desired style.  He then lets his hair air dry. It doesn&#x27;t make his hair look oily and it takes a few minutes to soak in, but after that, it&#x27;s undetectable.  The fragrance dissipates quickly.  After using these three products for a month, he has no more itches.  But as a precaution, he still uses them.  He&#x27;s convinced that the itching will return if he uses something else.  He tried two prescription medicines but neither worked well.  This natural remedy worked much better.  And these products aren&#x27;t expensive either.  I&#x27;m a big Shea Moisture fan (I use the Manuka Honey s/c/mask) and have been using their products for about a year and really love them.  My hair has never looked better.  When my hubby started having an itchy scalp, I suggested SM.  However, after trying Head and Shoulders and T Gel, he decided to go to the dermatologist.  Of course, the prescriptions didn&#x27;t do anything at all and he had an allergic reaction to one of them.  I again suggest SM and this time he was more receptive.  It took about three uses of the s/c/elixir before he saw the amazing results.  However, with each use, the itching diminished significantly.  By the third time, the itching was gone.  I guess the results you get with SM depends on what&#x27;s causing the problem.  But for him, it worked like a charm.  It was just what he needed.  So I highly recommend these products and the elixir in particular.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product for his dry, itchy and flaky scalp.  It works wonders for him!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference fruition other products I use. More water based.</li>
            <li> Works well, helped with the stubborn flakes and itchiness.  It is very light so you can use it at anytime and many times throughout the day.  Leaves ZERO residue and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy (I didn&#x27;t believe this was true in the other review I had read!).  Your hair dries as if you had only sprayed a little water in this.  I use this in conjunction with Head &amp; Shoulders, Clinical Strength.  The shampoo is great but I needed something in between washes as I only wash my hair every other day and when I&#x27;m extra flakey and itchy this is perfect.  Very mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed-race man with dry skin, so a lot of hair products don&#x27;t work right for me. However, this worked wonders on my dry scalp, which was always itchy and flaky. I used this conservatively every day for a couple of weeks, now I&#x27;m flake-free. No odor or residue after, which I love.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that stops the continuous itch of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love it, it not only gives your hair that fast moisture but it lasts as well and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all</li>
            <li> Yea.... Um this stuff really works. My scalp is always itchy and dry so this really helped ease the itch. I kinda wish it was a little moisturizing, but I still like it.</li>
            <li> Great product for dermatitis!  Tried prescription shampoo and oil...no good.  I no longer use shampoos with parabens or sulfates.  This spray isn&#x27;t cheap but I wish this product came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It works while hair is wet, but it has water as a main ingredient, so I don&#x27;t use it on dry Black hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product to try and reduce the pain from the hot spots that I get as a result of having Seborrheic Dermatitis. This elixir does not work for me. It actually makes my flakes more prominent and makes it harder for me to remove them when I wash my hair. It also fails to reduce the pain in any way. I know other reviewers have stated that this product has truly helped them with their scalp problems, but for me this product is more of a nuisance rather than a reliever. This product simply does not work for me.</li>
