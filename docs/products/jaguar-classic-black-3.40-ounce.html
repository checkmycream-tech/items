            <li>Very very nice.</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>good buy.</li>
            <li>smells good ..</li>
            <li>Its a nice smell that stays for about 4 or 5 hours..</li>
            <li>then its a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^^ that was my original preview.</li>
            <li>smells amazing, girls love it.</li>
            <li>To sum up, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any one who is looking for a fresh and pleasant perfume.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it to death.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes that my husband wears.</li>
            <li>You need to remember that not every cologne fits every person, but this one works excellent for me and it is a good everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell on my husband.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Anyway the fragrancy lasts enough in the wear that I use, so for me is ok, but if you have a better smell, maybe you are not going to be happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap, high quality and very strong too</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>This is a great deal at the price, smells like it should and lasts just as long as it would if bought from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about colognes, when go to shop one, I test large number and still mostly come out unsatisfied!</li>
            <li>After trying over 7 different famous colognes, this is perhaps my favorite.</li>
            <li>And every time he wears it he gets loads of compliments and it&#x27;s very reasonable priced!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great, everyday cologne, this does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>get my taste, I also like Tsar very much.</li>
            <li>Other brands don&#x27;t last 5 minutes on your body, but this here is a great, robust, lasting smell that captures the opposite sex in your corner for good!</li>
            <li>Also, it does last most of the day.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll most definitely benifit you in the women department.)</li>
            <li>This cologne is great smelling and it last long.</li>
            <li>He first got this as a christmas gift from a family member some years ago</li>
            <li>I bought tha same lotion one year ago in a mall shop and is different from this one, because the quality of the bottle in this case is not as good as the first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting, and very nice perfume maybe not sophisticated but for every day wearing is enough.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is handy and one push makes that a lot of perfume is applicate in one shot.</li>
            <li>as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>delivery fast.</li>
            <li>Real talk</li>
            <li>Close favourite to #1 favourite of Classic Gold.</li>
            <li>A fragrance worthy of the big cat-------You will feel like the King Of The Beasts or &amp;#34;Born Free&amp;#34; when applying this scent-------</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is nothing other than a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>What can I say, you never know how these products will actually fare after the first couple of time one uses it.  </li>
            <li>and I bought a bottle for my 14 year old brother</li>
            <li>Moreover, it is supposed to be a French made which I really doubt, unless the perfumes&#x27; factories over there have lost their distinctive taste for excellence.</li>
            <li>, i bought a few as a present for my relatives from europe :)</li>
            <li>you would thinks that its fake because of the price, but the smell is so good</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this particular cologne, and boy did I hit it big.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find it on sale for around $20; however it doesn&#x27;t worth buying it for even less than $5.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Definitely have to purchase this again in the near future.</li>
            <li>Actually, so far, Tsar and this classic black Jaguar are the only two colognes that have attracted me, have not yet found a third one!!</li>

            <li> The item looks fake as hell  and the smell doesn&#x27;t even stay 10 mins</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be worn for a business meeting or on a casual day.</li>

            <li> Smells good and I got compliments from the ladies. Must be good!  Also, it does last most of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought tha same lotion one year ago in a mall shop and is different from this one, because the quality of the bottle in this case is not as good as the first. Anyway the fragrancy lasts enough in the wear that I use, so for me is ok, but if you have a better smell, maybe you are not going to be happy.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this I get at least 2 compliments a week from women of every age, young and old. I&#x27;m 28 and I bought a bottle for my 14 year old brother and he&#x27;s even says it gets him attention. (Not saying that&#x27;s what were looking for but it&#x27;ll most definitely benifit you in the women department.)</li>
            <li> This cologne smells awesome!! I absolutely LOVE it to death. Only thing is.. it really doesn&#x27;t last very long. That&#x27;s the only thing about it that&#x27;s not likable.</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that my husband wears. It has a woodsy manly scent. It is hard to find this scent locally and if I am able to find it, it&#x27;s very expensive. This is a great deal at the price, smells like it should and lasts just as long as it would if bought from a department store.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and undamaged. I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It smells like Chrome  Legend which is stronger than this.</li>
            <li> Its a nice smell that stays for about 4 or 5 hours.. Not an wonderful fragance but Im happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wow! This is an exceptional cologne! Other brands don&#x27;t last 5 minutes on your body, but this here is a great, robust, lasting smell that captures the opposite sex in your corner for good! A MUST BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great.... delivery fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband years ago and it&#x27;s one of his favorites.  And every time he wears it he gets loads of compliments and it&#x27;s very reasonable priced!</li>
            <li> A fragrance worthy of the big cat-------You will feel like the King Of The Beasts or &amp;#34;Born Free&amp;#34; when applying this scent-------</li>
            <li> So This fragrance has an incredible scent. Very very nice. I bought it for my dad for father&#x27;s day and he loves it. Definitely have to purchase this again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about colognes, when go to shop one, I test large number and still mostly come out unsatisfied! This one caught my attention. The fragrance is very good. I like it very much. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;To get my taste, I also like Tsar very much. Actually, so far, Tsar and this classic black Jaguar are the only two colognes that have attracted me, have not yet found a third one!!</li>
            <li> smells amazing, girls love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap, high quality and very strong too</li>
            <li> After trying over 7 different famous colognes, this is perhaps my favorite. I recommend it for men of all ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be worn for a business meeting or on a casual day. Lasts at least 6-7 hours.</li>

            <li> fer the price, is such an awsome product!!!! everybody like it, i bought a few as a present for my relatives from europe :)</li>
            <li> great smell. good buy. would recommend.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this particular cologne, and boy did I hit it big. This has a great smell for a great price. Real talk it&#x27;s worth it and I will be doing a reorder</li>
            <li> smells good .. i highly suggest you buy it. you would thinks that its fake because of the price, but the smell is so good so if its really fake then its a great one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^^^ that was my original preview. Beware from this product, its faker than Nicki Minaj&#x27;s hair. The item looks fake as hell  and the smell doesn&#x27;t even stay 10 mins</li>
            <li> This cologne is nothing other than a cheap product. You&#x27;ll find it on sale for around $20; however it doesn&#x27;t worth buying it for even less than $5. Moreover, it is supposed to be a French made which I really doubt, unless the perfumes&#x27; factories over there have lost their distinctive taste for excellence. To sum up, I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any one who is looking for a fresh and pleasant perfume.</li>
            <li> What can I say, you never know how these products will actually fare after the first couple of time one uses it.  In the case of his product I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
