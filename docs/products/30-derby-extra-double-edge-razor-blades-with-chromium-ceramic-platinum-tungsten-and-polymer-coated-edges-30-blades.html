    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these Derby blades - as I knew I would be.  </li>
            <li>These Derby blades have been incredible, not one nick from them yet!</li>
            <li>The Derby blades were the best of the lot on my face.</li>
            <li>For a novice safety razor shaver, these blades are the best.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed and have ordered another 150 blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are great at a great price.  </li>
            <li>both of which give me a great shave.</li>
            <li>packaging is your biggest concern about a product, you know there&#x27;s good product in there.</li>
            <li>Recommended for beginning shavers, or anyone looking for a good workhorse blade.</li>
            <li>A shaving soap that goes in a mug with a boar&#x27;s hair brush isa good choice.  </li>
            <li>Work well, just as good as the ones they replaced.</li>
            <li>these blades were MUCH better!  </li>
            <li>They are as good or better than store bought brands.</li>
            <li>Feather&#x27;s get a lot of kudos, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the best shaves of my life with these blades so far.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>they glide over the skin better, they seem sharper, and take the hair off while leaving my epidermis intact.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I shave with both edges each time I shave.  </li>
            <li>If you have never used a safety razor, be sure to take your time when you shave.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>Great value for money and really great blades, they last a good 5-7 shaves each personally</li>
            <li>Good Starter Blade, fairly forgiving and lasts a long time I can get 7 Quality Shaves, but I don&#x27;t have Barbed Wired for a beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to nick yourself if you hurry.  </li>
            <li>You may find them comfortable for your skin.</li>
            <li>what a mouthful!) are a fantastic deal.  </li>
            <li>They give a clean smooth shave with no razor burn and nicks.  </li>
            <li>Last Weekend using a Superlather (Brush, soap AND cream)in an attempt for a seventh shave, which was successful</li>
            <li>Derby makes several kinds, but these seem to work the best for me and my old Gillette razors.</li>
            <li>Each blade is good for 5 shaves provided you use both sides of the blade equally.  </li>
            <li>Now, Sharp&#x27;s another story: shave one is great; shave two cuts my face to ribbons.</li>
            <li>Derby Extra razors are the perfect razors for a beginning double edge shaver.</li>
            <li>Of course, everyone&#x27;s face is, well, unique, right?</li>
            <li>It was great to find a place where they are much less costly.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to be a touch more environmentally conscious and get a paper sleeve full of razors instead of six plastic</li>
            <li>B0017QSZY4 Parker 22R Double Edge Butterfly Safety Razor and 10 Blades]], and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth learning to use a safety razor, but take your time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the blades and the price point, however, most other blades I&#x27;ve used come in a pack that allows you to remove a new blade without opening the package (you push the new blade out through a slit in the end), then the old blade goes into a space in the bottom.</li>
            <li>And I get more or less just as many shaves from Derby or Feather.</li>
            <li>Fine blades for one shave and just about cheap enough</li>
            <li>I buy these again, I will also purchase a blade safe (and possibly buy these in the 200-unit pack.</li>
            <li>My Dad and I both tried them, and the results were mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>The Merkurs had a tendency to chop up my face, the Personna were much better, but I still got nicks fairly regularly.</li>
            <li>OK blades and they last a long time and they&#x27;re very sharp out of the box, but they just don&#x27;t give me as good or as sweet a shave as the Derbys.</li>
            <li>If I skip a shaving day and shave carefully with these blades, I get a very smooth shave w/o knicking.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;ll consider switching potentially to find a razor with more economical packaging.</li>
            <li>I bought my soap at Whole Foods, but you can find them on Amazon too.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice shave and can use quite a few times each.</li>
            <li>ill probably keep experimenting with different blades to see if there is an better, but for now, these do a good job indeed.</li>
            <li>The glycerin soap is necessary, because you need more lubrication with the single blade safety razor to prevent nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but these Derby blades are much better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s saying alot; my face is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to modern day razors.  </li>
            <li>My only regret was that I just bought a new alum block before these Derby blades came in!</li>
            <li>Slow and careful will give you an amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>Modern shaving cream has alcohol in it that actually dries too quickly and loses the lubrication needed with the old fashioned razor.  </li>
            <li>I use one side for the right side of my face and the other for the left.</li>
            <li>&quot; I went back to the old style razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased a straight razor about a year ago that came with 100 Sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to use the shaving cream you would use with the fusion or other modern day razors.  </li>
            <li>I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot.</li>

            <li> i was about to give up on wet shaving until i decided to try a different blade.  </li>
            <li> I bought these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> These blades seem to keep their edge longer than other double edge no-name blades I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Derby blades come in little plastic mini-tubs that are individually wrapped, not to mention the blades are also individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave means I only need to shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I leave the razor out to dry after loosening the razor so the blade doesn&#x27;t rust, but I don&#x27;t think these blades will rust with the coated edges.  </li>
            <li> They stay sharp for a long time, but don&#x27;t nick my face like some of the others.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure the lather helped), I haven&#x27;t had a bad blade yet, they are my (inexpensive) workhorse blade</li>
            <li> I found these blades to be rough, and to tug on hairs.  </li>
            <li> After twenty years, you will have spent $350 on blades plus $30 on soap</li>
            <li> Try a few different ones and figure out which works for you.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t seem too sharp, and left my face raw after going against the grain of my beard.  </li>
            <li> Whether the Sharp blades dulled over time or if they&#x27;re just lower quality</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be-</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve tried others: Feather, Sharp</li>
            <li> They stay sharp after two or three shaving sessions.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to change blades that often in the morning; just finding the razor is hard enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been switching between Merkur and Personna blades.</li>
            <li> Razor preference is an odd thing.  </li>
            <li> So much less plastic in the landfills, etc.  </li>
            <li> I bought on Craigslist for less than $10.  </li>
            <li> Doing the math means that each blade cost me under 25 cents so each time I shave, it costs me less than a nickel for the blade.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see, less than 25 cents or $2.77 each.  </li>
            <li> Blades no better than any other.  </li>
            <li> I put them in a little ziplock bag to keep moisture out, and they hold up forever.  </li>
            <li> If you shave everyday of the year, you will use 73 of these blades which will cost you about $17.50.  </li>
            <li> With the Fusion, if you shave everyday and change your razor every five days and use a shaving cream that costs $3.00 for 6 ounces like they have here on Amazon, you will pay around $5600 for 20 years of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Derbys are as sharp on shave one, but on shave three they give me a much less irritating shave.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever get any knicks with these blades as happened with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Hard to decide which I want to buy, huh?  </li>
            <li> These blades are dull and hurt my face.  </li>
            <li> I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin.</li>
            <li> Our business uses these blades but to get them at the local drug store is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> And at the price per lot, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

            <li> These blades seem to keep their edge longer than other double edge no-name blades I&#x27;ve used before. I get 2-3 shaves on each edge before I decide to flip the blade. So I get about 7 shaves per blade.    I&#x27;ve had the best shaves of my life with these blades so far.</li>
            <li> Great value for money and really great blades, they last a good 5-7 shaves each personally and I hardly ever get any knicks with these blades as happened with others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love these razors. And at the price per lot, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I haven&#x27;t had to buy a razor in months!</li>

            <li> Derby Extra razors are the perfect razors for a beginning double edge shaver. I had tried my razor with the factory Merkur blade, and I got a half-decent shave, but I had to be very careful because the blade would randomly dig into my skin. I switched to Derby, and what a difference a Derby makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are very sharp- my wife tested them gently dry-shaving a bit of leg hair, and they left an instant bald spot. However, they&#x27;re not too sharp as some people have said a Feather blade can be- I can even press down on my razor just a bit in trouble areas to get really close results, and not have to worry too much about slicing myself open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting out with double edge shaving, do yourself a favor and pick up some Derby blades.

Recommended for beginning shavers, or anyone looking for a good workhorse blade.</li>
            <li> I had been using a combination of Feather, Merkur, and Wilkinson blades when I decided to go for a stock-up of these blades.  I&#x27;m very happy with the blades and the price point, however, most other blades I&#x27;ve used come in a pack that allows you to remove a new blade without opening the package (you push the new blade out through a slit in the end), then the old blade goes into a space in the bottom. However, these come in a case that does have a space for used blades, but you have to swing open an attached gate to access the slot both to gain access to the blades and the used blade slot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy these again, I will also purchase a blade safe (and possibly buy these in the 200-unit pack.</li>

            <li> i bought a parker razor with some shark blades, [[ASIN:B0017QSZY4 Parker 22R Double Edge Butterfly Safety Razor and 10 Blades]], and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the blades.  they didn&#x27;t seem too sharp, and left my face raw after going against the grain of my beard.  i was about to give up on wet shaving until i decided to try a different blade.  these blades were MUCH better!  they glide over the skin better, they seem sharper, and take the hair off while leaving my epidermis intact.  ill probably keep experimenting with different blades to see if there is an better, but for now, these do a good job indeed.</li>
            <li> Good Starter Blade, fairly forgiving and lasts a long time I can get 7 Quality Shaves, but I don&#x27;t have Barbed Wired for a beard.  Last Weekend using a Superlather (Brush, soap AND cream)in an attempt for a seventh shave, which was successful I did not feel ANY stubble for 28 HOURS!!  NO Nicks, Cuts or Weepers (I&#x27;m sure the lather helped), I haven&#x27;t had a bad blade yet, they are my (inexpensive) workhorse blade</li>
            <li> My only regret was that I just bought a new alum block before these Derby blades came in! I&#x27;d previously been switching between Merkur and Personna blades. The Merkurs had a tendency to chop up my face, the Personna were much better, but I still got nicks fairly regularly. These Derby blades have been incredible, not one nick from them yet! I feel these will be my go-to blades from now on.</li>
            <li> Razor preference is an odd thing.  Each person seems to develop the brands and styles that they like.  I found these blades to be rough, and to tug on hairs.  You may find them comfortable for your skin.</li>
            <li> In trying to be \\&quot;green\\&quot; I went back to the old style razor. So much less plastic in the landfills, etc.  These blades are great at a great price.  I put them in a little ziplock bag to keep moisture out, and they hold up forever.  Gives a nice shave and can use quite a few times each. They are as good or better than store bought brands.</li>
            <li> For s barber&#x27;s shave - A must!</li>
            <li> Our business uses these blades but to get them at the local drug store is very expensive.  It was great to find a place where they are much less costly.</li>
            <li> Do you want to spend $5600 for 20 years of shaving or $400 for the same number of shaves?  Read on to find out how to save over $5000 for the next 20 years on shaving.  The Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blade with Chromium-Ceramic-Platinum-Tungsten and Polymer Coated Edges(wow, what a mouthful!) are a fantastic deal.  I paid about $7.00 for 30 blades.  I shave with a Gillete safety razor from the 1960&#x27;s I bought on Craigslist for less than $10.  Each blade is good for 5 shaves provided you use both sides of the blade equally.  That&#x27;s the only drawback to a double edge razor.  If you use only one side, you will think it&#x27;s time to change the blade after 3 shaves.  I make sure I shave with both edges each time I shave.  I use one side for the right side of my face and the other for the left. If you have never used a safety razor, be sure to take your time when you shave.  These blades do not forgive haste.  It&#x27;s easy to nick yourself if you hurry.  Slow and careful will give you an amazing shave.  The closeness of the shave means I only need to shave every other day.  Since I don&#x27;t like to shave on weekends, one blade will actually last me up to two weeks.  I leave the razor out to dry after loosening the razor so the blade doesn&#x27;t rust, but I don&#x27;t think these blades will rust with the coated edges.  This means that these 30 blades may last me over a year.  Doing the math means that each blade cost me under 25 cents so each time I shave, it costs me less than a nickel for the blade.  I will never go back to modern day razors.  The stores put them in locked cases now and on Amazon, the gillette fusion replacement blades are $2.77 each.  Let&#x27;s see, less than 25 cents or $2.77 each.  Hard to decide which I want to buy, huh?  One thing though, you have to shave with a different type of soap.  You don&#x27;t want to use the shaving cream you would use with the fusion or other modern day razors.  Use a glycerin soap.  A shaving soap that goes in a mug with a boar&#x27;s hair brush isa good choice.  There are some glycerin shaving creams out there, but they can be pricey.  I bought my soap at Whole Foods, but you can find them on Amazon too.  The brush can be bought on Amazon or even at Walmart,  Either way, the soap in a mug will last forever.  The glycerin soap is necessary, because you need more lubrication with the single blade safety razor to prevent nicks and cuts.  Modern shaving cream has alcohol in it that actually dries too quickly and loses the lubrication needed with the old fashioned razor.  So to add it up, the soap, mug, and brush costs from $10 to $20 depending on where you purchase it and they will last forever, except for the soap which you may have to replace for about $3.00 every couple of years.  Five shaves for a quarter.  If you shave everyday of the year, you will use 73 of these blades which will cost you about $17.50.  After twenty years, you will have spent $350 on blades plus $30 on soap and you might have to replace your brush once or twice so figure $400 for shaving 20 years.  Of course, since I only shave 3 days a week, I will only spend $200 for 20 years of shaves.  With the Fusion, if you shave everyday and change your razor every five days and use a shaving cream that costs $3.00 for 6 ounces like they have here on Amazon, you will pay around $5600 for 20 years of shaving.  I assumed a 6 ounce can of shaving cream would last two weeks or 14 shaves.  $400 or $5600?  It&#x27;s worth learning to use a safety razor, but take your time.  These blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> These blades are dull and hurt my face.  I now shave with Feather or PolSliver both of which give me a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought these a long time ago. Since then I&#x27;ve tried others: Feather, Sharp, maybe something else, can&#x27;t recall. The Derby blades were the best of the lot on my face. Feather&#x27;s get a lot of kudos, but I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with them. OK blades and they last a long time and they&#x27;re very sharp out of the box, but they just don&#x27;t give me as good or as sweet a shave as the Derbys. And they&#x27;re pricey. I don&#x27;t think the Derbys are as sharp on shave one, but on shave three they give me a much less irritating shave. And I get more or less just as many shaves from Derby or Feather. Now, Sharp&#x27;s another story: shave one is great; shave two cuts my face to ribbons. Fine blades for one shave and just about cheap enough that it&#x27;s ok. But I don&#x27;t want to change blades that often in the morning; just finding the razor is hard enough. Having made the rounds now, I&#x27;m sticking with Derby.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s face is, well, unique, right? So, YMMV. Try a few different ones and figure out which works for you.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for about a year now.  At first I tried the usual store bought brands and after several butcherings, i found these blades.  For a novice safety razor shaver, these blades are the best.  They give a clean smooth shave with no razor burn and nicks.  Very impressed and have ordered another 150 blades.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. They stay sharp after two or three shaving sessions. So I literally have had this pack for a year.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Work well, just as good as the ones they replaced. I cant find the brand that Ive used for years.</li>
