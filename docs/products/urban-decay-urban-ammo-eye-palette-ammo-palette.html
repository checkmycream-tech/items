            <li>I often see her wearing eyeshadows from this palette and tells me how nice it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the sponges that came with it to apply the shades and opt for my own brushes instead.  </li>
            <li>Which is a nice almost greenish gold color.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it at this price versus paying $35 in the store.</li>
            <li>it arrived fast and in great condition</li>
            <li>My favorite is Two Face eye primer.  </li>

            <li>so glad i got it.</li>
            <li>I love the color selection and the shimmer.  </li>
            <li>This makes a lovely gift for someone who enjoys eye shadow.</li>
            <li>The colors don&#x27;t smudge when on and they work best with the primer potion from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Sin awesome highlighted for under brows and above the lid.</li>
            <li>Love it, however, if you don&#x27;t want eyeshadow with lots of shimmer to it, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>but no biggie :)</li>
            <li>I love this pallette.</li>
            <li>I just love their eye shadow.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with \\&quot;Polyester</li>
            <li>These colors are very soft and blend beautifully, but even when I use a primer on my eyelids and set with translucent powder, they tend to crease - A LOT -</li>
            <li>, I always know I will get a great product with vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and pigments are super nice.</li>
            <li>It is a soft shadow, but I use a primer and it stays on great all day.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many great things about Urban Decay&#x27;s shadows</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful shimmer to it and</li>
            <li>Finely milled and velvety.</li>
            <li>The casing is super cute also.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the variety.  </li>
            <li>so obviously this is great quality.</li>
            <li>Great pigment, blending, lasting wear.</li>
            <li>My new favorite palette. :)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was also very impressed with the overall color put out  very vibrant and very pigmented</li>
            <li>Well pigmented, glittery, and stays relatively well even f you don&#x27;t have a good primer.</li>
            <li>colors are even prettier in real life :)</li>
            <li>I use my own eyeshadow brush, and barely have to swipe the palette color I want to get it rich with color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a magnetic closure.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed with the overall texture and blendabilty upon swatching, I realize that the skin on my hand is a bit different than my eyelids, But it gave me confidence in the product.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, I love the smoothness of the product, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is into eyeshadow or just makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow, Before getting this I mostly used browns and creams but after this I don&#x27;t know how I could ever go back!</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant and pigmented!!!</li>
            <li>so pretty!</li>
            <li>It is one of those colors that looks great everyday,</li>
            <li>This is rare for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im able to create looks for any season, natural or smokey.</li>
            <li>Its a nice to have when I&#x27;m wanting a change from the Naked pallets.</li>
            <li>The mirror inside is bigger then in a compact, which is very nice, and the whole Palette is very skinny, which is also a plus.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and stay on well!</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Not the &amp;#34;stripper-body glitter&amp;#34; type glitter, just fine, soft glitter --</li>
            <li>While the product is good, I&#x27;m sure that I can get the same item from some other seller, much faster.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite urban decay palettes!!!</li>
            <li>I would suggest priming your lids first -</li>
            <li>and is very wearable!</li>
            <li>They are of great quality and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush, like many, is standard.  </li>
            <li>I got my first palettes in March.</li>
            <li>And with primer( I use a different brand because it brightens the shadows and sticks better).  </li>
            <li>Nice and 10$ at walmart or other retailers.</li>
            <li>:  Dense, high pigment for rich, lasting color and smooth coverage.  </li>
            <li>I was getting ready to go out one night and put \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; and \\&quot;Mildew\\&quot; on my eyes and \\&quot;Mildew\\</li>
            <li>I really like the colors here</li>
            <li>So much easier than supermarket brands</li>
            <li>I also want to add they look great on a more mature eye, so if you shy away from shimmer because of that, you might want to give these a try!</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite all around  eye shadow kit.</li>
            <li>The wand kind of sucks</li>
            <li>Smog is in the palettes (a staple color I use most everyday).</li>
            <li>other colors are fabulous too depending on what look you want.  </li>
            <li>I use this palette everyday:) i get compliments like no other!</li>
            <li>Application is smooth and stays for a half a day before reapplication.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay really has smooth, long lasting eyeshadow that does not crease!</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>I especially like the colors - light to dark, everyday into evening looks easily created.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use the color called \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; more than the rest because it&#x27;s a great base for all of the other colors in the palette.</li>
            <li>I believe this stems from the dense, high pigment used in Urban Decay&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>I have green/brown combo eyes and can easily get away with using the blue shade, and green shade, and the plum shade.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not a big fan of a couple of the colors in here, but overall I really like this pallet.</li>
            <li>Some of these colors have shimmer, but not extreme, so I look put together and fashionable without looking like I am trying to be</li>
            <li>Glittery colors tend to flake off, so one must be careful not to apply too much to brush or eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this Urban Decay Eyeshadow palette with much excitement as I long any and all Urban Decay products.  </li>
            <li>It is also the right size to put in your purse or small travel bag.</li>
            <li>I use this palette almost daily, and about six months later, the palette barely shows use.  </li>
            <li>will admit that I used up the Chopper long before the rest of the colors, but Urban Decay offers all of their palette colors in individual palettes.  </li>
            <li>A few of the colors are much more glittery than I thought as well, and I found out the hard way.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m just not a big fan of a couple of the colors in here, but overall I really like this pallet.</li>
            <li> Some of these colors have shimmer, but not extreme, so I look put together and fashionable without looking like I am trying to be</li>
            <li> Glittery colors tend to flake off, so one must be careful not to apply too much to brush or eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this Urban Decay Eyeshadow palette with much excitement as I long any and all Urban Decay products.  </li>
            <li> It is also the right size to put in your purse or small travel bag.</li>
            <li> I use this palette almost daily, and about six months later, the palette barely shows use.  </li>
            <li> will admit that I used up the Chopper long before the rest of the colors, but Urban Decay offers all of their palette colors in individual palettes.  </li>
            <li> A few of the colors are much more glittery than I thought as well, and I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> &quot; literally had so much glitter in it that it sprinkled down on my cheeks (and my shirt and my pants!!)</li>
            <li> so pretty, not one complaint.</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> You will need to put toilet paper under your eye when applying.</li>
            <li> It is a little more expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality eyeshadow that will last all day long without fading, flaking, or creasing then this is what you need to buy in addition to their Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> There are several lighter colors that work well for the upper eye, and mesh well with the other colors for the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> so maybe they&#x27;re a little *too* soft.</li>
            <li> will hold your shadow all day long.  </li>
            <li> am also 39 so need to shy away from the super shimmery.  </li>
            <li> They were apologetic and admitted that this delivery was taking longer than expected, but beyond that they were unhelpful.  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;office appropriate&amp;#34; I suppose.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> , they are playful, but be careful, they are GLITTERY!</li>
            <li> Also Oil Slick can double as a liner.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> One big pet peeve of mine are shadows that are hard and crumbly and that don&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time spending a lot of money on makeup, but with Urban Decay products</li>
            <li> This is not true of other companies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About half are shimmer and half have glitter.</li>
            <li> Definatley my everyday makeup</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Urban Decay makes.  </li>
            <li> A small dot worked into each lid</li>
            <li> That said,  I was a tad skeptical to try them  because they are all shimmer shades, but found myself  using these shadows for everyday.  </li>
            <li> , I have yet to be disappointed by Urban Decays shadows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind getting a little crazy with makeup from time to time, but I looked like a Vegas Showgirl, and then it was difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The rest are not as bad, but will leave you shimmery.</li>
            <li> get it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the fallout is just awful.</li>

            <li> I ordered this Urban Decay Eyeshadow palette with much excitement as I long any and all Urban Decay products.  And then I waited and waited.  The estimated delivery date passed, so of course I contacted the seller.  They were apologetic and admitted that this delivery was taking longer than expected, but beyond that they were unhelpful.  While the product is good, I&#x27;m sure that I can get the same item from some other seller, much faster.  So no, I don&#x27;t recommend this buyer.</li>
            <li> Plenty of colors of eye shadow. nice Christmas gift for family and friends that like a choice in eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I love this palette of colors.  I especially love Chopper, which I think another reviewer also adored.  It is one of those colors that looks great everyday, all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other colors are fabulous too depending on what look you want.  The colors have amazingly deep pigmentation.  A little goes a long way.  I have green/brown combo eyes and can easily get away with using the blue shade, and green shade, and the plum shade.  This is rare for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also 39 so need to shy away from the super shimmery.  Some of these colors have shimmer, but not extreme, so I look put together and fashionable without looking like I am trying to be 19.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that I used up the Chopper long before the rest of the colors, but Urban Decay offers all of their palette colors in individual palettes.  This is not true of other companies)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, try this palette.  Enjoy the variety.  And if you fall in love with one or two, you know you can always reorder just those colors.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice palette with pretty colors. The shadows have great color pay off and in an attractive packaging. Excellent! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Perfect colors! Such a beautiful shimmer to it and the colors come on so easily even if you just use your finger! Definatley my everyday makeup</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my brother&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s birthday. She opened it and was absolutely in love with it. She told me she had been wanting it for a while. I often see her wearing eyeshadows from this palette and tells me how nice it is. Well pigmented, glittery, and stays relatively well even f you don&#x27;t have a good primer. This is one of my favorite urban decay palettes!!!</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE this! so pretty, not one complaint. get it, you wont be disappointed. colors are even prettier in real life :)</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Great quality and gorgeous colors. Im able to create looks for any season, natural or smokey. My new favorite palette. :)</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with anything Urban Decay makes.  Great colors and great texture.  Always a win in my book!</li>
            <li> I got this palette 5 days after I ordered it! I&#x27;m glad I found it at this price versus paying $35 in the store. Love the colors and pigments are super nice. This palette is good for anyone! 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> I have heard so many great things about Urban Decay&#x27;s shadows and I finally splurged and bought this palette. The colors are beautiful. I tend to use the color called \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; more than the rest because it&#x27;s a great base for all of the other colors in the palette. One big pet peeve of mine are shadows that are hard and crumbly and that don&#x27;t blend well. These colors are very soft and blend beautifully, but even when I use a primer on my eyelids and set with translucent powder, they tend to crease - A LOT - so maybe they&#x27;re a little *too* soft. A few of the colors are much more glittery than I thought as well, and I found out the hard way. I was getting ready to go out one night and put \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; and \\&quot;Mildew\\&quot; on my eyes and \\&quot;Mildew\\&quot; literally had so much glitter in it that it sprinkled down on my cheeks (and my shirt and my pants!!) I don&#x27;t mind getting a little crazy with makeup from time to time, but I looked like a Vegas Showgirl, and then it was difficult to remove. I ended up finding glitter all over the place afterwards - on my husband, my coat, in the car! Wow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably try Urban Decay again, but I will probably buy it in person at Sephora or something in the future, and will probably not invest in a palette, but rather individual colors after closer inspection. The creasing issue still bugs me, though, so I may still be in search of a perfect eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I tried the TWO FACED makeup line eye shadow and was impressed. Amazon &amp;#34;suggested&amp;#34; this line so I read some reviews and gave it a go. I really like the colors here, they are playful, but be careful, they are GLITTERY! Not the &amp;#34;stripper-body glitter&amp;#34; type glitter, just fine, soft glitter -- so it&#x27;s not really &amp;#34;office appropriate&amp;#34; I suppose. It&#x27;s soft and goes on easily and lasts all day/night, though. :D</li>
            <li> i love this eye shadow! i use every color in this.palette.the colors are beautiful! it arrived fast and in great condition</li>
            <li> I bought this on the suggestion of a makeup artist who swears by Urban Decay shadows.  I now know why.  They are highly pigmented and a little goes a long way.  That said,  I was a tad skeptical to try them  because they are all shimmer shades, but found myself  using these shadows for everyday.  I also want to add they look great on a more mature eye, so if you shy away from shimmer because of that, you might want to give these a try! I would suggest priming your lids first - My favorite is Two Face eye primer.  A small dot worked into each lid will hold your shadow all day long.  I especially like the colors - light to dark, everyday into evening looks easily created.  Hands down my favorite all around  eye shadow kit.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Arrived as advertised and the gift receiver loved it!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the overall texture and blendabilty upon swatching, I realize that the skin on my hand is a bit different than my eyelids, But it gave me confidence in the product.  I also have the Naked 2 palette  I was also very impressed with the overall color put out  very vibrant and very pigmented, I have yet to be disappointed by Urban Decays shadows.</li>
            <li> Good product. I love the color and the glitter. Application is smooth and stays for a half a day before reapplication. However, might need to use a primer in order for glitter to stick.</li>
            <li> UD does it again, amazing palette, cute designs. the colors are so creamy and pigmented as always. im so glad i got it. its a really good combinations of neutrals and colors, amazing buy</li>
            <li> I love the color selection and the shimmer.  The mirror inside is bigger then in a compact, which is very nice, and the whole Palette is very skinny, which is also a plus.  I don&#x27;t use the sponges that came with it to apply the shades and opt for my own brushes instead.  This makes a lovely gift for someone who enjoys eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Urban Decay really has smooth, long lasting eyeshadow that does not crease! It is a little more expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality eyeshadow that will last all day long without fading, flaking, or creasing then this is what you need to buy in addition to their Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion.</li>
            <li> The shades are really beautiful and have great color payoff. Finely milled and velvety. But the fallout is just awful. You will need to put toilet paper under your eye when applying. Especially Maui wowie. Which is a nice almost greenish gold color. But the glitter will get all over your face. Above and below my eyes, there&#x27;s always glitter. The rest are not as bad, but will leave you shimmery. I personally would not purchase again. Clinique has the best eyeshadow I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, I love the smoothness of the product, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody who is into eyeshadow or just makeup. The colors don&#x27;t smudge when on and they work best with the primer potion from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow, Before getting this I mostly used browns and creams but after this I don&#x27;t know how I could ever go back! The colors are very vibrant and stay on well!</li>
            <li> I bought this palette just because of some YouTube makeup sensation was using it, I think it&#x27;s an additional collection for my makeups. Good colors</li>
            <li> i love love love this pallet!!! so pretty! and is very wearable! i use it often and get lots of compliments when i wear! arrived quickly and very happy!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of urban decay products.  They are of great quality and last a long time.  This palette is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 8 various fun-named shades.  Some are glittery, some not.  There are several lighter colors that work well for the upper eye, and mesh well with the other colors for the eyelid.  I use this palette almost daily, and about six months later, the palette barely shows use.  I believe this stems from the dense, high pigment used in Urban Decay&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a built in mirror that is a good size for this compact, though I tend to use my own mirror for putting on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush, like many, is standard.  I use my own eyeshadow brush, and barely have to swipe the palette color I want to get it rich with color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a magnetic closure.  Front cover has neat looking gun and smoke logo in purples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Dense, high pigment for rich, lasting color and smooth coverage.  Can be used wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Glittery colors tend to flake off, so one must be careful not to apply too much to brush or eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product.  I have a hard time spending a lot of money on makeup, but with Urban Decay products, I always know I will get a great product with vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I got my first palettes in March. The colors blended great. And with primer( I use a different brand because it brightens the shadows and sticks better).  I only got to try a trial size of primer potion that I received with another palettes. I don&#x27;t believe it did it justice so I&#x27;m not saying I dislike it. Now back to the product at hand. I got it way faster than it said and everything was in one piece. The wand kind of sucks but if you&#x27;re into makeup a lot grab some eco-tools brushes. Nice and 10$ at walmart or other retailers. Smog is in the palettes (a staple color I use most everyday). Also Oil Slick can double as a liner. Sin awesome highlighted for under brows and above the lid. About half are shimmer and half have glitter. Great starter for sure. Love UD!</li>
            <li> If you like smoky colors than this is the palette for you! It is also the right size to put in your purse or small travel bag.</li>
            <li> Love it, however, if you don&#x27;t want eyeshadow with lots of shimmer to it, this isn&#x27;t for you. It shipped very fast and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this palette everyday:) i get compliments like no other! but i always need to use an eyeshadow primer. but no biggie :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Urban Decay so obviously this is great quality. Great pigment, blending, lasting wear. I&#x27;m just not a big fan of a couple of the colors in here, but overall I really like this pallet. Its a nice to have when I&#x27;m wanting a change from the Naked pallets. The casing is super cute also.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I love this pallette. The colors are so vibrant and pigmented!!! The shimmer in each color is gorgous!!!  There is no matte shdes, it&#x27;s all shimmer!!! I use it alot! I am glad I bought this pallette!!!!</li>
            <li> The best pallet I own- the pigments are very bright and stay on throughout the night</li>
            <li> What can I say? I just love their eye shadow. It&#x27;s just sooo easy to use!! So much easier than supermarket brands and I&#x27;m really glad I gave it a try. A little goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> I am in love with this palette!  The colors are very pigmented and last all day. I have fallen in love with \\&quot;Polyester Bride\\&quot; as an inner corner highlight and \\&quot;Mowie Wowie\\&quot; is a gorgeous lid color!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow because it gives great coverage. It is a soft shadow, but I use a primer and it stays on great all day. Great colors, and very fast delivery.</li>
