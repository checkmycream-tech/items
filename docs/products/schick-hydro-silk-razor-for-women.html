            <li>but I liked them</li>
            <li>The opinions are 100% my own from my experience with Schick Hydro Silk Razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice razor works well</li>
            <li>I also really liked the flexibility of the head of the razor.</li>
            <li>The handle is really nice and the blade moves with your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice that it does come with the shower hanger.</li>
            <li>that it comes with two cartridges and a handy place to hang it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It was nice that I didn&#x27;t need to use soap.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used it 5 times and the lubrication is still effective.</li>
            <li>Cost effective.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve tried Schick Quattro, which I liked</li>
            <li>I also liked the raised design on the handle which allowed the razor to rest on the edge of the tub without the moisture strip coming into contact with the surface.</li>
            <li>A very nice change from the cheap razor.</li>
            <li>As any brand-new razor right from the package will do, during my first usage I got a great shave and my legs looked wonderful.</li>
            <li>i love this razor, its my very favorite one.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave, no nicks, and it has an awesome cream that comes out when you shave, so it&#x27;s super smooth</li>
            <li>I love getting campaigns for products that I really love!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>While I loved Venus razors for the longest time, I think this is better than their blades at this time and the best option I have found recently.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and glides so smooth!</li>
            <li>also feel like I have to apply more pressure for the razor to be effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  </li>
            <li>but I would love to find one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Best razor I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>I got these as a promotion to try and they are by far the best and most efficient razors Ive ever used :-)</li>
            <li>I first have to say the grip is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t very precise.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, close shave, with no razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable</li>
            <li>it was very smooth and gave me a close shave</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Hydro silk because I had never been very satisfied with the closeness of the shave of the Intuition.  </li>
            <li>This razor is the most amazing razor I have used and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am big on my razors and have always found the mens work better but this was an awesome product</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>and I am in love with the razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the trimmer I may still need to get used to it before I get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>The razor is wonderful because it cuts close but also doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin so daily use is no issue.  </li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li>I would like to be able to keep my razor in the shower (in its case of course).</li>
            <li>I looked in the store at many before purchasing this one because I wanted to stop using disposables.  </li>
            <li>Its an Ok razor.</li>
            <li>It gives a super-smooth shave that is comparable to Venus, but is a bit better price-wise.  </li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>My legs feel smooth all day!  </li>
            <li>How many shaves would I get with a disposable?</li>
            <li>I received my BzzAgent box in mid-April (Hooray for free samples!).</li>
            <li>Love the razor so you have to love the blades also</li>
            <li>So much better than those cheaper razors.  </li>
            <li>They give you a nice smooth shave without feeling like you are getting razor burn.</li>
            <li>I had a Gillette Venus before but this one is definitely better.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li>but this one is way better.  </li>
            <li>I love Shick razors.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome that I can shave and trim in the shower at the same time without being electrocuted</li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream either :).  </li>
            <li>My legs have never been this smooth before!</li>
            <li>I was able to recieve this product as part of a campaign for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>(love- keeps it out of reach for my son) -no</li>
            <li>My legs were silky smooth and no nicks!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get to try this out for free.</li>
            <li>Then I was finally able to use the razor.</li>
            <li>It has four blades, which we all know, the more the better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to go longer in between shaving times.</li>
            <li>Even better the package comes with a replacement blade.</li>
            <li>Okay razor.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best  one out there.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice product that leaves your legs feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The Hydro does a better job on my legs than the Quattro, but I agree with the reviewer who commented on the skin pulling.</li>
            <li>Between this and the Venus, I probably like the Venus better but will just switch between the two depending on what&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>But I do like both the Hydro and Venus better than the Quattro.</li>
            <li>I love the swivel head that conforms to those hard-to-shave areas around my knees.</li>
            <li>Even without lotion, my legs felt a lot more moisturized than they did before my shower.</li>
            <li>Way better than all of the ones offered by Venus and Gillette.</li>
            <li>but i love that razor so hopefully this one owrks just as WELL :d</li>
            <li>but I love the Venus Embrace more.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave, lightweight handle.  </li>
            <li>I like this razor, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Some have been better then others.</li>
            <li>Those tend to cut my legs more often.</li>
            <li>If you are really looking for a great quality razor</li>
            <li>If you are really looking for a great quality razor</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing serum.  </li>
            <li>It worked SO much better than the the razor I was using before.</li>
            <li>So I fell for their free sample and have been buying replacements ever since!</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER on armpits,</li>
            <li>Better to the point</li>
            <li>Why are replacement blades $3 more?</li>
            <li>sure about the cost of the blades quite yet.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>which means I can shave faster and it looks better and feels better than before.</li>
            <li>Honestly I got this for free to try out from BuzzAgent</li>
            <li>I must say I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others.</li>
            <li>I love the style of the razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>I have had the Shick Hydro Silk razor for about 4 years now and it is top notch.</li>
            <li>Here are the reasons that I love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is infinitely better than anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li>A more average-sized person probably wouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this razor, though.</li>
            <li>I really love the Schick hydro silk razor.</li>
            <li>I just love it&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li>Their blades work better on me, somehow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Venus razors which were okay</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>The raised design acts more as a guard, keeping the razor from making contact with the skin and preventing a close shave.</li>
            <li>There are many better options on the market that give me a closer shave.</li>
            <li>While I enjoyed the Schick HydroSilk razor</li>
            <li>The serum seems to just pour out when you&#x27;re using it, and it&#x27;s not an enjoyable sight...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVE this razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I was actually able to apply scented lotion directly after a shave!!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair that disappeared from my eyebrows and eyelashes reappeared on my legs lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to grip and feels very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s kind of true.  </li>
            <li>First, the shave itself is noticeably not as good as the Quattro, even with the fifth blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with how many uses I&#x27;m getting out of a single cartridge!</li>
            <li>It is best to keep it upright and in a dry area.</li>
            <li>I use it, and the hydrating strip is awesome because I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn or dry scaly legs.</li>
            <li>You are also able to use the trimmer without water when you have one of those speedy get ready days but still want to look good.</li>
            <li>I easily pulled it off of the disposable handle and fit perfectly on my more sturdy handle :)</li>
            <li>I am so excited I was able to try this product out for free on BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I am so excited I was able to try this product out for free on BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>the end, if you have slower, normal to fine hair growth, this razor will probably be great for you.  </li>
            <li>A great razor for a busy mom.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables work better than this.</li>
            <li>in my hand so comfortably which gives me more control</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more comfortable to use, and doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate her skin.</li>
            <li>So I bought this razor because I got a great coupon in the mail, so I was surprised that even at that value this razor could SUCK so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the disposables I was using.</li>
            <li>I believe the shave is closer and more comfortable with this razor and plan to keep using this brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did arrive very promptly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am petite, and the head of this razor is very large, therefore I found I couldn&#x27;t maneuver it effectively in tricky spots like my knees.</li>
            <li>Having smoother legs for a longer period of time seems like every womans dream come true!</li>

            <li>It gave me a a nice close shave, it really contours to the body I was able to shave everything without getting razor burned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone because I&#x27;ve never had a razor that&#x27;s been so easy to use.</li>

            <li>The handle is ergonomically correct for easy shaving.</li>
            <li>It makes it really easy to shave around your knees</li>
            <li>There are many better options on the market that give me a closer shave.ll not continue to use they Hydro Silk once I&#x27;ve run out of refills, I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>and I always return it to the hanging caddie  that came with it, which hangs easily 2 feet from the shower head.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything to help knock down ingrowns, and this is the best solution combined with PFB Chromabright.  </li>
            <li>I had the amazing opportunity  to try the product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
            <li>The razor is fine</li>

            <li>Gel razors are no my new favorite!</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s important to us girls right?!</li>
            <li>The first shave was ok.  </li>
            <li>I bought these razors after doing research on &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; razor, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited but leery about trying these razors.</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to be chosen for this Bzz Campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife has used these for a long while, and is quite happy with them.</li>
            <li>(I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>super smooth and nick-free.  </li>
            <li>I have never had another razor that shaves as close and looks as clean as the shave that I received with this razor.</li>
            <li>I turned the razor on, and was amazed at how clean a cut the trimmer delivers.</li>
            <li>It to feels nice and smooth and soft and</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried maaannyy different brands.</li>
            <li>I only tried this razor once so far, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>They give me a clean close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>It really makes your legs very smooth .</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Special gel on the blade still there even after shaving, and still seems to be a lot of it.</li>
            <li>He was right!</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tried many razors, but between finding the right shave and the right price, I didn&#x27;t have a true winner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Among the things I liked about this razor was the design of the handle, it fit comfortably in my hand which is a pet peeve I&#x27;ve had with many other razors.</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter &amp; she hasn&#x27;t complained, so I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>and I really do love Schick products, just on this one too much.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and razors are not always kind to it.</li>
            <li>Will have to continue to see how it works before I give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love them, with the five blades, it really reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the \\&quot;Water-Activated Moisturizing Serum for Smooth, Silky Skin\\&quot;- this serum does feel nice and smooth on your legs, however it only lasts a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>so what can you really say, The price was better than at the local market and very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>I feel that I need to come clean: I rarely ever have a need to shave.</li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job and last for several shaves.</li>
            <li>I shaved two days ago and my skin still feel really soft, so much better than when I use the cheap no name brand razors.</li>
            <li>I like the razor although the blades run out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super shaver</li>
            <li>It left my legs nice and smooth with no razor burn.</li>
            <li>The cost of those adds up fairly quickly, so I&#x27;m thankful I no longer have to do this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smoothing strips on this razor wore off way too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s water activated, it depletes rather quickly when you put the razor under some water to rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I got this item free thru BzzAgent and tried it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>She has been very pleased with the shaves and relatively long-life of these razors.</li>
            <li>Take it slowly as not to cut yourself, and make sure you exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I usually use my hubby&#x27;s, but now I have one of my own to love!</li>
            <li>After about 4 days my legs returned to normal... not being able to shave in the summer sucked by the way.</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it because I love Schick and am currently using the Schick Hydro Sensitive Care Razor and love it!</li>
            <li>I love it and am no longer looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>I saw that Schick had come out with a new razor with 5 blades and was supposed to moisturize more, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I love the new &amp;#34;Schick Hydro&amp;#34; It hydroizes as you&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get that the whole point of this razor is moisture, moisture, moisture, but it made me feel pretty slimy on areas I had to go over more than once</li>
            <li>It has a cushiony handle, which makes it easy to grip and a swivel head that allows for a really close shave.</li>
            <li>handle is easy to grip, and I felt that I had a much closer shave in my underarm area with the Schick Hydro Silk(tm) Razor.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, my legs feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>And the hydrating layer slides on immediately after the first shave to keep your legs moistureized!</li>
            <li>I will definitely reccommend this to friends and family and will need to buy more for myself as well!</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold and can be held comfortably many different ways depending on where you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li>Its sleek design fits nicely in my hand and it is easy to grip even when it gets wet.  </li>
            <li>Very good on curves and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>This has to be the best razor I have used, it gives a closer shave and little to no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I got the opportunity to try this razor/trimmer out for free.</li>
            <li>I go to try this product for free thanks to Schick and Buzz Agent</li>
            <li>Thanks schick for sending me a free pack to test out just in time for spring break.  </li>
            <li>Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor does a great job, the only problem I have is the handle is too big to fit in the hold on my shower caddy.</li>
            <li>Very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Schick for letting me try the product for free.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly close enough and is great if you like the 5 o&#x27; clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin feel more silky, smooth and hydrated after I shave</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have more sensitive skin on my legs.</li>
            <li>I shave with just soap and water, and with this razor my legs feel soft and hydrated for days after a shave. :)</li>
            <li>I thought id try it one more time to make sure, and sure enough the same things happened.</li>
            <li>I received one free through bzzagent and enjoyed only having to shave each area once since it had 5 blades.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I would rather razor manufacturers do away with the moisture strips entirely.  </li>
            <li>, I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked getting to try The Schick Hydro Silk razor, I typically only ever buy razors/refills from the Venus collection.</li>
            <li>really feel that there are better options out there if you&#x27;re looking for a new razor!</li>
            <li>The new design is better, with there being an additional metal bar aross each blade level, intended (I assume) to be more gentle for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>and it just slides right over the area you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li>I can skip lotion right after</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not compelled to lotion my legs right after shaving like I used to.</li>
            <li>I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>I suggest you just walk right by this razor</li>
            <li>I suggest you just walk right by this razor</li>
            <li>If you struggle from course hair that can be a pain to make sure you get try the new Schick Hydro silk for smooth clear skin with just one swipe of the blade.</li>
            <li>I loved the close shave I got with this product, it seems like the blade is larger then my normal brand of razor</li>
            <li>The Hydro Silk does not, and I think that&#x27;s the major problem with this razor which is causing so many problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was completely blown away how super smooth and close the shave was with this razor,</li>
            <li>Hydro silk is super smooth, leaves skin soft &amp; no knicks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, The serum dissipates quickly from the razor head, I&#x27;ve only used the razor 5 times tops and most of it is gone</li>
            <li>I was really happy with my shave for the first two times, my legs were left really smooth and they didn&#x27;t dry up after I toweled off.</li>
            <li>every woman should use this razor, its a close long lasting shave with a comfortable grip and a nice suction hanger for the shower!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: blades are pricey, but the experience is worth it if you&#x27;re willing.</li>
            <li>I got such a nice shave with these, very moisturizing and</li>
            <li>I really do have sensitive skin and this razor leaves me with nothing but smooth skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Easy to clean compared to the Quattro, which seemed to clog constantly if I waited a week to shave again&lt;</li>
            <li>The easy grip handles gives you complete control which helps prevent nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave me any razor bumps or cuts and it cut smooth and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Skin clearly much more moisturized, probably a combo of the special gel and the dry skin shaving gel I used.</li>
            <li>I normally get that cheap sack full of basic razors, but got a free sample of this one to try.  </li>
            <li>It hydrates your skin as you shave, is very smooth and cut my shave time by 30 minutes to only 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love!</li>
            <li>I love the new Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love!</li>
            <li>I used one for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>The razor cannot be felt on your skin during use, this was my first concern.  </li>
            <li>My legs have never felt so soft and smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It’s mid-May, and I’M STILL USING THE FIRST RAZOR.</li>
            <li>I’m at least on shave 20-something and still getting great results.</li>
            <li>first time that I used this razor, I was thinking to my self &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li>In fact, I was actually wowed by how smooth the shave was!</li>
            <li>I used the razor for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>What first caught my eye was the handle design.</li>
            <li>I tried this razor for the first time as a bzz agent and since trying them I have changed out my razors at home to be hydro silk for both my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>I went online to see if I could get the blades cheaper but decided to try the razor first before purchasing the replacement heads</li>
            <li>I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li>I first pulled this out of the packaging in haste, as my boyfriends clippers were failing to work</li>
            <li>It has far exceeded my expectations for a razor!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for FREE from BzzAgent in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li>and I thought it worked pretty well...</li>
            <li>It makes my legs extra smooth!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t cut myself with it thus far, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li>My legs feel incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I tried this razor out this morning and really like it!</li>
            <li>Like most extra bladed razors I have tried I get razor burn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have bumps or razor burn even if I go in the hot tub after</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is about these blades, since my husband has the same razor (but for men) and those blades work much better.  </li>
            <li>I must admit is actually does work a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty confident I have found the last brand of razors I will ever need to try.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and had to go over a couple times.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of razors and my skin hates shaving!</li>
            <li>and I dont think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to disposables.</li>
            <li>The trimmer however really makes this product a 10!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but has 2 big flaws.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>And the blade is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>an ok product overall</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most razors out there, but I always come back to Schick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of the Schick Quattro for Women for years, but was willing to check it out.</li>
            <li>The shave was super close, no nicks, no clogged up blades, no bumps, and I even noticed the whole day how much softer my skin was after using them.</li>
            <li>I really actually preferred the shape of the handle on the Hydro Silk, and the shave was close, quick, and incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>lets the razor dry while keeping the blade covered but a suction cup would make it more useful.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth it as it gave me a pretty decent shave.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try the Shick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor from BzzAgent [</li>
            <li>I bought this razor the other day and while it did offer a nice, close shave, it cut me up.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to share with you my schick hydro silk sensitive care&lt;br /&gt;Razor</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these razors to anyone who wants a quick, close shave with silky smooth results.</li>
            <li>I gave it a \\&quot;four\\&quot; because I can only vouch for one type of area - not the whole body, therefore cannot speak to how it will perform for most people who use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get all these positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting all these positive reviews, it&#x27;s like you paid people to write them.</li>
            <li>First of all it gives a very close shave with one pass of the razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The moisturizing tape gets used up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>No more need to run the razor over my underarms more than once to get the desired results - a great change from some of the previous razors I had been using.</li>
            <li>Although it was the same width as others, this razor felt wider and like it covered more area than most other razors.</li>
            <li>Now my options are to go out and buy Hydro Silk blades, go out and buy a Schick Quattro razor, or give up on Schick, buy a new Venus razor and throw away $12 worth of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the blades do not swivel as easily as I&#x27;d like for shaving my legs and such.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the razor it left me with smooth skin</li>
            <li>My old razor&#x27;s cartridges used to rust fairly quickly causing me to have to replace them quite often.</li>
            <li>My skin was certainly softer after shaving, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>, I just thought it would be smart to change it.</li>
            <li>As an avid saver, I&#x27;m always looking for other brands I can use to get the most for my money.  </li>
            <li>Nice little surprise with the suction for keeping it upright in the shower.</li>
            <li>I felt like the Schick Hydro Silk Razor was a great angle for reaching all the tough areas of my legs,</li>
            <li>The 5 blades really do their job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hydrating serum that allows you to have a very close shave</li>
            <li>and that is really unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>So, fast wore and to the  schick hydro silk</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave and really does moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li>Now for real test number 1.</li>
            <li>Real test</li>
            <li>Ready for real test</li>
            <li>the handle is very flexible for bumpy areas like my knees.  </li>
            <li>I have never had such a problem with razor burn and it is not even a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>They provided enough moisture so the blades were smooth against my legs.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Legs and underarms that are as smooth as Barry White&#x27;s voice.</li>
            <li>This razor has so much of that stuff that the blades don&#x27;t encounter any friction</li>
            <li>This razor is premium and very beneficial to my legs</li>
            <li>Also the size of the trimmer head makes it way easier to be as precise as possible.</li>
            <li>I did have to lather up a bit with soap as we don’t buy shaving cream here, but that wasn’t really a bother at all.</li>
            <li>These days I find it harder to get a smooth shave!</li>
            <li>(Maybe because I was more careful there?</li>
            <li>My legs stay smooth and hydrated for days, and after a month I am still using the same razor.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strips work really well, and it gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to use shaving cream either.</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>that I am getting such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>But did not produce as much &amp;#34;hydrating gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am a little worried, but if I need to pay a little more for something that lasts longer and performs better, then it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I recently got a free Schick Hydro Silk razor to use.  </li>
            <li>nothing really else to say.</li>
            <li>but I really like hydro silk.</li>
            <li>grip on the Schick Hydro Silk razor is extremely comfortable and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart even 4 years later.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t talk too much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very prone to nicks and razor burn, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this razor.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does.</li>
            <li>The only draw back to this product is that it didn&#x27;t give me a quite as close shave as I would have liked on my bikini area.</li>
            <li>and I love it, and will never go back to my old one.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes nicely and lasts through a few shaves.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like the Schick Hydro Silk razor because I&#x27;ve been wanting a five blade razor designed for women, but I feel that it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I&#x27;ve expected from a good razor, especially one designed for women.</li>
            <li>I have a Schick quattro that I like very much, but the store was out of blades and I live 50+ miles away from a reasonably sized store</li>
            <li>I live in the hot south and wear shorts a lot during the summer.</li>
            <li>Other than that issue I love the way these are built</li>
            <li>I am tempted to go back to my original razor after this one is used up.</li>
            <li>it cuts, and feels better on skin than a lot of other razors that my wife tried.</li>
            <li>With the Schick Hydro Razor I can now do every other day because with the 5 blades, I&#x27;m able to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>These work a lot better for me than the other brands (Gillette).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that its much cheaper to purchase a new razor every time rather than replacement blades!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the main reason I put off shaving as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Also the hydrating serum around the blades left my skin feeling silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t have to use lotion after shaving like normal.</li>
            <li>It has been quite a while since I have been active on Bzzagent, but boy am I glad I got this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how easy the razor is to hold and that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>: glides smoothly over my skin (much more so than Venus), blades stay sharp (haven&#x27;t changed the blade in a weeks use and it is still sharp), suction cup hanger (pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I like it - nice and smooth - good handle etc, but the clear head where the replacement cartridges snap in gets really cruddy looking after awhile.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to try the version created for sensitive skin through a program by Schick Hydro Sensitive Care razors.</li>
            <li>I always exfoliate first and also use shaving cream for sensitive skin which helps as well.</li>
            <li>I love that its the only tool I need now, and for me at least it worked better on the shorter setting.</li>
            <li>Well maybe not forever, but I&#x27;ve been using the same blades for about a year, shaving my legs and underarms every other day, and I still get a nice smooth finish after only one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I probably would have been happy enough with it, but it really falls short when shaving other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have very sensitive skin and very rarely get razor burn, so this is a big downside for me.</li>
            <li>These are now my new regulars!</li>
            <li>Schick has a new customer for life!</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve just scraped them off (when they&#x27;re wet, you can scrape them off easily with a finger nail).</li>
            <li>You need to use a slightly different angle, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a razor with such a soft smooth shave before.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to schedule in my &amp;#34;shave day/time&amp;#34;, I can just do it quickly during a regular shower.</li>
            <li>Convenience is key!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor is my favorite and I will continue to use it until it falls apart at which point I will likely replace it with the same thing (or newer version).</li>
            <li>It was really frustrating because I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables which have done a much better job.</li>
            <li>I think the main problem lays in the design of the moisturizing strip.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend....</li>
            <li>all, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>cost of refill razors is too high.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I was originally using a Venus Embrace, but I wanted to try out some different razors because I have sensitive skin on my legs that are prone to bumps and redness.</li>
            <li>I have been using another razor type (the one with a ring of soap around it) for years, and easily give it 5 stars, but I bought this at the supermarket the other day because they didn&#x27;t have what I needed.</li>
            <li>I am super excited to say that Schick Hydro Disposables have made that fear a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>and I really need that with my busy schedule and being in a rush all the time.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to shaving and tends to leave bumps no matter how much gel I use.</li>
            <li>Although refills are a bit pricey, this is defiantly worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Pretty good razors but get a weird mass buildup of the built in moisturizing gel that interferes with shaving.</li>
            <li>razor isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense</li>
            <li>I needed a few more words.  </li>
            <li>I do find trying to get the 5-blade head to make good contact is a bit awkward, but the result is definitely better than what you can get with a simple 3-blade razor.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strip also makes it glide so smoothly, I felt like it really cut down on the time it took to shave.</li>
            <li>I hardly feel it, but I get a super close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This keeps the moisture strip from turning into a big puddle of goo, a huge plus in my book, especially since this is what frustrates me the most about my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was ok for shaving my armpits where the skin is less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The Quattro has those vertical metal pieces that cross the blades, right?</li>
            <li>However, I am also cheap, so waxing and other hair removal methods are off the table.</li>
            <li>I think smooth shave, long lasting blades would have really summed it up.</li>
            <li>and it works like it&#x27;s brand new)</li>
            <li>The constant moisture that is released from the moisture strip is fantastic, and after two weeks of use, it stills has the same amount of moisture released.</li>
            <li>I just never really understood why I should pay more for a reusable one when I get about the same shave from a disposable.</li>
            <li>This handle is cheap, all plastic, and without any extra force nor dropping it, it broke on the 3rd shave.  </li>
            <li>irritation (I have VERY sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin so not ending up with bumps</li>
            <li>even if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have had problems before with irritated underarms after shaving, but with the Shick Hydro Care Sensitive Care Razor, no irritation!</li>
            <li>I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>razor irritated my underarms the first and only time I used it there.  </li>
            <li>I have tried and used so many brands in the past.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the replacement blades are a complete ripoff!</li>
            <li>I stopped using Schick in the past because of the wires that crossed from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>I doubt any other razor can be better - even in the future!</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp, long lasting, and the conditioning on the top AND the bottom allow easy shaving with only water- even on sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I can usually feel stubble within hours of shaving, but with product, it feels like super smooth and silky even the next day.  </li>
            <li>My armpits went from bumpy and dark to smooth and clear and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I have no personal need for the trimmer, my boyfriend has full access to it and has already gotten into the habit of using the trimmer for his facial hair.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a new razor since, well, lets just say it&#x27;s been a long time!  </li>
            <li>It becomes dull quickly and I have more problems than I have had with any other razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to really bad razor bumps and irritation but didn&#x27;t have much suffering after using these lol.</li>
            <li>The clear head of this one seems like a bit of a water trap.</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with a shower stick on accessory like the old one did.</li>
            <li>My skin is suuuuuper sensitive to shaving.</li>
            <li>but my skin is just THAT sensitive.</li>
            <li>so it REALLY gets a close shave that takes a bit longer to grow back in.</li>
            <li>It completely ran out of \\&quot;moisture dots.\\</li>
            <li>and I never feel like I can shower fast enough</li>
            <li>-NO knicks or cuts (so far)</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;d say that I didn&#x27;t really like is the serum that comes on the razor..</li>
            <li>/&gt;*the combination of the moisture strip and 5 blades leaves my legs SO soft.</li>
            <li>With my Venus Embrace, I am able to get at least 5-6 days of use.</li>
            <li>but I tend to have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the schick men&#x27;s razors, they have sharper blades that last longer and no GOOP!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am pron to razor burn..</li>
            <li>I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free though Bzzagent a few days ago.</li>
            <li>I use the Embrace because the moisture strip around the blades help protect my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but by the end of the day my legs were itchy and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>I was sent the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor as part of a program run by Schick</li>
            <li>The kit (but not the actual razor packaging) suggested using it with shaving gel/cream, which I did, but I did discover that because of the serum you could later do a quick touch up on a spot you may have missed with only wetting the razor and still getting a decent glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am usually pretty particular about my razors due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The cost of this razor is a little pricey, but I think its well worth it!</li>
            <li>but when I tried this I never got any more nicks or cuts, even when shaving my bikini area, and no more razor bumps or irritation!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I would never use this razor when I&#x27;m going to have a day at the pool or a night with my boyfriend, It does a quick acceptable shave for an average day where a minute amount of stubble won&#x27;t make me feel</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I would never use this razor when I&#x27;m going to have a day at the pool or a night with my boyfriend, It does a quick acceptable shave for an average day where a minute amount of stubble won&#x27;t make me feel</li>
            <li>I also noticed that since it seems to be more gentle than the average razor, my legs arent getting dried out like they used to.</li>
            <li>Overall Schick Hydro Silk is a decent razor.</li>
            <li>For the $6 I paid, I really am only going to end up getting 1 decent shave</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro Silk razor is the first Schick razor that I have actually wanted to go back to each morning.  </li>
            <li>It gets all the hair on the first stroke and leaves behind a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I bought a pack of those and turns out it is the EXACT SAME head, only with a cheaper handle.</li>
            <li>Shaving has always been such a chore, I have light skin and dark leg hair</li>
            <li>Went back to my old (cheaper)razor that I will just by new refill cartridges for.</li>
            <li>Got a free sample off of Bzzagent this past week</li>
            <li>I just used the razor with my normal shower gel, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I usually have a hard time getting a smooth shave in the shower, but it&#x27;s so easy with this one.</li>
            <li>(With the Quattro it was easy to go too hard and get nicked, so going light-handed is what I&#x27;m used</li>
            <li>The 5-blade design took me a few shaves to get used to, but it&#x27;s a super close shave.  </li>
            <li>DID keep my very sensitive skin from getting irritated, so it definitely met the expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty comparable to their other razors.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>It was the first non-disposable razor I ever bought (when I was 15), but I basically switched to the Quattro a few years ago to try something new.</li>
            <li>know before you buy, these blades dull SO QUICKLY, and you have to buy the Hydro Silk replacement blades, which for the price, if you like this razor, you might as well just buy a new razor</li>
            <li>I have never liked razors that were to light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a review on Amazon for the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor yet, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt; Being a woman of European descent, and taking after my Dad (who my husband affectionely calls &amp;#34;the werewolf), I am a hairy gal.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I got what I expected.</li>
            <li>Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® Razor gives me SUCH</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it awhile and it is barely dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I went to the store and checked out the different Schick razors and decided on this one because it said that it was for sensitive skin on the packaging.</li>
            <li>I barely get a close shave</li>
            <li>Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been using a Venus Embrace (5 blade) to both deal with my coarse hair and sensitive sking.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a very close shave without being rough on your skin while shaving.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old razors again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am definitely throwing my old razors</li>
            <li>They claim \\&quot;designed specifically for the curves of a woman&#x27;s body, the Schick Hydro Silk Razor features five independent curve sensing blades to follow your natural shape.</li>
            <li>It seems that I have to shave my legs everyday because my hair grows back so quickly.</li>
            <li>I was recently invited to participate in a BzzCampaign to try the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor, and was curious to try something new.</li>
            <li>the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in</li>
            <li>the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in</li>
            <li>and I have not had a problem using this razor at all, no dry skin!</li>
            <li>it made my legs extra smooth without shaving cream which is kinda hard  </li>
            <li>blade just is NOT SHARP enough.</li>
            <li>even the next day, when usually I&#x27;m stubbly, I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li>My legs felt very soft after the shave, much softer than after the Intuition shave, but I usually remedy that with a bit of lotion when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Not sure how long the razor actually lasts yet but a couple times and my skin is really smooth.</li>
            <li>The included holder stayed attached in my shower well enough, but I don&#x27;t generally use it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if I exfoliate first, when I use these razors my legs are never smooth.</li>
            <li>I decided to try other razors first since laser hair removal is such big financial and time commitment and tried the Schick Hydro Silk for women and have never looked back.</li>
            <li>Be careful with new blades-</li>
            <li>By the way, you can try taking the razor completely out of the bathroom to keep it dry</li>
            <li>I recommend it to women who like a long lasting shaving and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After a few uses it looks like the extra moisture dots are all gone, but they really do keep working for a while!</li>
            <li>I was seriously starting to consider laser hair removal for the bottom half of my legs, which is my problem area just to ease the difficulty of having to spend so much time on grooming.</li>
            <li>Second, and the really big one for me, is that I have had At least mild razor burn almost every time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>

            <li> but I liked them</li>
            <li> The opinions are 100% my own from my experience with Schick Hydro Silk Razor!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice razor works well</li>
            <li> I also really liked the flexibility of the head of the razor.</li>
            <li> The handle is really nice and the blade moves with your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice that it does come with the shower hanger.</li>
            <li> that it comes with two cartridges and a handy place to hang it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It was nice that I didn&#x27;t need to use soap.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used it 5 times and the lubrication is still effective.</li>
            <li> Cost effective.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried Schick Quattro, which I liked</li>
            <li> I also liked the raised design on the handle which allowed the razor to rest on the edge of the tub without the moisture strip coming into contact with the surface.</li>
            <li> A very nice change from the cheap razor.</li>
            <li> As any brand-new razor right from the package will do, during my first usage I got a great shave and my legs looked wonderful.</li>
            <li> i love this razor, its my very favorite one.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, no nicks, and it has an awesome cream that comes out when you shave, so it&#x27;s super smooth</li>
            <li> I love getting campaigns for products that I really love!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> While I loved Venus razors for the longest time, I think this is better than their blades at this time and the best option I have found recently.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and glides so smooth!</li>
            <li> also feel like I have to apply more pressure for the razor to be effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  </li>
            <li> but I would love to find one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Best razor I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I got these as a promotion to try and they are by far the best and most efficient razors Ive ever used :-)</li>
            <li> I first have to say the grip is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth.</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t very precise.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, close shave, with no razor burn or bumps</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable</li>
            <li> it was very smooth and gave me a close shave</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Hydro silk because I had never been very satisfied with the closeness of the shave of the Intuition.  </li>
            <li> This razor is the most amazing razor I have used and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am big on my razors and have always found the mens work better but this was an awesome product</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> and I am in love with the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the trimmer I may still need to get used to it before I get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> The razor is wonderful because it cuts close but also doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin so daily use is no issue.  </li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I would like to be able to keep my razor in the shower (in its case of course).</li>
            <li> I looked in the store at many before purchasing this one because I wanted to stop using disposables.  </li>
            <li> Its an Ok razor.</li>
            <li> It gives a super-smooth shave that is comparable to Venus, but is a bit better price-wise.  </li>
            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> My legs feel smooth all day!  </li>
            <li> How many shaves would I get with a disposable?</li>
            <li> I received my BzzAgent box in mid-April (Hooray for free samples!).</li>
            <li> Love the razor so you have to love the blades also</li>
            <li> So much better than those cheaper razors.  </li>
            <li> They give you a nice smooth shave without feeling like you are getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> I had a Gillette Venus before but this one is definitely better.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  </li>
            <li> but this one is way better.  </li>
            <li> I love Shick razors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awesome that I can shave and trim in the shower at the same time without being electrocuted</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream either :).  </li>
            <li> My legs have never been this smooth before!</li>
            <li> I was able to recieve this product as part of a campaign for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> (love- keeps it out of reach for my son) -no</li>
            <li> My legs were silky smooth and no nicks!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get to try this out for free.</li>
            <li> Then I was finally able to use the razor.</li>
            <li> It has four blades, which we all know, the more the better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to go longer in between shaving times.</li>
            <li> Even better the package comes with a replacement blade.</li>
            <li> Okay razor.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best  one out there.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice product that leaves your legs feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The Hydro does a better job on my legs than the Quattro, but I agree with the reviewer who commented on the skin pulling.</li>
            <li> Between this and the Venus, I probably like the Venus better but will just switch between the two depending on what&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> But I do like both the Hydro and Venus better than the Quattro.</li>
            <li> I love the swivel head that conforms to those hard-to-shave areas around my knees.</li>
            <li> Even without lotion, my legs felt a lot more moisturized than they did before my shower.</li>
            <li> Way better than all of the ones offered by Venus and Gillette.</li>
            <li> but i love that razor so hopefully this one owrks just as WELL :d</li>
            <li> but I love the Venus Embrace more.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave, lightweight handle.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Some have been better then others.</li>
            <li> Those tend to cut my legs more often.</li>
            <li> If you are really looking for a great quality razor</li>
            <li> If you are really looking for a great quality razor</li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing serum.  </li>
            <li> It worked SO much better than the the razor I was using before.</li>
            <li> So I fell for their free sample and have been buying replacements ever since!</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER on armpits,</li>
            <li> Better to the point</li>
            <li> Why are replacement blades $3 more?</li>
            <li> sure about the cost of the blades quite yet.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> which means I can shave faster and it looks better and feels better than before.</li>
            <li> Honestly I got this for free to try out from BuzzAgent</li>
            <li> I must say I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others.</li>
            <li> I love the style of the razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> I have had the Shick Hydro Silk razor for about 4 years now and it is top notch.</li>
            <li> Here are the reasons that I love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is infinitely better than anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li> A more average-sized person probably wouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this razor, though.</li>
            <li> I really love the Schick hydro silk razor.</li>
            <li> I just love it&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> Their blades work better on me, somehow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Venus razors which were okay</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> The raised design acts more as a guard, keeping the razor from making contact with the skin and preventing a close shave.</li>
            <li> There are many better options on the market that give me a closer shave.</li>
            <li> While I enjoyed the Schick HydroSilk razor</li>
            <li> The serum seems to just pour out when you&#x27;re using it, and it&#x27;s not an enjoyable sight...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVE this razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I was actually able to apply scented lotion directly after a shave!!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair that disappeared from my eyebrows and eyelashes reappeared on my legs lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to grip and feels very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s kind of true.  </li>
            <li> First, the shave itself is noticeably not as good as the Quattro, even with the fifth blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with how many uses I&#x27;m getting out of a single cartridge!</li>
            <li> It is best to keep it upright and in a dry area.</li>
            <li> I use it, and the hydrating strip is awesome because I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn or dry scaly legs.</li>
            <li> You are also able to use the trimmer without water when you have one of those speedy get ready days but still want to look good.</li>
            <li> I easily pulled it off of the disposable handle and fit perfectly on my more sturdy handle :)</li>
            <li> I am so excited I was able to try this product out for free on BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I am so excited I was able to try this product out for free on BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> the end, if you have slower, normal to fine hair growth, this razor will probably be great for you.  </li>
            <li> A great razor for a busy mom.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables work better than this.</li>
            <li> in my hand so comfortably which gives me more control</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more comfortable to use, and doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> So I bought this razor because I got a great coupon in the mail, so I was surprised that even at that value this razor could SUCK so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the disposables I was using.</li>
            <li> I believe the shave is closer and more comfortable with this razor and plan to keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did arrive very promptly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am petite, and the head of this razor is very large, therefore I found I couldn&#x27;t maneuver it effectively in tricky spots like my knees.</li>
            <li> Having smoother legs for a longer period of time seems like every womans dream come true!</li>

            <li> The handle is ergonomically correct for easy shaving.</li>
            <li> It makes it really easy to shave around your knees</li>
            <li> There are many better options on the market that give me a closer shave.ll not continue to use they Hydro Silk once I&#x27;ve run out of refills, I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> and I always return it to the hanging caddie  that came with it, which hangs easily 2 feet from the shower head.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything to help knock down ingrowns, and this is the best solution combined with PFB Chromabright.  </li>
            <li> I had the amazing opportunity  to try the product for free thanks to Schick!</li>
            <li> The razor is fine</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important that I have a razor that works and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> Gel razors are no my new favorite!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s important to us girls right?!</li>
            <li> The first shave was ok.  </li>
            <li> I bought these razors after doing research on &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; razor, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited but leery about trying these razors.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to be chosen for this Bzz Campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife has used these for a long while, and is quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> (I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> super smooth and nick-free.  </li>
            <li> I have never had another razor that shaves as close and looks as clean as the shave that I received with this razor.</li>
            <li> I turned the razor on, and was amazed at how clean a cut the trimmer delivers.</li>
            <li> It to feels nice and smooth and soft and</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried maaannyy different brands.</li>
            <li> I only tried this razor once so far, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> They give me a clean close shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> It really makes your legs very smooth .</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Special gel on the blade still there even after shaving, and still seems to be a lot of it.</li>
            <li> He was right!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many razors, but between finding the right shave and the right price, I didn&#x27;t have a true winner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Among the things I liked about this razor was the design of the handle, it fit comfortably in my hand which is a pet peeve I&#x27;ve had with many other razors.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter &amp; she hasn&#x27;t complained, so I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> and I really do love Schick products, just on this one too much.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and razors are not always kind to it.</li>
            <li> Will have to continue to see how it works before I give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love them, with the five blades, it really reduces irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the \\&quot;Water-Activated Moisturizing Serum for Smooth, Silky Skin\\&quot;- this serum does feel nice and smooth on your legs, however it only lasts a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> so what can you really say, The price was better than at the local market and very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I feel that I need to come clean: I rarely ever have a need to shave.</li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job and last for several shaves.</li>
            <li> I shaved two days ago and my skin still feel really soft, so much better than when I use the cheap no name brand razors.</li>
            <li> I like the razor although the blades run out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super shaver</li>
            <li> It left my legs nice and smooth with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> The cost of those adds up fairly quickly, so I&#x27;m thankful I no longer have to do this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smoothing strips on this razor wore off way too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s water activated, it depletes rather quickly when you put the razor under some water to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> I got this item free thru BzzAgent and tried it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> She has been very pleased with the shaves and relatively long-life of these razors.</li>
            <li> Take it slowly as not to cut yourself, and make sure you exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I usually use my hubby&#x27;s, but now I have one of my own to love!</li>
            <li> After about 4 days my legs returned to normal... not being able to shave in the summer sucked by the way.</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it because I love Schick and am currently using the Schick Hydro Sensitive Care Razor and love it!</li>
            <li> I love it and am no longer looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I saw that Schick had come out with a new razor with 5 blades and was supposed to moisturize more, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love the new &amp;#34;Schick Hydro&amp;#34; It hydroizes as you&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get that the whole point of this razor is moisture, moisture, moisture, but it made me feel pretty slimy on areas I had to go over more than once</li>
            <li> It has a cushiony handle, which makes it easy to grip and a swivel head that allows for a really close shave.</li>
            <li> handle is easy to grip, and I felt that I had a much closer shave in my underarm area with the Schick Hydro Silk(tm) Razor.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, my legs feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> And the hydrating layer slides on immediately after the first shave to keep your legs moistureized!</li>
            <li> I will definitely reccommend this to friends and family and will need to buy more for myself as well!</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hold and can be held comfortably many different ways depending on where you&#x27;re shaving.</li>
            <li> Its sleek design fits nicely in my hand and it is easy to grip even when it gets wet.  </li>
            <li> Very good on curves and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best razor I have used, it gives a closer shave and little to no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got the opportunity to try this razor/trimmer out for free.</li>
            <li> I go to try this product for free thanks to Schick and Buzz Agent</li>
            <li> Thanks schick for sending me a free pack to test out just in time for spring break.  </li>
            <li> Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor does a great job, the only problem I have is the handle is too big to fit in the hold on my shower caddy.</li>
            <li> Very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Schick for letting me try the product for free.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get nearly close enough and is great if you like the 5 o&#x27; clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not only does my skin feel more silky, smooth and hydrated after I shave</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have more sensitive skin on my legs.</li>
            <li> I shave with just soap and water, and with this razor my legs feel soft and hydrated for days after a shave. :)</li>
            <li> I thought id try it one more time to make sure, and sure enough the same things happened.</li>
            <li> I received one free through bzzagent and enjoyed only having to shave each area once since it had 5 blades.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I would rather razor manufacturers do away with the moisture strips entirely.  </li>
            <li> , I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked getting to try The Schick Hydro Silk razor, I typically only ever buy razors/refills from the Venus collection.</li>
            <li> really feel that there are better options out there if you&#x27;re looking for a new razor!</li>
            <li> The new design is better, with there being an additional metal bar aross each blade level, intended (I assume) to be more gentle for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> and it just slides right over the area you&#x27;re shaving.  </li>
            <li> I can skip lotion right after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not compelled to lotion my legs right after shaving like I used to.</li>
            <li> I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> I suggest you just walk right by this razor</li>
            <li> I suggest you just walk right by this razor</li>
            <li> If you struggle from course hair that can be a pain to make sure you get try the new Schick Hydro silk for smooth clear skin with just one swipe of the blade.</li>
            <li> I loved the close shave I got with this product, it seems like the blade is larger then my normal brand of razor</li>
            <li> The Hydro Silk does not, and I think that&#x27;s the major problem with this razor which is causing so many problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was completely blown away how super smooth and close the shave was with this razor,</li>
            <li> Hydro silk is super smooth, leaves skin soft &amp; no knicks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, The serum dissipates quickly from the razor head, I&#x27;ve only used the razor 5 times tops and most of it is gone</li>
            <li> I was really happy with my shave for the first two times, my legs were left really smooth and they didn&#x27;t dry up after I toweled off.</li>
            <li> every woman should use this razor, its a close long lasting shave with a comfortable grip and a nice suction hanger for the shower!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: blades are pricey, but the experience is worth it if you&#x27;re willing.</li>
            <li> I got such a nice shave with these, very moisturizing and</li>
            <li> I really do have sensitive skin and this razor leaves me with nothing but smooth skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Easy to clean compared to the Quattro, which seemed to clog constantly if I waited a week to shave again&lt;</li>
            <li> The easy grip handles gives you complete control which helps prevent nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave me any razor bumps or cuts and it cut smooth and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Skin clearly much more moisturized, probably a combo of the special gel and the dry skin shaving gel I used.</li>
            <li> I normally get that cheap sack full of basic razors, but got a free sample of this one to try.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates your skin as you shave, is very smooth and cut my shave time by 30 minutes to only 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love!</li>
            <li> I love the new Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love!</li>
            <li> I used one for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> The razor cannot be felt on your skin during use, this was my first concern.  </li>
            <li> My legs have never felt so soft and smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It’s mid-May, and I’M STILL USING THE FIRST RAZOR.</li>
            <li> I’m at least on shave 20-something and still getting great results.</li>
            <li> first time that I used this razor, I was thinking to my self &amp;#34;well</li>
            <li> In fact, I was actually wowed by how smooth the shave was!</li>
            <li> I used the razor for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> What first caught my eye was the handle design.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor for the first time as a bzz agent and since trying them I have changed out my razors at home to be hydro silk for both my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> I went online to see if I could get the blades cheaper but decided to try the razor first before purchasing the replacement heads</li>
            <li> I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li> I first pulled this out of the packaging in haste, as my boyfriends clippers were failing to work</li>
            <li> It has far exceeded my expectations for a razor!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for FREE from BzzAgent in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> and I thought it worked pretty well...</li>
            <li> It makes my legs extra smooth!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut myself with it thus far, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide smoothly over the skin.</li>
            <li> My legs feel incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor out this morning and really like it!</li>
            <li> Like most extra bladed razors I have tried I get razor burn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have bumps or razor burn even if I go in the hot tub after</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these blades, since my husband has the same razor (but for men) and those blades work much better.  </li>
            <li> I must admit is actually does work a bit better.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty confident I have found the last brand of razors I will ever need to try.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and had to go over a couple times.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of razors and my skin hates shaving!</li>
            <li> and I dont think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to disposables.</li>
            <li> The trimmer however really makes this product a 10!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but has 2 big flaws.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> And the blade is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> an ok product overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most razors out there, but I always come back to Schick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the Schick Quattro for Women for years, but was willing to check it out.</li>
            <li> The shave was super close, no nicks, no clogged up blades, no bumps, and I even noticed the whole day how much softer my skin was after using them.</li>
            <li> I really actually preferred the shape of the handle on the Hydro Silk, and the shave was close, quick, and incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> lets the razor dry while keeping the blade covered but a suction cup would make it more useful.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth it as it gave me a pretty decent shave.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try the Shick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor from BzzAgent [</li>
            <li> I bought this razor the other day and while it did offer a nice, close shave, it cut me up.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to share with you my schick hydro silk sensitive care&lt;br /&gt;Razor</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these razors to anyone who wants a quick, close shave with silky smooth results.</li>
            <li> I gave it a \\&quot;four\\&quot; because I can only vouch for one type of area - not the whole body, therefore cannot speak to how it will perform for most people who use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all these positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting all these positive reviews, it&#x27;s like you paid people to write them.</li>
            <li> First of all it gives a very close shave with one pass of the razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The moisturizing tape gets used up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> No more need to run the razor over my underarms more than once to get the desired results - a great change from some of the previous razors I had been using.</li>
            <li> Although it was the same width as others, this razor felt wider and like it covered more area than most other razors.</li>
            <li> Now my options are to go out and buy Hydro Silk blades, go out and buy a Schick Quattro razor, or give up on Schick, buy a new Venus razor and throw away $12 worth of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the blades do not swivel as easily as I&#x27;d like for shaving my legs and such.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the razor it left me with smooth skin</li>
            <li> My old razor&#x27;s cartridges used to rust fairly quickly causing me to have to replace them quite often.</li>
            <li> My skin was certainly softer after shaving, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> , I just thought it would be smart to change it.</li>
            <li> As an avid saver, I&#x27;m always looking for other brands I can use to get the most for my money.  </li>
            <li> Nice little surprise with the suction for keeping it upright in the shower.</li>
            <li> I felt like the Schick Hydro Silk Razor was a great angle for reaching all the tough areas of my legs,</li>
            <li> The 5 blades really do their job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hydrating serum that allows you to have a very close shave</li>
            <li> and that is really unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> So, fast wore and to the  schick hydro silk</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave and really does moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li> Now for real test number 1.</li>
            <li> Real test</li>
            <li> Ready for real test</li>
            <li> the handle is very flexible for bumpy areas like my knees.  </li>
            <li> I have never had such a problem with razor burn and it is not even a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> They provided enough moisture so the blades were smooth against my legs.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Legs and underarms that are as smooth as Barry White&#x27;s voice.</li>
            <li> This razor has so much of that stuff that the blades don&#x27;t encounter any friction</li>
            <li> This razor is premium and very beneficial to my legs</li>
            <li> Also the size of the trimmer head makes it way easier to be as precise as possible.</li>
            <li> I did have to lather up a bit with soap as we don’t buy shaving cream here, but that wasn’t really a bother at all.</li>
            <li> These days I find it harder to get a smooth shave!</li>
            <li> (Maybe because I was more careful there?</li>
            <li> My legs stay smooth and hydrated for days, and after a month I am still using the same razor.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strips work really well, and it gives you a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to use shaving cream either.</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> that I am getting such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> But did not produce as much &amp;#34;hydrating gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am a little worried, but if I need to pay a little more for something that lasts longer and performs better, then it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I recently got a free Schick Hydro Silk razor to use.  </li>
            <li> nothing really else to say.</li>
            <li> but I really like hydro silk.</li>
            <li> grip on the Schick Hydro Silk razor is extremely comfortable and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart even 4 years later.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t talk too much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very prone to nicks and razor burn, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this razor.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does.</li>
            <li> The only draw back to this product is that it didn&#x27;t give me a quite as close shave as I would have liked on my bikini area.</li>
            <li> and I love it, and will never go back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely and lasts through a few shaves.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like the Schick Hydro Silk razor because I&#x27;ve been wanting a five blade razor designed for women, but I feel that it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I&#x27;ve expected from a good razor, especially one designed for women.</li>
            <li> I have a Schick quattro that I like very much, but the store was out of blades and I live 50+ miles away from a reasonably sized store</li>
            <li> I live in the hot south and wear shorts a lot during the summer.</li>
            <li> Other than that issue I love the way these are built</li>
            <li> I am tempted to go back to my original razor after this one is used up.</li>
            <li> it cuts, and feels better on skin than a lot of other razors that my wife tried.</li>
            <li> With the Schick Hydro Razor I can now do every other day because with the 5 blades, I&#x27;m able to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> These work a lot better for me than the other brands (Gillette).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that its much cheaper to purchase a new razor every time rather than replacement blades!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the main reason I put off shaving as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Also the hydrating serum around the blades left my skin feeling silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t have to use lotion after shaving like normal.</li>
            <li> It has been quite a while since I have been active on Bzzagent, but boy am I glad I got this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how easy the razor is to hold and that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> : glides smoothly over my skin (much more so than Venus), blades stay sharp (haven&#x27;t changed the blade in a weeks use and it is still sharp), suction cup hanger (pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I like it - nice and smooth - good handle etc, but the clear head where the replacement cartridges snap in gets really cruddy looking after awhile.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to try the version created for sensitive skin through a program by Schick Hydro Sensitive Care razors.</li>
            <li> I always exfoliate first and also use shaving cream for sensitive skin which helps as well.</li>
            <li> I love that its the only tool I need now, and for me at least it worked better on the shorter setting.</li>
            <li> Well maybe not forever, but I&#x27;ve been using the same blades for about a year, shaving my legs and underarms every other day, and I still get a nice smooth finish after only one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably would have been happy enough with it, but it really falls short when shaving other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have very sensitive skin and very rarely get razor burn, so this is a big downside for me.</li>
            <li> These are now my new regulars!</li>
            <li> Schick has a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve just scraped them off (when they&#x27;re wet, you can scrape them off easily with a finger nail).</li>
            <li> You need to use a slightly different angle, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a razor with such a soft smooth shave before.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to schedule in my &amp;#34;shave day/time&amp;#34;, I can just do it quickly during a regular shower.</li>
            <li> Convenience is key!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor is my favorite and I will continue to use it until it falls apart at which point I will likely replace it with the same thing (or newer version).</li>
            <li> It was really frustrating because I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables which have done a much better job.</li>
            <li> I think the main problem lays in the design of the moisturizing strip.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend....</li>
            <li> all, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> cost of refill razors is too high.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I was originally using a Venus Embrace, but I wanted to try out some different razors because I have sensitive skin on my legs that are prone to bumps and redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using another razor type (the one with a ring of soap around it) for years, and easily give it 5 stars, but I bought this at the supermarket the other day because they didn&#x27;t have what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am super excited to say that Schick Hydro Disposables have made that fear a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> and I really need that with my busy schedule and being in a rush all the time.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to shaving and tends to leave bumps no matter how much gel I use.</li>
            <li> Although refills are a bit pricey, this is defiantly worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Pretty good razors but get a weird mass buildup of the built in moisturizing gel that interferes with shaving.</li>
            <li> razor isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense</li>
            <li> I needed a few more words.  </li>
            <li> I do find trying to get the 5-blade head to make good contact is a bit awkward, but the result is definitely better than what you can get with a simple 3-blade razor.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip also makes it glide so smoothly, I felt like it really cut down on the time it took to shave.</li>
            <li> I hardly feel it, but I get a super close and smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the moisture strip from turning into a big puddle of goo, a huge plus in my book, especially since this is what frustrates me the most about my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was ok for shaving my armpits where the skin is less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The Quattro has those vertical metal pieces that cross the blades, right?</li>
            <li> However, I am also cheap, so waxing and other hair removal methods are off the table.</li>
            <li> I think smooth shave, long lasting blades would have really summed it up.</li>
            <li> and it works like it&#x27;s brand new)</li>
            <li> The constant moisture that is released from the moisture strip is fantastic, and after two weeks of use, it stills has the same amount of moisture released.</li>
            <li> I just never really understood why I should pay more for a reusable one when I get about the same shave from a disposable.</li>
            <li> This handle is cheap, all plastic, and without any extra force nor dropping it, it broke on the 3rd shave.  </li>
            <li> irritation (I have VERY sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so not ending up with bumps</li>
            <li> even if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have had problems before with irritated underarms after shaving, but with the Shick Hydro Care Sensitive Care Razor, no irritation!</li>
            <li> I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> razor irritated my underarms the first and only time I used it there.  </li>
            <li> I have tried and used so many brands in the past.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the replacement blades are a complete ripoff!</li>
            <li> I stopped using Schick in the past because of the wires that crossed from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> I doubt any other razor can be better - even in the future!</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, long lasting, and the conditioning on the top AND the bottom allow easy shaving with only water- even on sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I can usually feel stubble within hours of shaving, but with product, it feels like super smooth and silky even the next day.  </li>
            <li> My armpits went from bumpy and dark to smooth and clear and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have no personal need for the trimmer, my boyfriend has full access to it and has already gotten into the habit of using the trimmer for his facial hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a new razor since, well, lets just say it&#x27;s been a long time!  </li>
            <li> It becomes dull quickly and I have more problems than I have had with any other razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to really bad razor bumps and irritation but didn&#x27;t have much suffering after using these lol.</li>
            <li> The clear head of this one seems like a bit of a water trap.</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with a shower stick on accessory like the old one did.</li>
            <li> My skin is suuuuuper sensitive to shaving.</li>
            <li> but my skin is just THAT sensitive.</li>
            <li> so it REALLY gets a close shave that takes a bit longer to grow back in.</li>
            <li> It completely ran out of \\&quot;moisture dots.\\</li>
            <li> and I never feel like I can shower fast enough</li>
            <li> -NO knicks or cuts (so far)</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;d say that I didn&#x27;t really like is the serum that comes on the razor..</li>
            <li> /&gt;*the combination of the moisture strip and 5 blades leaves my legs SO soft.</li>
            <li> With my Venus Embrace, I am able to get at least 5-6 days of use.</li>
            <li> but I tend to have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the schick men&#x27;s razors, they have sharper blades that last longer and no GOOP!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am pron to razor burn..</li>
            <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free though Bzzagent a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I use the Embrace because the moisture strip around the blades help protect my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but by the end of the day my legs were itchy and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor as part of a program run by Schick</li>
            <li> The kit (but not the actual razor packaging) suggested using it with shaving gel/cream, which I did, but I did discover that because of the serum you could later do a quick touch up on a spot you may have missed with only wetting the razor and still getting a decent glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am usually pretty particular about my razors due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cost of this razor is a little pricey, but I think its well worth it!</li>
            <li> but when I tried this I never got any more nicks or cuts, even when shaving my bikini area, and no more razor bumps or irritation!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I would never use this razor when I&#x27;m going to have a day at the pool or a night with my boyfriend, It does a quick acceptable shave for an average day where a minute amount of stubble won&#x27;t make me feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I would never use this razor when I&#x27;m going to have a day at the pool or a night with my boyfriend, It does a quick acceptable shave for an average day where a minute amount of stubble won&#x27;t make me feel</li>
            <li> I also noticed that since it seems to be more gentle than the average razor, my legs arent getting dried out like they used to.</li>
            <li> Overall Schick Hydro Silk is a decent razor.</li>
            <li> For the $6 I paid, I really am only going to end up getting 1 decent shave</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro Silk razor is the first Schick razor that I have actually wanted to go back to each morning.  </li>
            <li> It gets all the hair on the first stroke and leaves behind a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of those and turns out it is the EXACT SAME head, only with a cheaper handle.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been such a chore, I have light skin and dark leg hair</li>
            <li> Went back to my old (cheaper)razor that I will just by new refill cartridges for.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample off of Bzzagent this past week</li>
            <li> I just used the razor with my normal shower gel, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time getting a smooth shave in the shower, but it&#x27;s so easy with this one.</li>
            <li> (With the Quattro it was easy to go too hard and get nicked, so going light-handed is what I&#x27;m used</li>
            <li> The 5-blade design took me a few shaves to get used to, but it&#x27;s a super close shave.  </li>
            <li> DID keep my very sensitive skin from getting irritated, so it definitely met the expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty comparable to their other razors.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still pretty sharp.</li>
            <li> It was the first non-disposable razor I ever bought (when I was 15), but I basically switched to the Quattro a few years ago to try something new.</li>
            <li> know before you buy, these blades dull SO QUICKLY, and you have to buy the Hydro Silk replacement blades, which for the price, if you like this razor, you might as well just buy a new razor</li>
            <li> I have never liked razors that were to light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a review on Amazon for the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor yet, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt; Being a woman of European descent, and taking after my Dad (who my husband affectionely calls &amp;#34;the werewolf), I am a hairy gal.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® Razor gives me SUCH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it awhile and it is barely dull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I went to the store and checked out the different Schick razors and decided on this one because it said that it was for sensitive skin on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I barely get a close shave</li>
            <li> Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been using a Venus Embrace (5 blade) to both deal with my coarse hair and sensitive sking.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very close shave without being rough on your skin while shaving.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old razors again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am definitely throwing my old razors</li>
            <li> They claim \\&quot;designed specifically for the curves of a woman&#x27;s body, the Schick Hydro Silk Razor features five independent curve sensing blades to follow your natural shape.</li>
            <li> It seems that I have to shave my legs everyday because my hair grows back so quickly.</li>
            <li> I was recently invited to participate in a BzzCampaign to try the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor, and was curious to try something new.</li>
            <li> the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in</li>
            <li> the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in</li>
            <li> and I have not had a problem using this razor at all, no dry skin!</li>
            <li> it made my legs extra smooth without shaving cream which is kinda hard  </li>
            <li> blade just is NOT SHARP enough.</li>
            <li> even the next day, when usually I&#x27;m stubbly, I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li> My legs felt very soft after the shave, much softer than after the Intuition shave, but I usually remedy that with a bit of lotion when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the razor actually lasts yet but a couple times and my skin is really smooth.</li>
            <li> The included holder stayed attached in my shower well enough, but I don&#x27;t generally use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if I exfoliate first, when I use these razors my legs are never smooth.</li>
            <li> I decided to try other razors first since laser hair removal is such big financial and time commitment and tried the Schick Hydro Silk for women and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> Be careful with new blades-</li>
            <li> By the way, you can try taking the razor completely out of the bathroom to keep it dry</li>
            <li> I recommend it to women who like a long lasting shaving and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it looks like the extra moisture dots are all gone, but they really do keep working for a while!</li>
            <li> I was seriously starting to consider laser hair removal for the bottom half of my legs, which is my problem area just to ease the difficulty of having to spend so much time on grooming.</li>
            <li> Second, and the really big one for me, is that I have had At least mild razor burn almost every time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> How can blades be dull right when you open them??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nothing super special but not by any means bad.</li>
            <li> so it took a lot less time then normal.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very nice, close shave, but I hate the handle.  </li>
            <li> I usually get a dry or chapped feeling right after shaving.</li>
            <li> they can be so sharp that they will burn sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is what I like about the Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® Razor that has made me switch from my other brand 5 blade razor:&lt;br /&gt;*fits</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I have been an avid user of men&#x27;s razors for a long time as women&#x27;s razors never seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> The hydration stip around the razer is not securely attatched and if bumped, can flip or push back, at this point you may feel the razor as that piece also acts as a bumper guard so to speak and is what keeps the razor away from the skin, as it would normally stick out further than the razors.  </li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that means my hair is VERY thick and VERY coarse, it also grows fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> These blades give me red bumps and ingrown hairs every time, no matter how long it&#x27;s been since I last shaved or what shaving gel I use.  </li>
            <li> Not only do I get a closer shave, the cartridges last about twice as long as the Venus!</li>
            <li> I have been a die hard Schick Intuition fan since they first came out.</li>
            <li> Price for the initial kit is about average, but the cost of refills is a bit high for a razor that requires you to use shaving cream, the refills costing 15 and change for 4 heads is on par with the one step wet and shave razors refills (I.E schick intuition or the Venus Spa Breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved early morning (only time when child is napping to have that chance these days) and here a day and a half later my legs are still unaffected from shaving.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the moisture strip protrudes too much; not really sure what the deal is with that.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;unique\\&quot; Hanging  caddie is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much space</li>
            <li> -Long lasting (I&#x27;ve been using it for a month</li>
            <li> Blades last fairly long.  </li>
            <li> Each cartridge is really long lasting.</li>
            <li> The razors themselves only last 3-4 days without beginning to leave stubble behind on freshly shaved legs.</li>
            <li> , the head was far too large and it did an even poor job at getting a close shave</li>
            <li> , the head was far too large and it did an even poor job at getting a close shave</li>
            <li> I got a random free sample of this from an online order last year.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, and this razor gets very close without being irritating.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving my legs and the goop is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t actually shave my legs very closely.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s make a handle with some curves, like the lovely females who will be using it.&amp;#34; I appreciated the curved handle, with the wider base, for my hand.</li>
            <li> So, for the price, only getting 2 semi-satisfying days out of a single razor cartirige, I could not justify it.</li>
            <li> I tried these for my first shave after a long cold winter, and my skin was revitalized and ready for Spring skirt weather!</li>
            <li> I finally &#x27;snapped out&#x27; the small white &#x27;button&#x27; - used to replace cartridges and soaked the razor clear head part in vinegar and rinsed the heck out of it.  </li>
            <li> So, I wanted to sJeesh what other potential options I had and how they put up against my current razor.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that these razors dull out really fast.</li>
            <li> I shave frequently and often get razor burn from dull blades that force me to re-shave the same area multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Nothing terrifies me more than cutting my legs with a razor.</li>
            <li> I had assumed any Schick blades would fit on any Schick razor, just as any Venus blade can be put on any Venus razor, unfortunately this was not the case.</li>
            <li> So many razors end up cutting even though I&#x27;m careful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 40 and have been shaving my legs a long time.  </li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My legs are virtually hairless - naturally (no electrolysis here).</li>
            <li> The strips can feel a bit gooey after wetting, but they do not fall apart and crumble all over my legs as I&#x27;ve had other razors with strips similar to this do.</li>
            <li> this looks just like any other razor I have ever used, what could possibly be so different?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With other razors I have used, I have had to go over the same spots 2 or 3 times until the hair was gone.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to last longer than that of any other brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During use I definitely noted a noticeable difference in the ease of how the razor glided over my skin due to the strips of moisture serum which just made shaving a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Just keep them dry in between uses</li>
            <li> My skin was just as dry as ever after each shave.</li>
            <li> The blades dull so quickly and the replacement blades cost nearly $17, which I think is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually dripping wet by the time I realize my razor needs a new head.</li>
            <li> That would be my suggestion to anyone looking for a long lasting, moisturizing razor with less irritation.</li>
            <li> He said based on what I was telling him it sounded like I gained at least one day in between my normal shaving routine.</li>
            <li> have used the shick quartos for years and will go back to them, cuts and irritation are NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re either too expensive, don&#x27;t last long enough, make my sensitive legs break out, don&#x27;t shave close enough...</li>
            <li> use these dry please!</li>
            <li> These razors might work ok the first time, but after that they are terrible.  </li>
            <li> , never the less have the time to lather up my legs, take 3 swipes on every section of my leg, and rinse it off---just to find spots left unshaved after my shower.</li>
            <li> I typically shave my legs and underarms on a daily basis</li>
            <li> I have used them for up to a month, shaving every other day, without running out of shaving bar, as long as they aren&#x27;t soaked before use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it for long enough to hate it, but I love this razor.</li>
            <li> usually a very sensitive area for me, glided with no problems AND removed all the hair with no stubble left behind</li>
            <li> for a few hours (maybe), but the negative aspects outweigh the positive for this one.</li>
            <li> and I still have little red bumps.</li>
            <li> Tried this one &amp; was totally let down!</li>
            <li> and I do not feel as if my hand is going to slip off when wet or soapy.</li>
            <li> You might not need shaving cream with these since the moisturizing strip is almost like a shave gel once it gets wet.</li>
            <li> You know that goup that they put around women&#x27;s razors that gets all slimey when it&#x27;s wet?  </li>
            <li> skin was left itching and irritated and definitely not a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; as I expected based on the ads I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> the seeps from the razor when you get it wet.</li>
            <li> but I went from those pink 20 in a package razors to this beauty.  </li>
            <li> I still wind up having to use shaving cream and the moisture strips end up clogging up the razor making it even harder to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing I hate more than finding my razor in pieces on the floor the next day because the holder has come off.</li>
            <li> Had to be extra careful, because the blades are very sharp &amp; cut close to the skin!</li>
            <li> I had minor re-growth, but truthfully it wasn’t as bad as I typically have.</li>
            <li> If not, The conditioning serum WILL seep out and get all over the razor and proceed to dry into a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day</li>
            <li> At first, I thought that there was something wrong with it because I couldn&#x27;t feel it</li>
            <li> &amp; you don&#x27;t feel like you still have stubble after shaving like you do with other brands .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if a razor actually exists that you do not need lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> /&gt;*the blade lasts a lot longer than my other brand 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> On other areas?</li>
            <li> This could be due to the added moisturizers in the blades as well as using the Skintimates shave gel.</li>
            <li> It also stays sharp for a while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The refills are expensive, but they do make a disposable version now that is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, but glides over bumps, bones to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and does everything it says it should.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed it with my other razors.  </li>
            <li> No niks or cuts, yet an extremely close shave.  </li>
            <li> I used a Gillette Venus for YEARS, but finally decided to try the Hydro Silk this past summer.</li>
            <li> : Always leave this razor in a spot where the head isn&#x27;t resting on anything or very wet; the handle is designed to ensure this.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t quite as wide as I might have expected, but after a few mornings of using it, I got used to it</li>
            <li> The issue I have is that every single time the handle breaks after a few months.</li>
            <li> They cut my hair and not my skin - I&#x27;ve sliced myself less with Schick than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same cartridge for almost a month and it seems like it has hardly dulled at all</li>
            <li> : if you drop the razor, it is hard to get the blade back on the handle</li>
            <li> I received a three pack of these to try for free from Schick, and I was totally shocked by my results.</li>
            <li> but theres absolute nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> For the price it is definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> The refills are a bit pricey but still least costly than similar products.</li>
            <li> The minute I made one short slow stroke</li>
            <li> Instead of a lot of uses of slowly getting extra moisture, it will be used up in a use or two.</li>
            <li> : my ingrown issue went down.</li>
            <li> The size of the razor head and the number of blades makes it a little impractical for other body</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp!</li>
            <li> This razor is #1 for summertime as we ladies MUST get every single follicle and DESTROY its existance!</li>
            <li> (I shave every other day) and it hasn&#x27;t dried up yet</li>
            <li> swear it also seems like my hair is growing back a little less thick now</li>
            <li> Did have to repeat a few areas, but maybe I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard enough</li>
            <li> in winter its much , MUCH less.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using the Schick Intuition for the convenience of having a razor and shave cream in one package.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the schick quatro for women and it was still taking me 40-45 minutes to shave every time I shaved.</li>
            <li> previous razors included Intution, Venus, and Soleil.</li>
            <li> I am extremely prone to ingrown hairs, and my armpits are usually raw after shaving.  </li>
            <li> And being cursed with pale skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> Because of this, shaving is never exciting for me because I&#x27;d have to do it two times a day to keep up and WHO HAS TIME FOR THAT?!</li>
            <li> Also, when I got out of the shower I noticed a little cut on my foot.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s due to the use of shaving gel or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The little case that comes with it has some use -it</li>
            <li> Althought I have not had to use them, I got 4 replacement blades for about $18 (a little over $4 per blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it is not remotely unique, I have a venus razor caddie (that I don&#x27;t use because I have one that holds refills) and it looks almost identical,</li>
            <li> have to disclose that I am a buzz agent and got to try this product free.it is not remotely unique, I have a venus razor caddie (that I don&#x27;t use because I have one that holds refills) and it looks almost identical,</li>
            <li> Such a close shave and no razor burn which is very hard for me to find in a diposable razor.  </li>
            <li> would have been missing out and probably covered in band-aids.</li>
            <li> otherwise they will not fit.</li>
            <li> I am such not happy that immediately after shaving, it feels like I need to shave again.</li>
            <li> So being an Italian Irish blend, I have very thick, dark, difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I will say that I didn&#x27;t notice any less irritation with this razor as opposed to ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past</li>
            <li> I shaved in half the usual time and the razor glided over my skin.</li>
            <li> Of course I use lotion daily, but none of the usual ill affects I have had after shaving from other products.</li>
            <li> All of the newest razors have this slick, built in moisturizer that makes them messy sitting in my shower</li>
            <li> They also do not seem to leave my skin dried out like others have in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually can keep the blade for a few months in the winter, but in the summer a month is pushing it for me.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer give a close cut without discomfort and it is waterproof unlike ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> But my man noticed that my legs were silkier than they usually are.</li>
            <li> can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk performed just as well, if not better, than my Intuition does.</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy a razor that has a moisturizing strip it dries up after about 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Not sure why,</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll stick to my usual brand for now.</li>
            <li> It just releases a small amount at a time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO I usually buy disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Definitely not okay, since I don&#x27;t want to have to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually just buy whatever razors are the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I have cut myself maybe once in the past year and have NEVER had razor burn.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be going back to my Quattro.</li>
            <li> in the past month (I usually have at LEAST one per time)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a women&#x27;s razor</li>
            <li> The head is bulky and just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; for those hard to reach, lady spots.  </li>
            <li> That alone, to me, shows how little these razors irritate the skin!!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint:</li>
            <li> I personally hate shaving, because of all the bumps and cuts I get, but this razor has really made me change my mind.</li>
            <li> I mean, who can beat a razor and shaving cream in ONE??</li>
            <li> the negative side, I just can not get a close shave with this razor and thought it functioned especially poor in hard to shave areas such as underarms.</li>
            <li> I tried replacing the bade and the next one was just as bad</li>
            <li> I never experienced slow movement or felt a tugging of hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased these razors for my daughter who has a tough time finding razors that work well for her.</li>
            <li> It provides a close shave to remove all the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any nicks behind.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Venus razors for a while &amp; really like them, except for the Venus w/ Olay strips, those are just AWFUL.</li>
            <li> This immediately annoyed me.</li>
            <li> But seriously, This razor paired with skintimate shave gel is a match made in shaving heaven!</li>
            <li> I was really shocked that I found I had a lot less issues with ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I have awful sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> When I went on vacation, I took a disposable triple blade razor (I think it was Soliel trip blade) and shaving was so painful compared to this razor, and I was left with horrilbly uncomfortable razor burn!</li>
            <li> If this happens it doesn&#x27;t ruin the razor, but it&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> It is too thin and thus feels difficult to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> I attempted to use the trimmer but was left very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried this razor multiple times and it is awful.</li>
            <li> Well, I was not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> the refills are prety expensive</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with terrible razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say its in the trash.</li>
            <li> except the \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; feeling it leaves behind makes it difficult to know if you&#x27;ve gotten all the hair!</li>
            <li> All the blades on the Hyrdo make me a little fearful lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this...</li>
            <li> and he desperately needed help.</li>
            <li> and it was very uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s impossible to nick myself with this</li>
            <li> It eventually got so painful that it kinda hurt to have fabric rub against them.</li>
            <li> &quot; I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I could feel the blades cutting up my skin!</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed that another one irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I am honestly disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> Actually, I am disappointed with all schick razors.</li>
            <li> I literally woke up itching my legs like crazy!</li>
            <li> I personally hate shaving-</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I really, really hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I DEFINITELY hate when I come out the shower and find that one patch of hair that I forgot to shave.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> And all leave me bleeding with bumps, it&#x27;s just horrible!</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t get was all those nasty spots and razor bumps!</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> And what I didn&#x27;t get was all those nasty spots and razor bumps!</li>
            <li> Just bought this at target and it&#x27;s awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting and horrible to use.</li>
            <li> Hair always got stuck in there, and it was terrible!  </li>

            <li> Great razor!!!! The 5 blades really do their job. Not sure how long the razor actually lasts yet but a couple times and my skin is really smooth. I received the razor to try from a promo and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This bzzagent is one happy girl. This razor is the most amazing razor I have used and extremely comfortable. The trimmer give a close cut without discomfort and it is waterproof unlike ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. Thank schick amazing product! #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> #Gotitfree its a good razor. It gave me a a nice close shave, it really contours to the body I was able to shave everything without getting razor burned. It did not moisturize my skin as it claimed it would, after shave and shower I still had to use lotion . But my man noticed that my legs were silkier than they usually are. Overall Schick Hydro Silk is a decent razor. I would recommend it to all women. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I am allergic to it. Itching erythema grew on my legs every time I used it.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrifies me more than cutting my legs with a razor. It&#x27;s the main reason I put off shaving as much as I do. I am super excited to say that Schick Hydro Disposables have made that fear a thing of the past. I used one for the first time yesterday and I was amazed! The moisture strip was wonderful and I was able to shave my ankles and knees with no fear of taking a chunk out of myself. Yikes! I love the feel of the handle and the color is awesome, that&#x27;s important to us girls right?! These are now my new regulars! So happy I got a chance to try them of I would have been missing out and probably covered in band-aids.</li>
            <li> I am big on my razors and have always found the mens work better but this was an awesome product</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I got the opportunity to try this razor/trimmer out for free. It is a beautiful razor!!! It&#x27;s really hard for me to find a women&#x27;s razor but this one works absolutely wonderfully. I love it&#x27;s hydrating serum that allows you to have a very close shave and I am in love with the razor. My shave lasts a good 2-3 days when using this razor. I rate this razor a 10/10. I do wish it came with a shower stick on accessory like the old one did. I recommend it to women who like a long lasting shaving and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely liked the razor a lot! I&#x27;m not so sure about the trimmer I may still need to get used to it before I get the results I&#x27;m looking for. But the razor itself is definitely one of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried!!</li>
            <li> This razor is simply amazing. I am extremely prone to ingrown hairs, and my armpits are usually raw after shaving.  Day one:  I used the razor and my inflamed skin came to a halt.  Day two: my ingrown issue went down. The razor is wonderful because it cuts close but also doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin so daily use is no issue.  I have tried everything to help knock down ingrowns, and this is the best solution combined with PFB Chromabright.  My armpits went from bumpy and dark to smooth and clear and so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I received this razor as part of a promotion from the brand and I was amazed by this razor! I shave frequently and often get razor burn from dull blades that force me to re-shave the same area multiple times.  This razor provided a close, clean shave with just one swipe and the handle was comfortable and easy to hold!  Schick has a new customer for life!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all these positive reviews.  Are we using the same razor?  There was a coupon in the paper for this razor so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The first shave was ok.  Pretty comparable to their other razors.  Then I go to get the razor a second time and there is goop just hanging off the thing all over.  It was so gross.  I tried shaving my legs and the goop is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t actually shave my legs very closely.  I had to shave my legs and arm pit over and over to get the hair to an acceptable length!  My legs actually hurt now too.  I&#x27;m over 40 and have been shaving my legs a long time.  I do not recommend this product at all.  For the $6 I paid, I really am only going to end up getting 1 decent shave and that is really unacceptable.  By the way, you can try taking the razor completely out of the bathroom to keep it dry but what a pain.  I would like to be able to keep my razor in the shower (in its case of course).</li>
            <li> I switched to this razor a year ago after years of using another and its been a good change. I shave every other day so my razor defiantly gets a workout and it cuts closer so I feel smoother. Although refills are a bit pricey, this is defiantly worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It shaves close and smooth and I have not changed the razor head yet. Would buy one again.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you.</li>
            <li> this razor is really easy to use and has a great design.  I looked in the store at many before purchasing this one because I wanted to stop using disposables.  The blades that go to this are also sold on amazon and they work great.</li>
            <li> This razor feels amazing. It almost feels like it&#x27;s not even there. It&#x27;s very smooth. &amp; it adjust to the way you want. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
            <li> I  never like to write a product review after using something for just one time. But after using this I just had too! My skin is suuuuuper sensitive to shaving. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY razor out there...even MEN razors! And all leave me bleeding with bumps, it&#x27;s just horrible! I used this and as another reviewer said-you can&#x27;t even feel the blades on your skin!!  I did get a nick or two-but my skin is just THAT sensitive. What I didn&#x27;t get was all those nasty spots and razor bumps! I personally hate shaving-but since I give myself at home laser treatments shaving my legs is my only option. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love! I&#x27;ve already told my mom, best friend, and cousin about it! Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this...even if you have sensitive skin! I&#x27;m happy with this and will be purchasing the refills! &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Its an Ok razor. Price was right.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many razors, but between finding the right shave and the right price, I didn&#x27;t have a true winner.  The Schick Hydro Silk razor is the first Schick razor that I have actually wanted to go back to each morning.  It gives a super-smooth shave that is comparable to Venus, but is a bit better price-wise.  The one thing that takes a bit of getting-used-to is the handle.  It isn&#x27;t quite as wide as I might have expected, but after a few mornings of using it, I got used to it and it is a super-comfortable shave leaving my legs super smooth and nick-free.  I love it and am no longer looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried this razor multiple times and it is awful. It becomes dull quickly and I have more problems than I have had with any other razor. Ouch!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m one of those werewolf legged women haha. If I shave in the morning, then by mid afternoon I have stubble popping up. Because of this, shaving is never exciting for me because I&#x27;d have to do it two times a day to keep up and WHO HAS TIME FOR THAT?! So, fast wore and to the  schick hydro silk, I love it. It has 5 blades on it so it REALLY gets a close shave that takes a bit longer to grow back in. Before I was using a 2 blade razor. It works really well. I got my initial razor through bzzagent but definitely will be getting the refills</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter &amp; she hasn&#x27;t complained, so I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Very good razor, I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> A great razor for a busy mom. No shave gel needed and never knicks my skin. I get a close, comfortable shave and my legs feel moisturized every time. It is very comfortable to hold the handle and allows me to shave in minutes when I am in a hurry! I go to try this product for free thanks to Schick and Buzz Agent and I am now a loyal purchaser of Schick Hydro!</li>
            <li> I switch from Gillette to Schick after trying their disposable razors.  They are so smooth, and the mosturizing strip lasts longer than Gillettes.</li>
            <li> Maybe the razor I got was faulty, but here is my review anyway.  The razor cannot be felt on your skin during use, this was my first concern.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly close enough and is great if you like the 5 o&#x27; clock shadow look. Personally I don&#x27;t like that look on my legs or anywhere else for that matter.  The head is bulky and just doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot; for those hard to reach, lady spots.  The hydration stip around the razer is not securely attatched and if bumped, can flip or push back, at this point you may feel the razor as that piece also acts as a bumper guard so to speak and is what keeps the razor away from the skin, as it would normally stick out further than the razors.  Went back to my old (cheaper)razor that I will just by new refill cartridges for.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these razors for free by participating in a BzzAgent campaign.  I have always bought the cheapest razors that i could get because i used to think a razor is a razor is a razor.  This razor has changed my mind!!  My legs have never felt so soft and smooth after shaving.  It gives a close shave and really does moisturize very well.  My legs feel smooth all day!  It does a wonderful job and last for several shaves.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with razor from the start. As any brand-new razor right from the package will do, during my first usage I got a great shave and my legs looked wonderful. Now for real test number 1. Would I get that dreaded 5 o’clock shadow? I had minor re-growth, but truthfully it wasn’t as bad as I typically have. Real test #2 – How would the razor last subsequently, shave after shave? Shave two, three, four…. All were great. I continued to have silky-smooth legs after every shave. Ready for real test #3? How many shaves would I get with a disposable? So…. I received my BzzAgent box in mid-April (Hooray for free samples!). It’s mid-May, and I’M STILL USING THE FIRST RAZOR. Yes. I had to use caps because OMG IT’S STILL SHAVING LIKE A CHAMP. That was a completely unexpected pleasant surprise. I’m at least on shave 20-something and still getting great results. So ultimately, I’ve thrown out my former 5-blade razor and Schick’s Hydro-Silk Disposables are now my go-to! I cannot recommend them enough!</li>
            <li> They work well and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> I always buy Venus brand razors, but for whatever reason, I decided to change it up and bought this razor at my local Wal-Mart and I regret it. The blades dull so quickly and the replacement blades cost nearly $17, which I think is ridiculous! So, trying to save a couple bucks, I bought Schick Quattro replacement blades instead for about $12. I did not know that you need to buy the Hydro Silk blades otherwise they will not fit. I had assumed any Schick blades would fit on any Schick razor, just as any Venus blade can be put on any Venus razor, unfortunately this was not the case. Now my options are to go out and buy Hydro Silk blades, go out and buy a Schick Quattro razor, or give up on Schick, buy a new Venus razor and throw away $12 worth of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know before you buy, these blades dull SO QUICKLY, and you have to buy the Hydro Silk replacement blades, which for the price, if you like this razor, you might as well just buy a new razor each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be going back to Venus brand razors, and DO NOT recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing razor I have ever used. You can&#x27;t even feel the razor when you&#x27;re shaving. At first, I thought that there was something wrong with it because I couldn&#x27;t feel it but theres absolute nothing wrong with it. It left my legs smoother than ever. It&#x27;s so hydrating. Most definately the BEST razor I have ever used. Definately worth the money. I recommend you buy it. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, long lasting, and the conditioning on the top AND the bottom allow easy shaving with only water- even on sensitive skin! Be careful with new blades- they can be so sharp that they will burn sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Always leave this razor in a spot where the head isn&#x27;t resting on anything or very wet; the handle is designed to ensure this. If not, The conditioning serum WILL seep out and get all over the razor and proceed to dry into a sticky mess. I have found this can also happen while it is in its blade cover, so I don&#x27;t use that either.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as a promotion from the brand and I was excited to try it because I love Schick and am currently using the Schick Hydro Sensitive Care Razor and love it! The shave end was just as great as my current Schick razor that I&#x27;m using. It didn&#x27;t leave me any razor bumps or cuts and it cut smooth and I have very sensitive skin. While I was shaving my legs I noticed the trimmer was digging into the palm of my hand and it was very uncomfortable so I wouldn&#x27;t use this razor every day. I attempted to use the trimmer but was left very disappointed. It must be made for longer hair because even on the shortest setting it didn&#x27;t work very good. It also wasn&#x27;t very precise. I gave it three stars because the shave end was great and I really do love Schick products, just on this one too much.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of the Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors from Schick and I am greatly impressed. The handle is easy to hold and can be held comfortably many different ways depending on where you&#x27;re shaving. The shave itself is close but not so close that I cut myself. Also the hydrating serum around the blades left my skin feeling silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t have to use lotion after shaving like normal. The only draw back to this product is that it didn&#x27;t give me a quite as close shave as I would have liked on my bikini area. But regardless of the the bikini area I will definitely be buying Schick Hydro Silk® Disposable Razors in the future. For the price you can&#x27;t find another 5 blade hydrating razor.</li>
            <li> I got such a nice shave with these, very moisturizing and the handle is very flexible for bumpy areas like my knees.  Such a close shave and no razor burn which is very hard for me to find in a diposable razor.  Thanks schick for sending me a free pack to test out just in time for spring break.  I have already purchased another pack.</li>
            <li> I have been using another razor type (the one with a ring of soap around it) for years, and easily give it 5 stars, but I bought this at the supermarket the other day because they didn&#x27;t have what I needed. I was completely blown away how super smooth and close the shave was with this razor, even the next day, when usually I&#x27;m stubbly, I&#x27;m super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this for a while</li>
            <li> Best razors for my legs and armpits and needs a smooth finish afterwards never cuts my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the razor so you have to love the blades also so what can you really say, The price was better than at the local market and very pleased with my purchase, Does great for both men and women too,</li>
            <li> I got these as a promotion to try and they are by far the best and most efficient razors Ive ever used :-) 5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Got these razors free from BzzAgent but I liked them they got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use these dry please! you will get cut I recommend with shaving gel. Other than that issue I love the way these are built</li>
            <li> These razors might work ok the first time, but after that they are terrible.  I have never had such a problem with razor burn and it is not even a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> So much better than those cheaper razors.  No matter how much you have to pay, the more blades the better.  They seem to shave a lot closer &amp; you don&#x27;t feel like you still have stubble after shaving like you do with other brands .  They give you a nice smooth shave without feeling like you are getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it for long enough to hate it, but I love this razor. I&#x27;ve been recommending it to everyone because I&#x27;ve never had a razor that&#x27;s been so easy to use. I usually have a hard time getting a smooth shave in the shower, but it&#x27;s so easy with this one. It&#x27;s such a close shave that I only have to use it twice a week on my legs. I had a Gillette Venus before but this one is definitely better.</li>
            <li> Good razor, very soft, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Best razor out there! The handle is easy to use and the shave is so close. It moisturizes very well. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I was lucky to try the version created for sensitive skin through a program by Schick Hydro Sensitive Care razors. My overall impression is this thing does the job for me. I shaved early morning (only time when child is napping to have that chance these days) and here a day and a half later my legs are still unaffected from shaving. I usually get a dry or chapped feeling right after shaving. This did hold up to the statement of saying it keeps you moisturized for up to 2 hrs after shaving. Of course I use lotion daily, but none of the usual ill affects I have had after shaving from other products. The handle is designed well and perfect to hold. I like the case as it conceals the blades very well and hangs firmly on my shower wall. The strips can feel a bit gooey after wetting, but they do not fall apart and crumble all over my legs as I&#x27;ve had other razors with strips similar to this do. I get a very nice and close shave with this razor. I would recommend it, definitely.</li>
            <li> I received this product free via a program runby Schick Hydro Silk razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I used this razor, I was thinking to my self &amp;#34;well this looks just like any other razor I have ever used, what could possibly be so different?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, could I have not been more wrong. This razor is amazing! Not only does my skin feel more silky, smooth and hydrated after I shave but it produces a fantastic shave. It is the middle of winter and I have not had a problem using this razor at all, no dry skin! I have never had another razor that shaves as close and looks as clean as the shave that I received with this razor. Good Job Schick! I love the new Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor.  I used the Schick Quattro before but this one is way better.  You can&#x27;t beat the 5 blades</li>
            <li> I love Shick razors. I won&#x27;t use any other kind.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving. I really, really hate shaving. I have sensitive skin and razors are not always kind to it. However, I am also cheap, so waxing and other hair removal methods are off the table. I bought these razors after doing research on &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; razor, and I am not disappointed. In fact, I was actually wowed by how smooth the shave was!</li>
            <li> When it comes to shaving, I&#x27;m picky about the razors that I use. I don&#x27;t want to find an ingrown hair on my inner thigh when I&#x27;m about to go to the beach. I DEFINITELY hate when I come out the shower and find that one patch of hair that I forgot to shave. This razor, I got as a promotional sample from Schick ( with the help of BzzAgent *best site ever btw*).With the trim side of this razor, I am able to get hair outside of the shower ( which I love) and with the shaving side I am able to get a smooth and moisturizing shave!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these!! I was provided a pack of these from schick (through bzzagent) to try and they are awesome! I only needed a tiny bit of shave gel. They provided enough moisture so the blades were smooth against my legs.  Will definitely be purchasing when these are finished!</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail from buzzagent to try out FOR FREE!!! yeah isnt it great. it&#x27;s awesome that I can shave and trim in the shower at the same time without being electrocuted lol and I really need that with my busy schedule and being in a rush all the time. i will say that the razor does do what it says. it made my legs extra smooth without shaving cream which is kinda hard  It did not irritate my skin at all. No red spots or scraps. No itching through out the day like some razors can cause. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I got this item free thru BzzAgent and tried it for the first time yesterday.  It worked great!  Very smooth, close shave, with no razor burn or bumps - I didn&#x27;t use shaving cream either :).  The trimmer side is just a bonus.  Did not disappoint!  Will have to continue to see how it works before I give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This razor has a moisture release system with what are basically dots. I shaved my legs only twice. Twice, and the razor was already shot. It completely ran out of \\&quot;moisture dots.\\&quot; I was extremely disappointed. I&#x27;ll be going back to using my Gillette Venus with actual shaving cream bars built in. Those are the way to go and they rock. I have used them for up to a month, shaving every other day, without running out of shaving bar, as long as they aren&#x27;t soaked before use. That would be my suggestion to anyone looking for a long lasting, moisturizing razor with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I received a three pack of these to try for free from Schick, and I was totally shocked by my results. I first have to say the grip is great. It is very comfortable and I do not feel as if my hand is going to slip off when wet or soapy. The constant moisture that is released from the moisture strip is fantastic, and after two weeks of use, it stills has the same amount of moisture released. For a disposable razor, the results are amazing! My legs have never been this smooth before!</li>
            <li> My new favorite razor! I was able to recieve this product as part of a campaign for free in exchange for an honest review. This razor is #1 for summertime as we ladies MUST get every single follicle and DESTROY its existance! haha. But seriously, This razor paired with skintimate shave gel is a match made in shaving heaven! the 5 blades glide on so smooth and contour to your shape for virtually no room for nics/cuts. And the hydrating layer slides on immediately after the first shave to keep your legs moistureized! And the baldes keep their luster and sharpness. I find myself only having to change the blade once every 5-8 weeks if im shaving 2x a week (summer time) in winter its much , MUCH less. lol. You can find them here on amazon and the refills are a great price! Easy to use, great on the legs and underarms. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I got these from bzzagent as a free trial in exchange for my opinion. I love them, with the five blades, it really reduces irritation. My free trial came with Skintimate Silky Skin Moroccan oil shave gel, which combined with these razors, is smooth GAM heaven.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor does a great job, the only problem I have is the handle is too big to fit in the hold on my shower caddy.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor! Had to be extra careful, because the blades are very sharp &amp; cut close to the skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a review on Amazon for the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor yet, so here goes:&lt;br /&gt; Being a woman of European descent, and taking after my Dad (who my husband affectionely calls &amp;#34;the werewolf), I am a hairy gal. Yeah, I said it. And being cursed with pale skin and dark hair means I have to shave. A lot. So I was excited to try the Shick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor from BzzAgent [which means I got to try the razor for free, just for reviewing it]. I used the razor for the first time this morning. What first caught my eye was the handle design. It was like the people at Schick read my mind and they were like, &amp;#34;straight razor handles? That&#x27;s nonsense! Let&#x27;s make a handle with some curves, like the lovely females who will be using it.&amp;#34; I appreciated the curved handle, with the wider base, for my hand. It makes shaving easier, and makes it easier to go around the tricky parts of your leg, like ankles, toes, and knees. The razor also comes with a hydrating strip, which make the razor glide with ease. I just used the razor with my normal shower gel, and I didn&#x27;t need any extra shaving cream. Another revelation with this razor was that I only needed to go over each part of my leg once! With other razors I have used, I have had to go over the same spots 2 or 3 times until the hair was gone. And the final result? Legs and underarms that are as smooth as Barry White&#x27;s voice. Using this razor will make your legs and underarms feel smooth and hydrated. I have had problems before with irritated underarms after shaving, but with the Shick Hydro Care Sensitive Care Razor, no irritation! This will be my razor for life!</li>
            <li> Its best razor that i had. Never have irritation after using it. It simply glides on my skin and nourishes it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I got to try these for free from Schick and I really loved them. The shave was super close, no nicks, no clogged up blades, no bumps, and I even noticed the whole day how much softer my skin was after using them. I tried these for my first shave after a long cold winter, and my skin was revitalized and ready for Spring skirt weather! You might not need shaving cream with these since the moisturizing strip is almost like a shave gel once it gets wet. They would be great for vacation when you don&#x27;t want to have to worry about finding a travel sized can of shaving cream to pack. 1 razor lasts all week. Just keep them dry in between uses so you don&#x27;t lose all that goodness in the moisturizing strip.</li>
            <li> Schick sent me a free sample of these to try and I loved them! I am usually pretty particular about my razors due to my sensitive skin. I always exfoliate first and also use shaving cream for sensitive skin which helps as well. I felt like I got a close shave and did not experience any razor burn. I also did not break out using these as well. I shaved two days ago and my skin still feel really soft, so much better than when I use the cheap no name brand razors. Definitely would recommend purchasing these!</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this for the travel cover in the picture.  I didn&#x27;t come with the package.  I like the razor although the blades run out rather quickly.  Keep extra on hand.</li>
            <li> Just received this for free from BuzzAgent and I&#x27;m very impressed by the results! My legs and bikini line is smooth to the touch and the trimmer side is great with an adjustable power on/off massage. Would definitely recommend to any woman who needs to straighten up their bikini line.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I do not cry when I shave my legs, my son does. He is one and I never feel like I can shower fast enough, never the less have the time to lather up my legs, take 3 swipes on every section of my leg, and rinse it off---just to find spots left unshaved after my shower. Not anymore!!! This shaving blade is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: -One swipe- done -Long lasting (I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and it works like it&#x27;s brand new) -NO knicks or cuts (so far) in the past month (I usually have at LEAST one per time) -COmes with a convenient suction cup to attach to the shower wall (love- keeps it out of reach for my son) -no irritation (I have VERY sensitive skin) -leaves my legs feeling silky smooth -SAVES TIME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: -Still have to use lotion afterwards- I&#x27;m not sure if a razor actually exists that you do not need lotion afterwards but I would love to find one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Best razor I have tried so far! Definitely will continue to use this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#trieditfree #bzzagent #thanksSchick</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try these courtesy of BzzAgent and they are great. I&#x27;m prone to really bad razor bumps and irritation but didn&#x27;t have much suffering after using these lol. My legs were silky smooth and no nicks! The only thing I&#x27;d say that I didn&#x27;t really like is the serum that comes on the razor.. it can get a bit goopy and sticky.</li>
            <li> You know that goup that they put around women&#x27;s razors that gets all slimey when it&#x27;s wet?  This razor has so much of that stuff that the blades don&#x27;t encounter any friction and it just slides right over the area you&#x27;re shaving.  I tried peeling that stuff off, and it STILL doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had the amazing opportunity  to try the product for free thanks to Schick! I will not ever be buying another razor again! Gives great close shave and amazing moisture!</li>
            <li> I received these razors free to try from Schick. I was really happy with my shave for the first two times, my legs were left really smooth and they didn&#x27;t dry up after I toweled off. However, I noticed that these razors dull out really fast. After only a couple of shaves they stopped giving me as close of a shave. I would give more stars if they lasted longer, but still a good razor to take when you&#x27;re traveling for the weekend!</li>
            <li> I received this razor through the Bzz Agent campaign for free. This razor actually does its job. It provides a close shave to remove all the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any nicks behind. This razor actually provides moisture to the legs.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good price and fast shipping! I LOVE this brand! Schick Hydro Silk is THE BEST razor for a smooth, close shave! (Will be a stocking stuffer for a college girl.)</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro Silk Razor and cartridges provided me with the closest shave in one swipe of the blade that I have experienced in quite some time. No more need to run the razor over my underarms more than once to get the desired results - a great change from some of the previous razors I had been using. I tried this razor for the first time as a bzz agent and since trying them I have changed out my razors at home to be hydro silk for both my legs and underarms. If you struggle from course hair that can be a pain to make sure you get try the new Schick Hydro silk for smooth clear skin with just one swipe of the blade.</li>
            <li> The best ladies razor ever!  Doesn&#x27;t nick and is easy to clean. Super shaver and I love it, and will never go back to my old one.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro Silk are the only shavers that don&#x27;t cause me to have reactions to shaving....bumps, cuts, etc.  I highly recommend....</li>
            <li> I received a free Schick Hydro Silk Razor coupon in the mail as well as for $4 off the replacement heads. I was thrilled to get to try this out for free. The razor comes with two heads, the replacement heads are somewhat pricey($16.99 in store). I went online to see if I could get the blades cheaper but decided to try the razor first before purchasing the replacement heads, I&#x27;m glad I did! I will not be purchasing replacement heads. The razor doesn&#x27;t seem to work well with shaving cream and I second the \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock\\&quot; shadow look. No stubble but you can clearing see where the hair was removed from. On a positive note, my legs feel silky smooth. I&#x27;m going to try it again with body wash instead of shaving cream to see if this helps. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing though. This seems to have a lot of good reviews, if I were you I would look at the low star reviews to get a better feel for it. I don&#x27;t consider myself a picky razor person but I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables work better than this.</li>
            <li> All of the newest razors have this slick, built in moisturizer that makes them messy sitting in my shower and it simply a feature I don&#x27;t need. While I loved Venus razors for the longest time, I think this is better than their blades at this time and the best option I have found recently.</li>
            <li> I originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns. I was a bit skeptical at first because I have been an avid user of men&#x27;s razors for a long time as women&#x27;s razors never seemed to work for me. I started using a men&#x27;s razor in my teens and never looked back, until now. I got my wonderful campaign box in the mail and started using it right away as we are supposed to with the campaigns. I was really shocked that I found I had a lot less issues with ingrown hairs (I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand. I officially have changed to a Schick Hydro Silk for women razor and I am never looking back! I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li> Pretty good razors but get a weird mass buildup of the built in moisturizing gel that interferes with shaving.</li>
            <li> I have awful sensitive skin! This is the only product that have not caused any irritation on me and I will recommend it to anyone that have skin problems after shave!</li>
            <li> Creme de la creme! best razor I have tried so far! Got a free sample off of Bzzagent this past week and I loved this razor!It does an amazing job at moisturizing my legs even after I get out of the shower!  Gel razors are no my new favorite! I will definitely reccommend this to friends and family and will need to buy more for myself as well! A+</li>
            <li> This razor is premium and very beneficial to my legs it was very smooth and gave me a close shave</li>
            <li> I first pulled this out of the packaging in haste, as my boyfriends clippers were failing to work and he desperately needed help. I turned the razor on, and was amazed at how clean a cut the trimmer delivers. We trimmed up his hairline in minutes. Also the size of the trimmer head makes it way easier to be as precise as possible. Then I was finally able to use the razor. Although it was the same width as others, this razor felt wider and like it covered more area than most other razors. It has four blades, which we all know, the more the better. The moisturizing strip also makes it glide so smoothly, I felt like it really cut down on the time it took to shave. Oh yeah, and its WATERPROOF. While I have no personal need for the trimmer, my boyfriend has full access to it and has already gotten into the habit of using the trimmer for his facial hair. I think its awesome that the trimmer attachment is adjustable as well. It has far exceeded my expectations for a razor!&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for FREE from BzzAgent in exchange for my unbiased review* #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Very silky and smooth. Great shave. The moisture bar is great. Very good on curves and hard to reach places. Excellent  close shave.i recovered these as a promotion from bzz agent and they were terrific.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have more sensitive skin on my legs. But it&#x27;s nothing abnormal. I use the Venus and Olay razor. Love it! Tried this one &amp; was totally let down! The minute I made one short slow stroke I could feel the blades cutting up my skin! I know have razor bumps after using this razor. I hate it!</li>
            <li> Hey all! It is time for another product review for you all from some of our friends at Schick and at Bzzagent.com. This time it is a Schick Hydro Silk Razor review. It has been quite a while since I have been active on Bzzagent, but boy am I glad I got this campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty skeptical about this razor at first. I have been a die hard Schick Intuition fan since they first came out. I mean, who can beat a razor and shaving cream in ONE?? Well, maybe Schick themselves can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro Silk performed just as well, if not better, than my Intuition does. I did have to lather up a bit with soap as we don’t buy shaving cream here, but that wasn’t really a bother at all. I really actually preferred the shape of the handle on the Hydro Silk, and the shave was close, quick, and incredibly smooth. My legs felt very soft after the shave, much softer than after the Intuition shave, but I usually remedy that with a bit of lotion when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I highly recommend this razor. I&#x27;m able to go longer in between shaving times. My husband sure notices a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Schick Quattro for quite some time, quite happily. I saw that Schick had come out with a new razor with 5 blades and was supposed to moisturize more, so I decided to give it a try. I applied for a free sample online and when I received it in the mail I tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time out I shaved and I thought it worked pretty well...except the \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; feeling it leaves behind makes it difficult to know if you&#x27;ve gotten all the hair! Also, when I got out of the shower I noticed a little cut on my foot. I&#x27;ve NEVER cut myself using the Quattro! (which is the reason I&#x27;ve stuck with it. So many razors end up cutting even though I&#x27;m careful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another try, and this time as I shaved it felt like it was pulling my skin or something. Very uncomfortable. AND it cut me again, which I didn&#x27;t notice until after I got out of the shower. The Quattro has those vertical metal pieces that cross the blades, right? The Hydro Silk does not, and I think that&#x27;s the major problem with this razor which is causing so many problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense it is above the Quattro. Sure, it leaves your skin feeling super smooth...for a few hours (maybe), but the negative aspects outweigh the positive for this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor brand that I will use. The blades seem to last longer than that of any other brand. The handle is ergonomically correct for easy shaving. Even better the package comes with a replacement blade. I&#x27;ve found that its much cheaper to purchase a new razor every time rather than replacement blades!</li>
            <li> Okay razor. Definitely not the best  one out there. Shipping was fast and I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased these razors for my daughter who has a tough time finding razors that work well for her. She has been very pleased with the shaves and relatively long-life of these razors.</li>
            <li> I received a sample as a promotion to share my results and its a must buy kind of product! I have shaved once with this razor! This is amazing and glides so smooth! Your husband can have his razor back you&#x27;ve got your own now!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have ever used!  It makes my legs extra smooth!  Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I just got this razor today and I love it. It left my legs nice and smooth with no razor burn. To the best of my knowledge, it&#x27;s also cruelty free. I think it&#x27;ll be sticking with the Hydro Silk!</li>
            <li> These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  When combined with a good quality gel shave cream, they work better than anything else I have used and last up to a month, even with my steel wool-like face and body hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product that leaves your legs feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting all these positive reviews, it&#x27;s like you paid people to write them. I bought this razor the other day and while it did offer a nice, close shave, it cut me up. In the one time I have used it I got cut 9 times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never buying it again, I think I&#x27;m going to return to Gelette Fusion...</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Sensor Excel for ages. It was the first non-disposable razor I ever bought (when I was 15), but I basically switched to the Quattro a few years ago to try something new. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, the hair that disappeared from my eyebrows and eyelashes reappeared on my legs lol. These days I find it harder to get a smooth shave! The Hydro does a better job on my legs than the Quattro, but I agree with the reviewer who commented on the skin pulling. Take it slowly as not to cut yourself, and make sure you exfoliate. I haven&#x27;t cut myself with it thus far, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide smoothly over the skin. The Quattro I have cut myself with maybe once or twice, but not once with the Sensor Excel ever. All the blades on the Hyrdo make me a little fearful lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor irritated my underarms the first and only time I used it there.  I did try this once on my bikini area, and surprisingly without irritation! (Maybe because I was more careful there? I don&#x27;t know) However I stick with the Sensor Excel for my bikini and underarm areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect anything moisturizing out of the Hydro. Even with the Venus razor I tried, I still didn&#x27;t omit my regular shaving cream. Between this and the Venus, I probably like the Venus better but will just switch between the two depending on what&#x27;s on sale. But I do like both the Hydro and Venus better than the Quattro.</li>
            <li> I received a three pack of these free to try from Bzzagent. I love the swivel head that conforms to those hard-to-shave areas around my knees. My legs stay smooth and hydrated for days, and after a month I am still using the same razor. Very good quality and comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to share with you my schick hydro silk sensitive care&lt;br /&gt;Razor experience.&lt;br /&gt;  My legs feel incredibly smooth and soft. They have no rash bumps&lt;br /&gt;from not shaving for so long.&lt;br /&gt;I also did my bikini area. It to feels nice and smooth and soft and&lt;br /&gt;silky. There are no bumps from shaving which is a huge relief because&lt;br /&gt;I always get bumps there and hopefully we will be swimming soon so I&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use this razor.</li>
            <li> I tried this razor out this morning and really like it! The shape of the razor is similar to the Gillette Venus razor, which I was using before.  You need to use a slightly different angle, but you get used to it quickly.  The moisturizing strips work really well, and it gives you a very close shave.  Even without lotion, my legs felt a lot more moisturized than they did before my shower. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used, and I have tried maaannyy different brands. Way better than all of the ones offered by Venus and Gillette. Usually when I buy a razor that has a moisturizing strip it dries up after about 3 uses. I&#x27;ve been using the same blade for about 3 weeks (I shave every other day) and it hasn&#x27;t dried up yet and it&#x27;s still pretty sharp. Hasn&#x27;t cut my legs or given me a rash either, which happens often when I use Venus. I don&#x27;t really need to use shaving cream either. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Like most extra bladed razors I have tried I get razor burn. It gives a close shave but I am disappointed that another one irritates my skin. I used it 3 days ago and I still have little red bumps. I bought this one on a whim since the replacement blades were cheaper then 18 dollars too. I am tempted to go back to my original razor after this one is used up. It only had 3 blades.</li>
            <li> I got to try this razor free as part of a BZZAGENT campaign. This razor is amazing. I love getting campaigns for products that I really love! Here is what I like about the Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® Razor that has made me switch from my other brand 5 blade razor:&lt;br /&gt;*fits in my hand so comfortably which gives me more control so I don&#x27;t cut my legs on tricky spots like knees and ankles&lt;br /&gt;*the combination of the moisture strip and 5 blades leaves my legs SO soft. I had forgotten they could feel like that! Schick® Hydro Silk® Sensitive Care® Razor gives me SUCH a good, close shave!&lt;br /&gt;*Zero bumps or razor burn. I really do have sensitive skin and this razor leaves me with nothing but smooth skin! I don&#x27;t even have bumps or razor burn even if I go in the hot tub after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;*the blade lasts a lot longer than my other brand 5 blade razor. I&#x27;ve been using it awhile and it is barely dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely suggest you try this razor. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these blades, since my husband has the same razor (but for men) and those blades work much better.  These blades give me red bumps and ingrown hairs every time, no matter how long it&#x27;s been since I last shaved or what shaving gel I use.  Not sure why, but I have given up on using this razor with the women&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I was originally using a Venus Embrace, but I wanted to try out some different razors because I have sensitive skin on my legs that are prone to bumps and redness. So, I wanted to sJeesh what other potential options I had and how they put up against my current razor. A family member of mine recommended the Schick Quatro to me because I admired how smooth her legs were and how they were bump free. So, I went to the store and checked out the different Schick razors and decided on this one because it said that it was for sensitive skin on the packaging. Well, I was not impressed at all. The razors themselves only last 3-4 days without beginning to leave stubble behind on freshly shaved legs. With my Venus Embrace, I am able to get at least 5-6 days of use. Additionally, as I get into the third day, it leaves me with a lot of bumps and redness. So, for the price, only getting 2 semi-satisfying days out of a single razor cartirige, I could not justify it. Let alone the fact that it irritated my skin. Overall, I will not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I normally get that cheap sack full of basic razors, but got a free sample of this one to try.  I must admit is actually does work a bit better.  It seems to be easier to just the job done and no razor rash afterwards.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This razor didn&#x27;t give me a close shave and gave me razor burn even when used with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> i shouldnt review this because i havent tried it or recieved it yet LOL but i know that the mens one works amazing! the refills are prety expensive but i love that razor so hopefully this one owrks just as WELL :d</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good razor but I love the Venus Embrace more.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave, lightweight handle.  Blades last fairly long.  Gentle and did I mention the smooth shave? I needed a few more words.  I think smooth shave, long lasting blades would have really summed it up.</li>
            <li> I like this razor, but I don&#x27;t love it. It does a fabulous job on my legs. It gets all the hair on the first stroke and leaves behind a smooth finish. On other areas? Not so much. The size of the razor head and the number of blades makes it a little impractical for other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel like I have to apply more pressure for the razor to be effective. Perhaps the moisture strip protrudes too much; not really sure what the deal is with that. I get that the whole point of this razor is moisture, moisture, moisture, but it made me feel pretty slimy on areas I had to go over more than once and it made the razor slide around a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;ll stick to my usual brand for now.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to shaving and tends to leave bumps no matter how much gel I use. I&#x27;ve tried EVERY razor out there...even MEN razors! I used this and you can&#x27;t even feel the blades on your skin, It&#x27;s like silk!! And what I didn&#x27;t get was all those nasty spots and razor bumps! I personally hate shaving, because of all the bumps and cuts I get, but this razor has really made me change my mind. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new razor to love! I usually use my hubby&#x27;s, but now I have one of my own to love!</li>
            <li> it cuts, and feels better on skin than a lot of other razors that my wife tried. It&#x27;s more comfortable to use, and doesn&#x27;t cut or irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> I was chosen by BzzAgent to try these razors for free. Yippee! The opinions are 100% my own from my experience with Schick Hydro Silk Razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited but leery about trying these razors. I have tried and used so many brands in the past. Some have been better then others. I live in the hot south and wear shorts a lot during the summer. Stubble and irritation are not a choice for me!! The last razor I bought was a mens razor that required pricey replacement blades. I thought it was worth it as it gave me a pretty decent shave. Hahahahaaaaa Never again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also received the Skintimates Skin Therapy Shaving Gel with Morrocan Oil to try with my Hydro Silk razors. Holy Smokes!!! I am pretty confident I have found the last brand of razors I will ever need to try. I loved the results I received with these products. I have yet to have any irritated or bumpy skin from shaving with these. Even when I was at the beach and shaving daily!! These razors provide the closest and smoothest shave I have ever felt. They also do not seem to leave my skin dried out like others have in the past. This could be due to the added moisturizers in the blades as well as using the Skintimates shave gel. Whatever it is- I am hooked!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear it also seems like my hair is growing back a little less thick now that I am getting such a smooth shave. I was talking about this with my boyfriend. He said based on what I was telling him it sounded like I gained at least one day in between my normal shaving routine. He was right! Not only does this razor provide the smoothest shave it also last longer between shaves. Yes! Yes! Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the benefits of this razor including the 5 blades, moisturizing serum (added bonus) and the handle design! I felt like the Schick Hydro Silk Razor was a great angle for reaching all the tough areas of my legs, etc! But, it was also the perfect weight. I have never liked razors that were to light. Those tend to cut my legs more often. This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this razor are great! I am so excited I was able to try this product out for free on BzzAgent! But, honetly the most impressive thing about this experience has been the results I have received. Having smoother legs for a longer period of time seems like every womans dream come true! If you are really looking for a great quality razor this is it!e often. This razor was kind of just the right weight and design to glide over my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this razor are great!

            <li> This razor is really good. I didn&#x27;t even have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I can usually feel stubble within hours of shaving, but with product, it feels like super smooth and silky even the next day.  I do find trying to get the 5-blade head to make good contact is a bit awkward, but the result is definitely better than what you can get with a simple 3-blade razor.</li>
            <li> So I bought this razor because I got a great coupon in the mail, so I was surprised that even at that value this razor could SUCK so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade just is NOT SHARP enough. I used it for the first time and had to go over a couple times. How can blades be dull right when you open them??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was left itching and irritated and definitely not a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shick quartos for years and will go back to them, cuts and irritation are NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice razor works well</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a new razor since, well, lets just say it&#x27;s been a long time!  The 5-blade design took me a few shaves to get used to, but it&#x27;s a super close shave.  I love the moisturizing serum.  I shave with just soap and water, and with this razor my legs feel soft and hydrated for days after a shave. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this razor free as part of a bzz campaign.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it!</li>
            <li> So being an Italian Irish blend, I have very thick, dark, difficult hair. I have been using the Venus razors for a while &amp; really like them, except for the Venus w/ Olay strips, those are just AWFUL. But after I tried the Schick hydro silk razor, I&#x27;m saying bye-bye to my Venus for good! Not only do I get a closer shave, the cartridges last about twice as long as the Venus!</li>
            <li> I received the Schick Hydro Silk to try for free from bzzagent. Previously I had been using the Schick Intuition for the convenience of having a razor and shave cream in one package. I was excited to try the Hydro silk because I had never been very satisfied with the closeness of the shave of the Intuition.  I have been using the Hydro silk for almost one month and it does not dissappoint. First of all it gives a very close shave with one pass of the razor.  Each cartridge is really long lasting. I have been using the same cartridge for almost a month and it seems like it has hardly dulled at all and the moisturizing serum hasn&#x27;t been used up ( I shave about once every three days). I also really liked the flexibility of the head of the razor. It makes it really easy to shave around your knees and I even used it to shave my bikini line without any problems. I will say that I didn&#x27;t notice any less irritation with this razor as opposed to ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past but I tend to have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving. I also didn&#x27;t notice any added benefits from the moisturizing serum. My skin was just as dry as ever after each shave. Despite that I would buy the Hydro Silk in the future because of the close shave it gives, the length of time each cartridge lasts and the flexibility of the head.</li>
            <li> I got a random free sample of this from an online order last year. It worked SO much better than the the razor I was using before. (Schick Quattro For Women Trimstyle Razor &amp; Bikini Trimmer). So I fell for their free sample and have been buying replacements ever since! The handle is really nice and the blade moves with your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and this razor gets very close without being irritating. If you use shaving cream it works like a charm! It also stays sharp for a while.I usually can keep the blade for a few months in the winter, but in the summer a month is pushing it for me.  It is best to keep it upright and in a dry area. If you leave it sitting out in the shower or moist area the silk dots are activated and then a lot of it will come out at once. If this happens it doesn&#x27;t ruin the razor, but it&#x27;s not ideal. Instead of a lot of uses of slowly getting extra moisture, it will be used up in a use or two. After a few uses it looks like the extra moisture dots are all gone, but they really do keep working for a while! It just releases a small amount at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refills are expensive, but they do make a disposable version now that is much cheaper! I bought a pack of those and turns out it is the EXACT SAME head, only with a cheaper handle. I easily pulled it off of the disposable handle and fit perfectly on my more sturdy handle :)</li>
            <li> every woman should use this razor, its a close long lasting shave with a comfortable grip and a nice suction hanger for the shower!</li>
            <li> It did arrive very promptly and in good condition.  But did not produce as much &amp;#34;hydrating gel&amp;#34; as I expected based on the ads I&#x27;ve seen.  Also the blades do not swivel as easily as I&#x27;d like for shaving my legs and such.  Was ok for shaving my armpits where the skin is less sensitive.  I still prefer the Venus Embrace.</li>
            <li> Coming from a Schick Quattro, here are some of the things that come to mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely a difference in glide with shaving cream (will try without when I need a touch up)&lt;br /&gt;- MUCH BETTER on armpits, usually a very sensitive area for me, glided with no problems AND removed all the hair with no stubble left behind&lt;br /&gt;- Skin clearly much more moisturized, probably a combo of the special gel and the dry skin shaving gel I used. Still! Better to the point I can skip lotion right after&lt;br /&gt;- Special gel on the blade still there even after shaving, and still seems to be a lot of it. Not sure if that&#x27;s due to the use of shaving gel or not.&lt;br /&gt;- Did have to repeat a few areas, but maybe I wasn&#x27;t pressing hard enough (With the Quattro it was easy to go too hard and get nicked, so going light-handed is what I&#x27;m used to)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean compared to the Quattro, which seemed to clog constantly if I waited a week to shave again&lt;br /&gt;- Why are replacement blades $3 more? -_-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: blades are pricey, but the experience is worth it if you&#x27;re willing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just bought this at target and it&#x27;s awful.  I barely get a close shave and I&#x27;m left with terrible razor burn.  Not to mention the replacement blades are a complete ripoff!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Venus razor for years.  I had not tried the Schick Hydro Silk® razor until I received a free one from Bzz Agent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: glides smoothly over my skin (much more so than Venus), blades stay sharp (haven&#x27;t changed the blade in a weeks use and it is still sharp), suction cup hanger (pretty handy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: if you drop the razor, it is hard to get the blade back on the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about the cost of the blades quite yet.  I am a little worried, but if I need to pay a little more for something that lasts longer and performs better, then it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I recently got a free Schick Hydro Silk razor to use.  Another reviewer said that you can&#x27;t even feel the razor on your skin--it&#x27;s kind of true.  I hardly feel it, but I get a super close and smooth shave.  My favorite part is that I can fly over my ankles and knees, getting a close shave, and not get any nicks or cuts!  I&#x27;m a fan and will keep using this and am replacing my former razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It&#x27;s sharp, but glides over bumps, bones to prevent nicking.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of razors and my skin hates shaving! I only tried this razor once so far, but I am very happy with it. My skin did not get any razor bumps and my skin was not irritated.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a great razor. It seems that I have to shave my legs everyday because my hair grows back so quickly. With the Schick Hydro Razor I can now do every other day because with the 5 blades, I&#x27;m able to get a closer shave. The cost of this razor is a little pricey, but I think its well worth it!</li>
            <li> SO I usually buy disposable razors. I just never really understood why I should pay more for a reusable one when I get about the same shave from a disposable. I received the Schick Hydro Silk razor from bzzAgents and gave it a try. Now I get it. I&#x27;ve never had a razor with such a soft smooth shave before. It&#x27;s so much more comfortable than the disposables I was using. I feel like it&#x27;s impossible to nick myself with this which means I can shave faster and it looks better and feels better than before. I also noticed that since it seems to be more gentle than the average razor, my legs arent getting dried out like they used to. I&#x27;m not compelled to lotion my legs right after shaving like I used to. All in all I&#x27;m a huge fan and I dont think I&#x27;ll be able to go back to disposables. Consider me converted.</li>
            <li> I used to exclusively use Venus products until I finally tried this! I&#x27;m never going back! I believe the shave is closer and more comfortable with this razor and plan to keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> Work s Great for shaving..</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and does everything it says it should. It is nice that it does come with the shower hanger.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out what this goop is that is coming out of my razor. It prevents the blades from getting close enough to my skin to reach the hair. When I try to rinse it off it just floods out of the razor. I tried replacing the bade and the next one was just as bad so I know that&#x27;s not the problem. It&#x27;s disgusting and horrible to use. I much prefer the schick men&#x27;s razors, they have sharper blades that last longer and no GOOP!</li>
            <li> I loved the close shave I got with this product, it seems like the blade is larger then my normal brand of razor so it took a lot less time then normal. This will definitely be my razor of choice from now on!</li>
            <li> Honestly I got this for free to try out from BuzzAgent and I got to say I&#x27;m really happy with it. The razor is fine nothing super special but not by any means bad. The trimmer however really makes this product a 10! I love that its the only tool I need now, and for me at least it worked better on the shorter setting. I would definitely recommend this to others, and it comes with the battery you need to use the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I received these razors from bzzagent and let me tell ya, they are pretty darn good!!! The honestly leave your skin feeling so hydrated and smooth!! I have extremely sensitive skin and am pron to razor burn.. I&#x27;m happy to say I was actually able to apply scented lotion directly after a shave!! That alone, to me, shows how little these razors irritate the skin!! Would definitely recommend and will continue purchasing!!!!</li>
            <li> I received my Schick Hydro Silk TrimStyle Razor free though Bzzagent a few days ago. I tried it out right away. I must say I am glad that I did. I got a nice close shave and it left my legs nice and smooth. You are also able to use the trimmer without water when you have one of those speedy get ready days but still want to look good.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been such a chore, I have light skin and dark leg hair so 3-4 days after shaving its time to shave again! I was previously using the schick quatro for women and it was still taking me 40-45 minutes to shave every time I shaved. I was seriously starting to consider laser hair removal for the bottom half of my legs, which is my problem area just to ease the difficulty of having to spend so much time on grooming. I decided to try other razors first since laser hair removal is such big financial and time commitment and tried the Schick Hydro Silk for women and have never looked back. It hydrates your skin as you shave, is very smooth and cut my shave time by 30 minutes to only 15 minutes.  I no longer have to schedule in my &amp;#34;shave day/time&amp;#34;, I can just do it quickly during a regular shower. I will not be getting laser hair removal and will stick to this razor from now on.</li>
            <li> As an avid saver, I&#x27;m always looking for other brands I can use to get the most for my money.  Up to this point, I&#x27;ve been using a Venus Embrace (5 blade) to both deal with my coarse hair and sensitive sking. I was SO excited to be chosen for this Bzz Campaign!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, sadly, the design and idea were better than the execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Love that it comes with two cartridges and a handy place to hang it in the shower.  The hanger is just a suction cup, so it&#x27;d be perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;+The handle is a great shape, which made it perfect for holding on to in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;+A sort-of pro:  I stopped using Schick in the past because of the wires that crossed from top to bottom.  Hair always got stuck in there, and it was terrible!  The new design is better, with there being an additional metal bar aross each blade level, intended (I assume) to be more gentle for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;+The moisturizing beads and these bars DID keep my very sensitive skin from getting irritated, so it definitely met the expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-There is really only one con for me, and this is probably very specific to my hair type.  I have a medical condition that means my hair is VERY thick and VERY coarse, it also grows fairly quickly.  Here is where that \\&quot;sort-of\\&quot; pro comes in:  the bars meant to protect your skin also keep the blades from getting as close a shave as I get with the Venus.  I use the Embrace because the moisture strip around the blades help protect my sensitive skin.  Because of the guards on the Schick blades, the shave wasn&#x27;t as close.  The result was that I already had stubble later in the day.  Definitely not okay, since I don&#x27;t want to have to shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you have slower, normal to fine hair growth, this razor will probably be great for you.  My skin was certainly softer after shaving, and I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation.  I just require a closer shave than these razors provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***While I got this for free from the AWESOME crew at BzzAgent.com, opinions are my own.While I got this for free from the AWESOME crew at BzzAgent.com, opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> i love this razor, its my very favorite one. ive been using since it came out. nothing really else to say. it makes shaving easier. glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because Schick doesn&#x27;t test on animals but i enjoy it. It has 5 blades which makes shaving quicker and i like the lotion that is built into the head of the razor</li>
            <li> Been a fan of Schick since Intuition. Hydro silk is super smooth, leaves skin soft &amp; no knicks. I have tried many others. I like gillette Venus but I really like hydro silk.</li>
            <li> This handle is cheap, all plastic, and without any extra force nor dropping it, it broke on the 3rd shave.  Complete waste of money.  I&#x27;m now looking for a sturdier handled razor.</li>
            <li> I am honestly disappointed with this razor. Actually, I am disappointed with all schick razors. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I exfoliate first, when I use these razors my legs are never smooth. It was nice that I didn&#x27;t need to use soap. I love the style of the razor. I am such not happy that immediately after shaving, it feels like I need to shave again. Thanks to Schick for letting me try the product for free.</li>
            <li> My wife has used these for a long while, and is quite happy with them. No problems to report.</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to the cream the seeps from the razor when you get it wet. The first time I used the razor it left me with smooth skin and I really liked it but by the end of the day my legs were itchy and sensitive to the touch. I literally woke up itching my legs like crazy! It eventually got so painful that it kinda hurt to have fabric rub against them. After about 4 days my legs returned to normal... not being able to shave in the summer sucked by the way. I thought id try it one more time to make sure, and sure enough the same things happened. Needless to say its in the trash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors. They give me a clean close shave without razor burn. Which is a big for me I have very sensitive skin so not ending up with bumps is great. I like how easy the razor is to hold and that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I received these to review free of charge.</li>
            <li> Great product I tried this for free through bzzz agent and I loved it I also got some great shaving cream as well. I would recommend this it&#x27;s really great if you want smooth legs no cuts and the razors is great for legs, underarms , etc. I will def keep buying in the future</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> Ive never been impressed by razors that are supposed to moisturize or lubricate-i&#x27;ve always had to use shaving cream too. I usually just buy whatever razors are the cheapest. This one may make me reconsider -using no shaving cream at all this razor gave my underarms a clean and irritation free shave. I&#x27;ve now used it 5 times and the lubrication is still effective. ( I use an epilator on my legs do I cannot speak to how this holds up for legs) . The little case that comes with it has some use -it lets the razor dry while keeping the blade covered but a suction cup would make it more useful. A very nice change from the cheap razor.</li>
            <li> I love the new &amp;#34;Schick Hydro&amp;#34; It hydroizes as you&lt;br /&gt;shave! It has very nice handle to reach certain&lt;br /&gt;places. My skin feels silky and smooth for weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. M.</li>
            <li> I have a Schick quattro that I like very much, but the store was out of blades and I live 50+ miles away from a reasonably sized store so I decided to give the Hydro Silk a try. It&#x27;s not terrible, but has 2 big flaws. First, the shave itself is noticeably not as good as the Quattro, even with the fifth blade. Second, and the really big one for me, is that I have had At least mild razor burn almost every time I&#x27;ve used it. I do not have very sensitive skin and very rarely get razor burn, so this is a big downside for me. I will definitely be going back to the Quattro as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> I like it - nice and smooth - good handle etc, but the clear head where the replacement cartridges snap in gets really cruddy looking after awhile.  I finally &#x27;snapped out&#x27; the small white &#x27;button&#x27; - used to replace cartridges and soaked the razor clear head part in vinegar and rinsed the heck out of it.  Has anyone else had this &#x27;gross&#x27; problem?  I haven&#x27;t noticed it with my other razors.  The clear head of this one seems like a bit of a water trap.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Schick Hydro Silk Sensitive Care Razor as part of a program run by Schick and I&#x27;m 100% sold on it! The razor glides across my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me with any knicks or cuts, which is huge. It has a cushiony handle, which makes it easy to grip and a swivel head that allows for a really close shave. I&#x27;ll never go back to my disposable Bic razors, again!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I got the Schick Hydro Silk razor free and tried it out.  The 5 blade razor works amazing.  There is no going over the same area twice.The blade glides effortlessly across curves, and leaves all parts feeling silky smooth.  I paired it with the Skintimate tropical shave gel and it worked great.  No niks or cuts, yet an extremely close shave.  I would definitely recommend these razors to anyone who wants a quick, close shave with silky smooth results.</li>
            <li> I like this razor and have repurchased it several times. The issue I have is that every single time the handle breaks after a few months. Always in the same place. I&#x27;ll still keep busing it but you always need a backup.</li>
            <li> Ok , what is great about it . It really makes your legs very smooth . It might be the best razor but the problem is , every time I use it my legs become on fire . As if it removes the skin with the hair . I will to use this again .</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  Its sleek design fits nicely in my hand and it is easy to grip even when it gets wet.  The aloe strip on the blade leaves legs feeling smooth and silky.  My biggest complaint: cost of refill razors is too high.</li>
            <li> I have had the Shick Hydro Silk razor for about 4 years now and it is top notch. Before that, I used the same razor for probably 7 years give or take. I typically shave my legs and underarms on a daily basis so it&#x27;s important that I have a razor that works and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The grip on the Schick Hydro Silk razor is extremely comfortable and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart even 4 years later. I store my razor in the shower too, so this is kind of amazing to me.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges last me about 2 months and they aren&#x27;t even rusting when I decide it&#x27;s time to replace them. My old razor&#x27;s cartridges used to rust fairly quickly causing me to have to replace them quite often. The cost of those adds up fairly quickly, so I&#x27;m thankful I no longer have to do this.&lt;br /&gt;The razor provides a close shave no matter where on my body I use it, and the hydrating strip is awesome because I don&#x27;t have to worry about razor burn or dry scaly legs. It moisturizes my legs while I&#x27;m shaving which saves time and money on lotion. In today&#x27;s world, everyone is about saving time and money. Convenience is key!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor is my favorite and I will continue to use it until it falls apart at which point I will likely replace it with the same thing (or newer version).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best razor I have ever owned. Here are the reasons that I love this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. One pass and hair is gone. No going over areas multiple times - saves time and helps prevent skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Stays sharp...forever. Well maybe not forever, but I&#x27;ve been using the same blades for about a year, shaving my legs and underarms every other day, and I still get a nice smooth finish after only one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Goodbye razor burn and razor cuts! I have cut myself maybe once in the past year and have NEVER had razor burn. I only use soap/body wash (not shaving cream) while showering. This razor gives a very close shave without being rough on your skin while shaving. When I went on vacation, I took a disposable triple blade razor (I think it was Soliel trip blade) and shaving was so painful compared to this razor, and I was left with horrilbly uncomfortable razor burn! I never knew how comfortable shaving could be. I will never go back to my old razors again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Cost effective. Althought I have not had to use them, I got 4 replacement blades for about $18 (a little over $4 per blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous razors included Intution, Venus, and Soleil. This razor is infinitely better than anything I have tried before.</li>
            <li> Not a fan.  The smoothing strips on this razor wore off way too quickly.  For the price it is definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> I received one free through bzzagent and enjoyed only having to shave each area once since it had 5 blades.  Also recommend the schick shaving cream along with it. When not using shaving cream my legs still feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a very nice, close shave, but I hate the handle.  It is too thin and thus feels difficult to maneuver.  I prefer the handle on the Schick Quattro--much easier to handle.  If I could put the razors from the Hydro Silk onto the Schick Quattro handle, I would have the perfect razor.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I am petite, and the head of this razor is very large, therefore I found I couldn&#x27;t maneuver it effectively in tricky spots like my knees. I had to switch to a smaller, &amp;#34;no-frills&amp;#34; razor for that. A more average-sized person probably wouldn&#x27;t have any problems with this razor, though.</li>
            <li> I really love the Schick hydro silk razor. It leaves my legs smooth without any irritation. The easy grip handles gives you complete control which helps prevent nicks and cuts. The refills are a bit pricey but still least costly than similar products.</li>
            <li> So frickn&#x27; smooth.  I have been looking for a proper razor and now have found it! I just love it&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> No complaints. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> These work a lot better for me than the other brands (Gillette). Moisturizes nicely and lasts through a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m not a wolverine so I can&#x27;t talk too much but I have to mention the longevity of the razor! I bought a bunch in bulk because I&#x27;m so used to Venus, and swapping them out every 2 weeks but I&#x27;ve been using one razor for 2-3 months and it&#x27;s still sharp!</li>
            <li> These deliver a close, smooth shave time and time again. I&#x27;m really impressed with how many uses I&#x27;m getting out of a single cartridge! I&#x27;m very prone to nicks and razor burn, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this razor.</li>
            <li> Can find cheaper ones elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing tape gets used up pretty fast. And the blade is pretty small.&lt;br /&gt;It an ok product overall</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most razors out there, but I always come back to Schick. Their blades work better on me, somehow. They cut my hair and not my skin - I&#x27;ve sliced myself less with Schick than any other brand I&#x27;ve used. The Hydro Silk glides smoothly - I just wish the lotion strip lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try when I saw it at the drugstore. I was definately more than impressed! I&#x27;ve tried Venus razors which were okay, I&#x27;ve tried Schick Quattro, which I liked but when I tried this I never got any more nicks or cuts, even when shaving my bikini area, and no more razor bumps or irritation! I&#x27;ve always had a problem with getting nicks when shaving there, and now I get great pain free results! Love it!</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave, no nicks, and it has an awesome cream that comes out when you shave, so it&#x27;s super smooth, you don&#x27;t really need shaving cream if you&#x27;re in a hurry</li>
            <li> Love it, NO CUTS, GREAT</li>
            <li> Excellent razor but I went from those pink 20 in a package razors to this beauty.  It is a keeper.  Give it a try, great shave under the arms.  Nice little surprise with the suction for keeping it upright in the shower.</li>
            <li> I shaved in half the usual time and the razor glided over my skin. I tried it with liquid soap and without and the effect was the same. I never experienced slow movement or felt a tugging of hair. I believe this is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and I will definitely buy the refill cartridges. It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to grip and feels very comfortable in my hand. My legs feel like silk and this is a great razor! I doubt any other razor can be better - even in the future!</li>
            <li> These razors are amazing. I received them free through BzzAgent to review and I fell in love with them. I am definitely throwing my old razors our and keeping these in stock. They give you a perfect clean close shave without the worry of nicks and cuts! They made my legs feel silky smooth. I</li>
            <li> This has to be the best razor I have used, it gives a closer shave and little to no irritation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel that I need to come clean: I rarely ever have a need to shave. My legs are virtually hairless - naturally (no electrolysis here). However, I do need to shave my underarms on a regular basis - and this is where this product shined for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is easy to grip, and I felt that I had a much closer shave in my underarm area with the Schick Hydro Silk(tm) Razor. However, the moisturizing benefit of this product is lost on me, as I only need a shaver for my underarms. I do believe that the moisturizing aspect would be great for legs - although I can&#x27;t vouch for that by experience, as I never need to shave my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great value and a product I would recommend for daily use. I gave it a \\&quot;four\\&quot; because I can only vouch for one type of area - not the whole body, therefore cannot speak to how it will perform for most people who use it.</li>
            <li> I want to say upfront that I was given a free sample to try out and review, but don&#x27;t worry I won&#x27;t sugar coat my opinions because I&#x27;ve gotten it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like the Schick Hydro Silk razor because I&#x27;ve been wanting a five blade razor designed for women, but I feel that it just didn&#x27;t deliver what I&#x27;ve expected from a good razor, especially one designed for women. If I had only wanted it for shaving my legs I probably would have been happy enough with it, but it really falls short when shaving other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the things I liked about this razor was the design of the handle, it fit comfortably in my hand which is a pet peeve I&#x27;ve had with many other razors. It is also lightweight and perfect for travel. The included holder stayed attached in my shower well enough, but I don&#x27;t generally use it. There is nothing I hate more than finding my razor in pieces on the floor the next day because the holder has come off. I also liked the raised design on the handle which allowed the razor to rest on the edge of the tub without the moisture strip coming into contact with the surface. This keeps the moisture strip from turning into a big puddle of goo, a huge plus in my book, especially since this is what frustrates me the most about my previous razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, I just can not get a close shave with this razor and thought it functioned especially poor in hard to shave areas such as underarms. It was really frustrating because I&#x27;ve had cheap disposables which have done a much better job. I think the main problem lays in the design of the moisturizing strip. The raised design acts more as a guard, keeping the razor from making contact with the skin and preventing a close shave. Honestly, I would rather razor manufacturers do away with the moisture strips entirely.  I still wind up having to use shaving cream and the moisture strips end up clogging up the razor making it even harder to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not continue to use they Hydro Silk once I&#x27;ve run out of refills, I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it. There are many better options on the market that give me a closer shave.ll not continue to use they Hydro Silk once I&#x27;ve run out of refills, I feel that for the price it just isn&#x27;t worth it.

            <li> I liked getting to try The Schick Hydro Silk razor, I typically only ever buy razors/refills from the Venus collection. While I enjoyed the Schick HydroSilk razor I don&#x27;t think it even cut close to the shave I get with my Venus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price for the initial kit is about average, but the cost of refills is a bit high for a razor that requires you to use shaving cream, the refills costing 15 and change for 4 heads is on par with the one step wet and shave razors refills (I.E schick intuition or the Venus Spa Breeze).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During use I definitely noted a noticeable difference in the ease of how the razor glided over my skin due to the strips of moisture serum which just made shaving a lot faster. I was initially worried this serum would leave a gross film on my skin but it didn&#x27;t... The kit (but not the actual razor packaging) suggested using it with shaving gel/cream, which I did, but I did discover that because of the serum you could later do a quick touch up on a spot you may have missed with only wetting the razor and still getting a decent glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, The serum dissipates quickly from the razor head, I&#x27;ve only used the razor 5 times tops and most of it is gone and I always return it to the hanging caddie  that came with it, which hangs easily 2 feet from the shower head.  The serum seems to just pour out when you&#x27;re using it, and it&#x27;s not an enjoyable sight...When you pull the razor away from your skin  you can actually see a mucus like  string form between your skin and the razor.(think along the lines of the gooey inside of an Aloe Vera plant) Blech&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;unique\\&quot; Hanging  caddie is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much space but there is no where to store razor head refills! This immediately annoyed me. I&#x27;m usually dripping wet by the time I realize my razor needs a new head. I don&#x27;t want to have to store them in the medicine cabinet. I have always utilized and relied on caddies that allow you to store the refills in shower. Also it is not remotely unique, I have a venus razor caddie (that I don&#x27;t use because I have one that holds refills) and it looks almost identical, the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave, Bottom line, it just doesn&#x27;t get a close shave, I can go over a spot 2-3 times and still remnants of  stubble. And if you intend to shave your lady bits I suggest you just walk right by this razor, the head was far too large and it did an even poor job at getting a close shave there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would never use this razor when I&#x27;m going to have a day at the pool or a night with my boyfriend, It does a quick acceptable shave for an average day where a minute amount of stubble won&#x27;t make me feel self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to disclose that I am a buzz agent and got to try this product free.it is not remotely unique, I have a venus razor caddie (that I don&#x27;t use because I have one that holds refills) and it looks almost identical, the only thing that may be unique is I&#x27;m not sure if the venus razor sits sideways in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the most important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shave, Bottom line, it just doesn&#x27;t get a close shave, I can go over a spot 2-3 times and still remnants of  stubble.

            <li> I was recently invited to participate in a BzzCampaign to try the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women Razor, and was curious to try something new. I&#x27;ve been a user of the Schick Quattro for Women for years, but was willing to check it out. Needless to say, I&#x27;ll be going back to my Quattro. There are two reasons I say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the \\&quot;Water-Activated Moisturizing Serum for Smooth, Silky Skin\\&quot;- this serum does feel nice and smooth on your legs, however it only lasts a couple of uses. Since it&#x27;s water activated, it depletes rather quickly when you put the razor under some water to rinse it out. You then just have a standard razor, albeit rather bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And second, the \\&quot;Oval Cartridge with Five Curve Sensing Blades for Close Shave\\&quot;- They claim \\&quot;designed specifically for the curves of a woman&#x27;s body, the Schick Hydro Silk Razor features five independent curve sensing blades to follow your natural shape. The blades also feature skin guards that smooth skin to achieve a close shave while preventing skin irritation.\\&quot; In all the years I&#x27;ve used a Quattro, I&#x27;ve never gotten cut by my razor. In the month I&#x27;ve used the Hydro Silk, I&#x27;ve been cut three times. THREE!!! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the angle of the blades or what, but I keep nicking myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really feel that there are better options out there if you&#x27;re looking for a new razor!</li>
            <li> I tried this razor for BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve tried almost every razor on the market. They&#x27;re either too expensive, don&#x27;t last long enough, make my sensitive legs break out, don&#x27;t shave close enough...it&#x27;s always SOMETHING! But this one is AMAZING. Best part? Yeah...it&#x27;s a $10 razor, but the cartridges last FOREVER. I used one of the two that came with the razor for 2 months...and even then, it was still working great, I just thought it would be smart to change it. So you&#x27;re looking at $10 for 4 months (2 cartridges come with it) of great, close shaves. The ONLY downside is that if you leave it where water can get on it (like, while your husband takes a shower), the moisture beads get slimy. But, I&#x27;ve just scraped them off (when they&#x27;re wet, you can scrape them off easily with a finger nail). There is still enough left of it when you scrape it off for your skin to be moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVE this razor and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I used a Gillette Venus for YEARS, but finally decided to try the Hydro Silk this past summer. I can confidently say that I do not miss my Venus one bit! I&#x27;ve never used a razor that plays well with my eczema, but this one absolutely does. It hydrates surprisingly well and to date, I&#x27;ve never received a knick or cut.</li>
