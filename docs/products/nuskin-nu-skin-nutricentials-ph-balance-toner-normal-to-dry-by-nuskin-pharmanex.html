            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Nu Skin products.</li>
            <li> I have  found this to be a good facial pH toner for my skin which is dry.   It also works well to pick up any residual dirt or make up after cleansing and leaves the skin feeling comfortable not tight.  The downside is that it&#x27;s pricey - so I&#x27;m still in the market for an effective pH toner, but reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin soft and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I love it! Everything the good reviews had to say is true..... So give this a try, u will love it too!</li>
            <li> A very nice and refreshing toner! You can really see what is left on a cotton ball after use. It really makes your face feel truly clean!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. My skin gets clearer as I continue to use this. NuSkin cream is also good.</li>
            <li> It is magic!! After toning my face with that toner, it shins like stars...oh my god, I love it..can not live with out it very morning</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. I needed a toner to add to my skin care kit and NU SKIN is so well worth the price for what it does for my skin.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family members.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nu Skin since 1989.  It works for me.  It really does smooth out lines and I don&#x27;t look so tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using nuskin products for years and at 68, people still comment on my smooth skin.  The night cream is terrific also.</li>
            <li> Only use this product on your uneven skin areas.</li>
            <li> Best toner ever!  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh...not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I feel the product is probable good  but I like placing my orders and they want to charge my credit card very month and one product coast $80 and the 0ther $85  I called and said no and she argued with me high pressurize sales.  then If I don&lt;br /&gt;t like the product they want me to ship it back.  LOL another cost these people are to much.  sad business deal this way.</li>
            <li> been using ph balance for years. since the late 80&#x27;s. only thing i have found to control my red t-zone issue. i searched for a decade before i found something that worked.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner. My skin gets clearer as I continue to use this. NuSkin cosmetic  is also good.</li>
            <li> Gf recommended this to me, works great</li>
