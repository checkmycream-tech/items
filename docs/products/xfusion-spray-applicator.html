            <li>great product....</li>
            <li>However I ordered another one and this one works great - like it was meant to.  </li>
            <li>Great applicator that goes with the X-fusion product.  </li>
            <li>If you use the XFusion sprinkle on hair fibers from the container it will fly all over and not cover as well.  </li>
            <li>Great price. ..</li>
            <li>great product. ..</li>
            <li>It is a great device for spraying the X-Fusion powder on the scalp, when you have thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look fuller and doesn&#x27;t sweat off, looks great all day</li>
            <li>This attachment works great with Fusion bottle.</li>
            <li>Works great with Xfusion.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this top.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is good and works great</li>
            <li>I like the way the applicator can put an even and pleasant application of the product.  </li>
            <li>This applicator makes it so easy to distribute the perfect amount of X-Fusion.</li>
            <li>The X-Fusion applicator is a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t quite perform like I&#x27;d like for it</li>
            <li>Not as good that way.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work good at all.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look too good.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is good once I figured out how to remove the cap from the bottle.</li>
            <li>its lasts me a good while by using this.</li>
            <li>Not as good as theold discontinued applicator.</li>
            <li>So I was very pleased with the return service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a way to hide my bald spots!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It is really great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>, this is a must own.</li>
            <li>Much faster, covers perfect.  </li>
            <li>The applicator kind of puffs out in a glob</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>but why would I try, when the original XFusion container does just as good a job?</li>
            <li>Applicator worked great at first</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to be so great.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, superior packaging.</li>
            <li>This applicator works ok</li>
            <li>It blows the fiber into the hair more than onto the scalf for me.  </li>
            <li>I find I get a better application with just the shaker top that comes on the X-Fusion container.  </li>
            <li>If this product was more durable it would be five stars.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s bullcrap that it doesn&#x27;t actually fit on the XFusion bottle!</li>
            <li>I love the powder</li>
            <li>After using the spray applicator I can say for sure that I will always be using it going forward.</li>
            <li>It almost make the keratin more of a air brush and you have much more control.</li>
            <li>you are looking for more control and to specifically control your hair line</li>
            <li>I will keep it, for sure.</li>
            <li>I think its better to fill a hairline</li>
            <li>I wated more than one mounth</li>
            <li>Like others, I purchased the applicator thinking that I might get more even coverage than just using the container.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I practiced</li>
            <li>I might get a better spread of fibers using this tool â€¦</li>
            <li>I did better just \\&quot;sprinkling\\&quot; this item on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I just love this applicator.  </li>
            <li>You just push the top and point nozzle where you want coverage and push.  </li>
            <li>works ok with the hair fibers to cover thinning scalp areas.  </li>
            <li>It just ok, I like shake effect better</li>
            <li>I can now wear hairstyles that I couldn&#x27;t before because of the thinness on top.  </li>
            <li>but it sure is helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did because they refunded my purchase even before they received the defective one.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>i love the x-fusion pump.</li>
            <li>and save me more.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>Better to just apply XFusion without this pump.</li>
            <li>but I find the sprinkling from the bottle much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li>This is simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use the shaker top that&#x27;s on the hair fibers container.</li>
            <li>I get better coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love using this applicator with Xfusion</li>
            <li>and it does distribute the product more evenly.</li>
            <li>But I can see where it could be more helpful&lt;</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A brush seamed to work better for me.</li>
            <li>Works great to deliver a more natural application!!!</li>
            <li>it works it feeled in my edges pretty good</li>
            <li>liking it and very easy use to cover some bold spots on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>but at first I felt this was ok, because the application was nice.</li>
            <li>It helps you be much more precise</li>
            <li>Love this pump perfect for my keratin powder helps with precision and eliminates some of the mess if you normaly sprinkle it on.</li>
            <li>The applicator makes application easy.</li>
            <li>This applicator makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>Makes application easy peasy</li>
            <li>It easily shampoos out.</li>
            <li>, IT&#x27;S EASY TO HANDLE, SO GO FOR IT</li>
            <li>Makes spreading the fibers so easy.</li>
            <li>Applies hair fibers for thinning hair evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>it kind of blows a bald spot in the fiber and only works good for the hairline,</li>
            <li>The applicator works just fine</li>
            <li>If they could somehow figure out a spray applicator with fine control of the part you press (so a lot doesn&#x27;t come out at once), that would probably work.    </li>
            <li>It sprays a fine film instead of globs.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice, but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The original version sometimes needed two hands, while this version can be used easily with one hand.</li>
            <li>and it is just as easy to shake the product on to the desired area in it&#x27;s original container...</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement from just sprinkling the X-Fusion onto&lt;br /&gt;my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy when something works as advertised and this item simply does just that!  </li>
            <li>Actually, this was a great way to apply powder to scalp.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t fit the size xfusion canister I purchased.  </li>
            <li>The applicator works great, especially if you have lots of places you need the product.</li>
            <li>but It didn&#x27;t fit bottle</li>
            <li>I wore it out &amp; this is all that&#x27;s available now..</li>
            <li>and then I smooth into the hair with my finger or the edge of the hairline tool (which is just a card with a jagged edge)</li>
            <li>it delivers a precise &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; of powder where you need it.</li>
            <li>I have been using fusion for a while and thought what a great idea to have an applicator for even distribution and making it last.  </li>
            <li>This product does not even fit the x fusion.</li>
            <li>I wanted it to fit</li>
            <li>/&gt;The order was filled rapidly and received on time as promised.</li>
            <li>It sounded like a good idea to be able to direct the product right to the area</li>
            <li>Although some appear to assail this product as being made from sheep hair, I honestly don&#x27;t find some of the other cotton-based fibers to be necessarily superior.  </li>
            <li>This DOES fit the XFusion bottles, but first you must unscrew and remove the shaker screen (the plastic top with the holes in it).</li>
            <li>The first time or two I tried it, it did not work at all, the top kept collapsing.  </li>
            <li>It requires what I consider a good amount of pressure, and it must be in a very specific spot, plus I&#x27;ve found that you need to wait in between pumps, so it takes more time than it is worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I happened to stumble across this product while looking for something else..</li>
            <li>XFusion spray applicator, is a perfect applicator, just enough to make it look natural, thank you,</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to get it right, but works great!</li>
            <li>I can direct and put the product where I need it the most!  </li>
            <li>No Mess and better coverage!</li>
            <li>I was so hoping that this applicator would be superior to the former one.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars only because Xfusion is so good</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think if they were offering a kit, they would provide the right size to fit over the hair powder.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit right on the container</li>
            <li>Quick sending, thank you</li>
            <li>but I use a quick sprinkle on the crown..</li>
            <li>LOVED IT , IT&#x27;S VERY HELPFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THE FIBERS WITH NO MESS</li>
            <li>Its OK, but I liked the other atomizer I had.  </li>
            <li>I just bought the applicator last week and I love it!</li>
            <li>The ability to more evenly, finely distribute the product makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I think the X-Fusion product is amazing but have gone back to using the sprinkler container as it is sold without the pump.</li>
            <li>When it spits out the Xfusion, it is in clumps which are readily seen in the light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a more direct, concentrated application...</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Would like the old spray better</li>
            <li>I guess it works as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with shaking product in top of hair&lt;</li>
            <li>worth the money for it</li>
            <li>Good product, This product is what I expected.</li>
            <li>Also, I recommend the hairline tool to keep the product from having too distinct a demarkation between skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>and the coverage is better by far.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be gentle when pushing on the top, and push on the back and a bit towards the top of the applicator,  Just the right amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li>The other brand device works much better, but does cost more.</li>
            <li>Works very well, and is easier to use than the original version of the spray applicator.  </li>
            <li>and it never worked right</li>
            <li>I was going to just take it as a loss, but since I had to order another one right away</li>
            <li>They made it right for me</li>
            <li>IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET GO.  </li>
            <li>Lets you pinpoint right</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to send me a new applicator free of charge.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want the fibers shaken all over the top of my hair where medication has caused a sudden unexpected thinning of the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great and makes application so much easier and doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li>Works with X Fusion &amp; Toppik, but it only works good when the canister is full of fiber, once it gets low</li>
            <li>I was very very very unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I am VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this applicator is a must for smooth application of the X-Fusion product.  </li>
            <li>When it worked it was great, but it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>Would have recommended it at first.</li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t work anymore!  </li>
            <li>You just pump the applicator and it puts the fibers exactly where you need them.</li>
            <li>find I am better off using the Xfusion by itself in the back.  </li>
            <li>With this relatively inexpensive tool you screw it onto the container and pump the top to spread on the hair fibers.  </li>
            <li>I love it and definitely recommend getting it when ordering the X-Fusion.</li>
            <li>I actually wrote the company explaining that I love the xfusion hair fibers product itself, but my applicator stopped working.  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t necessary for the top of the head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried rinsing it under hot water</li>
            <li>First use of it</li>
            <li>It sounds like a good idea to use this so that you don&#x27;t waste the product where you don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, a positive nod to the Kaboki alternative itself.</li>
            <li>Had been wanting a better way to apply the x-fusion for a Long time.</li>
            <li>Then I use my own hairspray to stick it down well.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure hair is completely dry before applying the fibers.</li>
            <li>This makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier and precise (after a short learning curve).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works very well with the X-Fusion.  </li>
            <li>It really makes it easier to apply the product.</li>
            <li>Makes applying the hair fibers so much easier than sprinkling the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I did not find much use for this.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to go with the Xfusion fibers and it really helps with the application.</li>
            <li>This means a 2 minute job to get hair ready in the morning turns into a 15 MINUTE JOB.</li>
            <li>If there was another item available to use for the application of the xfusion powder I would definitely not purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I really did not get to try it.</li>
            <li>It does not distribute the stuff in any real way.</li>
            <li>The applicator is a pump and it is much easier and quicker to apply.</li>
            <li>and I appreciated it.</li>
            <li>The applicator makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier.</li>
            <li>before i was wasting too much of the product.</li>
            <li>It comes to a point and makes it much easier to cover just the area needed.</li>
            <li>If you are using the Xfusion fibers, you really need this to apply around the hairline.  </li>
            <li>Really improves how to use the XFusion product</li>
            <li>Much easier to just shake can.</li>
            <li>This applicator allows for a very targeted spread to minimize wasteage.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this device.</li>
            <li>it makes it much easier to gt the product where I want it to go</li>
            <li>So much easier to just sprinkle</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need it to use the fibers.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need this to use with the product.</li>
            <li>It was really a life</li>
            <li>Product really didn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li>I am not a huge fan of the fibers, but if you are going to use them, this applicator works really really well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Strange little adapter lol but works</li>
            <li>It requires very little pressure and best used with quick, short puffs--if you plunge it all the way down, you may have to wait for it to release.</li>
            <li>However, after less than 10 uses, it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li>I used it and when I want to go back to add more, nexrt to the last place I used it, the air from the device, blows off everything you&#x27;ve already applied.  </li>
            <li>so I try to move it back and forth really quickly while I pump</li>
            <li>I am surprised there are any positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the applicator.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using an applicator</li>
            <li>ever hard to use it on your own.</li>
            <li>In the front hair line, it is really tricky, I find Fill in powder with a brush also sold on Amazon, and put it on really lightly far away from hair line.  </li>
            <li>Like others, I realized that it was not necessary or useful to have the applicator.  </li>
            <li>Bought 3 and none go them worked more than a few times.</li>
            <li>It works good if you are using it where there is hair that is not too thin.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit on the other bottle I bought.</li>
            <li>and it was brand new,</li>
            <li>and you will have to buy new ones every so often.</li>
            <li>but it still doesn&#x27;t pump anything out as when it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li>Your hairdo looks very natural with the X-Fusion powder and the spray applicator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this applicator every day for about four years now and just ordered a new one because my first one is finally worn out.</li>
            <li>I just pump it into the top of my scalp, use a small brush to blend in and go.</li>
            <li>You have to keep pressing it many times to see a little bit of blue fibers on your head.</li>
            <li>Not enough product comes out of the nozzle and aiming it is really not that accurate.</li>
            <li>The bubble will not retract fast enough-</li>
            <li>With it you can easily direct and control the area in which to apply x-fusion.</li>
            <li>This applicator helps to direct the X-Fusion to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>It give you precise application to prevent waste.</li>
            <li>and it does not waste.</li>
            <li>It responds reasonably well to different levels of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thus far not had that happen with XFusion.</li>
            <li>where you need it so you do not waste product.</li>
            <li>The way I have had to deftly style y hair to try to hide the fact there is pink skin where hair was a few months ago was traumatic.</li>
            <li>Please go back to thedrawing board and deveop a decent applicator you can direct to problem areas.</li>
            <li>There is a loss of pressure as the bottle is nearing empty, but works just fine again after I give it a shake; also I do marry what&#x27;s left with a new bottle before the old one is empty, which also helps.</li>
            <li>After ordering the X-Fusion applicator, I realized , I could make this product last a lot longer, because there is no waste.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using it, I would use too much product to do the same thing that the applicator does with a third of the product.  </li>
            <li>This product looks so natural and each day I use it only enhances the look of my hair.</li>
            <li>So back to shaking the bottle directly on my thinning areas.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s design good for getting fibers on other parts of my scalp, so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li>The pump itself breaks down after the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>This puts the fibers exactly where I need them without wasting product or creating a mess.</li>
            <li>Being able to direct the fake hair rather than sprinkle it is preferable.</li>
            <li>But it sprays the x-fusion exactly where you need it without waste.</li>
            <li>The applicator gets clogged quickly and is hard to unclog.</li>
            <li>It delivers too much product at 1 time, so you have a blob of these fibers in a half dollar size area.</li>
            <li>I think it helps apply the product easier (&amp; you use less of it), then just gently move the product thru your hair with your fingertips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very disappointing because when it works it&#x27;s great.  </li>

            <li> great product....</li>
            <li> However I ordered another one and this one works great - like it was meant to.  </li>
            <li> Great applicator that goes with the X-fusion product.  </li>
            <li> If you use the XFusion sprinkle on hair fibers from the container it will fly all over and not cover as well.  </li>
            <li> Great price. ..</li>
            <li> great product. ..</li>
            <li> It is a great device for spraying the X-Fusion powder on the scalp, when you have thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look fuller and doesn&#x27;t sweat off, looks great all day</li>
            <li> This attachment works great with Fusion bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great with Xfusion.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this top.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is good and works great</li>
            <li> I like the way the applicator can put an even and pleasant application of the product.  </li>
            <li> This applicator makes it so easy to distribute the perfect amount of X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> The X-Fusion applicator is a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t quite perform like I&#x27;d like for it</li>
            <li> Not as good that way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good at all.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look too good.  </li>
            <li> The applicator is good once I figured out how to remove the cap from the bottle.</li>
            <li> its lasts me a good while by using this.</li>
            <li> Not as good as theold discontinued applicator.</li>
            <li> So I was very pleased with the return service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a way to hide my bald spots!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It is really great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> , this is a must own.</li>
            <li> Much faster, covers perfect.  </li>
            <li> The applicator kind of puffs out in a glob</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> but why would I try, when the original XFusion container does just as good a job?</li>
            <li> Applicator worked great at first</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to be so great.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, superior packaging.</li>
            <li> This applicator works ok</li>
            <li> It blows the fiber into the hair more than onto the scalf for me.  </li>
            <li> I find I get a better application with just the shaker top that comes on the X-Fusion container.  </li>
            <li> If this product was more durable it would be five stars.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bullcrap that it doesn&#x27;t actually fit on the XFusion bottle!</li>
            <li> I love the powder</li>
            <li> After using the spray applicator I can say for sure that I will always be using it going forward.</li>
            <li> It almost make the keratin more of a air brush and you have much more control.</li>
            <li> you are looking for more control and to specifically control your hair line</li>
            <li> I will keep it, for sure.</li>
            <li> I think its better to fill a hairline</li>
            <li> I wated more than one mounth</li>
            <li> Like others, I purchased the applicator thinking that I might get more even coverage than just using the container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I practiced</li>
            <li> I might get a better spread of fibers using this tool â€¦</li>
            <li> I did better just \\&quot;sprinkling\\&quot; this item on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I just love this applicator.  </li>
            <li> You just push the top and point nozzle where you want coverage and push.  </li>
            <li> works ok with the hair fibers to cover thinning scalp areas.  </li>
            <li> It just ok, I like shake effect better</li>
            <li> I can now wear hairstyles that I couldn&#x27;t before because of the thinness on top.  </li>
            <li> but it sure is helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did because they refunded my purchase even before they received the defective one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> i love the x-fusion pump.</li>
            <li> and save me more.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> Better to just apply XFusion without this pump.</li>
            <li> but I find the sprinkling from the bottle much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This is simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use the shaker top that&#x27;s on the hair fibers container.</li>
            <li> I get better coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love using this applicator with Xfusion</li>
            <li> and it does distribute the product more evenly.</li>
            <li> But I can see where it could be more helpful&lt;</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> A brush seamed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> Works great to deliver a more natural application!!!</li>
            <li> it works it feeled in my edges pretty good</li>
            <li> liking it and very easy use to cover some bold spots on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> but at first I felt this was ok, because the application was nice.</li>
            <li> It helps you be much more precise</li>
            <li> Love this pump perfect for my keratin powder helps with precision and eliminates some of the mess if you normaly sprinkle it on.</li>
            <li> The applicator makes application easy.</li>
            <li> This applicator makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> Makes application easy peasy</li>
            <li> It easily shampoos out.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S EASY TO HANDLE, SO GO FOR IT</li>
            <li> Makes spreading the fibers so easy.</li>
            <li> Applies hair fibers for thinning hair evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> it kind of blows a bald spot in the fiber and only works good for the hairline,</li>
            <li> The applicator works just fine</li>
            <li> If they could somehow figure out a spray applicator with fine control of the part you press (so a lot doesn&#x27;t come out at once), that would probably work.    </li>
            <li> It sprays a fine film instead of globs.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The original version sometimes needed two hands, while this version can be used easily with one hand.</li>
            <li> and it is just as easy to shake the product on to the desired area in it&#x27;s original container...</li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement from just sprinkling the X-Fusion onto&lt;br /&gt;my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy when something works as advertised and this item simply does just that!  </li>
            <li> Actually, this was a great way to apply powder to scalp.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the size xfusion canister I purchased.  </li>
            <li> The applicator works great, especially if you have lots of places you need the product.</li>
            <li> but It didn&#x27;t fit bottle</li>
            <li> I wore it out &amp; this is all that&#x27;s available now..</li>
            <li> and then I smooth into the hair with my finger or the edge of the hairline tool (which is just a card with a jagged edge)</li>
            <li> it delivers a precise &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; of powder where you need it.</li>
            <li> I have been using fusion for a while and thought what a great idea to have an applicator for even distribution and making it last.  </li>
            <li> This product does not even fit the x fusion.</li>
            <li> I wanted it to fit</li>
            <li> /&gt;The order was filled rapidly and received on time as promised.</li>
            <li> It sounded like a good idea to be able to direct the product right to the area</li>
            <li> Although some appear to assail this product as being made from sheep hair, I honestly don&#x27;t find some of the other cotton-based fibers to be necessarily superior.  </li>
            <li> This DOES fit the XFusion bottles, but first you must unscrew and remove the shaker screen (the plastic top with the holes in it).</li>
            <li> The first time or two I tried it, it did not work at all, the top kept collapsing.  </li>
            <li> It requires what I consider a good amount of pressure, and it must be in a very specific spot, plus I&#x27;ve found that you need to wait in between pumps, so it takes more time than it is worth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I happened to stumble across this product while looking for something else..</li>
            <li> XFusion spray applicator, is a perfect applicator, just enough to make it look natural, thank you,</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get it right, but works great!</li>
            <li> I can direct and put the product where I need it the most!  </li>
            <li> No Mess and better coverage!</li>
            <li> I was so hoping that this applicator would be superior to the former one.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because Xfusion is so good</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think if they were offering a kit, they would provide the right size to fit over the hair powder.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit right on the container</li>
            <li> Quick sending, thank you</li>
            <li> but I use a quick sprinkle on the crown..</li>
            <li> LOVED IT , IT&#x27;S VERY HELPFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THE FIBERS WITH NO MESS</li>
            <li> Its OK, but I liked the other atomizer I had.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the applicator last week and I love it!</li>
            <li> The ability to more evenly, finely distribute the product makes a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I think the X-Fusion product is amazing but have gone back to using the sprinkler container as it is sold without the pump.</li>
            <li> When it spits out the Xfusion, it is in clumps which are readily seen in the light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a more direct, concentrated application...</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Would like the old spray better</li>
            <li> I guess it works as good as expected.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with shaking product in top of hair&lt;</li>
            <li> worth the money for it</li>
            <li> Good product, This product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Also, I recommend the hairline tool to keep the product from having too distinct a demarkation between skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> and the coverage is better by far.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be gentle when pushing on the top, and push on the back and a bit towards the top of the applicator,  Just the right amount for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The other brand device works much better, but does cost more.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and is easier to use than the original version of the spray applicator.  </li>
            <li> and it never worked right</li>
            <li> I was going to just take it as a loss, but since I had to order another one right away</li>
            <li> They made it right for me</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET GO.  </li>
            <li> Lets you pinpoint right</li>
            <li> They were kind enough to send me a new applicator free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want the fibers shaken all over the top of my hair where medication has caused a sudden unexpected thinning of the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes application so much easier and doesn&#x27;t waste product.</li>
            <li> Works with X Fusion &amp; Toppik, but it only works good when the canister is full of fiber, once it gets low</li>
            <li> I was very very very unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I am VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this applicator is a must for smooth application of the X-Fusion product.  </li>
            <li> When it worked it was great, but it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Would have recommended it at first.</li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t work anymore!  </li>
            <li> You just pump the applicator and it puts the fibers exactly where you need them.</li>
            <li> find I am better off using the Xfusion by itself in the back.  </li>
            <li> With this relatively inexpensive tool you screw it onto the container and pump the top to spread on the hair fibers.  </li>
            <li> I love it and definitely recommend getting it when ordering the X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> I actually wrote the company explaining that I love the xfusion hair fibers product itself, but my applicator stopped working.  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t necessary for the top of the head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rinsing it under hot water</li>
            <li> First use of it</li>
            <li> It sounds like a good idea to use this so that you don&#x27;t waste the product where you don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, a positive nod to the Kaboki alternative itself.</li>
            <li> Had been wanting a better way to apply the x-fusion for a Long time.</li>
            <li> Then I use my own hairspray to stick it down well.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure hair is completely dry before applying the fibers.</li>
            <li> This makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier and precise (after a short learning curve).  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the X-Fusion.  </li>
            <li> It really makes it easier to apply the product.</li>
            <li> Makes applying the hair fibers so much easier than sprinkling the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I did not find much use for this.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the Xfusion fibers and it really helps with the application.</li>
            <li> This means a 2 minute job to get hair ready in the morning turns into a 15 MINUTE JOB.</li>
            <li> If there was another item available to use for the application of the xfusion powder I would definitely not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really did not get to try it.</li>
            <li> It does not distribute the stuff in any real way.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a pump and it is much easier and quicker to apply.</li>
            <li> and I appreciated it.</li>
            <li> The applicator makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier.</li>
            <li> before i was wasting too much of the product.</li>
            <li> It comes to a point and makes it much easier to cover just the area needed.</li>
            <li> If you are using the Xfusion fibers, you really need this to apply around the hairline.  </li>
            <li> Really improves how to use the XFusion product</li>
            <li> Much easier to just shake can.</li>
            <li> This applicator allows for a very targeted spread to minimize wasteage.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this device.</li>
            <li> it makes it much easier to gt the product where I want it to go</li>
            <li> So much easier to just sprinkle</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need it to use the fibers.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need this to use with the product.</li>
            <li> It was really a life</li>
            <li> Product really didn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the fibers, but if you are going to use them, this applicator works really really well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Strange little adapter lol but works</li>
            <li> It requires very little pressure and best used with quick, short puffs--if you plunge it all the way down, you may have to wait for it to release.</li>
            <li> However, after less than 10 uses, it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  </li>
            <li> I used it and when I want to go back to add more, nexrt to the last place I used it, the air from the device, blows off everything you&#x27;ve already applied.  </li>
            <li> so I try to move it back and forth really quickly while I pump</li>
            <li> I am surprised there are any positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the applicator.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using an applicator</li>
            <li> ever hard to use it on your own.</li>
            <li> In the front hair line, it is really tricky, I find Fill in powder with a brush also sold on Amazon, and put it on really lightly far away from hair line.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I realized that it was not necessary or useful to have the applicator.  </li>
            <li> Bought 3 and none go them worked more than a few times.</li>
            <li> It works good if you are using it where there is hair that is not too thin.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit on the other bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> and it was brand new,</li>
            <li> and you will have to buy new ones every so often.</li>
            <li> but it still doesn&#x27;t pump anything out as when it&#x27;s brand new.  </li>
            <li> Your hairdo looks very natural with the X-Fusion powder and the spray applicator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this applicator every day for about four years now and just ordered a new one because my first one is finally worn out.</li>
            <li> I just pump it into the top of my scalp, use a small brush to blend in and go.</li>
            <li> You have to keep pressing it many times to see a little bit of blue fibers on your head.</li>
            <li> Not enough product comes out of the nozzle and aiming it is really not that accurate.</li>
            <li> The bubble will not retract fast enough-</li>
            <li> With it you can easily direct and control the area in which to apply x-fusion.</li>
            <li> This applicator helps to direct the X-Fusion to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> It give you precise application to prevent waste.</li>
            <li> and it does not waste.</li>
            <li> It responds reasonably well to different levels of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thus far not had that happen with XFusion.</li>
            <li> where you need it so you do not waste product.</li>
            <li> The way I have had to deftly style y hair to try to hide the fact there is pink skin where hair was a few months ago was traumatic.</li>
            <li> Please go back to thedrawing board and deveop a decent applicator you can direct to problem areas.</li>
            <li> There is a loss of pressure as the bottle is nearing empty, but works just fine again after I give it a shake; also I do marry what&#x27;s left with a new bottle before the old one is empty, which also helps.</li>
            <li> After ordering the X-Fusion applicator, I realized , I could make this product last a lot longer, because there is no waste.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using it, I would use too much product to do the same thing that the applicator does with a third of the product.  </li>
            <li> This product looks so natural and each day I use it only enhances the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> So back to shaking the bottle directly on my thinning areas.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s design good for getting fibers on other parts of my scalp, so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> The pump itself breaks down after the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> This puts the fibers exactly where I need them without wasting product or creating a mess.</li>
            <li> Being able to direct the fake hair rather than sprinkle it is preferable.</li>
            <li> But it sprays the x-fusion exactly where you need it without waste.</li>
            <li> The applicator gets clogged quickly and is hard to unclog.</li>
            <li> It delivers too much product at 1 time, so you have a blob of these fibers in a half dollar size area.</li>
            <li> I think it helps apply the product easier (&amp; you use less of it), then just gently move the product thru your hair with your fingertips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing because when it works it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> However, it does disburse the product a little too densely and while it&#x27;s not perfect it does get the job done and requires a brush for a uniform and more realistic appearance.</li>
            <li> Is not good for wide areas because it sprays in a fine line.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money they charge for these cheaply made little things, they should last at least 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s too late to return the first, I&#x27;d like to return this one.</li>
            <li> Really gets past the hair to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that really works - at least for me...</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have only 1 empty xfusion can that this fits on.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> when you order the applicator, and the powder they need to send you  a powder bottle where&lt;br /&gt;the spay fits on the bottle,it doesn&#x27;t screw on ir or fit on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t know what bottle its suppose to fit on very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I find the Xfusion i used (which is the same fibers as the other brands) to be way too lite to be spraying it.</li>
            <li> can, only to find the contents turned clumpy - perhaps due to humidity.  </li>
            <li> really this is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It also makes it less likely to bunch up.</li>
            <li> If you are a freak and want to turn your hair blue, I would recommend getting this along with X-Fusion black hair fibers.</li>
            <li> It tends to spray fast in a specific area which tends to make the X-Fusion look cakey and fake, not natural.</li>
            <li> It helps me to place the Xfusion fibres accurately, eliminating waste of the expensive Xfusion product.</li>
            <li> I find it easier to just sprinkle it on being careful about clumping.</li>
            <li> I would be much harder to try to apply by shaking the container.</li>
            <li> This one is harder for me to use</li>
            <li> It does not fit the container of X-fusion i also purchased at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of time, effort and money~</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This does not work anything like I expected or what was shown in the video.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t cover in the back, and the front it was unpredictable and made a mess.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all!</li>
            <li> I think I am more disappointed</li>
            <li> With Kaboki or other powder-cannister products, I find a lot of material can come pouring out and gets on my forehead, ears, the bathroom counter, etc.  </li>
            <li> It builds up on the scalp some and tends to make the hair feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> She also said regular hair spray works just as well as the X-Fusion spray and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> trying to do large areas is difficult to do.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply to the back of my head, but easier that with the shaker method.</li>
            <li> but then it started spraying the product out of the bulb that is pressed down.</li>
            <li> , I cannot bring myself to put down anything with is name.  </li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in spray quality and stream once you are about half way down the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not fit on the other cans because the tops do not screw off.</li>
            <li> You have to pump several times to get a very small area covered with the product.</li>
            <li> It blobs out in a puff - the ball stays down if you pump too hard or too long - you can&#x27;t control where the dust is flying.  </li>
            <li> I think you use less product with applicator.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to using this applicator, you&#x27;ll find you are using less product</li>
            <li> I have less mess when using it.</li>
            <li> but the pump takes a lot of pressure in your finger to make it work and then the product shoots out in little dots.</li>
            <li> Maybe with a little practice?</li>
            <li> This little nozzle here is my Tool Of Tools.</li>
            <li> A little went</li>
            <li> I think it must need to prime itself with a few pumps.  </li>
            <li> but this purchase was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This applicator has been messy from the beginning.</li>
            <li> and it did not fit the X-fusion bottle.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t waste a drop wit it.  </li>
            <li> Does not fit the bottle.</li>
            <li> becasue the color I need is not available.</li>
            <li> If you wear everyday it is a must have.</li>
            <li> Overall, it covers thin areas</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> It did not fit the bottle</li>
            <li> I might buy another one in a few months for travel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, you don&#x27;t need to push down too hard on the ball pump.  </li>
            <li> A little hard to squeeze out the powder but works well...</li>
            <li> This is no better than just sprinkling the product on your head.  </li>
            <li> so I end up with hair fibers on my scalp and on my hand :-/</li>
            <li> The applicator enables me to focus the spray to small areas.  </li>
            <li> BUT I WAS TOO LAZY.  </li>
            <li> You may have to find the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; distance to hold it, because a mere 4-5 inches can deliver a focused blast of product like you were using a paint spray can and starting up close on paper.  </li>
            <li> Beyond that, it doesn&#x27;t distribute the product like I would have hoped, so I found no redeeming qualities for this item at all.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this applicator, and I&#x27;m extremely confused by the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> but I did NOT like the cover-up powder which was very messy.  </li>
            <li> I would encourage all folks with negative reviews to contact the company like I did.  </li>
            <li> A totally frustrating experience and a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit frustrating that I have to keep purchasing one after a few months.</li>
            <li> I mean like 3 minutes between sprays.</li>
            <li> She shakes a small amount of the fibers on the thin areas, then rubs them onto the scalf area with her finger.  </li>
            <li> THIS ONE WAS NOT GOOD.</li>
            <li> This is not good if your in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Too bad they are not very clear about the need for this with the product.</li>
            <li> This applicator is weak and does not force hair fibers through and onto your scalp.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to finally receive this</li>
            <li> I have weak hands and did not realize the force it takes to get the powder through the device.</li>
            <li> Initially i tried to apply without the applicator and it was a nasty mess.</li>
            <li> Not the seller&#x27;s fault - but this device is not a great product.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> Unable to use, there were no instructions on how to use the applicator</li>
            <li> I dont know what is wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be exhausted pumping!  </li>
            <li> Without this applicator, it would be difficult and even wasteful of the X-Fusion product.</li>
            <li> sorry i purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product...</li>
            <li> It was useless and I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a set with the small XFusion hair powder and Fiberhold spray and the applicator was the wrong size!!</li>
            <li> hair is very thin in spots and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> The product is feeble and is easily broken, do not allow it to become submerged as it would be disastrous.  </li>
            <li> The applicator spray will not DETRACT for 2-3 minutes after depressing it to spray.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> It would be impossible to apply the x-fusion without it.  </li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> BAD BAD</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it does not work as well.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> Doubtful if I will purchase this againh</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as advertised.</li>
            <li> This applicator works ok but I did NOT like the cover-up powder which was very messy.  I prefer a brush on cover -up  that I have been using for 2 years.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you get the hair fibers.  The ability to more evenly, finely distribute the product makes a big difference.  I have two -- one permanently in my travel kit and one for regular home use.</li>
            <li> when you order the applicator, and the powder they need to send you  a powder bottle where&lt;br /&gt;the spay fits on the bottle,it doesn&#x27;t screw on ir or fit on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work and don&#x27;t know what bottle its suppose to fit on very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the X-Fusion.  I just pump it into the top of my scalp, use a small brush to blend in and go.</li>
            <li> This a piece of junk,do not buy !</li>
            <li> Works very well, and is easier to use than the original version of the spray applicator.  The original version sometimes needed two hands, while this version can be used easily with one hand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use with the X-Fusion fibers.  It blows the fiber into the hair more than onto the scalf for me.  I find I get a better application with just the shaker top that comes on the X-Fusion container.  My hair stylist agrees.  She shakes a small amount of the fibers on the thin areas, then rubs them onto the scalf area with her finger.  She also said regular hair spray works just as well as the X-Fusion spray and is far less expensive.</li>
            <li> I was so hoping that this applicator would be superior to the former one.  I like the idea that it can be used with one hand.  I am disappointed that it does not work as well.</li>
            <li> I like the way the applicator can put an even and pleasant application of the product.  Yet, I have found myself ordering this same product for the third time in one year.  That should say plenty.  The product is feeble and is easily broken, do not allow it to become submerged as it would be disastrous.  If this product was more durable it would be five stars.</li>
            <li> The applicator works just fine but you do need a bit of patience.  The first time or two I tried it, it did not work at all, the top kept collapsing.  I think it must need to prime itself with a few pumps.  I tried again and it works great!  You do have to be gentle when pushing on the top, and push on the back and a bit towards the top of the applicator,  Just the right amount for my hair.  I purchased another color and another applicator today.  I have had thining hair for years and have tried all kinds of products.  This is the only one that really works - at least for me...</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this applicator is a must for smooth application of the X-Fusion product.  It&#x27;s well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Not the seller&#x27;s fault - but this device is not a great product.  I used it and when I want to go back to add more, nexrt to the last place I used it, the air from the device, blows off everything you&#x27;ve already applied.  Quick sending, thank you</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all!</li>
            <li> This applicator is the only way I can target the fibers where I want them without messing up my hairstyle. Hard to apply to the back of my head, but easier that with the shaker method.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a good idea to use this so that you don&#x27;t waste the product where you don&#x27;t need it but the pump takes a lot of pressure in your finger to make it work and then the product shoots out in little dots. I think the X-Fusion product is amazing but have gone back to using the sprinkler container as it is sold without the pump. The product itself works incredibly well at covering up your scalp if your hair is thinnning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy when something works as advertised and this item simply does just that!  What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> It really makes it easier to apply the product.</li>
            <li> Applicator worked great at first but then it started spraying the product out of the bulb that is pressed down. Purchased another one to only have a problem with that one too.  When it worked it was great, but it didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bullcrap that it doesn&#x27;t actually fit on the XFusion bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product. It changed how I look at myself in the mirror!</li>
            <li> Had been wanting a better way to apply the x-fusion for a Long time. Could not afford their $600+ fancy sprayer so I muddled along. It takes some getting used to. But it sprays the x-fusion exactly where you need it without waste. Would not want to be without it...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want this to go with your XFusion</li>
            <li> Great buy - works perfectly</li>
            <li> The X-Fusion applicator is a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t quite perform like I&#x27;d like for it to.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it gets the fibers where you want them, it&#x27;s a more direct, concentrated application...but I noticed it tends to blow fibers off where you&#x27;ve just put them. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s design good for getting fibers on other parts of my scalp, so it&#x27;s not a total waste.</li>
            <li> This item did not work.  The powder would now spray out. I was very very very unsatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Actually, this was a great way to apply powder to scalp.  However, after less than 10 uses, it wouldn&#x27;t work any more.  Just threw it away and shaking product on to scalp.  Not as good that way.  Would have recommended it at first.</li>
            <li> This is no better than just sprinkling the product on your head.  I love the powder but this purchase was a waste of money.  I am surprised there are any positive reviews.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I&#x27;ve now used this for several months &amp; decided I don&#x27;t like it. It delivers too much product at 1 time, so you have a blob of these fibers in a half dollar size area. So, now, I just tap the product against my head, out of the container.  If they could somehow figure out a spray applicator with fine control of the part you press (so a lot doesn&#x27;t come out at once), that would probably work.    -------------------------------    I think it helps apply the product easier (&amp; you use less of it), then just gently move the product thru your hair with your fingertips.</li>
            <li> This applicator has been messy from the beginning. Fibers puff out from the edges during application...but at first I felt this was ok, because the application was nice. Especially for the front part of my scalp. I could deal with the cleanup.  But here it is 2 months after purchase and it really doesn&#x27;t work anymore!  I would buy another if they could somehow improve this to not \\&quot;leak\\&quot;. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using the spray applicator I can say for sure that I will always be using it going forward. It almost make the keratin more of a air brush and you have much more control. It also makes it less likely to bunch up. There is a noticeable difference in spray quality and stream once you are about half way down the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for more control and to specifically control your hair line, this is a must own.</li>
            <li> Makes applying the hair fibers so much easier than sprinkling the bottle.  It is a must if you use fusion keratin hair fibers.  It makes application to the places you need verse trying to sprinkle the fusion fibers and hoping to get it where you need to.</li>
            <li> I find the Xfusion i used (which is the same fibers as the other brands) to be way too lite to be spraying it. I would spray it and like %80 of the fibers would float away in the air. I find it easier to just sprinkle it on being careful about clumping.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t fit the size xfusion canister I purchased.  So it&#x27;s useless.  I am not happy.</li>
            <li> I,ve been X-Fusion for quite a while. After ordering the X-Fusion applicator, I realized , I could make this product last a lot longer, because there is no waste.  You just pump the applicator and it puts the fibers exactly where you need them. I wish I had bought a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this item and he loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this item over time, because I thought it had improved.  IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK. Although it&#x27;s too late to return the first, I&#x27;d like to return this one.</li>
            <li> Unable to use, there were no instructions on how to use the applicator and it did not fit the X-fusion bottle. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> These work great....for about 8 or 10 times, then they stop working and you have to throw them away.  For the amount of money they charge for these cheaply made little things, they should last at least 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> I did not find much use for this.  I give it 4 stars only because Xfusion is so good, I cannot bring myself to put down anything with is name.  Maybe there is a learning curve.  It just didn&#x27;t cover in the back, and the front it was unpredictable and made a mess.  Had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;I find I am better off using the Xfusion by itself in the back.  Much faster, covers perfect.  In the front hair line, it is really tricky, I find Fill in powder with a brush also sold on Amazon, and put it on really lightly far away from hair line.  I may learn to control that sprayer some day.  I will keep it, for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the Xfusion fibers and it really helps with the application. I have less mess when using it.</li>
            <li> Works with X Fusion &amp; Toppik, but it only works good when the canister is full of fiber, once it gets low it kind of blows a bald spot in the fiber and only works good for the hairline, trying to do large areas is difficult to do. Makes the hairline look amazing though!!</li>
            <li> Did not like the spray adapter application. I think its better to fill a hairline but I use a quick sprinkle on the crown..</li>
            <li> Hi  I wated more than one mounth and i havent get my product  So i dont recomend this weppsit to purshes or to buy from  regards</li>
            <li> I frankly don&#x27;t know how people use this product without the applicator.  It helps you be much more precise and you don&#x27;t waste a drop wit it.  Takes a little practice, but works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> BE WARNED- this DOSENT WORK. The bubble will not retract fast enough- I mean like 3 minutes between sprays. This means a 2 minute job to get hair ready in the morning turns into a 15 MINUTE JOB. X FUSION - FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY. The applicator spray will not DETRACT for 2-3 minutes after depressing it to spray. This means it takes 15 MINUTES for 5 sprays. IT IS HORRIBLE. I dont know what is wrong with this product. I am VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!  It helps you get the product where you need it without wasting it!!  A must have in my opinion!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered this sooner. Works great and makes application so much easier and doesn&#x27;t waste product. Get it especially if you wear your hair in a crew cut like mine.</li>
            <li> Like others, I purchased the applicator thinking that I might get more even coverage than just using the container.  Like others, I realized that it was not necessary or useful to have the applicator.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this.  It works -- it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s very focused on one area, so you get heavy amounts of fiber in a line instead of in a diffuse manner over the scalp.  I&#x27;m sure if I practiced I might get a better spread of fibers using this tool â€¦ but why would I try, when the original XFusion container does just as good a job?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work good at all.  I did better just \\&quot;sprinkling\\&quot; this item on the scalp.  The cap seemed to just not work like I thought it should.</li>
            <li> The applicator makes application easy. However, it does disburse the product a little too densely and while it&#x27;s not perfect it does get the job done and requires a brush for a uniform and more realistic appearance.</li>
            <li> I find this product works well for me and is not noticeable. The applicator works great, especially if you have lots of places you need the product.</li>
            <li> I just love this applicator.  Prior to using it, I would use too much product to do the same thing that the applicator does with a third of the product.  It is really great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this top.  I don&#x27;t need to try and sprinkle all over my head.  You just push the top and point nozzle where you want coverage and push.  Works great!!!</li>
            <li> Initially i tried to apply without the applicator and it was a nasty mess. Once I got the applicator, applying xfusion became a piece of cake.  Saved me time and money. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out how it fits or works with the XFusion Keratin Hair Fibers.  If anyone knows, please let me know.</li>
            <li> I SEE ALOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THIS. THERE WAS INSTRUCTIONS WITH IT. YOU NEED TO GET THE SHAKER COVER OFF THE CONTAINER WITH THE POWDER IN, AND THEN SCREW THIS ON. IT IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT AND I HAVE ARTHRITIS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found a way to hide my bald spots! This applicator makes it so easy. Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! No Mess and better coverage!</li>
            <li> works ok with the hair fibers to cover thinning scalp areas.  The other brand device works much better, but does cost more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine is defective but it shoots the hair fibers out the front and the back so I end up with hair fibers on my scalp and on my hand :-/</li>
            <li> This pump does not hold up. The pump itself breaks down after the first couple of days. If there was another item available to use for the application of the xfusion powder I would definitely not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> These applicators don&#x27;t work as well as I would like. When it spits out the Xfusion, it is in clumps which are readily seen in the light.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the bottle.</li>
            <li> great product....no complaints</li>
            <li> I could not live without this applicator, and I&#x27;m extremely confused by the negative reviews. This DOES fit the XFusion bottles, but first you must unscrew and remove the shaker screen (the plastic top with the holes in it). It requires very little pressure and best used with quick, short puffs--if you plunge it all the way down, you may have to wait for it to release. There is a loss of pressure as the bottle is nearing empty, but works just fine again after I give it a shake; also I do marry what&#x27;s left with a new bottle before the old one is empty, which also helps. I&#x27;ve used this applicator every day for about four years now and just ordered a new one because my first one is finally worn out. This puts the fibers exactly where I need them without wasting product or creating a mess. Perfect every time, when used correctly.</li>
            <li> I like the spray applicator, however it had a cap in the ad and didn&#x27;t when delivered&lt;br /&gt;no one would take care of exchanging.  I had to ship back and get credit then&lt;br /&gt;I could re order.  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> The applicator enables me to focus the spray to small areas.  I would be much harder to try to apply by shaking the container.</li>
            <li> I have only 1 empty xfusion can that this fits on. I really did not get to try it. It does not fit on the other cans because the tops do not screw off. It os of no use to me.</li>
            <li> It just ok, I like shake effect better</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you are using a fusion. It works great!</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I&#x27;ve found for my thinning hair.  I can now wear hairstyles that I couldn&#x27;t before because of the thinness on top.  This product looks so natural and each day I use it only enhances the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> What a great product to use with XFusion!  I can direct and put the product where I need it the most!  It distributes the product evenly and on point!</li>
            <li> Brought the XFusion Spray Applicator because it was advertised with the X-Fusion Keratin Hair Fibers but It didn&#x27;t fit bottle</li>
            <li> It does not distribute the stuff in any real way. I just shake it on like a salt shaker. My wife hates it because it gets all over.</li>
            <li> Makes application easy peasy</li>
            <li> If you are a freak and want to turn your hair blue, I would recommend getting this along with X-Fusion black hair fibers. This applicator is weak and does not force hair fibers through and onto your scalp. You have to keep pressing it many times to see a little bit of blue fibers on your head.</li>
            <li> I purchased this applicator to be used with the X-Fusion Hair Fibers product and this is excellent to use.  I would rather use this applicator rather than just shaking it out of the container.  The applicator is a pump and it is much easier and quicker to apply.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> liking it and very easy use to cover some bold spots on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> Would like the old spray better This one is harder for me to use</li>
            <li> Its OK, but I liked the other atomizer I had.  I wore it out &amp; this is all that&#x27;s available now..</li>
            <li> Not necessary to use this but it sure is helpful.</li>
            <li> Strange little adapter lol but works</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to finally receive this and it never worked right and it was brand new, so I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars. However I ordered another one and this one works great - like it was meant to.  I was going to just take it as a loss, but since I had to order another one right away I thought I would try to return it. I&#x27;m glad I did because they refunded my purchase even before they received the defective one. So I was very pleased with the return service. They made it right for me and I appreciated it. Just keep in mind that they eventually get worn out and you will have to buy new ones every so often. I&#x27;m just realizing this now.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the powder through my hair.  I just shake it onto my head. I have weak hands and did not realize the force it takes to get the powder through the device.</li>
            <li> Works great to deliver a more natural application!!!</li>
            <li> I guess it works as good as expected. I think I am more disappointed becasue the color I need is not available.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE WAS NOT GOOD. IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET GO.  I SHOULD HAVE SENT IT BACK, BUT I WAS TOO LAZY.  WOULDN&#x27;T SPRAY OUT THE KERATIN OR PUFF BACK UP.  BAD BAD BAD</li>
            <li> The x-fusion applicator is a must.  It would be impossible to apply the x-fusion without it.  With it you can easily direct and control the area in which to apply x-fusion.</li>
            <li> Love this pump perfect for my keratin powder helps with precision and eliminates some of the mess if you normaly sprinkle it on. If you wear everyday it is a must have.</li>
            <li> It works good if you are using it where there is hair that is not too thin.  Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t look too good.  The applicator is good once I figured out how to remove the cap from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble with shaking product in top of hair&lt;br /&gt;But, this applicator helps to place product on sides of hair as well.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the supplier. Quick delivery, superior packaging. The applicator gets clogged quickly and is hard to unclog. This is not good if your in a hurry. Is not good for wide areas because it sprays in a fine line. Maybe with a little practice?</li>
            <li> The applicator makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier. I wouldn&#x27;t try using the product without it. Will be buying one for my sister to use.</li>
            <li> XFusion spray applicator, is a perfect applicator, just enough to make it look natural, thank you,</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a set with the small XFusion hair powder and Fiberhold spray and the applicator was the wrong size!! You&#x27;d think if they were offering a kit, they would provide the right size to fit over the hair powder.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> This applicator helps to direct the X-Fusion to my scalp.  This is a huge improvement from just sprinkling the X-Fusion onto&lt;br /&gt;my scalp.  The product remains on my head without powder going onto the counter.  I still have to use my fingertips to spread the product around but all in all it is a big improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It helps me to place the Xfusion fibres accurately, eliminating waste of the expensive Xfusion product. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does not fit the container of X-fusion i also purchased at the same time.  I am very disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> i love the x-fusion pump. it alows me to put it were i want it. before i was wasting too much of the product. by using this it helps out alot. and save me more. so i dont have to buy it every month. its lasts me a good while by using this. i love it. so go and get one your self and try it out. worth the money for it</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. You have to pump several times to get a very small area covered with the product. You&#x27;ll be exhausted pumping!  Better to just apply XFusion without this pump. You&#x27;ll save time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> Great applicator that goes with the X-fusion product.  Without this applicator, it would be difficult and even wasteful of the X-Fusion product.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you order the hair fiber. It give you precise application to prevent waste. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found that this thing just blows the fibers around and they don&#x27;t end up where you want them.  It sounded like a good idea to be able to direct the product right to the area but I find the sprinkling from the bottle much more satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Good product, This product is what I expected. I would purchase and recommend  this product to anyone with hair thinning and loss...</li>
            <li> If you use the XFusion sprinkle on hair fibers from the container it will fly all over and not cover as well.  With this relatively inexpensive tool you screw it onto the container and pump the top to spread on the hair fibers.  It comes to a point and makes it much easier to cover just the area needed. Then I use my own hairspray to stick it down well.  It easily shampoos out. Just be sure hair is completely dry before applying the fibers.</li>
            <li> If you are using the Xfusion fibers, you really need this to apply around the hairline.  Also, I recommend the hairline tool to keep the product from having too distinct a demarkation between skin and hair.  The applicator kind of puffs out in a glob so I try to move it back and forth really quickly while I pump and then I smooth into the hair with my finger or the edge of the hairline tool (which is just a card with a jagged edge) so the fibers spread out.</li>
            <li> Great price. ..great product. ..</li>
            <li> Really improves how to use the XFusion product</li>
            <li> LOVED IT , IT&#x27;S VERY HELPFUL TO DISTRIBUTE THE FIBERS WITH NO MESS AT ALL , IT&#x27;S EASY TO HANDLE, SO GO FOR IT</li>
            <li> I just bought the applicator last week and I love it! It is a great device for spraying the X-Fusion powder on the scalp, when you have thinning hair. it delivers a precise &amp;#34;shot&amp;#34; of powder where you need it. Your hairdo looks very natural with the X-Fusion powder and the spray applicator. I highly recommend the applicator.</li>
            <li> Does not puff evenly. Cant get it on as directions say. Much easier to just shake can. and it does not waste.</li>
            <li> Works great creates even coverage!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what or how to use it .</li>
            <li> This is simply outstanding.  With Kaboki or other powder-cannister products, I find a lot of material can come pouring out and gets on my forehead, ears, the bathroom counter, etc.  This applicator allows for a very targeted spread to minimize wasteage.  You may have to find the &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; distance to hold it, because a mere 4-5 inches can deliver a focused blast of product like you were using a paint spray can and starting up close on paper.  The father you pull out, the farther the spread, so you can figure the best distanc that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, you don&#x27;t need to push down too hard on the ball pump.  It responds reasonably well to different levels of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip is to not lose the cap that protects the opening - especially if humid environments can cause products of this nature to get clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, a positive nod to the Kaboki alternative itself. Although some appear to assail this product as being made from sheep hair, I honestly don&#x27;t find some of the other cotton-based fibers to be necessarily superior.  I&#x27;ve purchased Samson Hair Fiberas to refill a Kaboki can, only to find the contents turned clumpy - perhaps due to humidity.  I&#x27;ve thus far not had that happen with XFusion.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this device. Not enough product comes out of the nozzle and aiming it is really not that accurate. I prefer to use the shaker top that&#x27;s on the hair fibers container. I get better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ll say NO to the spray applicator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want the fibers shaken all over the top of my hair where medication has caused a sudden unexpected thinning of the top of my hair. The way I have had to deftly style y hair to try to hide the fact there is pink skin where hair was a few months ago was traumatic. XFusion has been a godsend. This little nozzle here is my Tool Of Tools. Thank god it exists because I don&#x27;t know how else I could have carried out with pinky scalp areas disguise.</li>
            <li> Makes spreading the fibers so easy. I highly recommend using an applicator</li>
            <li> This applicator makes it so easy to distribute the perfect amount of X-Fusion. I love it and definitely recommend getting it when ordering the X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t  work ever well unless you have someone to help you. ever hard to use it on your own. sorry i purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love using this applicator with Xfusion it makes it much easier to gt the product where I want it to go</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
            <li> Applies hair fibers for thinning hair evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using fusion for a while and thought what a great idea to have an applicator for even distribution and making it last.  A totally frustrating experience and a waste of money.  It blobs out in a puff - the ball stays down if you pump too hard or too long - you can&#x27;t control where the dust is flying.  So much easier to just sprinkle and the coverage is better by far.  Total waste of time, effort and money~</li>
            <li> No instructions and can&#x27;t figure out how it could possibly screw into the xfusion bottle.  Should have saved my money and not bother with buying this.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It builds up on the scalp some and tends to make the hair feel a little dry. Overall, it covers thin areas and I was really impressed!</li>
            <li> This is a useless product...it doesn&#x27;t fit right on the container and it is just as easy to shake the product on to the desired area in it&#x27;s original container...waste of money</li>
            <li> A little hard to squeeze out the powder but works well...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use Xfusion, you need this.  Being able to direct the fake hair rather than sprinkle it is preferable.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. It makes my hair look fuller and doesn&#x27;t sweat off, looks great all day</li>
            <li> This product does not even fit the x fusion. It was useless and I couldn&#x27;t use it. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> This applicator clogs and stops working after several uses.  It&#x27;s very disappointing because when it works it&#x27;s great.  I actually wrote the company explaining that I love the xfusion hair fibers product itself, but my applicator stopped working.  They were kind enough to send me a new applicator free of charge.  After having this second applicator for several months now, it too has quit working.  I would encourage all folks with negative reviews to contact the company like I did.  Perhaps they will get enough feedback that they will look into improving the design.</li>
            <li> It did not fit the bottle I I wanted it to fit</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the fibers, but if you are going to use them, this applicator works really really well and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> You cannot control the amount of product that shoots out with each pump so I don&#x27;t like this and you really don&#x27;t need it to use the fibers.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to be so great.  After a while it quite working as well as before and I don&#x27;t use it at all now.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get it right, but works great!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 and none go them worked more than a few times. Worthless.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need this to use with the product. Skip it and save your money.</li>
            <li> I think you use less product with applicator.</li>
            <li> If you buy the X-fusion this is a must have.  It sprays a fine film instead of globs.  Get this to go on your X-Fusion.</li>
            <li> This attachment works great with Fusion bottle. A must in my opinion. Really gets past the hair to the scalp.</li>
            <li> For ease of applying the XFusion Keratin Hair Fibers - you can&#x27;t beat it! Lets you pinpoint right where you need it so you do not waste product.</li>
            <li> I dont think I would ever not want to use the applicator with Xfusion. I love it! I might buy another one in a few months for travel</li>
            <li> it works it feeled in my edges pretty good</li>
            <li> Air is discharged at the rate that it actually separates the XFusion rather than cover. So back to shaking the bottle directly on my thinning areas.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to using this applicator, you&#x27;ll find you are using less product and it does distribute the product more evenly.</li>
            <li> Not as good as theold discontinued applicator. Please go back to thedrawing board and deveop a decent applicator you can direct to problem areas.</li>
            <li> I sent this back....it wasn&#x27;t necessary for the top of the head.  But I can see where it could be more helpful&lt;br /&gt;like for my detail needs.</li>
            <li> The applicator is good and works great but this is my 4th applicator because after using it awhile it becomes clogged and it no longer performs the way it should.  I&#x27;ve tried rinsing it under hot water but it still doesn&#x27;t pump anything out as when it&#x27;s brand new.  It&#x27;s a bit frustrating that I have to keep purchasing one after a few months.</li>
            <li> This does not work anything like I expected or what was shown in the video. It requires what I consider a good amount of pressure, and it must be in a very specific spot, plus I&#x27;ve found that you need to wait in between pumps, so it takes more time than it is worth. Beyond that, it doesn&#x27;t distribute the product like I would have hoped, so I found no redeeming qualities for this item at all.</li>
            <li> This makes applying the X-Fusion so much easier and precise (after a short learning curve).  I wouldn&#x27;t even bother trying to use without this applicator.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit on the other bottle I bought. Have to get the compatible product.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in a spray variety.</li>
            <li> I love this product! First use of it and I knew this was for me. It was really a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thin in spots and this did the trick. Covered like a dream. I used a soft&lt;br /&gt; makeup brush to dab in the spots that needed covering. A little went a long way.&lt;br /&gt; A brush seamed to work better for me. This will now become a part of my morning ritual.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m so happy I happened to stumble across this product while looking for something else..</li>
            <li> It tends to spray fast in a specific area which tends to make the X-Fusion look cakey and fake, not natural. Not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Product really didn&#x27;t work that well.  Seemed to get clogged and would not come out of the applicator.  Doubtful if I will purchase this againh</li>
            <li> Works great with Xfusion.  Too bad they are not very clear about the need for this with the product.</li>
            <li> could not attach to xfusion container....yada yada yada...blah blah blah...really this is ridiculous.  please if you do this I will not review anything again</li>
            <li> It does not spray as the one I presently have. It might be defective but I  threw away the order receipt thinking it would work the same as the one I presently have which is also an exfusion product Otherwise I would have returned.&lt;br /&gt;The order was filled rapidly and received on time as promised.</li>
    </ol>
