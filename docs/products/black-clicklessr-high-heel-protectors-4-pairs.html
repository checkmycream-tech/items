            <li>These are amazing things!  </li>
            <li>They are amazing and durable!</li>
            <li>Saved my favorite heels- absolutely awesome!</li>
            <li>They arrived in two days, and fit perfectly on a variety of my heels!!</li>
            <li>Clickless does a great job at protecting my heels and they blend in with the shoe nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I had to take the heel off the good shoe so could have these on both.</li>
            <li>Much more durable and once they are on you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off!</li>
            <li>They have already saved my favorite pair of shoes!</li>
            <li>I ordered these to go along with my wedding heels, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>And they do a great job at minimizing sound.</li>
            <li>I emailed their customer service to ask a question, and they were immediately helpful and kind.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfect over the heel and quieted the sound of the heels when I walk.</li>
            <li>These protectors are veryrobust, super easy to install in the heels, and they look great!</li>
            <li>But I soon learned that they do an incredible job of protecting your heel from getting scuff marks, or from slipping in to crack on the side walk and ruin beautiful heels.</li>
            <li>I used the size three; fits snug over the heel tip and feels very secure.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok-</li>
            <li>Most heel protectors are bulky and noticeable, but these ones look like they&#x27;re made for my shoe.  </li>
            <li>Brought these for my favorite pair of heels since I wore through heel protector they came with.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to throw out your favorite heels anymore ladies.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just going to a cobbler to replace heel tips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that they provide a bit more stability for those times when your not so stable......</li>
            <li>I am so grateful to the person who invented this ingenious product that have saved my shoes from me.&lt;br /&gt;Get them.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>Should have got more :-)</li>
            <li>probably more, because the shoe repair shop is at the mall</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a great product</li>
            <li>but i wish there were more of the practical sizes.</li>
            <li>Love the shoes, but the heels lasted one wear.</li>
            <li>I found more heals I could protect.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will buy extras.</li>
            <li>Since I got the variety pack, it worked out fine for what I had but just measure to be sure before ordering.  </li>
            <li>So far these have held up great, reduced the noise of my stilettos, and protected my shoes.  </li>
            <li>So far these work great.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t stay on very well......was good for a day until I can bring my shoes</li>
            <li>Not only do they protect the end tips on my heels, but they&#x27;re the perfect quick fix for when I do break them off.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and seem durable.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed with these I&#x27;m buying the other color today!</li>
            <li>Great concept, but these are designed to fit only the slimmest of heels.</li>
            <li>None of the sizes fit any of my heels, even the smallest that I thought was considered &amp;#34;stilleto.&amp;#34; Would be great if these were made for thicker heels -- I would definitely buy them then!</li>
            <li>I wish there was an size option available.</li>
            <li>Gave it 1 star, because they didn&#x27;t fit over my heels.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product... highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The heel protectors were nice at first, but wore out quickly.</li>
            <li>Differnt sizes are nice to make sure it fit the heels I needed and with the left overs</li>
            <li>They fit very easy on the heels and they are not noticeable; I wish I find larger sizes as well.</li>
            <li>But they are great for protecting your heels, especially if you live somewhere with weather (ice, snow, rain).</li>
            <li>However, these do work great for a few wears.</li>
            <li>Plus, these actually make the shoes more comfortable to wear and easier to walk in.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, they are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>These have extended the life of shoes that I thought were beyond help or just didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth to repair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>These worked FAR better than the Quick Tips I tried first.</li>
            <li>You are better off going to a shoe repair person and get your heels fixed right.  </li>
            <li>have traction right?)</li>
            <li>am wearing the right size</li>
            <li>However, of course, they don&#x27;t fit all high heels.  </li>
            <li>I love these tiny super heroes for stilettos.</li>
            <li>The package has a couple of different sizes, and it slides right on your heel, so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I have put them on brand new shoes to make sure they stay like new for longer.</li>
            <li>Clickless website actually has two more colors (neutral &amp; brown).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for this type of heel protectors in the last 10 years and I am glad I found them.</li>
            <li>For most people, they might last longer.</li>
            <li>Seems like a simple product and might be buying more of these</li>
            <li>Now my walk is as pretty as my shoes.  </li>
            <li>The package contains 3 pairs good for tinny heels, similar to the picture, and 3 pairs next size.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they do it for everyone but, as a fun bonus, they included a nude set along with the black ones I purchased so that was a wonderful surprise.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to use the large caps for a pair of dress booties</li>
            <li>being proactive would be smart.  </li>
            <li>Caps aren&#x27;t very durable</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like these.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>They seem to give a tiny bit of shock absorption… and I&#x27;ll take any help I can get when it comes to being comfortable in</li>
            <li>and they made so much noise and were slippery.</li>
            <li>Only one pair fit my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use.</li>
            <li>cause i double checked it and it fit well while set up.</li>
            <li>And, it reminded me that men tend not to like when they hear the click of our high heels!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they have saved my composure and supported me in not slipping when I should have most definitely gone down on the dance floor.</li>
            <li>They were really small for my shoe&#x27;s heel, but if they had fit they would&#x27;ve worked fine.</li>
            <li>so much better than the other heel savers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and they are like brand new!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wast your money on this takes your shoes to shoes repairs guy or just buy new shoes !</li>
            <li>Try Quick Tips for that, those last a while.</li>
            <li>The company actually recommends adding them to your shoes BEFORE you have an issue and initially I thought it was just a gimmick to sell more of their product</li>
            <li>Oh also my bf was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t have traction with these (like high heels</li>
            <li>However, as other reviewers mentioned only one pair really fits most heels.</li>
            <li>They were super simple to put on and they saved me lots of money in comparison to getting my old shoes repaired or buying new ones.  </li>
            <li>They are a quick solution but do not hold up long.</li>
            <li>When I walk, my heels tend to hit the ground harder than normal, which means I wear out the tips on heels way too quickly.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Dress shoes can be so uncomfortable when they are new, so when I get mine nice and broken in (but still looking good)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; anymore when walking on hard surfaces and I feel like I have more grip</li>
            <li>I can walk so much more securely (and sexily) when these are on my shoes - no more of that high heel shuffle with the short steps and unattractive gate that looks so desperate on a woman.  </li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on my damaged heels with just nail as it looks like the old heel nails would break through the heel cap.</li>
            <li>she likes them so far</li>
            <li>I have put them on old, worn out shoes to extend the life.</li>
            <li>I to have the heels professionally re-done.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have put them in the heels of several other shoes and they dampen the sound of clicking.</li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars but the largest size is still very small for most heels.</li>
            <li>Not useful and cannot fit the heel properly, Stay away and save your money.</li>
            <li>Are you constantly buying new shoes or taking yours to the repair for your heel tips?  </li>
            <li>I have used these on several new pairs of shoes.  </li>
            <li>2 pair are wasted because the caps fit tiny heels.  </li>
            <li>so instead, i found a clear and smaller drug store pair.</li>
            <li>You can barely even tell I have them on the shoes.</li>
            <li>I had some heels with fairly thin points, but none of the sizes that came in the pack would even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li>My shoes usually only last a couple of weeks before needing new tips.  </li>
            <li>The nail went right through after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>It really hard to fit it on the heal , and only on is useable</li>
            <li>My only complaint I have is that this is a variety pack and only the two largest sizes fit my heels.</li>
            <li>It is still cheaper than re-heeling or buying new shoes sooner than expected though.</li>

            <li> When I walk, my heels tend to hit the ground harder than normal, which means I wear out the tips on heels way too quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Dress shoes can be so uncomfortable when they are new, so when I get mine nice and broken in (but still looking good)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; anymore when walking on hard surfaces and I feel like I have more grip</li>
            <li> I can walk so much more securely (and sexily) when these are on my shoes - no more of that high heel shuffle with the short steps and unattractive gate that looks so desperate on a woman.  </li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on my damaged heels with just nail as it looks like the old heel nails would break through the heel cap.</li>
            <li> she likes them so far</li>
            <li> I have put them on old, worn out shoes to extend the life.</li>
            <li> I to have the heels professionally re-done.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have put them in the heels of several other shoes and they dampen the sound of clicking.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars but the largest size is still very small for most heels.</li>
            <li> Not useful and cannot fit the heel properly, Stay away and save your money.</li>
            <li> Are you constantly buying new shoes or taking yours to the repair for your heel tips?  </li>
            <li> I have used these on several new pairs of shoes.  </li>
            <li> 2 pair are wasted because the caps fit tiny heels.  </li>
            <li> so instead, i found a clear and smaller drug store pair.</li>
            <li> You can barely even tell I have them on the shoes.</li>
            <li> I had some heels with fairly thin points, but none of the sizes that came in the pack would even come close to fitting.</li>
            <li> My shoes usually only last a couple of weeks before needing new tips.  </li>
            <li> The nail went right through after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It really hard to fit it on the heal , and only on is useable</li>
            <li> My only complaint I have is that this is a variety pack and only the two largest sizes fit my heels.</li>
            <li> It is still cheaper than re-heeling or buying new shoes sooner than expected though.</li>
            <li> A more than casual glance at the heels, you can tell that they are on.</li>
            <li> Work well, but didnt last long.. they fell apart.</li>
            <li> These work well, but don&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I walk hard and tend to wear down the heel of my shoes quickly.</li>
            <li> I always lose the heel pads long before the shoes give out so</li>
            <li> For less than $12 (since I have used a couple different sizes on the same shoe!)</li>
            <li> Every time i take my shoes for repair due to the heel tip damage, i end up spending about $6 per pair of shoes and they really don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> I can walk on heels, but sometimes I destroy the little nub thing by walking on them too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found they last about 2-3 months with moderate wear, but that&#x27;s from someone whose gait has a heavy heel strike.</li>
            <li> I got them for two pairs of black shoes that were losing their heel pads and these solved the problem instantly.  </li>
            <li> The pictures make the heel protectors look less obtrusive than they actually are.  </li>
            <li> I wear stilettos for work everyday and I am usually walking on concrete or rough floors.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your heels from slipping</li>
            <li> Money WELL spent!</li>
            <li> I tried putting on another smaller cap that was really tight, but the cap rolled under my heel after a few blocks.  </li>
            <li> Only for VERY narrow heels</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m less likely to slip on slick surfaces.  </li>
            <li> They keep your shoe from clicking (obviously, given the name) but also keep it from sinking down into the annoying sidewalk cracks filled with putty.</li>
            <li> Save your money, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I always wear one heel down to the nail.</li>
            <li> I got them so that I would be less &amp;#34;clacky&amp;#34; when I was cruising around my office in stilettos at work.</li>
            <li> These were WAY to small to work for any but the pointiest of heels, and I mean like barely a pencil in diameter.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> the other 2 are too small !</li>
            <li> They last a few months of casual wear.  </li>
            <li> but they were too small.</li>
            <li> I assumed my heels would be on the small size but</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ruin the look of a slick pair of stilettos with this.</li>
            <li> They are &amp;#34;clickless&amp;#34; as advertised but now I squeak when I walk on hard surfaces.  </li>
            <li> you have save me trips to the shoe repair shop and at least $60...</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> wanted to wear them to a garden wedding... looked ridiculous on.</li>
            <li> I was worried they&#x27;d look ridiculous once I put them on, but you cannot tell at all.</li>
            <li> The two that I could use decreased the noise when I walk.</li>
            <li> Afraid they would rip if I forced it.</li>
            <li> No wrapping the heel before, trimming tape, or any of that other crap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worse!  </li>
            <li> These items are useless to me.  </li>
            <li> they have saved expensive shoes!</li>
            <li> Until that happens though, I am rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to have to get rid of them or spend $20+ to get the heels retapped.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just dangerous!!!</li>

            <li> These worked FAR better than the Quick Tips I tried first. Much more durable and once they are on you don&#x27;t have to worry about them falling off!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on worn tips. The nail went right through after a few hours.  I tried putting on another smaller cap that was really tight, but the cap rolled under my heel after a few blocks.  Caps aren&#x27;t very durable and I don&#x27;t recommend using it on a heel with a nail.  Try Quick Tips for that, those last a while.</li>
            <li> Do you wear stilettos?  Are you constantly buying new shoes or taking yours to the repair for your heel tips?  THEN YOU NEED THESE!!  These heel protectors have become a must have for me.  I wear stilettos for work everyday and I am usually walking on concrete or rough floors.  My shoes usually only last a couple of weeks before needing new tips.  I have had these on a recent pair that I bought and it has been over a month and they are like brand new!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought these because I walk hard and tend to wear down the heel of my shoes quickly. They arrived in two days, and fit perfectly on a variety of my heels!!</li>
            <li> Only for VERY narrow heels</li>
            <li> Not useful and cannot fit the heel properly, Stay away and save your money.</li>
            <li> Really like these. But only need 2 sizes. Would like to only order the size I need.</li>
            <li> They work perfect on my stilettos!</li>
            <li> These work really well. I was hoping to use the large caps for a pair of dress booties but they were too small. That being said, I have put them in the heels of several other shoes and they dampen the sound of clicking. Didn&#x27;t work for what I bought them for but that&#x27;s ok- I found another use for them.</li>
            <li> The heel protectors were nice at first, but wore out quickly.</li>
            <li> I had a pair of shoes I would buy and the heel kept coming off.  These kept the heel on and kept my shoes quiet!</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Seriously. They have already saved my favorite pair of shoes! They keep your shoe from clicking (obviously, given the name) but also keep it from sinking down into the annoying sidewalk cracks filled with putty.</li>
            <li> way to clunky for any of my heals. wanted to wear them to a garden wedding... looked ridiculous on. so instead, i found a clear and smaller drug store pair.</li>
            <li> Great fix. The package has a couple of different sizes, and it slides right on your heel, so quick and easy. Thank You</li>
            <li> Great works as described !!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these to go along with my wedding heels, and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  Most heel protectors are bulky and noticeable, but these ones look like they&#x27;re made for my shoe.  They seem to give a tiny bit of shock absorption… and I&#x27;ll take any help I can get when it comes to being comfortable in heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clickless website actually has two more colors (neutral &amp; brown).  I emailed their customer service to ask a question, and they were immediately helpful and kind.  I definitely plan to order again in the future!</li>
            <li> So far these have held up great, reduced the noise of my stilettos, and protected my shoes.  I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> Worked great i would recommend</li>
            <li> Brought these for my favorite pair of heels since I wore through heel protector they came with. Fit perfect over the heel and quieted the sound of the heels when I walk. Great heel protector replacement so you don&#x27;t have to throw out your favorite heels anymore ladies.</li>
            <li> I bought these from BeClickless.com and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I got them for two pairs of black shoes that were losing their heel pads and these solved the problem instantly.  They were super simple to put on and they saved me lots of money in comparison to getting my old shoes repaired or buying new ones.  The company actually recommends adding them to your shoes BEFORE you have an issue and initially I thought it was just a gimmick to sell more of their product but after using them for a few weeks, I can absolutely see how that could be beneficial.  I always lose the heel pads long before the shoes give out so being proactive would be smart.  Plus, these actually make the shoes more comfortable to wear and easier to walk in.  I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; anymore when walking on hard surfaces and I feel like I have more grip so I&#x27;m less likely to slip on slick surfaces.  Not sure if they do it for everyone but, as a fun bonus, they included a nude set along with the black ones I purchased so that was a wonderful surprise.  My only word of caution would be to measure the heels you&#x27;ll be covering.  I assumed my heels would be on the small size but both pairs actually needed the larger size covers.  Since I got the variety pack, it worked out fine for what I had but just measure to be sure before ordering.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product... highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great concept, but these are designed to fit only the slimmest of heels. None of the sizes fit any of my heels, even the smallest that I thought was considered &amp;#34;stilleto.&amp;#34; Would be great if these were made for thicker heels -- I would definitely buy them then! Until that happens though, I am rather disappointed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I thought that this might help protect my heel tips when I was working in NYC. Nope. They would pop of walking on carpet indoors, and I lost one in a crack in the side walk. You&#x27;re better off just going to a cobbler to replace heel tips. It&#x27;s not a viable preventative measure to protect your heels.</li>
            <li> I love these tiny super heroes for stilettos. they have saved expensive shoes! I got them so that I would be less &amp;#34;clacky&amp;#34; when I was cruising around my office in stilettos at work. And they do a great job at minimizing sound. But I soon learned that they do an incredible job of protecting your heel from getting scuff marks, or from slipping in to crack on the side walk and ruin beautiful heels. I&#x27;ve also found that they provide a bit more stability for those times when your not so stable......maybe a Saturday night after a couple of cocktails. Hey don&#x27;t judge me. I&#x27;m pretty sure they have saved my composure and supported me in not slipping when I should have most definitely gone down on the dance floor. I am so grateful to the person who invented this ingenious product that have saved my shoes from me.&lt;br /&gt;Get them. save your shoes and your self.</li>
            <li> These were WAY to small to work for any but the pointiest of heels, and I mean like barely a pencil in diameter. I had some heels with fairly thin points, but none of the sizes that came in the pack would even come close to fitting. These are only for the skinniest of stilettos.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this type of heel protectors in the last 10 years and I am glad I found them. The package contains 3 pairs good for tinny heels, similar to the picture, and 3 pairs next size. They fit very easy on the heels and they are not noticeable; I wish I find larger sizes as well.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Every time i take my shoes for repair due to the heel tip damage, i end up spending about $6 per pair of shoes and they really don&#x27;t last that long.  These protectors are veryrobust, super easy to install in the heels, and they look great! I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> When I walk, my heels tend to hit the ground harder than normal, which means I wear out the tips on heels way too quickly. The Clickless Heel Protectors solved this problem. They provide protection for the tips of my heels and because they&#x27;re made of a rubber-like material, they also provide cushioning when walking so they lessen the impact, and thus the wear, on my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found they last about 2-3 months with moderate wear, but that&#x27;s from someone whose gait has a heavy heel strike. For most people, they might last longer. In my opinion, they are totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> These saved my shoes!!!! I had metal and stuff sticking out from the bottom and they made so much noise and were slippery. This was such a simple fix to the problem !</li>
            <li> These work perfectly. However, as other reviewers mentioned only one pair really fits most heels. I wish there was an size option available.</li>
            <li> They are a quick solution but do not hold up long.</li>
            <li> Clickless does a great job at protecting my heels and they blend in with the shoe nicely.  They last a few months of casual wear.  I have used these on several new pairs of shoes.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t use these on my damaged heels with just nail as it looks like the old heel nails would break through the heel cap.</li>
            <li> Works! Keeps your heels from slipping</li>
            <li> I now have these in all three colors and have been using them for months.  I love them! Not only do they protect the end tips on my heels, but they&#x27;re the perfect quick fix for when I do break them off.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Makes my heels almost noiseless .  Should have got more :-)</li>
            <li> My wife broke her heel and we found these. she likes them so far and I had to take the heel off the good shoe so could have these on both. Seems like a simple product and might be buying more of these so we have them on hand for her.</li>
            <li> Gave it 1 star, because they didn&#x27;t fit over my heels. Used your measurements and I couldn&#x27;t  get them to go over my heel. Afraid they would rip if I forced it. Disappointed!!!! Sent them back intact.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars but the largest size is still very small for most heels. But they are great for protecting your heels, especially if you live somewhere with weather (ice, snow, rain). Wish they had larger sizes</li>
            <li> Best. Product. Ever. These have extended the life of shoes that I thought were beyond help or just didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth to repair. I have put them on old, worn out shoes to extend the life. I have put them on brand new shoes to make sure they stay like new for longer. I have even used a pair of pliers (for grip), taken them off a pair of shoes they had been on and put them on others. Still work perfectly! I have showed them off to all of my friends who are in turn ordering them. Money WELL spent! Thank you Thank you Thank you! UPDATE: You did it again! You have saved THE SAME pair of shoes for the 3rd time! Dress shoes can be so uncomfortable when they are new, so when I get mine nice and broken in (but still looking good) I hate to have to get rid of them or spend $20+ to get the heels retapped. For less than $12 (since I have used a couple different sizes on the same shoe!) you have save me trips to the shoe repair shop and at least $60... probably more, because the shoe repair shop is at the mall and that&#x27;s just dangerous!!! Thanks again for a great product</li>
            <li> Works great but i wish there were more of the practical sizes. I wear a lot of stiletto pumps like the picture, but there was only 1 set of that size</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 pairs of shoes that I wear to work. Love the shoes, but the heels lasted one wear. These protectors saved the day!!! It allowed me to keep both shoes, because when I attempted to manually replace the heel I couldn&#x27;t remove the heel. So the protector works as a replacement heel and allows me to keep my favorite work heels!!</li>
            <li> The pictures make the heel protectors look less obtrusive than they actually are.  A more than casual glance at the heels, you can tell that they are on. They are &amp;#34;clickless&amp;#34; as advertised but now I squeak when I walk on hard surfaces.  That&#x27;s worse!  You are better off going to a shoe repair person and get your heels fixed right.  Don&#x27;t ruin the look of a slick pair of stilettos with this.</li>
            <li> 2 pair are wasted because the caps fit tiny heels.  The two that I could use decreased the noise when I walk.</li>
            <li> Work well, but didnt last long.. they fell apart.</li>
            <li> These are amazing things!  Worth every penny.  I can walk so much more securely (and sexily) when these are on my shoes - no more of that high heel shuffle with the short steps and unattractive gate that looks so desperate on a woman.  Yay!  Thank you clickless heel protectors!!  Now my walk is as pretty as my shoes.  And - I can buy a wider variety of heel styles knowing I have these.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought these months ago and I have had the same pair on my heels ever since!!! They are amazing and durable! I won&#x27;t wear my heels without them now.</li>
            <li> Differnt sizes are nice to make sure it fit the heels I needed and with the left overs I found more heals I could protect. Holding up great and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow! Great product!! I bought them as backup to keep in at my office and travel bag for shoe emergencies. Today I ended up having to use a pair and they are a shoe saver! I used the size three; fits snug over the heel tip and feels very secure. You can barely even tell I have them on the shoes. I am so impressed with these I&#x27;m buying the other color today!</li>
            <li> I can walk on heels, but sometimes I destroy the little nub thing by walking on them too much.  These protect and defend it perfectly. Love this product and will buy extras.</li>
            <li> not sturdy. Stands out.</li>
            <li> These items are useless to me.  Only one pair fit my shoes.  Save your money, not worth it.</li>
            <li> So far these work great. I was worried they&#x27;d look ridiculous once I put them on, but you cannot tell at all. My only complaint I have is that this is a variety pack and only the two largest sizes fit my heels. so I have two I can&#x27;t really use. It is still cheaper than re-heeling or buying new shoes sooner than expected though. Oh also my bf was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t have traction with these (like high heels have traction right?) but I haven&#x27;t noticed an issue with that. It feels like they&#x27;re not even there.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and seem durable.</li>
            <li> Today is the 1st day i am wearing it, and one of the pair has already slipped and lost.&lt;br /&gt;I am wearing the right size cause i double checked it and it fit well while set up. Unfortunately only one of the 4 delivered sizes worked and even more sadly it slipped away.</li>
            <li> These work well, but don&#x27;t seem to last very long. Might just be cheaper to get your heels repaired. However, these do work great for a few wears.</li>
            <li> I tried several different kinds of heel protectors. I always wear one heel down to the nail. This was the only one I&#x27;ve tried that goes on and stays on!</li>
            <li> They were really small for my shoe&#x27;s heel, but if they had fit they would&#x27;ve worked fine.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay on very well......was good for a day until I can bring my shoes I to have the heels professionally re-done.</li>
            <li> It really hard to fit it on the heal , and only on is useable the other 2 are too small ! Don&#x27;t wast your money on this takes your shoes to shoes repairs guy or just buy new shoes !</li>
            <li> awesome! so much better than the other heel savers I&#x27;ve tried. No wrapping the heel before, trimming tape, or any of that other crap. They literally just slide over the heel and done. Saved my favorite heels- absolutely awesome!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I saw it on the &amp;#34;Bethenny&amp;#34; talk show.  And, it reminded me that men tend not to like when they hear the click of our high heels!  (Smiling...got to please &#x27;em!)  But, they actually seem to make your heels stronger and sturdier.  However, of course, they don&#x27;t fit all high heels.  Please look at the sizing...</li>
