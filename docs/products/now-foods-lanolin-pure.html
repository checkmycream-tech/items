            <li>So i found a great replica recipe</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lanolin is great to hydate and soften skin, but I will stick with the LIQUID lanolin, which is easier to work with and has no smell.  </li>

            <li>the mic built into my computer isn&#x27;t that great.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on her tender, stuffy nose to protect it from too many tissues - awesome.      </li>
            <li>I used this to make my own tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li>Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>This a good company and this Lanolin is a great quality.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest smell, but if you can get over it, it&#x27;s so much better of a value than the lansinoh nipple cream.  </li>
            <li>Very nice lanolin at a good price and quantity.</li>
            <li>Some people find the smell pleasant, good for them.</li>

            <li>Good seller.</li>

            <li>Good lanolin.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, my face feels good and not greasy.  </li>

            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>This is a good alternative, but for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on skin/in skincare.</li>
            <li>, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>and it covered the &amp;#34;barnyardiness&amp;#34; fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good product, and timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Will probably stick with this brand as it is a good price and the convenience of ordering it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lost track of a source for it until I discovered a wonderful company called Amazon that has just about everything in the world available and I started using it again.</li>
            <li>good product but not what needed.</li>
            <li>Best stuff on earth and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased and used &amp;#34;now products&amp;#34; before and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Im sure it works great, but i CANNOT get over the smell of lanolin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works great</li>
            <li>I am elated that I decided to purchase this product and I am sure it will be a great addition to my products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but I had no idea</li>
            <li>Not the most pleasant smell, but doable, and a good protectant.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, can&#x27;t beat the price for lanolin - works great, and is nice and clean</li>
            <li>those darn things are magic!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>I love lanolin!</li>
            <li>She hasnt been able to find anything (before this) that didnt sting or irritate her bottom until this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Little did I know that I would use this for so much more!  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to put in a liner!  </li>
            <li>Excellent value &amp; fast shipper!</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first but the product works great baby doesn&#x27;t mind the smell at all!</li>
            <li>feels fine, performs great.</li>
            <li>Its pure lanolin and works wonderfully for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>This was a great price and a large quantity making this a great buy.</li>
            <li>This is truly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The price for this is amazing.</li>
            <li>This lanolin is amazing.</li>
            <li>the price is amazing</li>
            <li>I soften it with warm vegetable oil and add spice, scent or color as needed for my use.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d be in for when the product arrived.  </li>
            <li>Nice, creamy lanolin.  </li>
            <li>What a nice product.</li>
            <li>Mostly they smell good, but</li>
            <li>I am sure it would not be good for everyone.</li>
            <li>I cut it with coconut oil, beeswax, honey, and rosemary oil for a nice lip balm for daytime use.</li>
            <li>I used this product to make my own tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I am using it to make my own hand lotion and this will meet my purposes</li>
            <li>Warm both of them and measure</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own smell and color.</li>
            <li>My hope was that this would put an end to the perpetual fight I am having with my own skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best skin cream: relatively light and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It smells like putrified machine oil, and the odor is very strong.  </li>
            <li>VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>It works perfectly and 100% natural!</li>
            <li>Now Pure Lanolin is a very good quality.</li>
            <li>We have been using lanolin for years to heal cuts and scrapes - especially good for young children.</li>
            <li>It has excellent natural tackiness, and sticks well to metal surfaces.</li>
            <li>Best price so far.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!</li>
            <li>Lanolin is a great emollient, although it is sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell great in larger quantities.  </li>
            <li>I love it, especially a greater substitution for vaseline (petroleum) that my wife used to use on her self &amp; our young daughter.</li>
            <li>I am starting to make my own skin care products and through some research discovered that lanolin would be great for a lip balm!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the price it great for 7oz.</li>
            <li>It dissolves well in hot water and makes for a great lotion on my hands afterwards.  </li>
            <li>After 9 months, I still have a mostly full container, so economically-speaking, this is good.</li>
            <li>But for me, this is fantastic, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Now pure Lanolin is great.</li>
            <li>There are a number of collercial industrial lubes and gun lubes that use lanolin as an additive, but the pure stuff works great, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find that they could be whipped together to produce such a delicious feeling cream that is super effective.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and it lives up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>Its effect is like magic.</li>
            <li>This way I don&#x27;t mistakenly eat Lanolin (though it is safe to be ingested)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>This product is actually better than the nipple cream I bought at the store.</li>
            <li>Vastly better than any store bought, petroleum based, perfumed creams.</li>
            <li>great- smells nice, keeps the wool soft and water-resistant.  </li>
            <li>I tried many many brands of lotion to relieve this problem.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, even including shipping, this was at a better price than I used to get buying it at a nearby store.</li>
            <li>Many reviews harp on the smell.</li>
            <li>It sure beats lansinoh for $10 for 2 oz.  </li>
            <li>way better than desitin.</li>
            <li>Besides who is smelling your kids bum or your udders anyways? :-)</li>
            <li>Better than any chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li>but then it soaks in and works it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the product (just as described) and the transaction went very well.</li>
            <li>If you apply it an hour or so before bedtime, most of it will soak in before retiring or you can wear cotton gloves to bed.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this is as well.</li>
            <li>I love the NOW brand and their lanolin does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Most people buy lanolin as a skin cream, but I find that&#x27;s</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff and have gotten it for my family as gifts.</li>
            <li>This has solved many winter skin problems for me.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t found anything better for soothing winter skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need more chemicals</li>
            <li>Not completely terrible...</li>
            <li>I love using this.</li>
            <li>But it does feel better in the morning, but it seems you can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using it on more exposed areas of your skin during the day I would pick a odorless pharmaceutical grade lanolin instead.</li>
            <li>and now they stopped buying it and ask me to make some more for them</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after lanolin has soaked in.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil does an okay job with the smell</li>
            <li>Works so much better than any chap stick or lip balm on the market.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>You can get more processed lanolin that doesn&#x27;t have the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could mix it with something else to help mask the smell</li>
            <li>sons love this for chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>much better value than any thing out there</li>
            <li>Sure - it goes on like axel grease...</li>
            <li>This is the very best out of a dozen different ointments for the bottom I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more soothing, rubs in better and protects more.</li>
            <li>Feet feels already better and smoother too!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave a non-polar protective layer on top of damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>The liquid lanolin from Now Foods has a more tolerable odor.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>Maybe a more liquid one of those would work better, maybe not.</li>
            <li>I mix this with shea butter, coconut oil and argan oil and whip it to a lovely creamy texture that is a pleasure to apply.  </li>
            <li>better than bengay.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a liquid was a desent price compared to most.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what others use it for :)</li>
            <li>(ok.. a lot..)</li>
            <li>:) will buy again and some stronger soap scent.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about the excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I was expecting an oil like substance, but this is more like a wax.</li>
            <li>Once I was getting the dryness under control, I mixed it with some smelly lotion and it turned out great!</li>
            <li>Great but really stinky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema for most of my life.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>My hands have improved but I&#x27;m hoping for better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li>I love this lanolin so much better than the tube of &amp;#34;nipple cream&amp;#34; you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li>ok ok</li>
            <li>I love this product but my husband thinks I smell like a barn when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It works great and ye sit smells, but it smells like real lanolin.</li>
            <li>Great for work roughened hands and really has some staying power.</li>
            <li>It smells like the real thing too (aka sheep)! :P  </li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works excellent if left on overnight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the best and most practical way to use this product is at night and to cover the area of use, if possible.  </li>
            <li>I had to use dish soap and the scratchy side of a sponge to get most of it off my fingers from opening the jar.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Very nice and pure product.</li>
            <li>I love it and this brand is really ez to work with and it smells good too:)</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff you can get to relieve dry hands and lips.</li>
            <li>It made a creamy salve that is perfect for dry chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that helped manage severely dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the smell which was very mild and kind of pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for chapped lips or dry hands.  </li>
            <li>so it could be more easily applied while keeping it sterile.</li>
            <li>It works best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my babies dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t smell good maybe you should bath more and use/eat more natural products.</li>
            <li>Great Natural product for the world.</li>
            <li>perfect for my rough heels</li>
            <li>This is a great natural additive to lotions to make them thicker and to lock moisture into the skin</li>
            <li>It keeps the wool soft and water-resistant- great for my daughter because she pees A LOT.</li>
            <li>This is a good price on this much Lanolin.</li>
            <li>Good product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This product is good lanolin, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how much you get and not so easy to melt into your skin as another brand I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li>Great for skin, thanks for quick shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars since I&#x27;ve not used or ordered lanolin before, however, I did order other products from this company and they were all excellent quality</li>
            <li>I noticed in the AM that it was not something that washed off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I know lanolin is supposed to have a strong scent</li>
            <li>This tub doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and has the consistency of lanolin in the tubes I had purchased before.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong...</li>
            <li>It smells like lanolin- not too strong in my opinion, and not too refined either.  </li>
            <li>What I did not expect is it has a fairly strong odor when I made it into lotion.</li>
            <li>but oh boy the smell is strong.  </li>
            <li>Maybe some people will think it&#x27;s strong like my husband.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong at all</li>
            <li>This lanolin is just as good at a far better price.</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with Now Pure Lanolin.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully for that, and the price was right, definitely!  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this 7oz tub of lanolin (more or less 1 cup) to &amp;#34;lanolize&amp;#34; wool diapers for my baby, which it is perfect for.  </li>
            <li>Given the thickness of the lanolin, I&#x27;ve found coconut oil to work best in thinning this down to a consistency that will spread and absorb easily.  </li>
            <li>2) moisturizer for the hands, face, feet, anywhere; 3) great moisturizer for the eyelids and around the eyes in general....</li>
            <li>We personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, (admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a rose garden, but it does work great which for us, makes it totally worth the trade off.)  </li>
            <li>It has kind of an earthy odor, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li>- this has been the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>The best for moisturizing my hair when I mix with other oils!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild lanolin aroma and is smooth and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>Smells fine (like lanolin, but not at all offensive),</li>
            <li>If you already work with sheep or cows, it might be fine for you.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way cheaper than another one I got and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>brand/purple container before which worked fine but was about $10/oz</li>
            <li>My jar of lanoline was a thicker consistency than described, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>but Argan oil seems to absorb onto my skin more quickly than the lanolin because I&#x27;m just mixing it in my hands.  </li>
            <li>It melts really nice in hot water, and covers whole diaper cover nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a more natural, golden color and a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is really nice pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>Schmearing this stuff on my fingers and leaving on overnight (with gloves) has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It is nearly water proof and provides excellent lubrication and corrosion protection on the bronze turnbuckles on my 44 year old Morgan 24</li>
            <li>I was using Lansinoh Lanolin to lanolize my wool diaper covers at a huge cost difference.</li>
            <li>I will be using it to winterize my feet and my dogs paws, but will need fragrance free for hands and lips.</li>
            <li>product heals chapped/cracked/sore lips fast and gives a really nice shine to them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available....</li>
            <li>i use lanolin to keep my heels smooth, and to keep my hands from drying out during winter    you can buy 2oz of processed lanolin, with the smell removed for about $15    </li>
            <li>Hydrous lanolin does not seem to be available anywhere at all.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic item.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>but it is what our skin needs to stay smooth.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic to avoid chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Great product and will definitely last for awhile.</li>
            <li>A great for moisturing hands/feet especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>Once it melts, it goes well with oils such as jojoba, avocado oil, apricot oil and works great to hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li>not something I was comfortable putting in my son&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>I also put some on my hands, feels smooth as well.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and is so much cheaper than using the popular nipple cream.</li>
            <li>It is great and I will stocking up on it as this condition can only be controlled but it never goes away.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic for my mechanics hands after a day in the shop and for my feet after a day running around barefoot.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li>Obviously isn&#x27;t for use on nipples for breastfeeding but works great for lanolizing wool diaper covers or garments.</li>
            <li>The mixture leaves a light waxy film on my skin, preventing the clay from sucking all the moisture out of my skin.</li>
            <li>We also are users of Eucerin, Aquaphor, and good old petroleum jelly</li>
            <li>I have good skin naturally</li>
            <li>Our skin looked so good after being all day at the pool everyone was surprised.</li>
            <li>It can be used to keep leather soft and good.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job keeping them moving easily and lasts a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li>Sure it smells if you stick your nose right up to the jar - it is oil secreted by sheep, what do you expect?</li>
            <li>A very nice lanolin that, when used in lip balm, yields a lasting, creamy experience that leaves lips silky and kissable.</li>
            <li>It is a mild, natural, wooly and pleasant smell.    </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Pure Lanolin!  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY the best option for dry, wrinkly, cracked skin etc</li>
            <li>Pretty sure that shouldn&#x27;t have been in there.</li>
            <li>Any nursing mom is probably familiar with the scent.</li>
            <li>Lanoline definitely has excellent benefits, but I most likely will never use the majority of the contents of this tub because of the downsides.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>And I love that there are no scary ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been looking for and will buy more.  </li>
            <li>Lanolin is really great for dry skin, and I use it for a foot massage every night.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for eczema patches, dry skin, even chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>I love having it handy, and have used it for the following purposes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>Great value, works well for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>It is also great for dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li>but omg feels great on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very strong sense of smell and am highly allergic to perfumes, chemical-y smells, etc.  </li>
            <li>scent free, easy to dissolve in hot water if you add a squirt of baby wash or draft liquid.  </li>
            <li>If you are okay with strong oil smells like olive oil, you may be perfectly okay with the regular wear of this product.</li>
            <li>but this pure lanolin is much better for moisturizing and getting rid of dryness.  </li>
            <li>It has been very effective moisturizing my dry lips.</li>
            <li>It does strip out of diapers easily by using blue Dawn though, as I had to discover after forgetting to tell my husband to make sure to use a liner...  Oops!  </li>
            <li>Obviously, they have removed some of the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>I have been a faithful user of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it still wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived in good condition before the promised date and is about the same price as what I ordered through my pharmacy even with the shipping.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a sweet smelling cream.</li>
            <li>It has a slightly sweet smell that I don&#x27;t mind, and that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t need to buy more very soon</li>
            <li>Even an 1/8 of a teaspoon overpowered a full batch (10 oz).  </li>
            <li>This is a nice soft lanolin.</li>
            <li>Then I smear it on my feet, wrap my feet in cellophane wrap and the next day my tootsies are gorgeous, not a callus in sight.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell try melting it together with a 1/3 oil (jojoba or almond are good choices), 1/3 bees wax, 1/3 lanolin and a couple drops of essential oil you like.</li>
            <li>and it goes on SO much better and soaks in MUCH faster-</li>
            <li>The smell dissipates after a while - it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>smells earthy but not a bad smell to me</li>
            <li>It smells like Lanolin should and its not a bad smell by any means.</li>
            <li>I wanted the more unrefined version so that it would contain a higher variety of natural lipids that would more closely mimic my skin&#x27;s variety of lipids.  </li>
            <li>Great price compared to some other brands.</li>
            <li>Beware this is PURE lanolin!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m re-ordering this one after trying the pharmaceutical and plain lanolin, this option works just fine and is a great price.  </li>
            <li>But I either got used to the smell really quickly</li>
            <li>Super sticky and smelly.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>had I been pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it works ideally.</li>
            <li>of time my dog and I are very sensitive about some scent, but my dog seems ok with this one</li>
            <li>We used this initially as a diaper cream, better than any of the creams out there!  </li>
            <li>have also been using this daily on a new surgical scar, and it seems to be doing a great job of healing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s been in the fridge magic happens and it gets solid and stays that way, but stays easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>, i had started drinking sea salt water and my lips became very dry, nothing was working, so I found good reviews on lanolin.</li>
            <li>Smells a little sheepy but is a great price for a lot of lanolin.</li>
            <li>Hope you will enjoy as much as I am.</li>
            <li>HANDS ARE MUCH SOFTER AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li>It even helps calm the unbearable itching.</li>
            <li>Totally amazing-- the only thing that would soothe my lips when I was on Accutane.</li>
            <li>So amazing on your skin -- especially dry/cracked hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with lansinoh which has no scent and is clear, Much better than this.</li>
            <li>The ratio of glycerin to lanolin will determine it&#x27;s heaviness, use the lanolin sparingly if you want light, add more for a deep penetrating foot</li>
            <li>What I purchased it for is to lanolize wool diaper covers, and so far, I have been extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a smell worth worrying about.</li>
            <li>It has the same ingredients, so it&#x27;s kind of a mystery to me.</li>
            <li>, my girlfriend likes it, her friend who had dinner with us last night (this lady is into fashion and has her hair styled) liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Smooth and stretchy, lanolin can be used in place of petroleum jelly and is thicker and more solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m going for some kind of a scent purified lanolin.</li>
            <li>It also has a distinct smell, which took me about a week to get used to.</li>
            <li>What I do is to find a good but not too costly liquid moisturizing product and stir this in until the thick stuff becomes more malleable.</li>
            <li>The salve is greasy but it works and is safe and natural.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth a try.</li>
            <li>I make my own facial lotion with Lanolin and Shea butter, also 1/3 of water.</li>
            <li>so far after 10 applications over 3 days, my eczema fingers getting better.</li>
            <li>Sticky for 5-10 minutes until absorbed, then no need to apply lotion all day.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of drag and it not greasy.</li>
            <li>good quality and just what i expected</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>To me, it just smells earthy, not dirty.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a very convenient container and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Like others have said, this lanolin has a distinct odor</li>
            <li>But after mixing it with other oils and ingredients it really worked great.</li>
            <li>but after about an hour nap it soaks right in with no residue or oily feel.</li>
            <li>My nose doesn&#x27;t smell it unless I put my hand right up to my nose.  </li>
            <li>, it works, and it is priced right.  </li>
            <li>I supposed it is a very pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li>fast  fast ,love this product really hydrate the skin</li>
            <li>Once you get past the smell, you&#x27;ll realize what a great product it is.</li>
            <li>wanted to use more pure and natural organic products but shea butter, coconut oil and lanolin</li>
            <li>However, as I went through it, I found a large piece of plastic in the tub!</li>
            <li>it is inexpensive, great product for several different types of usage.  </li>
            <li>It is super smelly but it does the job really well.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly like lanolin as I would expect from a natural product.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the smell is not \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; nor like heavily fragranced lotions and cosmetic skin applications, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if this works better than others, but I really like that it is one natural ingredient.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt the fluffy cute sheepies at all, so even the most snooty of vegans and vegetarians should probably shut up and slap this stuff on your skin.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, this Now brand melts so much better and STAYS melted better than the stuff in the tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healing for pretty much anything and mixes well with coconut oil and/or essential oils to make our own salves.</li>
            <li>within a week her bottom is smooth and clear!</li>
            <li>With this lanolin my recipe turned out great and for the first time my daughter actually tanned instead of getting red and sunburned.</li>
            <li>Other said this product has a sheep smell, which I kind of agree with but for the price it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great deal and an excellent product, and with only half the tub empty after 4 months of daily use I can imagine I will continue to get a lot of use out of one tub.</li>
            <li>But its a great replacement for the processed petroleum jelly/mineral oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation, unlike its petrolatum counterparts, its hard to wash away with water.</li>
            <li>Keeps them more resilient and makes them last longer.</li>
            <li>I applied Lanolin on it and the rashes looked so much better the next day.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>So many different things were tried, including homemade remedies, doctor visits, steroids (ugh).  </li>
            <li>It takes some doing to get it mixed but if warmed up first it mixes much better.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I am expecting my first child in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t into it, but now I like the thickness of it.  </li>
            <li>Feels oily at first</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off the first time I wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural, light smell.  </li>
            <li>And we have recently ordered 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I use a dab of it on my hand eczema, which works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it claims to be.  </li>
            <li>If I rub it in pretty well</li>
            <li>This is also the first thing that goes on my lips as soon as I&#x27;m out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The Lanolin, however, is exactly what was wanted &amp; does what I need.</li>
            <li>If I had the money I would buy this for every pretty girl I saw so they would stay that way longer.</li>
            <li>This system  works even if I didn&#x27;t take a bath first.</li>
            <li>Not only does it moisturize more, but it also does a MUCH better job at protecting lips and skin from damage such as wind burn.</li>
            <li>I bought this to make some foot balm (to emulate &amp;#34;bag balm&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>This is my first time to purchase lanolin</li>
            <li>It is really smelly!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Very sticky!</li>
            <li>First ever buying Now product.</li>
            <li>Ok enough.  </li>
            <li>It does smell a bit barnyardy which I&#x27;m ok with, especially when used at home or before bed.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes okay, but definitely has a smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a better value than buying purified lanolin, especially if  you need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I experimented with putting a dollop onto a saucer and warming in the microwave first</li>
            <li>Actually have used sheep lanolin for years to help my skin stay in top shape.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t stinky, exactly.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Rub it on and put a pair of old socks on my hands and in the morning skin, nails, cuticles are all smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Made my creams come out super smooth and extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I compounded a tbs of this with 3 drops of tea tree oil and a few drops of water to help with the smell and to make it smoother/thinner to spread more easily.</li>
            <li>Workd very well, also works well on my face if I keep it away from the oily area right around my nose.</li>
            <li>I think there are other brands that smell more mildly.  </li>
            <li>It really lasts and penetrates and somehow does give the same &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling that many moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>I am kind of tired of people who are so concerned with how they smell as if a product can make them smell better.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve every ordered/used pure lanolin before.  </li>
            <li>It is pure, with almost no scent, consistent in thickness, and does not have any added products, byproducts, or dirt.</li>
            <li>Item is exactly what it says, a tub of pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>it has a very strong lanolin smell but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li>It is very, very sticky, too much so for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i would recommend buying this in its pure state and not the other kind that has fragrance as those are diluted with water.</li>
            <li>after this positive exprience, I will continue buying Now products &amp; products sold by Nature and Herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much prefered over the frilly frill type pretty smelling lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sticky when you first apply it</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty intense.</li>
            <li>Also, smells really natural, stinky but not a bad stinky.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, coming from someone that is very familiar with lanolin, there is nothing strange about the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>It worked well, but has a strong lanoline smell, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking for the same purpose.</li>
            <li>Definitely has the strong lanolin smell, but it works.</li>
            <li>Certainly hope it&#x27;s not part of the ingredients as that wouldn&#x27;t be pure 100% lanolin.</li>
            <li>It is the pure lanolin I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>We use pure lanolin for all types of skin issues from eczema, to cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for pure lanolin to wash wool diaper covers.  </li>
            <li>This product is pure and well priced</li>
            <li>I mix it with pure cocoa butter</li>
            <li>My wife and I decided to try 100% pure lanolin as our baby kept getting rashes even with Desitin.  </li>
            <li>It is darker and I&#x27;m assuming because it&#x27;s pure and it smells like lanolin, so if you&#x27;re looking for some type of pleasing scent</li>
            <li>Just the smell and texture of this tells you that it is pure and does not have petroleum byproducts in it.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Pure lanolin is pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li>, It does have a certain smell</li>
            <li>The smell is trivial, unless you are using it on a large area, you won&#x27;t notice a thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure lanolin and worked well in my mustache wax recipe (50/50 lanolin and beeswax).</li>
            <li>This is really pure lanolin and has to be heated to liquify for use.  </li>
            <li>Pure lanolin, no alcohol, fragrance etc.</li>
            <li>It is 100% pure, so it does have what I like to call a &#x27;sheepy&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is as moisturizing as pure lanolin</li>
            <li>its pure and its a legit product.</li>
            <li>Seems completely pure.</li>
            <li>I used the pure stuff to sleep with.</li>
            <li>Finding pure lanolin is not the easiest thing to do</li>
            <li>So i searched for pure lanolin and this is it.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pure lanolin and</li>
            <li>I have used pure lanolin before, but in liquid form.</li>
            <li>I found that if I use pure lanolin on my hands (which is why I bought this product) then wash with a scented handsoap, the smell is no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lanolin, and it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why it smells this way if it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
            <li>what pure lanolin was like</li>
            <li>I was really struck by how much this smells, stays pungent even after application,  and really not suitable for chapped lips or hands, but heels probably a good choice, as the smell sticks around.  </li>
            <li>Smells a little like sheep on its own.</li>
            <li>The plastic surgeon told me the best thing for dry skin is plain old lanolin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product - reasonable price - add a little to regular lotion to add to the moisturizing effects of the lotion.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells a bit, and yes it is also a bit greasy until it absorbs, but it REALLY helps my hands.</li>
            <li>really a multi-use product</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>A very stout skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use it straight for hands and feet.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff, and it really works.</li>
            <li>This has been a very satisfactory substitute.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is very dense lanolin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I had to experiment with the amount I used on my hands and now know how much to apply.  </li>
            <li>Just getting ready to re order.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m supposed to be doing with it</li>
            <li>and it really masked the smell</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product has really helped with chapped skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>He would prefer that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a sheep&#x27;s butt, but it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s sniffing himself a whole lot seeing as he&#x27;s immersed in water.</li>
            <li>it has performed as expected in all of those tasks. :)</li>
            <li>In 15 minutes, lanolin is absorbed completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>Very smoothing.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use in my home made hair moisturizer it works really well to help my hair retain moisture.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It does have a smell to it, not overpowering, but very persistent.</li>
            <li>But very think must be moisturizing</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my very sore nipples (breastfeeding).</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for my wool diaper covers and do really like it.</li>
            <li>I probably just added too much of it and need to re-proportion my ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well with my combination</li>
            <li>If lanolin works, it so much cheaper than doctor specialist co-pay.</li>
            <li>Intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I much prefer it to petrochemiccal based lip</li>
            <li>The lotion is very moisturizing but it is also VERY stinky (like a sheep).</li>
            <li>Its def the real stuff.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me too much since I used it at bedtime</li>
            <li>I  bought this because it eas much cheeper.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really heard that my husband loves it but also hasn&#x27;t said he hates it.</li>
            <li>It smells like a bandaid really.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.</li>
            <li>no matter how much i moisturize.</li>
            <li>so I was very suprised at this one.</li>
            <li>This is pure but not ultra-purified lanoline, I&#x27;ve used Lansinosh first and in comparison this is slightly heavier and smellier, but it&#x27;s a better product and a better-priced product per ounce than store-bought varieties (like CVS).</li>
            <li>As the other reviews have stated it does have a chemically smell to it, but so does most pure lanolin.</li>
            <li>This has so many uses, but primarily we use it with other ingredients mixed together as a burn ointment.  </li>
            <li>I have had other Lanolin products that went on smooth and was absorbed, but not this one.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been very happy with how long it stays on my skin and like the fact that it is pure and mixed with a lot of other chemicals whose effect on my skin is unclear.</li>
            <li>son&#x27;s diaper rash (works better than any other cream I have used.  </li>
            <li>This lanolin is softer and more pungent than the other brands I have tried but seems to work well.</li>
            <li>10x cheaper then most other options</li>
            <li>I also use this product for diaper rashes, it cleaned up my daughters rash much better than any other products.</li>
            <li>or full of synthetic crap that can do more harm that good.</li>
            <li>I usually buy austrailian gold lanolin which is a bit more anhydrous, has more clarity, thicker, and fragrance free (very slight laolin scent).  </li>
            <li>I have a skin condition similar to psoriasis and, so far, pure lanolin seems to be the only natural treatment that does any good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cruelty-free, natural, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Nothing better than lanolin for treating dry, natural rawhide drum heads, like congas, bongos, etc.</li>
            <li>This one is very soft and smooth but doesn&#x27;t quite work the same.</li>
            <li>The true test will come once I start breastfeeding regularly.</li>
            <li>cool for a bit, pop it in the fridge (essential) overnight and then take out and use.  </li>
            <li>I melted it gently over the stove to make my swimmer&#x27;s cream, and the product became clear, indicating it is also quite pure in that it contains no undissolved solids.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t Live without it!  </li>
            <li>Now Solutions 7oz pure lanolin is a greater value and the same thick, \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; texture as Lansinoh, but it does have a strong smell and amber color.</li>
            <li>I live on the east coast in PA, and the winter air here is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>I find it works better and those who mind the smell may find this less offensive.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for extremely dry skin (e.g., feet area).</li>
            <li>Lanolin gets absorbed completely into the skin in an hour or so, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It is a must for nursing mothers, particularly with a newborn.  </li>
            <li>And further, many purchased creams don&#x27;t give a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>I pay particular attention to my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up, my hands are soft and supple and feel comfortable and moisturized throughout the day, even after several washings.</li>
            <li>However, your issue may be different and for the reasonable price, I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin, this product works really well.</li>
            <li>The pure lanolin I ordered was just as I expected it to be, and much cheaper than the brands available in stores near me, even with the shipping charges.</li>
            <li>It leaves your  hair very soft!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality lanolin, and it smells just like it should.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as high of quality as is used in Lasinoh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend mixing this into homemade lotions for eczema.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, I highly prefer this product.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend just warming it a bit.</li>
            <li>This is a much better option and only slightly more expensive which I feel is worth it for the convenience.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit gives full coverage, and you can apply it right over your regular lip color.</li>
            <li>Jason Natural Cosmetics Pure Beauty Oil, 5,000 IU Vitamin E Oil - 4 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like good quality lanolin, and a little bit goes a long way on your hands and feet in the winter.</li>
            <li>and it really heals his paw specially during the rough winter season.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow this stuff really protects your skin.  </li>
            <li>very efficient but wow...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that my LO didn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much as I did.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer on your lips than normal gloss does.</li>
            <li>This smells totally normal.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re such a good company, usually.</li>
            <li>Cetaphill was probably the best, but I noticed that when I apply it(not only Cetaphill but all the mentioned) they create a temporary smooth feeling that disappear with the first     wash,  or when my hand are again in contact with the cold weather, and then I have to keep re-applying again and again many times during the day for a mediocre result (beside the     chemical involved)  Lanolin:    </li>
            <li>I use it on dry, cracked skin and it looks so much better the next day.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have been using lanolin for the last year and it keeps my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>This is version is great for spreading on the body, and less messy.</li>
            <li>Great product - I need only small sweet pea size for wool soaker, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Bought 2 on first round and back for two more.</li>
            <li>I originally tried 1oz Lansinoh lanolin, which is devoid of smell or color.</li>
            <li>This is a new product for me, with using is for my hair</li>
            <li>We use a grape sized glob with new covers.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live with out lanolin while I was breastfeeding my boy.  </li>
            <li>seal on bottle intact, i.e., new product.</li>
            <li>Just have to live with it.  </li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and it has made my skin look so ashy</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product in smaller sizes, and recently discovered it was available in 7 oz size.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing lanolin from local stores for breastfeeding and it was more money and a whole lot less product.  </li>
            <li>If the smell of lanolin bothers you, you may want to go with the really expensive kind, such as Lansinoh, or maybe a perfumed kind, such as Pure and Simple New Zealand.  </li>
            <li>my skin stays very soft for days after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use a lot of products.</li>
            <li>However has a very natural barn&#x27;ish smell.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for dry hands and prefer it over lotions and salves as it generally works better even without the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>lanolin in general is very viscous, but it spreads easily once applied and slightly warmed by body heat.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy this product in my local pharmacy at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>If you soak your feet first, you only have to do this once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>even when mixed with other ingredients, so its (in my opinion) better for a bedtime lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is the first (prescribed or otherwise) to actually heal the rashes.</li>
            <li>Smells a little strong but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and you can&#x27;t get more pure than 100%.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product curious as to what it would smell like, being familiar with sheep smell, having handled sheep and bundled wool after shearing, and it is one of my least favorite aromas from childhood.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would softer but, apparently, lanolin in it&#x27;s pure state is more on the hard side.  </li>
            <li>In less than 2 months the skin on my feet is now completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Further, once applied, it lasts for a long time, even after washing dishes my hands are still hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t run in hot weather, and it had good lubricity in the cold.</li>
            <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything outside of a usual lanolin smell.</li>
            <li>and the smell isn&#x27;t that strong when on dried wool diaper cover.</li>
            <li>It may be a good product, but I&#x27;ve never used it long enough to tell how effective it is on my skin because the smell is so bad.</li>
            <li>I used it to make a body cream and even a large amount of essential oil and aloe gel couldn&#x27;t over power the smell.</li>
            <li>as explained in other reviews, this one is this cheap because it&#x27;s unprocessed, meaning, for lanolin, that it is very efficient, but oh my this thing stink like an old forgotten drawer in a house with humidity problems!!</li>
            <li>Very thick and effective on moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and low smell.</li>
            <li>Have used other brands that do not have such a strong smell</li>
            <li>I also found that the smell is not as bad as many have made is sound!</li>
            <li>Also great to put around your nose when you have a cold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am surprised that no one else has mentioned mixing this with NOW Coco Butter.</li>
            <li>My skin recently developed some rashes.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Australian Lanolin that is also sold on this site.</li>
            <li>If you dilute it to 1/2 tsp per gallon of water with a scented wool wash, you don&#x27;t really notice anything different.</li>
            <li>It helps to keeps my hands soft and prevents drying.  </li>
            <li>I guess you&#x27;ve got to be an old person like me to sniff this product and automatically think--</li>
            <li>I think the modern bandages just don&#x27;t have the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I AM A FREQUENT HAND</li>
            <li>Used this to precondition and old baseball glove and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>Very sticky, even turned my gloves yellow.</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep my hands and feet soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>but after few minutes my hands are silky smooth for hours (or until I wash the dishes again).</li>
            <li>If you want to stay young longer then you NEED this now.</li>
            <li>(if you&#x27;ve ever got stuff directly from a farm, you would know that this can be a problem).  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I was surprised when i opened the container-</li>
            <li>Some might break out from it, but so far, for me, I have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell.</li>
            <li>as natural lanolin does.  </li>
            <li>that was an unexpected surprise.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it was all natural, no dies or fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it has residual pesticides in it from the cleaning of sheep&#x27;s wool before processing it to take out the oils &#x3D;</li>
            <li>This is definitely what he was looking for to keep his skin from flaking and peeling so much, and one weekly application is all he&#x27;s asked for, done after cleaning, drying, and applying antifungal ointment.</li>
            <li>but I have used it directly on my lips.</li>
            <li>The odor was like old duplicate receipt paper chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wax naturally produced by sheep to make their fleeces waterproof, and is extracted during the routine sheering and wool treating process.</li>
            <li>Your body needs natural lipids to maintain moisture, and this stuff is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also really like having a jar I can just dip my finger in rather than a tube that requires two hands; anyone will a newborn knows that anything you can do one handed is a big bonus!</li>
            <li>I have used about 4 so far and each has</li>
            <li>Not in that it smells like dirt, but it has a &#x27;natural,&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit like a wet dog to me but the comfort of having my baby suck on my hands after I put it on and not worry about toxic chemicals is worth the smell factor.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and you only need a tad bit which goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and makes me nauseated, but I have a very sensitive stomach, so that may not be the case with everyone</li>
            <li>So much less expensive than the tiny tube lanolin; great for first weeks of nursing, and on baby&#x27;s bottom--starting to use it on super dry feet or elbows.  </li>
            <li>After that just usual lotion-like application works fine.</li>
            <li>Lanolin has a particular smell its that simple.</li>
            <li>The smell is tolerable, as long as the product is not applied over large areas on body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very thick texture with a distinct mild smell.</li>
            <li>Pure lanolin has been one of only two things that can relieve this and keep my hands soft (the other is pure Emu oil).</li>
            <li>Product just as described in description and other reviewers were right, has a smell</li>
            <li>I would liken it to the smell of a high quality pair of leather boots, or the smell whenever I walk into the local Merrell outlet.</li>
            <li>If you have really dry, cracked heels, fingers, or elbows (or if you are a new nursing mom), I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Used on several different skin ailments, all with positive results.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for keeping my hands soft during these brutal winter months.  </li>
            <li>And since the smell bother me, I wear some cheap cotton gloves, take them off in the morning and do my usual work.</li>
            <li>Takes too long to apply, but works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>The quality is exactly what I expected....</li>
            <li>I decided to try Now Foods Pure Lanolin because my hands get so dry and crack.  </li>
            <li>My husband, on the other hand, is not so appreciative of picking up our baby who smells like a little tiny sheep.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with smelling like wet sheep for a little bit.</li>
            <li>You can mix this with a few other products that are natural and make it smell better.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with dry cracking skin.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I can&#x27;t keep up with her changes, so this product really keeps the wool resistant and keeps her clothes dry as well.</li>
            <li>his dry skin is gone, you really have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li>(Also tried Balmex - our daily go-to, Triple paste, Aquaphor, and butt-paste (our least favorite)).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick but you can rub on skin easily.</li>
            <li>I have a very old compensating Euphonium that I especially rely on lanolin for.</li>
            <li>I rub the lanolin/oil mixture on my hands &amp; feet at night and the next morning, they are very soft and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I once purchased a one pound bag of lanolin, and while it was a little cheaper, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to dig it out of it&#x27;s plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>Lanolin presents a thick weight heavy moisturizer that stays on lips, works really well even with only a light coating, can help speed healing, and is fantastic for extremely dry/cracked</li>
            <li>The texture is the same, but Lansinoh is clear and odorless.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like it sinks in and has really healed my skin.</li>
            <li>and this is the only purely natural product I can find.</li>
            <li>so I use natural products as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>I have to heat it with a hairdryer to make it soft enough to apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li>After a short time, you get used to the natural odor of this lanolin.</li>
            <li>Some people seem to be extra sensitive or something.</li>
            <li>No worries on harmful ingredients such as petroleum/petrolatums, this is 100% natural from the wool of those cuddly sheep.</li>
            <li>Most lip balms really do not go a great job at protecting and moisturizing lips for an extended time after application.</li>
            <li>It costs far less than comparable options, and it really works.</li>
            <li>I gave it a chance, and used it on my badly dried hands and feet overnight, and it works much better than any of the hand or foot creams I previously used.  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick, slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; until rubbed on your hands.  </li>
            <li>It works much better (the way it rubs in, the slight stickiness and the added &#x27;volume&#x27;), and it feels much less greasy, especially after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I ordered this since it was more lanolin for the same price or less than other products, and disregarded the reviews about the smell because of it, but after opening the container I can tell you this stuff definitely smells like a barnyard</li>
            <li>I bought little screw top containers at Walmart (in the travel toiletries isle, came in a pack of two) and scooped it into the little containers</li>
            <li>While I use this as a lip balm, lanolin can be used on other parts of the skin in need of intense moisturizers plus protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus Its much cheaper than the other kinds.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this before I spent way too much on another product that works just the same.</li>
            <li>Regardless of what I      do and what the temperature is,  my hands stay smooth with no such senseless thick layer anymore.</li>
            <li>We use it as a natural diaper cream that works like no other, for dry hands, the children&#x27;s owies and for lanolizing their woolies to make them water resistant.  </li>
            <li>Looked everywhere for pure lanolin, the only thing that works for my little guys frequent diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little \\&quot;sheepish\\&quot;</li>
            <li>this product has been great for healing my hands between outbreaks of dyshidrotic eczema (unfortunately still need a prescription to tame that)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never felt this soft before even using other natural oils.</li>
            <li>My dad is a shepherd and this has a very faint scent of sheep but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Use it on my baby who suffers from extremely dry skin and eczema right after her bath and and her skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We have been using pure lanolin for our babies&#x27; bottoms for over 4 months now, and they have less rashes.  </li>
            <li>The other more expensive brands must do something to take the pure lanolin color away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for small jobs.</li>
            <li>Not as &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; as other lanolins; therefore, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So applied Lanolin on my bad looking hands and feet, and i have to say that after first time my hands look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I immediately rubbed a small amount on my left knee which had been scaly and whitish from being chapped and the next day was much improved and the following day looked almost normal.  </li>
            <li>You only need a little bit too, so the jar has lasted quite a long time; and I STILL have more than half left!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick and smells kind of like vaseline, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It is a very thick substance, that moisturizes extraordinarily well!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to other nurses, medical personnel, farmers, or anyone constantly exposed to the outdoors or chemicals on their hands.</li>
            <li>IMO, Nothing natural works as well as lanolin for soothing and moisturizing very dry, chapped skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sink in quickly at all, so this is definitely a product where a little goes a long way and to use it only on tougher, dry areas or as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>Good product, a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because I really prefer \\&quot;hydrous\\&quot; lanolin (which has water mixed in and is a little easier to use)</li>

            <li> my husband has diabetes, i bought this for him and it works great,</li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is also great at moisturizing my cuticles, the ends of my hair, my feet, chapped lips, knees, and elbows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to waterproof baby clothing.  </li>
            <li> Love this lanolin!!  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very handy in the shop, too.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been amazing from lanolozing wool, to treating cracked skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> As many have pointed out, this is the best for cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on her tender, stuffy nose to protect it from too many tissues - awesome.      </li>
            <li> I used this to make my own tanning lotion!  </li>
            <li> Good quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> This a good company and this Lanolin is a great quality.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest smell, but if you can get over it, it&#x27;s so much better of a value than the lansinoh nipple cream.  </li>
            <li> Very nice lanolin at a good price and quantity.</li>
            <li> Some people find the smell pleasant, good for them.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality lanolin at a super price!</li>
            <li> Great stuff for an amazing price, and</li>
            <li> Great product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Good product, and I have been using it for months since I started breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> but this is a good price</li>
            <li> Good seller.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that smells good, I&#x27;d suggest trying shea butter or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Good lanolin.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, my face feels good and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It may not smell good</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good product....</li>
            <li> Good packAging.  </li>
            <li> Good quality for good price.</li>
            <li> good for the hands, diaper rash, anti-sieze of threads on a bolt, boat building.</li>
            <li> lanolin is good.</li>
            <li> Good Thank.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> This is a good alternative, but for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on skin/in skincare.</li>
            <li> , this is a good product.</li>
            <li> and it covered the &amp;#34;barnyardiness&amp;#34; fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good product, and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Will probably stick with this brand as it is a good price and the convenience of ordering it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lost track of a source for it until I discovered a wonderful company called Amazon that has just about everything in the world available and I started using it again.</li>
            <li> good product but not what needed.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on earth and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased and used &amp;#34;now products&amp;#34; before and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Im sure it works great, but i CANNOT get over the smell of lanolin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works great</li>
            <li> I am elated that I decided to purchase this product and I am sure it will be a great addition to my products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but I had no idea</li>
            <li> Not the most pleasant smell, but doable, and a good protectant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, can&#x27;t beat the price for lanolin - works great, and is nice and clean</li>
            <li> those darn things are magic!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li> I love lanolin!</li>
            <li> She hasnt been able to find anything (before this) that didnt sting or irritate her bottom until this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Little did I know that I would use this for so much more!  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to put in a liner!  </li>
            <li> Excellent value &amp; fast shipper!</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first but the product works great baby doesn&#x27;t mind the smell at all!</li>
            <li> feels fine, performs great.</li>
            <li> Its pure lanolin and works wonderfully for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> This was a great price and a large quantity making this a great buy.</li>
            <li> This is truly amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The price for this is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lanolin is amazing.</li>
            <li> the price is amazing</li>
            <li> I soften it with warm vegetable oil and add spice, scent or color as needed for my use.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d be in for when the product arrived.  </li>
            <li> Nice, creamy lanolin.  </li>
            <li> What a nice product.</li>
            <li> Mostly they smell good, but</li>
            <li> I am sure it would not be good for everyone.</li>
            <li> I cut it with coconut oil, beeswax, honey, and rosemary oil for a nice lip balm for daytime use.</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my own tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I am using it to make my own hand lotion and this will meet my purposes</li>
            <li> Warm both of them and measure</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own smell and color.</li>
            <li> My hope was that this would put an end to the perpetual fight I am having with my own skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best skin cream: relatively light and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It smells like putrified machine oil, and the odor is very strong.  </li>
            <li> VERY strong.  </li>
            <li> It works perfectly and 100% natural!</li>
            <li> Now Pure Lanolin is a very good quality.</li>
            <li> We have been using lanolin for years to heal cuts and scrapes - especially good for young children.</li>
            <li> It has excellent natural tackiness, and sticks well to metal surfaces.</li>
            <li> Best price so far.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> Lanolin is a great emollient, although it is sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell great in larger quantities.  </li>
            <li> I love it, especially a greater substitution for vaseline (petroleum) that my wife used to use on her self &amp; our young daughter.</li>
            <li> I am starting to make my own skin care products and through some research discovered that lanolin would be great for a lip balm!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell that great.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the price it great for 7oz.</li>
            <li> It dissolves well in hot water and makes for a great lotion on my hands afterwards.  </li>
            <li> After 9 months, I still have a mostly full container, so economically-speaking, this is good.</li>
            <li> But for me, this is fantastic, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Now pure Lanolin is great.</li>
            <li> There are a number of collercial industrial lubes and gun lubes that use lanolin as an additive, but the pure stuff works great, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that they could be whipped together to produce such a delicious feeling cream that is super effective.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it and it lives up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> Its effect is like magic.</li>
            <li> This way I don&#x27;t mistakenly eat Lanolin (though it is safe to be ingested)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> This product is actually better than the nipple cream I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> Vastly better than any store bought, petroleum based, perfumed creams.</li>
            <li> great- smells nice, keeps the wool soft and water-resistant.  </li>
            <li> I tried many many brands of lotion to relieve this problem.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, even including shipping, this was at a better price than I used to get buying it at a nearby store.</li>
            <li> Many reviews harp on the smell.</li>
            <li> It sure beats lansinoh for $10 for 2 oz.  </li>
            <li> way better than desitin.</li>
            <li> Besides who is smelling your kids bum or your udders anyways? :-)</li>
            <li> Better than any chapstick or lip balm.</li>
            <li> but then it soaks in and works it&#x27;s magic.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the product (just as described) and the transaction went very well.</li>
            <li> If you apply it an hour or so before bedtime, most of it will soak in before retiring or you can wear cotton gloves to bed.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this is as well.</li>
            <li> I love the NOW brand and their lanolin does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Most people buy lanolin as a skin cream, but I find that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff and have gotten it for my family as gifts.</li>
            <li> This has solved many winter skin problems for me.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t found anything better for soothing winter skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need more chemicals</li>
            <li> Not completely terrible...</li>
            <li> I love using this.</li>
            <li> But it does feel better in the morning, but it seems you can&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> If you plan on using it on more exposed areas of your skin during the day I would pick a odorless pharmaceutical grade lanolin instead.</li>
            <li> and now they stopped buying it and ask me to make some more for them</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after lanolin has soaked in.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil does an okay job with the smell</li>
            <li> Works so much better than any chap stick or lip balm on the market.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> You can get more processed lanolin that doesn&#x27;t have the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could mix it with something else to help mask the smell</li>
            <li> sons love this for chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> much better value than any thing out there</li>
            <li> Sure - it goes on like axel grease...</li>
            <li> This is the very best out of a dozen different ointments for the bottom I have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more soothing, rubs in better and protects more.</li>
            <li> Feet feels already better and smoother too!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave a non-polar protective layer on top of damaged skin.  </li>
            <li> The liquid lanolin from Now Foods has a more tolerable odor.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> Maybe a more liquid one of those would work better, maybe not.</li>
            <li> I mix this with shea butter, coconut oil and argan oil and whip it to a lovely creamy texture that is a pleasure to apply.  </li>
            <li> better than bengay.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a liquid was a desent price compared to most.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what others use it for :)</li>
            <li> (ok.. a lot..)</li>
            <li> :) will buy again and some stronger soap scent.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an oil like substance, but this is more like a wax.</li>
            <li> Once I was getting the dryness under control, I mixed it with some smelly lotion and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> Great but really stinky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema for most of my life.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> My hands have improved but I&#x27;m hoping for better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it on Amazon for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this lanolin so much better than the tube of &amp;#34;nipple cream&amp;#34; you buy in stores.  </li>
            <li> ok ok</li>
            <li> I love this product but my husband thinks I smell like a barn when I wear it.</li>
            <li> It works great and ye sit smells, but it smells like real lanolin.</li>
            <li> Great for work roughened hands and really has some staying power.</li>
            <li> It smells like the real thing too (aka sheep)! :P  </li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works excellent if left on overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the best and most practical way to use this product is at night and to cover the area of use, if possible.  </li>
            <li> I had to use dish soap and the scratchy side of a sponge to get most of it off my fingers from opening the jar.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice and pure product.</li>
            <li> I love it and this brand is really ez to work with and it smells good too:)</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff you can get to relieve dry hands and lips.</li>
            <li> It made a creamy salve that is perfect for dry chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product that helped manage severely dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the smell which was very mild and kind of pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for chapped lips or dry hands.  </li>
            <li> so it could be more easily applied while keeping it sterile.</li>
            <li> It works best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my babies dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t smell good maybe you should bath more and use/eat more natural products.</li>
            <li> Great Natural product for the world.</li>
            <li> perfect for my rough heels</li>
            <li> This is a great natural additive to lotions to make them thicker and to lock moisture into the skin</li>
            <li> It keeps the wool soft and water-resistant- great for my daughter because she pees A LOT.</li>
            <li> This is a good price on this much Lanolin.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This product is good lanolin, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how much you get and not so easy to melt into your skin as another brand I&#x27;ve gotten.  </li>
            <li> Great for skin, thanks for quick shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars since I&#x27;ve not used or ordered lanolin before, however, I did order other products from this company and they were all excellent quality</li>
            <li> I noticed in the AM that it was not something that washed off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I know lanolin is supposed to have a strong scent</li>
            <li> This tub doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and has the consistency of lanolin in the tubes I had purchased before.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong...</li>
            <li> It smells like lanolin- not too strong in my opinion, and not too refined either.  </li>
            <li> What I did not expect is it has a fairly strong odor when I made it into lotion.</li>
            <li> but oh boy the smell is strong.  </li>
            <li> Maybe some people will think it&#x27;s strong like my husband.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong at all</li>
            <li> This lanolin is just as good at a far better price.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with Now Pure Lanolin.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully for that, and the price was right, definitely!  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this 7oz tub of lanolin (more or less 1 cup) to &amp;#34;lanolize&amp;#34; wool diapers for my baby, which it is perfect for.  </li>
            <li> Given the thickness of the lanolin, I&#x27;ve found coconut oil to work best in thinning this down to a consistency that will spread and absorb easily.  </li>
            <li> 2) moisturizer for the hands, face, feet, anywhere; 3) great moisturizer for the eyelids and around the eyes in general....</li>
            <li> We personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, (admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a rose garden, but it does work great which for us, makes it totally worth the trade off.)  </li>
            <li> It has kind of an earthy odor, so be aware of that.</li>
            <li> - this has been the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> The best for moisturizing my hair when I mix with other oils!</li>
            <li> It has a very mild lanolin aroma and is smooth and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells fine (like lanolin, but not at all offensive),</li>
            <li> If you already work with sheep or cows, it might be fine for you.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper than another one I got and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> brand/purple container before which worked fine but was about $10/oz</li>
            <li> My jar of lanoline was a thicker consistency than described, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> but Argan oil seems to absorb onto my skin more quickly than the lanolin because I&#x27;m just mixing it in my hands.  </li>
            <li> It melts really nice in hot water, and covers whole diaper cover nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a more natural, golden color and a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is really nice pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> Schmearing this stuff on my fingers and leaving on overnight (with gloves) has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It is nearly water proof and provides excellent lubrication and corrosion protection on the bronze turnbuckles on my 44 year old Morgan 24</li>
            <li> I was using Lansinoh Lanolin to lanolize my wool diaper covers at a huge cost difference.</li>
            <li> I will be using it to winterize my feet and my dogs paws, but will need fragrance free for hands and lips.</li>
            <li> product heals chapped/cracked/sore lips fast and gives a really nice shine to them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still available....</li>
            <li> i use lanolin to keep my heels smooth, and to keep my hands from drying out during winter    you can buy 2oz of processed lanolin, with the smell removed for about $15    </li>
            <li> Hydrous lanolin does not seem to be available anywhere at all.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> but it is what our skin needs to stay smooth.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic to avoid chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Great product and will definitely last for awhile.</li>
            <li> A great for moisturing hands/feet especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Once it melts, it goes well with oils such as jojoba, avocado oil, apricot oil and works great to hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> not something I was comfortable putting in my son&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I also put some on my hands, feels smooth as well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and is so much cheaper than using the popular nipple cream.</li>
            <li> It is great and I will stocking up on it as this condition can only be controlled but it never goes away.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic for my mechanics hands after a day in the shop and for my feet after a day running around barefoot.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Obviously isn&#x27;t for use on nipples for breastfeeding but works great for lanolizing wool diaper covers or garments.</li>
            <li> The mixture leaves a light waxy film on my skin, preventing the clay from sucking all the moisture out of my skin.</li>
            <li> We also are users of Eucerin, Aquaphor, and good old petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> I have good skin naturally</li>
            <li> Our skin looked so good after being all day at the pool everyone was surprised.</li>
            <li> It can be used to keep leather soft and good.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job keeping them moving easily and lasts a long time without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> Sure it smells if you stick your nose right up to the jar - it is oil secreted by sheep, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> A very nice lanolin that, when used in lip balm, yields a lasting, creamy experience that leaves lips silky and kissable.</li>
            <li> It is a mild, natural, wooly and pleasant smell.    </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Pure Lanolin!  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY the best option for dry, wrinkly, cracked skin etc</li>
            <li> Pretty sure that shouldn&#x27;t have been in there.</li>
            <li> Any nursing mom is probably familiar with the scent.</li>
            <li> Lanoline definitely has excellent benefits, but I most likely will never use the majority of the contents of this tub because of the downsides.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> And I love that there are no scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for and will buy more.  </li>
            <li> Lanolin is really great for dry skin, and I use it for a foot massage every night.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great for eczema patches, dry skin, even chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> I love having it handy, and have used it for the following purposes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> Great value, works well for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> It is also great for dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> but omg feels great on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very strong sense of smell and am highly allergic to perfumes, chemical-y smells, etc.  </li>
            <li> scent free, easy to dissolve in hot water if you add a squirt of baby wash or draft liquid.  </li>
            <li> If you are okay with strong oil smells like olive oil, you may be perfectly okay with the regular wear of this product.</li>
            <li> but this pure lanolin is much better for moisturizing and getting rid of dryness.  </li>
            <li> It has been very effective moisturizing my dry lips.</li>
            <li> It does strip out of diapers easily by using blue Dawn though, as I had to discover after forgetting to tell my husband to make sure to use a liner...  Oops!  </li>
            <li> Obviously, they have removed some of the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it still wasn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived in good condition before the promised date and is about the same price as what I ordered through my pharmacy even with the shipping.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a sweet smelling cream.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly sweet smell that I don&#x27;t mind, and that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t need to buy more very soon</li>
            <li> Even an 1/8 of a teaspoon overpowered a full batch (10 oz).  </li>
            <li> This is a nice soft lanolin.</li>
            <li> Then I smear it on my feet, wrap my feet in cellophane wrap and the next day my tootsies are gorgeous, not a callus in sight.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell try melting it together with a 1/3 oil (jojoba or almond are good choices), 1/3 bees wax, 1/3 lanolin and a couple drops of essential oil you like.</li>
            <li> and it goes on SO much better and soaks in MUCH faster-</li>
            <li> The smell dissipates after a while - it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> smells earthy but not a bad smell to me</li>
            <li> It smells like Lanolin should and its not a bad smell by any means.</li>
            <li> I wanted the more unrefined version so that it would contain a higher variety of natural lipids that would more closely mimic my skin&#x27;s variety of lipids.  </li>
            <li> Great price compared to some other brands.</li>
            <li> Beware this is PURE lanolin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m re-ordering this one after trying the pharmaceutical and plain lanolin, this option works just fine and is a great price.  </li>
            <li> But I either got used to the smell really quickly</li>
            <li> Super sticky and smelly.  </li>
            <li> It is mild and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> had I been pregnant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works ideally.</li>
            <li> of time my dog and I are very sensitive about some scent, but my dog seems ok with this one</li>
            <li> We used this initially as a diaper cream, better than any of the creams out there!  </li>
            <li> have also been using this daily on a new surgical scar, and it seems to be doing a great job of healing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s been in the fridge magic happens and it gets solid and stays that way, but stays easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> , i had started drinking sea salt water and my lips became very dry, nothing was working, so I found good reviews on lanolin.</li>
            <li> Smells a little sheepy but is a great price for a lot of lanolin.</li>
            <li> Hope you will enjoy as much as I am.</li>
            <li> HANDS ARE MUCH SOFTER AND SMOOTH</li>
            <li> It even helps calm the unbearable itching.</li>
            <li> Totally amazing-- the only thing that would soothe my lips when I was on Accutane.</li>
            <li> So amazing on your skin -- especially dry/cracked hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with lansinoh which has no scent and is clear, Much better than this.</li>
            <li> The ratio of glycerin to lanolin will determine it&#x27;s heaviness, use the lanolin sparingly if you want light, add more for a deep penetrating foot</li>
            <li> What I purchased it for is to lanolize wool diaper covers, and so far, I have been extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a smell worth worrying about.</li>
            <li> It has the same ingredients, so it&#x27;s kind of a mystery to me.</li>
            <li> , my girlfriend likes it, her friend who had dinner with us last night (this lady is into fashion and has her hair styled) liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Smooth and stretchy, lanolin can be used in place of petroleum jelly and is thicker and more solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m going for some kind of a scent purified lanolin.</li>
            <li> It also has a distinct smell, which took me about a week to get used to.</li>
            <li> What I do is to find a good but not too costly liquid moisturizing product and stir this in until the thick stuff becomes more malleable.</li>
            <li> The salve is greasy but it works and is safe and natural.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> I make my own facial lotion with Lanolin and Shea butter, also 1/3 of water.</li>
            <li> so far after 10 applications over 3 days, my eczema fingers getting better.</li>
            <li> Sticky for 5-10 minutes until absorbed, then no need to apply lotion all day.</li>
            <li> It has a good amount of drag and it not greasy.</li>
            <li> good quality and just what i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> To me, it just smells earthy, not dirty.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a very convenient container and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Like others have said, this lanolin has a distinct odor</li>
            <li> But after mixing it with other oils and ingredients it really worked great.</li>
            <li> but after about an hour nap it soaks right in with no residue or oily feel.</li>
            <li> My nose doesn&#x27;t smell it unless I put my hand right up to my nose.  </li>
            <li> , it works, and it is priced right.  </li>
            <li> I supposed it is a very pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li> fast  fast ,love this product really hydrate the skin</li>
            <li> Once you get past the smell, you&#x27;ll realize what a great product it is.</li>
            <li> wanted to use more pure and natural organic products but shea butter, coconut oil and lanolin</li>
            <li> However, as I went through it, I found a large piece of plastic in the tub!</li>
            <li> it is inexpensive, great product for several different types of usage.  </li>
            <li> It is super smelly but it does the job really well.</li>
            <li> It smells strongly like lanolin as I would expect from a natural product.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the smell is not \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; nor like heavily fragranced lotions and cosmetic skin applications, but it&#x27;s not horrible either.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if this works better than others, but I really like that it is one natural ingredient.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt the fluffy cute sheepies at all, so even the most snooty of vegans and vegetarians should probably shut up and slap this stuff on your skin.</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion, this Now brand melts so much better and STAYS melted better than the stuff in the tube.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healing for pretty much anything and mixes well with coconut oil and/or essential oils to make our own salves.</li>
            <li> within a week her bottom is smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> With this lanolin my recipe turned out great and for the first time my daughter actually tanned instead of getting red and sunburned.</li>
            <li> Other said this product has a sheep smell, which I kind of agree with but for the price it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great deal and an excellent product, and with only half the tub empty after 4 months of daily use I can imagine I will continue to get a lot of use out of one tub.</li>
            <li> But its a great replacement for the processed petroleum jelly/mineral oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation, unlike its petrolatum counterparts, its hard to wash away with water.</li>
            <li> Keeps them more resilient and makes them last longer.</li>
            <li> I applied Lanolin on it and the rashes looked so much better the next day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.  </li>
            <li> So many different things were tried, including homemade remedies, doctor visits, steroids (ugh).  </li>
            <li> It takes some doing to get it mixed but if warmed up first it mixes much better.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am expecting my first child in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t into it, but now I like the thickness of it.  </li>
            <li> Feels oily at first</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off the first time I wash my hands.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural, light smell.  </li>
            <li> And we have recently ordered 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I use a dab of it on my hand eczema, which works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it claims to be.  </li>
            <li> If I rub it in pretty well</li>
            <li> This is also the first thing that goes on my lips as soon as I&#x27;m out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The Lanolin, however, is exactly what was wanted &amp; does what I need.</li>
            <li> If I had the money I would buy this for every pretty girl I saw so they would stay that way longer.</li>
            <li> This system  works even if I didn&#x27;t take a bath first.</li>
            <li> Not only does it moisturize more, but it also does a MUCH better job at protecting lips and skin from damage such as wind burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make some foot balm (to emulate &amp;#34;bag balm&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> This is my first time to purchase lanolin</li>
            <li> It is really smelly!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Very sticky!</li>
            <li> First ever buying Now product.</li>
            <li> Ok enough.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a bit barnyardy which I&#x27;m ok with, especially when used at home or before bed.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes okay, but definitely has a smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a better value than buying purified lanolin, especially if  you need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experimented with putting a dollop onto a saucer and warming in the microwave first</li>
            <li> Actually have used sheep lanolin for years to help my skin stay in top shape.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t stinky, exactly.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Rub it on and put a pair of old socks on my hands and in the morning skin, nails, cuticles are all smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Made my creams come out super smooth and extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I compounded a tbs of this with 3 drops of tea tree oil and a few drops of water to help with the smell and to make it smoother/thinner to spread more easily.</li>
            <li> Workd very well, also works well on my face if I keep it away from the oily area right around my nose.</li>
            <li> I think there are other brands that smell more mildly.  </li>
            <li> It really lasts and penetrates and somehow does give the same &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling that many moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I am kind of tired of people who are so concerned with how they smell as if a product can make them smell better.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve every ordered/used pure lanolin before.  </li>
            <li> It is pure, with almost no scent, consistent in thickness, and does not have any added products, byproducts, or dirt.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what it says, a tub of pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> it has a very strong lanolin smell but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It is very, very sticky, too much so for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i would recommend buying this in its pure state and not the other kind that has fragrance as those are diluted with water.</li>
            <li> after this positive exprience, I will continue buying Now products &amp; products sold by Nature and Herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much prefered over the frilly frill type pretty smelling lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very sticky when you first apply it</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty intense.</li>
            <li> Also, smells really natural, stinky but not a bad stinky.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, coming from someone that is very familiar with lanolin, there is nothing strange about the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> It worked well, but has a strong lanoline smell, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> Definitely has the strong lanolin smell, but it works.</li>
            <li> Certainly hope it&#x27;s not part of the ingredients as that wouldn&#x27;t be pure 100% lanolin.</li>
            <li> It is the pure lanolin I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> We use pure lanolin for all types of skin issues from eczema, to cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for pure lanolin to wash wool diaper covers.  </li>
            <li> This product is pure and well priced</li>
            <li> I mix it with pure cocoa butter</li>
            <li> My wife and I decided to try 100% pure lanolin as our baby kept getting rashes even with Desitin.  </li>
            <li> It is darker and I&#x27;m assuming because it&#x27;s pure and it smells like lanolin, so if you&#x27;re looking for some type of pleasing scent</li>
            <li> Just the smell and texture of this tells you that it is pure and does not have petroleum byproducts in it.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Pure lanolin is pure lanolin.  </li>
            <li> , It does have a certain smell</li>
            <li> The smell is trivial, unless you are using it on a large area, you won&#x27;t notice a thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure lanolin and worked well in my mustache wax recipe (50/50 lanolin and beeswax).</li>
            <li> This is really pure lanolin and has to be heated to liquify for use.  </li>
            <li> Pure lanolin, no alcohol, fragrance etc.</li>
            <li> It is 100% pure, so it does have what I like to call a &#x27;sheepy&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is as moisturizing as pure lanolin</li>
            <li> its pure and its a legit product.</li>
            <li> Seems completely pure.</li>
            <li> I used the pure stuff to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Finding pure lanolin is not the easiest thing to do</li>
            <li> So i searched for pure lanolin and this is it.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pure lanolin and</li>
            <li> I have used pure lanolin before, but in liquid form.</li>
            <li> I found that if I use pure lanolin on my hands (which is why I bought this product) then wash with a scented handsoap, the smell is no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lanolin, and it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it smells this way if it&#x27;s so pure.</li>
            <li> what pure lanolin was like</li>
            <li> I was really struck by how much this smells, stays pungent even after application,  and really not suitable for chapped lips or hands, but heels probably a good choice, as the smell sticks around.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little like sheep on its own.</li>
            <li> The plastic surgeon told me the best thing for dry skin is plain old lanolin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product - reasonable price - add a little to regular lotion to add to the moisturizing effects of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells a bit, and yes it is also a bit greasy until it absorbs, but it REALLY helps my hands.</li>
            <li> really a multi-use product</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> A very stout skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it straight for hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, and it really works.</li>
            <li> This has been a very satisfactory substitute.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is very dense lanolin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I had to experiment with the amount I used on my hands and now know how much to apply.  </li>
            <li> Just getting ready to re order.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m supposed to be doing with it</li>
            <li> and it really masked the smell</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product has really helped with chapped skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> He would prefer that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a sheep&#x27;s butt, but it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s sniffing himself a whole lot seeing as he&#x27;s immersed in water.</li>
            <li> it has performed as expected in all of those tasks. :)</li>
            <li> In 15 minutes, lanolin is absorbed completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> Very smoothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my home made hair moisturizer it works really well to help my hair retain moisture.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does have a smell to it, not overpowering, but very persistent.</li>
            <li> But very think must be moisturizing</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my very sore nipples (breastfeeding).</li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my wool diaper covers and do really like it.</li>
            <li> I probably just added too much of it and need to re-proportion my ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well with my combination</li>
            <li> If lanolin works, it so much cheaper than doctor specialist co-pay.</li>
            <li> Intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I much prefer it to petrochemiccal based lip</li>
            <li> The lotion is very moisturizing but it is also VERY stinky (like a sheep).</li>
            <li> Its def the real stuff.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me too much since I used it at bedtime</li>
            <li> I  bought this because it eas much cheeper.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really heard that my husband loves it but also hasn&#x27;t said he hates it.</li>
            <li> It smells like a bandaid really.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.</li>
            <li> no matter how much i moisturize.</li>
            <li> so I was very suprised at this one.</li>
            <li> This is pure but not ultra-purified lanoline, I&#x27;ve used Lansinosh first and in comparison this is slightly heavier and smellier, but it&#x27;s a better product and a better-priced product per ounce than store-bought varieties (like CVS).</li>
            <li> As the other reviews have stated it does have a chemically smell to it, but so does most pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> This has so many uses, but primarily we use it with other ingredients mixed together as a burn ointment.  </li>
            <li> I have had other Lanolin products that went on smooth and was absorbed, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been very happy with how long it stays on my skin and like the fact that it is pure and mixed with a lot of other chemicals whose effect on my skin is unclear.</li>
            <li> son&#x27;s diaper rash (works better than any other cream I have used.  </li>
            <li> This lanolin is softer and more pungent than the other brands I have tried but seems to work well.</li>
            <li> 10x cheaper then most other options</li>
            <li> I also use this product for diaper rashes, it cleaned up my daughters rash much better than any other products.</li>
            <li> or full of synthetic crap that can do more harm that good.</li>
            <li> I usually buy austrailian gold lanolin which is a bit more anhydrous, has more clarity, thicker, and fragrance free (very slight laolin scent).  </li>
            <li> I have a skin condition similar to psoriasis and, so far, pure lanolin seems to be the only natural treatment that does any good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cruelty-free, natural, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than lanolin for treating dry, natural rawhide drum heads, like congas, bongos, etc.</li>
            <li> This one is very soft and smooth but doesn&#x27;t quite work the same.</li>
            <li> The true test will come once I start breastfeeding regularly.</li>
            <li> cool for a bit, pop it in the fridge (essential) overnight and then take out and use.  </li>
            <li> I melted it gently over the stove to make my swimmer&#x27;s cream, and the product became clear, indicating it is also quite pure in that it contains no undissolved solids.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Live without it!  </li>
            <li> Now Solutions 7oz pure lanolin is a greater value and the same thick, \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; texture as Lansinoh, but it does have a strong smell and amber color.</li>
            <li> I live on the east coast in PA, and the winter air here is VERY drying.</li>
            <li> I find it works better and those who mind the smell may find this less offensive.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for extremely dry skin (e.g., feet area).</li>
            <li> Lanolin gets absorbed completely into the skin in an hour or so, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It is a must for nursing mothers, particularly with a newborn.  </li>
            <li> And further, many purchased creams don&#x27;t give a lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> I pay particular attention to my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up, my hands are soft and supple and feel comfortable and moisturized throughout the day, even after several washings.</li>
            <li> However, your issue may be different and for the reasonable price, I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin, this product works really well.</li>
            <li> The pure lanolin I ordered was just as I expected it to be, and much cheaper than the brands available in stores near me, even with the shipping charges.</li>
            <li> It leaves your  hair very soft!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality lanolin, and it smells just like it should.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as high of quality as is used in Lasinoh.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend mixing this into homemade lotions for eczema.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , I highly prefer this product.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend just warming it a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a much better option and only slightly more expensive which I feel is worth it for the convenience.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit gives full coverage, and you can apply it right over your regular lip color.</li>
            <li> Jason Natural Cosmetics Pure Beauty Oil, 5,000 IU Vitamin E Oil - 4 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like good quality lanolin, and a little bit goes a long way on your hands and feet in the winter.</li>
            <li> and it really heals his paw specially during the rough winter season.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow this stuff really protects your skin.  </li>
            <li> very efficient but wow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that my LO didn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much as I did.  </li>
            <li> It lasts longer on your lips than normal gloss does.</li>
            <li> This smells totally normal.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re such a good company, usually.</li>
            <li> Cetaphill was probably the best, but I noticed that when I apply it(not only Cetaphill but all the mentioned) they create a temporary smooth feeling that disappear with the first     wash,  or when my hand are again in contact with the cold weather, and then I have to keep re-applying again and again many times during the day for a mediocre result (beside the     chemical involved)  Lanolin:    </li>
            <li> I use it on dry, cracked skin and it looks so much better the next day.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using lanolin for the last year and it keeps my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> This is version is great for spreading on the body, and less messy.</li>
            <li> Great product - I need only small sweet pea size for wool soaker, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 on first round and back for two more.</li>
            <li> I originally tried 1oz Lansinoh lanolin, which is devoid of smell or color.</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me, with using is for my hair</li>
            <li> We use a grape sized glob with new covers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live with out lanolin while I was breastfeeding my boy.  </li>
            <li> seal on bottle intact, i.e., new product.</li>
            <li> Just have to live with it.  </li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and it has made my skin look so ashy</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in smaller sizes, and recently discovered it was available in 7 oz size.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing lanolin from local stores for breastfeeding and it was more money and a whole lot less product.  </li>
            <li> If the smell of lanolin bothers you, you may want to go with the really expensive kind, such as Lansinoh, or maybe a perfumed kind, such as Pure and Simple New Zealand.  </li>
            <li> my skin stays very soft for days after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use a lot of products.</li>
            <li> However has a very natural barn&#x27;ish smell.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for dry hands and prefer it over lotions and salves as it generally works better even without the extra ingredients.</li>
            <li> lanolin in general is very viscous, but it spreads easily once applied and slightly warmed by body heat.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in my local pharmacy at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> If you soak your feet first, you only have to do this once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> even when mixed with other ingredients, so its (in my opinion) better for a bedtime lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is the first (prescribed or otherwise) to actually heal the rashes.</li>
            <li> Smells a little strong but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and you can&#x27;t get more pure than 100%.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product curious as to what it would smell like, being familiar with sheep smell, having handled sheep and bundled wool after shearing, and it is one of my least favorite aromas from childhood.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would softer but, apparently, lanolin in it&#x27;s pure state is more on the hard side.  </li>
            <li> In less than 2 months the skin on my feet is now completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Further, once applied, it lasts for a long time, even after washing dishes my hands are still hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t run in hot weather, and it had good lubricity in the cold.</li>
            <li> but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything outside of a usual lanolin smell.</li>
            <li> and the smell isn&#x27;t that strong when on dried wool diaper cover.</li>
            <li> It may be a good product, but I&#x27;ve never used it long enough to tell how effective it is on my skin because the smell is so bad.</li>
            <li> I used it to make a body cream and even a large amount of essential oil and aloe gel couldn&#x27;t over power the smell.</li>
            <li> as explained in other reviews, this one is this cheap because it&#x27;s unprocessed, meaning, for lanolin, that it is very efficient, but oh my this thing stink like an old forgotten drawer in a house with humidity problems!!</li>
            <li> Very thick and effective on moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and low smell.</li>
            <li> Have used other brands that do not have such a strong smell</li>
            <li> I also found that the smell is not as bad as many have made is sound!</li>
            <li> Also great to put around your nose when you have a cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am surprised that no one else has mentioned mixing this with NOW Coco Butter.</li>
            <li> My skin recently developed some rashes.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Australian Lanolin that is also sold on this site.</li>
            <li> If you dilute it to 1/2 tsp per gallon of water with a scented wool wash, you don&#x27;t really notice anything different.</li>
            <li> It helps to keeps my hands soft and prevents drying.  </li>
            <li> I guess you&#x27;ve got to be an old person like me to sniff this product and automatically think--</li>
            <li> I think the modern bandages just don&#x27;t have the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I AM A FREQUENT HAND</li>
            <li> Used this to precondition and old baseball glove and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> Very sticky, even turned my gloves yellow.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my hands and feet soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> but after few minutes my hands are silky smooth for hours (or until I wash the dishes again).</li>
            <li> If you want to stay young longer then you NEED this now.</li>
            <li> (if you&#x27;ve ever got stuff directly from a farm, you would know that this can be a problem).  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was surprised when i opened the container-</li>
            <li> Some might break out from it, but so far, for me, I have not had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.</li>
            <li> as natural lanolin does.  </li>
            <li> that was an unexpected surprise.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was all natural, no dies or fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it has residual pesticides in it from the cleaning of sheep&#x27;s wool before processing it to take out the oils &#x3D;</li>
            <li> This is definitely what he was looking for to keep his skin from flaking and peeling so much, and one weekly application is all he&#x27;s asked for, done after cleaning, drying, and applying antifungal ointment.</li>
            <li> but I have used it directly on my lips.</li>
            <li> The odor was like old duplicate receipt paper chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wax naturally produced by sheep to make their fleeces waterproof, and is extracted during the routine sheering and wool treating process.</li>
            <li> Your body needs natural lipids to maintain moisture, and this stuff is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also really like having a jar I can just dip my finger in rather than a tube that requires two hands; anyone will a newborn knows that anything you can do one handed is a big bonus!</li>
            <li> I have used about 4 so far and each has</li>
            <li> Not in that it smells like dirt, but it has a &#x27;natural,&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit like a wet dog to me but the comfort of having my baby suck on my hands after I put it on and not worry about toxic chemicals is worth the smell factor.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad and you only need a tad bit which goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and makes me nauseated, but I have a very sensitive stomach, so that may not be the case with everyone</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than the tiny tube lanolin; great for first weeks of nursing, and on baby&#x27;s bottom--starting to use it on super dry feet or elbows.  </li>
            <li> After that just usual lotion-like application works fine.</li>
            <li> Lanolin has a particular smell its that simple.</li>
            <li> The smell is tolerable, as long as the product is not applied over large areas on body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick texture with a distinct mild smell.</li>
            <li> Pure lanolin has been one of only two things that can relieve this and keep my hands soft (the other is pure Emu oil).</li>
            <li> Product just as described in description and other reviewers were right, has a smell</li>
            <li> I would liken it to the smell of a high quality pair of leather boots, or the smell whenever I walk into the local Merrell outlet.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry, cracked heels, fingers, or elbows (or if you are a new nursing mom), I&#x27;d highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used on several different skin ailments, all with positive results.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for keeping my hands soft during these brutal winter months.  </li>
            <li> And since the smell bother me, I wear some cheap cotton gloves, take them off in the morning and do my usual work.</li>
            <li> Takes too long to apply, but works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> The quality is exactly what I expected....</li>
            <li> I decided to try Now Foods Pure Lanolin because my hands get so dry and crack.  </li>
            <li> My husband, on the other hand, is not so appreciative of picking up our baby who smells like a little tiny sheep.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with smelling like wet sheep for a little bit.</li>
            <li> You can mix this with a few other products that are natural and make it smell better.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with dry cracking skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can&#x27;t keep up with her changes, so this product really keeps the wool resistant and keeps her clothes dry as well.</li>
            <li> his dry skin is gone, you really have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> (Also tried Balmex - our daily go-to, Triple paste, Aquaphor, and butt-paste (our least favorite)).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick but you can rub on skin easily.</li>
            <li> I have a very old compensating Euphonium that I especially rely on lanolin for.</li>
            <li> I rub the lanolin/oil mixture on my hands &amp; feet at night and the next morning, they are very soft and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I once purchased a one pound bag of lanolin, and while it was a little cheaper, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to dig it out of it&#x27;s plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> Lanolin presents a thick weight heavy moisturizer that stays on lips, works really well even with only a light coating, can help speed healing, and is fantastic for extremely dry/cracked</li>
            <li> The texture is the same, but Lansinoh is clear and odorless.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like it sinks in and has really healed my skin.</li>
            <li> and this is the only purely natural product I can find.</li>
            <li> so I use natural products as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have to heat it with a hairdryer to make it soft enough to apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li> After a short time, you get used to the natural odor of this lanolin.</li>
            <li> Some people seem to be extra sensitive or something.</li>
            <li> No worries on harmful ingredients such as petroleum/petrolatums, this is 100% natural from the wool of those cuddly sheep.</li>
            <li> Most lip balms really do not go a great job at protecting and moisturizing lips for an extended time after application.</li>
            <li> It costs far less than comparable options, and it really works.</li>
            <li> I gave it a chance, and used it on my badly dried hands and feet overnight, and it works much better than any of the hand or foot creams I previously used.  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick, slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; until rubbed on your hands.  </li>
            <li> It works much better (the way it rubs in, the slight stickiness and the added &#x27;volume&#x27;), and it feels much less greasy, especially after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since it was more lanolin for the same price or less than other products, and disregarded the reviews about the smell because of it, but after opening the container I can tell you this stuff definitely smells like a barnyard</li>
            <li> I bought little screw top containers at Walmart (in the travel toiletries isle, came in a pack of two) and scooped it into the little containers</li>
            <li> While I use this as a lip balm, lanolin can be used on other parts of the skin in need of intense moisturizers plus protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus Its much cheaper than the other kinds.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this before I spent way too much on another product that works just the same.</li>
            <li> Regardless of what I      do and what the temperature is,  my hands stay smooth with no such senseless thick layer anymore.</li>
            <li> We use it as a natural diaper cream that works like no other, for dry hands, the children&#x27;s owies and for lanolizing their woolies to make them water resistant.  </li>
            <li> Looked everywhere for pure lanolin, the only thing that works for my little guys frequent diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little \\&quot;sheepish\\&quot;</li>
            <li> this product has been great for healing my hands between outbreaks of dyshidrotic eczema (unfortunately still need a prescription to tame that)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never felt this soft before even using other natural oils.</li>
            <li> My dad is a shepherd and this has a very faint scent of sheep but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Use it on my baby who suffers from extremely dry skin and eczema right after her bath and and her skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We have been using pure lanolin for our babies&#x27; bottoms for over 4 months now, and they have less rashes.  </li>
            <li> The other more expensive brands must do something to take the pure lanolin color away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for small jobs.</li>
            <li> Not as &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; as other lanolins; therefore, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So applied Lanolin on my bad looking hands and feet, and i have to say that after first time my hands look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I immediately rubbed a small amount on my left knee which had been scaly and whitish from being chapped and the next day was much improved and the following day looked almost normal.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit too, so the jar has lasted quite a long time; and I STILL have more than half left!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and smells kind of like vaseline, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thick substance, that moisturizes extraordinarily well!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to other nurses, medical personnel, farmers, or anyone constantly exposed to the outdoors or chemicals on their hands.</li>
            <li> IMO, Nothing natural works as well as lanolin for soothing and moisturizing very dry, chapped skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sink in quickly at all, so this is definitely a product where a little goes a long way and to use it only on tougher, dry areas or as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Good product, a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because I really prefer \\&quot;hydrous\\&quot; lanolin (which has water mixed in and is a little easier to use)</li>
            <li> Smells like any other natural lanolin and brings instant relief to cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I, too, have been using it on my cuticles because with fall here and winter to soon follow behind, it is so easy to have my hands and cuticles become dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little dab of a petroleum jelly based product to &#x27;calm down&#x27; my hair after washing it, and was looking for a non-petroleum alternative.</li>
            <li> Thick, pure, Lanolin!  </li>
            <li> It only takes a pea sized drop to do both hands so a jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately i don&#x27;t use this after breastfeeding since it does not state safe to use for babies like the other brand in the tubes, but i will use this for a general skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly as a deep conditioning treatment for my hands, which get dry from constant washing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> And a batch will last a long time and cost pennies per day.  </li>
            <li> This tub should last a long time and you can&#x27;t beat amazons price.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a LOT because my daily routine soils my hands all day long.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted another brand of Hydrous Lanolin which is apparently no longer available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I put this on my belly (9 months pregnant and past my due date) with a little coconut oil and my skin is sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and sticky and does not absorb well, contrary to other reviews I&#x27;ve read.  </li>
            <li> This will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> But since little man is so sensitive to anything perfumed, this is the way to go for me!  </li>
            <li> Not only that but for any type of DRY skin, Like bottom of foot, heels, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell that reminds me of sheep on the farm as a kid, but I am hyper sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> the texture is sticky but absorbs into your skin, especially when mixed with other oils.</li>
            <li> It is hard to say so much about.</li>
            <li> I had some that was so very sticky that it was hard to scoop out.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very sticky and hard to rub</li>
            <li> Australian Lanolin is more expensive, but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of lanolin (new mom), Didn&#x27;t realize how little you need!  </li>
            <li> you can buy a pound of unprocessed lanolin, with the smell of sheep for about $11    natural lanolin is anhydrous, dark in color, and has an odor to it    if you want lanolin that doesn&#x27;t smell, get the processed hydrous lanolin</li>
            <li> You had to rub your hands together for a long time and it still felt sticky.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A couple of nights using this will go a long way towards soothing hands that have started to crack and bleed from dryness.</li>
            <li> We will keep this lanolin in our home even after our kids have long since potty trained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not awfully sensitive with smells</li>
            <li> We use it for minor scrapes and burns after we disinfect.  </li>
            <li> Has the earthy lanolin smell with a thick and gooey consistency much like petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> It is so thick it is almost unusable as it comes straight out of the jar.</li>
            <li> My lips and fingers dry/crack up easily and especially in the cold.</li>
            <li> Initially used it 40 years ago when I was seriously burned on high tension wires and couldn&#x27;t afford skin graphs.</li>
            <li> While it DID soften, it also seemed to me to dry, rather than moisturize, so as I said, it didn&#x27;t help me in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I tried Pure Lanolin, and it seriously cleared the rash up within hours.  </li>
            <li> I tried different creams for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and none of the other stuff seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of the winter, coconut oil is not rich enough to provide the needed moisture and protection.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, buy other brands before choosing this.</li>
            <li> It simply doesn&#x27;t seem to be as purified as other brands of lanolin I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Will stick with the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> which let you open them with one hand while the other is holding</li>
            <li> The only other lanolin I have used was Lansinoh HPA lanolin.</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than dumping several toxins on your skin that are bad for you.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell a mile away, but rather when you stick your nose on where you applied it, therefore when I apply it on my hands, I keep them away from my nose (in gloves) for a while until they dry out.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry skin before I go for a skin</li>
            <li> I had wickedly dry lips.</li>
            <li> I use this for breast feeding and dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have done that if my hands or cuticles were severely dry.</li>
            <li> After age 50, my skin became so dry, also a Diabetic.</li>
            <li> It does the job of moisturizing severely dry</li>
            <li> CLEARED UP A DRY PATCH</li>
            <li> WASHER.WORKING ON DRY ELBOWS AND FEET AND SEE IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> It is just the stuff for dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as cuticle oil, lip balm, for cuts, dry skin, diaper rash etc.</li>
            <li> I have tried a slew of products for dry, cracked feet</li>
            <li> but it is unbeatable for dry, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> They quickly dry and lose effectiveness.</li>
            <li> One for each grandchild and for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Using this, my skin is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> This works well for my dog&#x27;s dry skin areas.  </li>
            <li> I also discovered that I can rub it on my hands before doing dishes to prevent them from getting horribly dry and cracked since it doesn&#x27;t rinse off in water.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away once the wool is dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using lanolin for some time now for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> it would or wouldn&#x27;t work for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have never used lanolin before, instead seeking a skin creme to solve dry and severely cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else on my lips or (once) dry and cracked hands...</li>
            <li> I use this for dry areas all over my body.  </li>
            <li> It helps to keep his hands from cracking with the dry winter weather that we experience living in Downeast Maine.</li>
            <li> Healed seriously dry and cracked skins on hands over one application.</li>
            <li> give this a try for dry skin .</li>
            <li> I also use it for myself in winter, when my skin hands become ultra dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> We use this for to heal dry heals and dry lips.</li>
            <li> Every winter my skin feels like it&#x27;s going to dry up and blow away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for excessively dry skin and the slits that come of it, as a result.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and thick, just as expected.</li>
            <li> only downside is really price given lanolin is expensive and these products are more expensive than a gigantic jar of lanolin due to the packaging requirements.</li>
            <li> My hands used to be like a cracked concrete block with a senseless thick layer.</li>
            <li> I felt nauseated when I first opened the jar, and took a sniff.  </li>
            <li> Lanolin works wonders on baby diaper rash, rough spots, sore noses, minor cuts and scrapes.  </li>
            <li> It does the job as far as moisturizing goes, but the slightly gray color and odd smell are off-putting.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff from a friend because of excessively dry skin and this works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Also, the last time that I used it, it didn&#x27;t lanolize my covers nearly enough, so they&#x27;re leaking :\</li>
            <li> This small container has enough lanolin in it to last me for years of treating drum heads.</li>
            <li> I mixed half of this with 91% alcohol in a spray bottle and it makes supreme case lubricant for resizing brass cases.</li>
            <li> My hands were very dry from this 2014 Polar Vortex storm.</li>
            <li> My husband also tried it since his hands get very dry from working on a computer all day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was suffering from very dry and chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It is healing up a very dry cracked spot on my hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lanolin products over the past few decades, but I&#x27;ve yet to buy any that smelled worse than this one.</li>
            <li> This pure lanolin has a smell and is very thick compare to the liquid lanolin.  </li>
            <li> I add a little regular lotion to it to help work it into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, very dense.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as it only takes a small dab to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Will order it again before I let my jar go empty.</li>
            <li> For those that are not immersed in water, it smells a bit like wet dog.</li>
            <li> The smell is not very noticeable either.</li>
            <li> If you need something that doesn&#x27;t smell like a wet sheep, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re putting it on chapped pink parts that are beneath your nose, you may find the odor a bit offensive.</li>
            <li> Because of this, it is harder to mix than the liquid lanolin.  </li>
            <li> It takes a minute to work it into my skin (expected)</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s almost to be expected from a tub of this</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling was rough.  </li>
            <li> did not really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am going to try to add some essential oil to it and see it that helps just so it will not go to waste.</li>
            <li> but if you want something that smells good you also will be getting artificial stuff which can make damaged skin worse.</li>
            <li> and you kind of don&#x27;t want to use it because it is so annoyingly sticky.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for peoples who are still trying other chemical lotion,because they did not get     to know yet this magic Lanolin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to apply in its solid form.  </li>
            <li> are all solid at room temperature and not easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the ONLY thing that finally cured our baby&#x27;s diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a LONG way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and am unable to get in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sticky though.</li>
            <li> Other Lotions:    </li>
            <li> I used to get deep bleeding fissures in my heals, but no more.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely cost efffective.</li>
            <li> (I am speaking about the severity of my lips due to being on Isotretinoin)</li>
            <li> I bought it for breastfeeding and to re-lanolize wool soakers, but I have been using it on my rough elbows, too (leave it up to my mother to point out that they needed some TLC!).</li>
            <li> A small whisk is a big help.  </li>
            <li> It is no longer available locally except in small tubes which is very, very expensive and not at all practical for anyone who uses this in any quantity.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any other people recommending this as a hair product, but I do.</li>
            <li> but it does have an odor to it that my other pharmaceutical grade lanolin lacks</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SOAK INTO THE SKIN LIKE OTHER LOTIONS</li>
            <li> endless uses</li>
            <li> No more open wounds or sores.</li>
            <li> Smells like wet sheep!</li>
            <li> Bought this for nursing because it was inexpensive compared to other lanolins.</li>
            <li> I usually have to keep reapplying moisturizer all day but only once.</li>
            <li> The texture is extremely waxy, not unlike earwax.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> WORK OUTSIDE IN THE COLD AND USE PURE LANOLIN ON FACE AND HANDS.</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on your dry spots before you go to bed and after a few nights you&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Like all anhydrous lanolin (meaning it has very low water content), this is not a lotion - it is thick and sticky, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li> This product is so thick it can be difficult to apply and get down into fine cracks and callouses.</li>
            <li> This came in such a big jar that I no longer felt guilty about using it for other things too, like my dry feet.</li>
            <li> You could consider it a little sticky.. but not much.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong lanolin odor (not good) mixed with an odd chemical smell that makes me instantly want to wash it off and put up with dry hands instead of that terrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if ya search hard enough you&#x27;ll find it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;TIP: If your hands are really bad, slather on the first coat and stick your hands inside some zip-lock baggies and let it just soak in for 30-60 minutes for deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Fairly sticky oilment with awful smell...</li>
            <li> I bet I smell better than anyone who uses the crap that costs hundreds of dollars.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff but horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I also used it to help heal my older daughter&#x27;s chapped lips which she wouldn&#x27;t stop picking at, for a painful dry spot on my husband&#x27;s hand, and to help keep my long hair moisturized....</li>
            <li> sisters tell me that they can&#x27;t really smell anything bad about it, even when they stick their noses into it, so I suppose it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
            <li> The only 100% lanolin at the store was in nipple cream (in the bay isle) and it was ridiculously</li>
            <li> and it has a slight odor.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;d say the odd smell isn&#x27;t too problematic for this product.</li>
            <li> WIFE SAYS SHE SMELLS A SLIGHT MUSKY SCENT</li>
            <li> Still has a slight smell to it -</li>
            <li> A slight grease and papaya smell ...</li>
            <li> but they switched their formula to using less lanolin</li>
            <li> I took a gamble trying to not buy a ton of lansinoh hpa lanolin, but this product is isticky and has a slight smell.  </li>
            <li> color is yellowish, not grey, in the batch I got and the smell was not pleasant, but not a problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this lanolin hoping it would help soften the thick, dry, scaling that resulted from this condition (after trying just about everything else).</li>
            <li> I used it as a diaper rash cream for my little one&lt;</li>
            <li> I also use it for my little mans bum at changing time.</li>
            <li> The stuff does smell a little like sheep</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell a little fresher.</li>
            <li> We use it for my husband&#x27;s marathon ocean swims to prevent chafing - we mix with a little petroleum jelly to help it spread around, and it&#x27;s still stuck on after three or four hours.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need.  </li>
            <li> purchased this for our little one&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little sticky (greasy)</li>
            <li> This product works well even though it is a little sticky.</li>
            <li> At a fraction of the cost, I will take the little stronger odor.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes</li>
            <li> A jar lasts a little over a year.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible strong smell, it smells like a bigger container of lanolin.</li>
            <li> This item works well on very dry skin and helps keep feet from getting hard and calloused.  </li>
            <li> so I mean DRY.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive pure lanolin product to replace the expensive breastfeeding product (in the purple package) from the local market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark in color as well.</li>
            <li> Most purchased moisturizing creams and lotions have a frightening list of artificial ingredients, even hydrogenated oil which I wouldn&#x27;t eat and don&#x27;t want to apply to my skin either.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s about the consistency of cold butter, but much slower to melt)</li>
            <li> I work in a kitchen and have to use harsh detergents all day, so my hands were cracking and even bleeding.</li>
            <li> Also made them feel oily when they dried.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it every few days, so that the condition doesn&#x27;t return.  </li>
            <li> May have to heavily sent to cover smell.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands and wait a few seconds while it softens.  </li>
            <li> I threw this out after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with some heavily scented lotion and that did not even help.</li>
            <li> The smell do disappear after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I feel it heavy on my skin all day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to lanozine some wool I was recycling into diapers and nursing pads, and although I did not use them heavily, it seamed to work because I didn’t have urine or milk soak</li>
            <li> It does not continue to smell after a few minutes on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Just be prepared for messy and smelly.</li>
            <li> The faint scent smells natural, and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Yes, it can smell a little sheepy, but not strong.</li>
            <li> I used it to heal diaper rushes and it usually heals in less than one day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little (very little)</li>
            <li> Lanolin does smell a bit, but not strong for me.</li>
            <li> This works for my other remedies and the thickness of it keeps the other stuff from being to thin.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable value for how inexpensive it is and how little you need to do the job.</li>
            <li> We prefer this over other cream we tried when we rash gets bad - mainly for overnight.</li>
            <li> This is so greasy and sticky and it stinks to high heaven, as you would expect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick stuff and can be hard to get off clothes and sheets, so be careful with it,</li>
            <li> so that I don’t rub it raw with all the nose blowing.</li>
            <li> Too bad Amazon can&#x27;t keep a tighter rein on the bad sellers and highlight the good ones.</li>
            <li> Pure Lanolin is hard to find it in stores,and when you do it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> this won&#x27;t be it, but it certainly does not have a bad ordor...</li>
            <li> I transfer a wad of into small containers and keep it at work, in my car and my purse.</li>
            <li> My mom used this stuff on us kids when I was small....</li>
            <li> Small batches keep the ingredients fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does seem to help scabs, scars, and even small wounds.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering 2 of these per year for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to see how well</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I never got past the smell to use it for anything.  </li>
            <li> (Hey, isn&#x27;t petroleum dead dinosaurs?!</li>
            <li> Smells no different than the way too expensive medela or lanisoh brand lanolins.</li>
            <li> The cold dry winters here in Maine are rough on your exposed areas and this stuff helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in, yet also hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Gets a little thick and hard to apply in winter and can turn liquid in summer</li>
            <li> Very heavy</li>
            <li> My poor kid smells like a wet lamb when I put this on him!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has dry fingertips that split (which can be very painful)</li>
            <li> In NM the climate is so dry, everyone suffers from cracked lips, fingers and heels.&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin is far thicker and faster for healing the painful cracks than any other product out there, whether petroleum or beeswax based.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasant but you eventually get accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are much less noticable than before and have not gotten worse.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s to goopy/sticky/tacky and somewhat difficult to smear on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product that works.  </li>
            <li> It does have an odor which I find hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Hardens if it gets cold, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> One vendor was dishonest - charging my card and claiming a \\&quot;backorder\\&quot; on the product when I wrote them</li>
            <li> In the last year I developed a horrible case of dishydrotic eczema on my feet which was spreading to my hands.</li>
            <li> I work outside in the cold</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell of this product</li>
            <li> Yes, it does have a stronger odor than the commonly sold brand.  </li>
            <li> I did not care for this product because it was thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s offered in this thick consistency product from Now.</li>
            <li> Its thick</li>
            <li> Yes, its thick -</li>
            <li> I like this lanolin BECAUSE it is thick.  </li>
            <li> I put a layer of coconut oil under so that I can move the thick lanolin around my face.  </li>
            <li> Too thick to use alone, must mix with oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know how thick it would be.</li>
            <li> Really thick.</li>
            <li> I smear the lanolin, yes smear as it is really thick, all over my hands</li>
            <li> Remember, it is really thick</li>
            <li> THICK.  </li>
            <li> Is too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing I used could soothe them.</li>
            <li> no more dryness or itchiness!</li>
            <li> My horsey neighbor told me Bag Balm was the stuff to get for dry skin, but I saw from reviews that BB stinks of gasoline and contains toxins banned in healthier countries.  </li>
            <li> but it is much less expensive than the one in the purple package.</li>
            <li> but my husband hated the smell so much I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> I add to my butter base moisture and it make my hair feel like clouds its the soft.</li>
            <li> I had a cold sore on my lip that would not go away with any other preparations, I put this product on it, and it was gone in one day.</li>
            <li> It stinks sooooo bad that I cannot even stand to open the jar, much less has it on my body.</li>
            <li> I was raised in a sheep + goats + .... farm , and this Lanolin really smell like sheep, and its disgusting -for me at least- either because it bring memories or because something else ..</li>
            <li> The reviews about the bad smell must be from people that are not familiar with what raw lanolin smells like.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that i expected it too smell really bad, but also i expected that it will do the trick for my cracked from cold hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Weird smell, not sure I want to use it to make lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my lips and thought that was kinda dumb because I&#x27;d be smelling it all day.</li>
            <li> This product has an awful smell and a different texture than other brands of lanolin.</li>
            <li> Once it was dry, all of my skin was terrible dry as well.</li>
            <li> I have sore, cracked, dry painful skin on my hands because of Eczema.</li>
            <li> In three days&#x27; time, my elbows have seen a 75% improvement (and they were a tough case, since I have &amp;#34;mat&amp;#34; elbows from teaching self-defense).</li>
            <li> it is very thick and softens your lips after a day or 2</li>
            <li> Melts very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I agree it stinks a &#x27;little&#x27;.</li>
            <li> they never experienced life with sheep.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with a face lotion to thin out and absorb.</li>
            <li> Non irritating for rashes.</li>
            <li> Just a thin layer and</li>
            <li> The smell is annoying, like it bothers you in the middle of the day, you know?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like this, it stinks.</li>
            <li> use it on dry, cracked skin, palms, feet and also as a base for home made skin cream and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> add it to a bandaid, and within a few minutes the painful crack softens and starts to heal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are using this for our 1 year old&#x27;s horrible diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I placed the order because it&#x27;s not USP certified.  </li>
            <li> For all I know, it could be coming from China, that&#x27;s a bit scary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my knees and elbows but think it would feel &#x27;weird&#x27; on my feet.  </li>
            <li> SO EXPENSIVE for that</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a problem for me, because I was raised around sheep, so it&#x27;s somewhat nostalgic.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand &amp; unable to decode.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry if this is how it is supposed to smell, but I could not take it.  </li>
            <li> Hydrating but has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I mean really really bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product had an medicine odor that makes it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> He thinks it stinks.  </li>
            <li> It stinks</li>
            <li> however it smells awful and is extremly hard to mask.</li>
            <li> The product smells like lanolin-not an unpleasant scent at all.</li>
            <li> Even though it does have a smell, it isn&#x27;t bad to me.</li>
            <li> In the winter I get the bad cracks on my fingers and the sides of my thumbs.</li>
            <li> Some said it smells bad.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used under my nose when I’ve had really bad allergies</li>
            <li> Once I got used to it, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make home made suntan lotion for me and my kids because of the bad stuff in store brands.</li>
            <li> If you have a really bad time&lt;</li>
            <li> It is not smell that bad like some user described.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> Could not use this because it smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with some hesitation after reading the reviews about how bad it smells.  </li>
            <li> I hate it sooooo bad.</li>
            <li> I know I hate the smell,</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need loads of alcohol and crap to make it so.  </li>
            <li> The odor of this product is very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Reading all bad reviews, I expecting horrible smell.</li>
            <li> the smell was not too bad!</li>
            <li> but it smells awful.  </li>
            <li> I had a terrible heat rash that I healed by drying it out.</li>
            <li> omg I bought this to put in a mixture I was making and it smelled terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product, and I have been using it for months since I started breastfeeding. However, as I went through it, I found a large piece of plastic in the tub! Pretty sure that shouldn&#x27;t have been in there. Certainly hope it&#x27;s not part of the ingredients as that wouldn&#x27;t be pure 100% lanolin. Rated 3 stars for this reason.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and am unable to get in the stores.  It works well for my skin problems.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of lanolin (new mom), Didn&#x27;t realize how little you need!  But it&#x27;s great to have around and it&#x27;s a good deal!</li>
            <li> In NM the climate is so dry, everyone suffers from cracked lips, fingers and heels.&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin is far thicker and faster for healing the painful cracks than any other product out there, whether petroleum or beeswax based.&lt;br /&gt;I add it to a bandaid, and within a few minutes the painful crack softens and starts to heal.&lt;br /&gt;My mom had a tube of lanolin in every medicine chest, and with three kids, it still  took years to go through one tube. This big jar will last FOREVER. I transfer a wad of into small containers and keep it at work, in my car and my purse.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product because it was thick and sticky.  You had to rub your hands together for a long time and it still felt sticky.  I have had other Lanolin products that went on smooth and was absorbed, but not this one.  Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love it. I bought this to add to my homemade lip balm and also to use in some healing salve. it has a very strong lanolin smell but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like this, it stinks. I know lanolin is supposed to have a strong scent but I wish I had purchased one that didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s thick but you can rub on skin easily. Extremely sticky though. It&#x27;s very dark in color as well. I wont be buying this one again. I should have stuck with lansinoh which has no scent and is clear, Much better than this. But it&#x27;s more expensive too. I&#x27;m using it for breastfeeding and my babies bottom since she tends to have a rash often. Lanolin works great getting rid of diaper rashes but I don&#x27;t like the smell or color of this one.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff really protects your skin.  it repels water and keeps moisture in your skin.  i have diabetes and use this on my feet, legs, hands and arms.  it&#x27;s thick and smells kind of like vaseline, but a little goes a long way.  my skin stays very soft for days after applying it.  i would recommend buying this in its pure state and not the other kind that has fragrance as those are diluted with water.</li>
            <li> This is what you want to use on your, Conga Skins. Keeps them more resilient and makes them last longer.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells a bit, and yes it is also a bit greasy until it absorbs, but it REALLY helps my hands. I work in a kitchen and have to use harsh detergents all day, so my hands were cracking and even bleeding. I mix the lanolin with a bit of moisturizer and rub it in last thing before bed, and VIOLA!...soft, and healed hands in the morning. Wonderful product...a gift from our sheep friends!</li>
            <li> Love it and it lives up to it&#x27;s name.  I use it for my hands and cuticles since I wash my hands a lot.  The smell is not bad and you only need a tad bit which goes a long way.  Will order it again before I let my jar go empty.</li>
            <li> I was raised in a sheep + goats + .... farm , and this Lanolin really smell like sheep, and its disgusting -for me at least- either because it bring memories or because something else .. ..., I don&#x27;t know.   Some people find the smell pleasant, good for them. I wish I have such feeling, but I cannot.  It does not smell a mile away, but rather when you stick your nose on where you applied it, therefore when I apply it on my hands, I keep them away from my nose (in gloves) for a while until they dry out.  Some people compare the smell to chemical or oil product or whatever, and that&#x27;s because -I guess- they never experienced life with sheep.  Other Lotions:    I work outside in a ~40 - 50 degree environment. My hands used to be like a cracked concrete block with a senseless thick layer. I was using Aveeno, Cetaphill, Vasyline and whatever might     help. Cetaphill was probably the best, but I noticed that when I apply it(not only Cetaphill but all the mentioned) they create a temporary smooth feeling that disappear with the first     wash,  or when my hand are again in contact with the cold weather, and then I have to keep re-applying again and again many times during the day for a mediocre result (beside the     chemical involved)  Lanolin:    I apply it once at night. And since the smell bother me, I wear some cheap cotton gloves, take them off in the morning and do my usual work. Its effect is like magic. Regardless of what I      do and what the temperature is,  my hands stay smooth with no such senseless thick layer anymore. I feel bad for peoples who are still trying other chemical lotion,because they did not get     to know yet this magic Lanolin.  I know I hate the smell, BUT, I will always use it for its healing power, which has no match \\&quot;based on my experience\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s why I gave it 5 stars ( I would give it 100 if I can).  AND  It&#x27;s lanolin, a sheep&#x27;s product, so it smells sheep.  If the smell is unbearable to me, I would go with a chemical products that God knows what can do to my health.   It&#x27;s a trade off .... ... ..</li>
            <li> As many have pointed out, this is the best for cracked feet. I used to get deep bleeding fissures in my heals, but no more.  Put it on at bedtime and then wear socks. I have tried the pharmaceutical grade, which doesn&#x27;t smell, but it didn&#x27;t work and grew mold during the summer if I did not keep it in the fridge. Obviously, they have removed some of the \\&quot;good stuff\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that no one else has mentioned mixing this with NOW Coco Butter. Melt the two together in equal parts. I find it works better and those who mind the smell may find this less offensive.</li>
            <li> Use for chapped baby cheeks and eczema - works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Now pure Lanolin is great. Firstly, the price it great for 7oz. I use it on dry, cracked skin and it looks so much better the next day. I agree it stinks a &#x27;little&#x27;. The smell disappears after 10 minutes (or maybe I just get used to it. But its a great replacement for the processed petroleum jelly/mineral oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another observation, unlike its petrolatum counterparts, its hard to wash away with water. We have to use soap to wash the Lanolin. So its great in case you want to workout/swim and still protect your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of my recent uses for this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My skin recently developed some rashes. I applied Lanolin on it and the rashes looked so much better the next day. 2. I also use it for my chapped lips before I go to bed. This way I don&#x27;t mistakenly eat Lanolin (though it is safe to be ingested)&lt;br /&gt;3. I used it as a diaper rash cream for my little one&lt;br /&gt;4. I use it on dry skin before I go for a skin&lt;br /&gt;5. I had some bruises and applied Lanolin to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really a multi-use product and I recommend the Now brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> Excellent quality lanolin at a super price!</li>
            <li> I have been mixing it with shea butter and use it daily on my hands and feet.  So far I have been very happy with how long it stays on my skin and like the fact that it is pure and mixed with a lot of other chemicals whose effect on my skin is unclear.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  I was a bit skeptical when I placed the order because it&#x27;s not USP certified.  It is the pure lanolin I was looking for.  Good value. However, I wish it states the product origin for I have no idea where the product is coming from. For all I know, it could be coming from China, that&#x27;s a bit scary.</li>
            <li> I felt nauseated when I first opened the jar, and took a sniff.  It smells like putrified machine oil, and the odor is very strong.  I gave it a chance, and used it on my badly dried hands and feet overnight, and it works much better than any of the hand or foot creams I previously used.  Lanolin gets absorbed completely into the skin in an hour or so, and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized.  I use more expensive lanolin on my hands during the day because of the odor, and use this one at night.  Works great, and it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it is.  Works great for all the diaper rashes my child has gotten except for when she had a yeast infection.  Highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> I usually buy austrailian gold lanolin which is a bit more anhydrous, has more clarity, thicker, and fragrance free (very slight laolin scent).  I was really struck by how much this smells, stays pungent even after application,  and really not suitable for chapped lips or hands, but heels probably a good choice, as the smell sticks around.  I will be using it to winterize my feet and my dogs paws, but will need fragrance free for hands and lips.</li>
            <li> A very stout skin moisturizer. Waterproof and sticks with you for hours and hours. Smells and tastes(if you use it for a lip balm and so on) like a sheep yard. Hardens if it gets cold, not a big deal. I have used it as a leather oiler on shoes. Much prefered over the frilly frill type pretty smelling lotions. Very natural.</li>
            <li> Could be user error, but it didn&#x27;t stay melted when I added it to the tepid water to lanolize my wool diaper covers. Also made them feel oily when they dried.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in smaller sizes, and recently discovered it was available in 7 oz size. This is extremely cost efffective. This product is great for skin...I mix it with a face lotion to thin out and absorb. I use it straight for hands and feet. I have also used it on our pets on abrasions, etc., as well as diaper rashes for my grandkids...simply, put - it is inexpensive, great product for several different types of usage.  Seller is great also which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It does the job as far as moisturizing goes, but the slightly gray color and odd smell are off-putting. I much prefer the Australian Lanolin that is also sold on this site. It has a more natural, golden color and a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;The Australian Lanolin is more expensive, but a little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ll be buying it next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lanolize wool diaper soakers - those darn things are magic!  Why doesn&#x27;t everyone use them? Baby wears the wool at night, it doesn&#x27;t smell and it doesn&#x27;t leak.    I&#x27;ve also used it on her tender, stuffy nose to protect it from too many tissues - awesome.      Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own tanning lotion!  It works perfectly and 100% natural!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of lanolin for years and have found this to be a wonderful product for my skin. I am very pleased with Now Pure Lanolin. It has a very mild lanolin aroma and is smooth and silky on my skin. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Fairly sticky oilment with awful smell...</li>
            <li> Sure it smells if you stick your nose right up to the jar - it is oil secreted by sheep, what do you expect? I personally use it to lanolize wool to condition and make it waterproof. If you dilute it to 1/2 tsp per gallon of water with a scented wool wash, you don&#x27;t really notice anything different. Even though it does have a smell, it isn&#x27;t bad to me. I would liken it to the smell of a high quality pair of leather boots, or the smell whenever I walk into the local Merrell outlet. I don&#x27;t think it smells like manure or a barnyard... I&#x27;ve bought it elsewhere but this is a good price so I will be buying it from Amazon with I am done with these two jars.</li>
            <li> We use pure lanolin for all types of skin issues from eczema, to cuts and scrapes. It&#x27;s healing for pretty much anything and mixes well with coconut oil and/or essential oils to make our own salves. Grateful it&#x27;s offered in this thick consistency product from Now.</li>
            <li> This works great for my hand psoriasis.  Is great for nails also.  Now have my friends using it.  Good seller. A++++</li>
            <li> When I started on Isotretinoin (Accutane) I had wickedly dry lips. I mean nothing I used could soothe them. I did some research and it said that things like Chapstick only prevent and protect, but they cannot heal chapped/cracked lips. I read that lanolin or Shea butter were the only things that can actually heal them. I found that even if you have a product with lanolin in it, it will not do the job. (I am speaking about the severity of my lips due to being on Isotretinoin) I have been a faithful user of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it still wasn&#x27;t good enough. The only 100% lanolin at the store was in nipple cream (in the bay isle) and it was ridiculously expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased and used &amp;#34;now products&amp;#34; before and have been very pleased. This product is actually better than the nipple cream I bought at the store. I cannot go anywhere without this. I bought little screw top containers at Walmart (in the travel toiletries isle, came in a pack of two) and scooped it into the little containers so I can take them with me anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product heals chapped/cracked/sore lips fast and gives a really nice shine to them. I have gotten a lot of compliments!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the delivery service was quite prompt.  We have been using lanolin for years to heal cuts and scrapes - especially good for young children.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for a good price</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  I&#x27;ve had ongoing issues with the skin on my fingertips for over 2 years.  So many different things were tried, including homemade remedies, doctor visits, steroids (ugh).  Schmearing this stuff on my fingers and leaving on overnight (with gloves) has made a huge difference.  I continue to use it every few days, so that the condition doesn&#x27;t return.  It&#x27;s cruelty-free, natural, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, and it really works. I bought it for breastfeeding and to re-lanolize wool soakers, but I have been using it on my rough elbows, too (leave it up to my mother to point out that they needed some TLC!). In three days&#x27; time, my elbows have seen a 75% improvement (and they were a tough case, since I have &amp;#34;mat&amp;#34; elbows from teaching self-defense). Very impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of lanolin for years and it does not smell of sheep.  Mixed with glycerin and shea butter it&#x27;s the best skin cream: relatively light and easily absorbed.  The ratio of glycerin to lanolin will determine it&#x27;s heaviness, use the lanolin sparingly if you want light, add more for a deep penetrating foot cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gently heat the ingredients to make mixing easier (briefly microwaved or double boiler, never over a flame).  A small whisk is a big help.  It takes some doing to get it mixed but if warmed up first it mixes much better.  And a batch will last a long time and cost pennies per day.  Vastly better than any store bought, petroleum based, perfumed creams.</li>
            <li> I was looking for pure lanolin to wash wool diaper covers.  This stuff works great- smells nice, keeps the wool soft and water-resistant.  Plan to use it for skin care this winter, too!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing about the smell: it smells like lanolin, because that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s in it. Any nursing mom is probably familiar with the scent. If you are looking for something that smells good, I&#x27;d suggest trying shea butter or coconut oil. If you have really dry, cracked heels, fingers, or elbows (or if you are a new nursing mom), I&#x27;d highly recommend this product. A little goes a long way, and you can&#x27;t get more pure than 100%.  What I purchased it for is to lanolize wool diaper covers, and so far, I have been extremely pleased with it. Unbelievable value for how inexpensive it is and how little you need to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is excellent.  Unobtainable now in UK, so a great relief to find it in USA.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my expanding belly during pregnancy. I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use a lot of products. I had been using Eucerin, but around month 8 got stretch marks anyway. I switched to Lanolin based on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation and use another product which has herbs in it to help with the itching. Although the lanolin is a bit smelly, I put it on at night. My stretch marks are much less noticable than before and have not gotten worse. Wish I&#x27;d been using this all along!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also now using it on my baby&#x27;s skin for diaper rashes and otherwise. It also works great for her!</li>
            <li> I use this as chapstick. It&#x27;s moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t wear off for hours. Same goes for my heels. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a smell worth worrying about.</li>
            <li> A very nice lanolin that, when used in lip balm, yields a lasting, creamy experience that leaves lips silky and kissable. Not as &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; as other lanolins; therefore, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it in my homemade chapstick. Little bit goes a long way. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive pure lanolin product to replace the expensive breastfeeding product (in the purple package) from the local market. This one is very soft and smooth but doesn&#x27;t quite work the same. It has the same ingredients, so it&#x27;s kind of a mystery to me. This product has worked great on itchy, winter skin and for the price I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is a great skin protectant and moisturizer. I started using lanolin while breast feeding and mentioned that my fingers were not cracked this winter.  My husband also tried it since his hands get very dry from working on a computer all day.  This tub doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and has the consistency of lanolin in the tubes I had purchased before.  Unfortunately i don&#x27;t use this after breastfeeding since it does not state safe to use for babies like the other brand in the tubes, but i will use this for a general skin moisturizer. lanolin in general is very viscous, but it spreads easily once applied and slightly warmed by body heat.  This tub should last a long time and you can&#x27;t beat amazons price.</li>
            <li> As a nurse, I wash my hands constantly, not to mention using gallons of sani-gel type products. All the soap and alcohol really had my hands dried out to the point of cracking at the knuckles. I tried many many brands of lotion to relieve this problem. Pure lanolin has been one of only two things that can relieve this and keep my hands soft (the other is pure Emu oil). I highly recommend this to other nurses, medical personnel, farmers, or anyone constantly exposed to the outdoors or chemicals on their hands. I will be purchasing more in the future. Almost forgot... a little goes a LONG way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If your hands are really bad, slather on the first coat and stick your hands inside some zip-lock baggies and let it just soak in for 30-60 minutes for deep moisturizing. After that just usual lotion-like application works fine.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product that works.  My mom used this stuff on us kids when I was small....great to know it&#x27;s still available....if ya search hard enough you&#x27;ll find it.  Great Seller..</li>
            <li> i use lanolin to keep my heels smooth, and to keep my hands from drying out during winter    you can buy 2oz of processed lanolin, with the smell removed for about $15    you can buy a pound of unprocessed lanolin, with the smell of sheep for about $11    natural lanolin is anhydrous, dark in color, and has an odor to it    if you want lanolin that doesn&#x27;t smell, get the processed hydrous lanolin</li>
            <li> This is a new product for me, with using is for my hair I add to my butter base moisture and it make my hair feel like clouds its the soft.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in my local pharmacy at a much higher price.  It is no longer available locally except in small tubes which is very, very expensive and not at all practical for anyone who uses this in any quantity.  I do.  It is absolutely invaluable for anyone who likes to go barefoot but does not enjoy the cracked, splitting callouses that develop on heels.  Nightly use of this before bedtime eliminates the problem.  Anyhow, even including shipping, this was at a better price than I used to get buying it at a nearby store. The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because I really prefer \\&quot;hydrous\\&quot; lanolin (which has water mixed in and is a little easier to use) and this is \\&quot;anhydrous\\&quot; lanolin - no water and somewhat stickier.  Hydrous lanolin does not seem to be available anywhere at all.  This has been a very satisfactory substitute.</li>
            <li> Wife loves Lanolin. This product is pure and well priced</li>
            <li> Many reviews harp on the smell. I really like the smell, my girlfriend likes it, her friend who had dinner with us last night (this lady is into fashion and has her hair styled) liked the smell. It is a mild, natural, wooly and pleasant smell.    I work construction and rock climb a lot. In the winter I get the bad cracks on my fingers and the sides of my thumbs. I&#x27;ve tried the bag balm, the healing salves--the lanolin works the fastest and is a very good value. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. I use this for breast feeding and dry hands. Smells a little strong but not unbearable. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it to lanolize wool diaper covers for my baby. Great product - I need only small sweet pea size for wool soaker, so it will last a long time. It melts really nice in hot water, and covers whole diaper cover nicely. It has stronger smell when opened box than different product by Lansiloh, but you can&#x27;t beat the price, and and the smell isn&#x27;t that strong when on dried wool diaper cover.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Good lanolin.  Smells fine (like lanolin, but not at all offensive), feels fine, performs great.</li>
            <li> I am expecting my first child in 2 weeks and my doctor recommended that I use lanolin to keep my nipples supple prior to and during breastfeeding. I have been applying this product daily after showering and it seems to be working well. The true test will come once I start breastfeeding regularly.</li>
            <li> this works well for chapped lips, i had started drinking sea salt water and my lips became very dry, nothing was working, so I found good reviews on lanolin. it is very thick and softens your lips after a day or 2</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my breastfeeding needs and its so wonderful! It sure beats lansinoh for $10 for 2 oz.  I also use it for my little mans bum at changing time. I cannot praise this product enough! way better than desitin. Or vasaline.  Its not the greatest smelling...but if you want something that smells good you also will be getting artificial stuff which can make damaged skin worse. Besides who is smelling your kids bum or your udders anyways? :-)</li>
            <li> We are using this for our 1 year old&#x27;s horrible diaper rash. She has very sensitive skin, this product works really well. We prefer this over other cream we tried when we rash gets bad - mainly for overnight. (Also tried Balmex - our daily go-to, Triple paste, Aquaphor, and butt-paste (our least favorite)).</li>
            <li> Used this for homemade chapstick. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was suffering from very dry and chapped lips. The product works great! Better than any chapstick or lip balm. It is very soothing and moisturizing. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the smell. The scent is not very pleasant but you eventually get accustomed to it.</li>
            <li> Its thick but it keeps skin so well moisturized and it has a slight odor. I mix it with pure cocoa butter so the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> It contains no additives, so unless you are allergic to the lanolin itself, it makes a great base for skin creams.  I soften it with warm vegetable oil and add spice, scent or color as needed for my use.  Small batches keep the ingredients fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in good condition before the promised date and is about the same price as what I ordered through my pharmacy even with the shipping.</li>
            <li> This is truly amazing stuff. I bought it too revive some wool sweaters but I have been using it on my hands, face and lips as a moisturizer. It really lasts and penetrates and somehow does give the same &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling that many moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> This is very dense lanolin.  At first I wasn&#x27;t into it, but now I like the thickness of it.  I exclusively pump and this stuff has definitely soothed some boob issues.</li>
            <li> I put this on my belly (9 months pregnant and past my due date) with a little coconut oil and my skin is sooooo soft. Never felt this soft before even using other natural oils. Also worked great on my feet, knees, elbows and lips. Feels oily at first but after about an hour nap it soaks right in with no residue or oily feel. Also, smells really natural, stinky but not a bad stinky. The smell doesn&#x27;t stick after you are wearing the product. Hope you will enjoy as much as I am. Will review once I lanolize my wool diaper soakers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Live without it!  Even after washing my hands, I still have a protective barrier left!</li>
            <li> Non irritating for rashes. I like it.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff from a friend because of excessively dry skin and this works like a charm! no more dryness or itchiness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m re-ordering this one after trying the pharmaceutical and plain lanolin, this option works just fine and is a great price.  Lanolin is really great for dry skin, and I use it for a foot massage every night.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d be in for when the product arrived.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve every ordered/used pure lanolin before.  I thought it would softer but, apparently, lanolin in it&#x27;s pure state is more on the hard side.  It&#x27;s also very sticky when you first apply it but then it soaks in and works it&#x27;s magic.  I had to experiment with the amount I used on my hands and now know how much to apply.  It is wonderful for keeping my hands soft during these brutal winter months.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my knees and elbows but think it would feel &#x27;weird&#x27; on my feet.  All in all, I&#x27;m happy with the product (just as described) and the transaction went very well.</li>
            <li> Just had to comment after seeing the reviews complaining about the odor.  This is a high quality lanolin, and it smells just like it should.  It does not smell like a zoo or a barnyard, it smells like lanolin.  If you are looking for something without any odor, then you should stick to vegetable or petrochemical products (which won&#x27;t work a fraction as well for skin, hair, leather, etc.).  Also:  Like all anhydrous lanolin (meaning it has very low water content), this is not a lotion - it is thick and sticky, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Check the seller ratings before making an order.  One vendor was dishonest - charging my card and claiming a \\&quot;backorder\\&quot; on the product when I wrote them (that&#x27;s a big no-no on Amazon!).  The next had the product to me faster than I would have hoped, and was actually the cheapest.  Too bad Amazon can&#x27;t keep a tighter rein on the bad sellers and highlight the good ones.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and a large quantity making this a great buy. I will definetly order again. Wonderful for use by nursing mothers, skin dryness and chapped caloused heels,</li>
            <li> I use lanolin on my tuning slides for all of my brass instruments. It does a great job keeping them moving easily and lasts a long time without having to reapply. I have a very old compensating Euphonium that I especially rely on lanolin for. One jar will last you forever.</li>
            <li> Weird smell, not sure I want to use it to make lip balm.  May have to heavily sent to cover smell.</li>
            <li> Smells like any other natural lanolin and brings instant relief to cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago.  Just getting ready to re order.  I have been very happy with it.  Yes, its thick - After all it is LANOLIN!  I put it on my hands and wait a few seconds while it softens.  It will NOT get runny like hand lotion.  It is NOT hand lotion.  Some said it smells bad.  Well, it is LANOLIN and it smells like lanolin.  That should surprise no one.  It comes from the oil of sheep skin/wool.  One reviewer said it smelled like sheep.  What else would it smell like?  My nose doesn&#x27;t smell it unless I put my hand right up to my nose.  If you prefer the scent of wildflowers, I suggest buying some scented lotion maybe with lanolin as an additive.  I wash my hands a LOT because my daily routine soils my hands all day long.  I like this lanolin BECAUSE it is thick.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off the first time I wash my hands.  I can still feel it after washing my hands several times.  It helps to keeps my hands soft and prevents drying.  I live on the east coast in PA, and the winter air here is VERY drying. I wouldn&#x27;t use it if I was going through a receiving line shaking hands, but I do &amp;#34;wear&amp;#34; it around the house in the winter time and at night.  If you apply it an hour or so before bedtime, most of it will soak in before retiring or you can wear cotton gloves to bed.  I have done that if my hands or cuticles were severely dry. And to the reviewer who insisted that anyone who says it doesn&#x27;t stink is lying -  get a life.  IT SMELLS LIKE LANOLIN.  I don&#x27;t find it offensive.  Garlic smells like garlic.  Limberger cheese smells like limberger cheese.  Lanolin smells like lanolin.  I like this product, it works, and it is priced right.  I am happily reordering.</li>
            <li> My wife and I decided to try 100% pure lanolin as our baby kept getting rashes even with Desitin.  We have been amazed at the versatility of uses for this product - 1) ointment for babies&#x27; bottoms; 2) moisturizer for the hands, face, feet, anywhere; 3) great moisturizer for the eyelids and around the eyes in general.... At first I was a little \\&quot;sheepish\\&quot; (ha ha!) about smelling like a sheep.  The stuff does smell a little like sheep but we have actually grown to like the smell well enough.  It is a natural, light smell.  It does not leave any smell on your clothes or face. For instance, I put the moisturizer all over my face before going to bed at night.  In the morning, my face feels good and not greasy.  I believe this is because the lanolin absorbs so well into the skin.  Also, the lanolin leaves no lasting smell on your clothes, sheets, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using pure lanolin for our babies&#x27; bottoms for over 4 months now, and they have less rashes.  And we have recently ordered 4 more bottles. We also are users of Eucerin, Aquaphor, and good old petroleum jelly but this pure lanolin is much better for moisturizing and getting rid of dryness.  I use aquaphor before going out during the day b/c I don&#x27;t want to smell \\&quot;sheep-y\\&quot;.  My wife loves the stuff and even loves the smell so she has no issues going out with it on....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing.... sometimes when my skin feels itchy (i.e. possibly from dryness), I apply the lanolin and this soothes the itch.  Try this product.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I love lanolin! It is an excellent way to keep your lips moist.  Just a tiny bit gives full coverage, and you can apply it right over your regular lip color. It lasts longer on your lips than normal gloss does.</li>
            <li> It may not smell good but it is what our skin needs to stay smooth.  It&#x27;s better than dumping several toxins on your skin that are bad for you.  You can mix this with a few other products that are natural and make it smell better.  I am kind of tired of people who are so concerned with how they smell as if a product can make them smell better.  If you don&#x27;t smell good maybe you should bath more and use/eat more natural products. I smell very good all the time.. and I don&#x27;t need loads of alcohol and crap to make it so.  I bet I smell better than anyone who uses the crap that costs hundreds of dollars.  America needs to wake the hell up.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell a little fresher. It is a oily and 100% lanolin. Don&#x27;t expect a sweet smelling cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff you can get to relieve dry hands and lips. The plastic surgeon told me the best thing for dry skin is plain old lanolin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to. Need to spend 5-10 minutes working it into your skin before bedtime. I noticed in the AM that it was not something that washed off easily with soap and water. A couple of nights using this will go a long way towards soothing hands that have started to crack and bleed from dryness.</li>
            <li> My dad is a shepherd and this has a very faint scent of sheep but in a good way. Love it. I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m supposed to be doing with it, I think I&#x27;ll add it to my DIY pomade cause my hair is curly and sheep know how to rock curly hair. Learn from nature.</li>
            <li> This Lanolin is awesome for lanolizing Wool diaper covers. We use a grape sized glob with new covers. It dissolves well in hot water and makes for a great lotion on my hands afterwards.  We will keep this lanolin in our home even after our kids have long since potty trained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a little dab of a petroleum jelly based product to &#x27;calm down&#x27; my hair after washing it, and was looking for a non-petroleum alternative. This is it! It works much better (the way it rubs in, the slight stickiness and the added &#x27;volume&#x27;), and it feels much less greasy, especially after a couple of days. It has a slightly sweet smell that I don&#x27;t mind, and that fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any other people recommending this as a hair product, but I do. This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars since I&#x27;ve not used or ordered lanolin before, however, I did order other products from this company and they were all excellent quality so I&#x27;m sure this is as well. It is darker and I&#x27;m assuming because it&#x27;s pure and it smells like lanolin, so if you&#x27;re looking for some type of pleasing scent this won&#x27;t be it, but it certainly does not have a bad ordor...it smells like it should smell!</li>
            <li> I guess you&#x27;ve got to be an old person like me to sniff this product and automatically think--Band-aid! I think the modern bandages just don&#x27;t have the same smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it&#x27;s on, within about a minute or so, the smell basically fades away. I used it on my lips and thought that was kinda dumb because I&#x27;d be smelling it all day. But I either got used to the smell really quickly or it just faded. Either way, I&#x27;d say the odd smell isn&#x27;t too problematic for this product. I made lotion and added some orange and lavender oils and it really masked the smell very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has really helped with chapped skin. My hands were very dry from this 2014 Polar Vortex storm. I don&#x27;t even have to use the product every day--it&#x27;s like it sinks in and has really healed my skin. A little goes a long way so I won&#x27;t need to buy more very soon but I&#x27;m going to get this same NOW brand product. This is a great price, too!</li>
            <li> a lot of product for the price but it does have an odor to it that my other pharmaceutical grade lanolin lacks</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my tuba slides moving. It is super smelly but it does the job really well.</li>
            <li> The best for moisturizing my hair when I mix with other oils!</li>
            <li> I love the NOW brand and their lanolin does not disappoint.  Great quality and value.</li>
            <li> After age 50, my skin became so dry, also a Diabetic. I put on Aveeno Cream 1st, let soak in for 10 minutes, then put this Now brand Lanolin over it to work as a skin barrier cream at night. It is very, very sticky, too much so for daytime use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a Face Cream &amp; on eyes &amp; as a body cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Pure Lanolin!  I tried different creams for my baby&#x27;s diaper rash and none of the other stuff seemed to work.  I tried Pure Lanolin, and it seriously cleared the rash up within hours.  I use it as a preventative now and apply it on my baby 2-3 times a day.  I have never had a diaper rash since.</li>
            <li> I ordered this since it was more lanolin for the same price or less than other products, and disregarded the reviews about the smell because of it, but after opening the container I can tell you this stuff definitely smells like a barnyard and I can still smell it after applying it. If you think you can handle the barn animal scent then it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Put this stuff on your dry spots before you go to bed and after a few nights you&#x27;ll notice a difference. The cold dry winters here in Maine are rough on your exposed areas and this stuff helps. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to bother us at all.</li>
            <li> Most people buy lanolin as a skin cream, but I find that&#x27;s it&#x27;s very handy in the shop, too. Lanolin is an all-natural product that lubricates and protects metal, prevents rust, and won&#x27;t attack synthetics or cause crevice corrosion. It has excellent natural tackiness, and sticks well to metal surfaces. It won&#x27;t run in hot weather, and it had good lubricity in the cold. There are a number of collercial industrial lubes and gun lubes that use lanolin as an additive, but the pure stuff works great, and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY the best option for dry, wrinkly, cracked skin etc Just the smell and texture of this tells you that it is pure and does not have petroleum byproducts in it.&lt;br /&gt;We use it on dry, cracked skin, palms, feet and also as a base for home made skin cream and sunscreen. LOVE this stuff and have gotten it for my family as gifts.</li>
            <li> Pure lanolin is pure lanolin.  It arrived promptly and was reasonably priced.  Lanolin is a great emollient, although it is sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell great in larger quantities.  As a hand or foot cream it&#x27;s probably the best b ang for the buck</li>
            <li> This is seriously the ONLY thing that finally cured our baby&#x27;s diaper rash. Not zinc oxide, not vaseline, not Burts Bees -- nothing! Just a thin layer and within a week her bottom is smooth and clear!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic to avoid chapped hands. It only takes a pea sized drop to do both hands so a jar will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to Lanolize my wool diaper covers, and it was the cheapest I could find that was 100% Lanolin. I had lanolized my diaper covers before with Lasinoh, but it was way too cost prohibitive. So I ordered this, and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell like this. It smells like chewing tobacco. Also, the last time that I used it, it didn&#x27;t lanolize my covers nearly enough, so they&#x27;re leaking :\ I&#x27;ll have to try it again but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as high of quality as is used in Lasinoh.</li>
            <li> It works as described (sticky, goopy, smelly) and as needed. We use it for my husband&#x27;s marathon ocean swims to prevent chafing - we mix with a little petroleum jelly to help it spread around, and it&#x27;s still stuck on after three or four hours. He would prefer that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a sheep&#x27;s butt, but it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s sniffing himself a whole lot seeing as he&#x27;s immersed in water. For those that are not immersed in water, it smells a bit like wet dog. I use a dab of it on my hand eczema, which works pretty well. The smell dissipates after a while - it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and low smell. Smooth and stretchy, lanolin can be used in place of petroleum jelly and is thicker and more solid at room temperature.</li>
            <li> This has solved many winter skin problems for me. It&#x27;s thick stuff and can be hard to get off clothes and sheets, so be careful with it, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better for soothing winter skin.</li>
            <li> I threw this out after a few days.  It does the job of moisturizing severely dry skin- but it smells awful.  We started calling it barnyard balm and I finally threw it out.  Nobody would use it because it smells like sheep doo doo. If you already work with sheep or cows, it might be fine for you.   Next time I&#x27;m going for some kind of a scent purified lanolin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I like to use this every night, It does have a certain smell but it&#x27;s not so bad and you get used to it after awhile. Great product and will definitely last for awhile.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Has the earthy lanolin smell with a thick and gooey consistency much like petroleum jelly.  It absorbs well but also is greasy, I use it under gloves for overnight skin healing.  IMO, Nothing natural works as well as lanolin for soothing and moisturizing very dry, chapped skin.  It also works wonder for diaper rash.  NOW&#x27;s lanolin is affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> Good product....I make hair and skin products....never used lanolin but will continuing using this. Made my creams come out super smooth and extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great for brittle nail</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this 7oz tub of lanolin (more or less 1 cup) to &amp;#34;lanolize&amp;#34; wool diapers for my baby, which it is perfect for.  I also used it to help heal my older daughter&#x27;s chapped lips which she wouldn&#x27;t stop picking at, for a painful dry spot on my husband&#x27;s hand, and to help keep my long hair moisturized.... it has performed as expected in all of those tasks. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my homemade lotion.  Im sure it works great, but i CANNOT get over the smell of lanolin.  Even an 1/8 of a teaspoon overpowered a full batch (10 oz).  Ick.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the winter, coconut oil is not rich enough to provide the needed moisture and protection.  Lanolin does. I put a layer of coconut oil under so that I can move the thick lanolin around my face.  In 15 minutes, lanolin is absorbed completely into the skin. I also massage lanolin around my cuticles, rub on my doggie&#x27;s paws, use it as lip balm, even rub some on my hair at night for moisture and use it to shiny up my battered winter leather boots.  Rub some on tools to prevent rusting.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love! Looked everywhere for pure lanolin, the only thing that works for my little guys frequent diaper rashes. I was using nipple cream, but it was costing me an arm and a leg! Best stuff on earth and very reasonably priced! Bought 2 on first round and back for two more. I want to stock up while I can.</li>
            <li> Husband is bed ridden and we use the lanolin daily on his buttocks to prevent and heal bed sores.  It is the best product on the market for this purpose.  No others even come close to the healing properties in this jar.  It lasts a long time as it only takes a small dab to do the trick.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I tried everything else and nothing works as well on my hands.  I do a lot of art projects that all but strip the skin off me so need protection as well as  healing.  I don&#x27;t need more chemicals and this is the only purely natural product I can find.</li>
            <li> Very smoothing. Great product. Good packAging.  I would&#x27;buy it again and you should too. It is hard to say so much about. Lanolin</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my home made hair moisturizer it works really well to help my hair retain moisture. I love it and this brand is really ez to work with and it smells good too:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way cheaper than another one I got and it works just fine. The smell is not very noticeable either.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this to prevent chaffing from breast pumping and she likes it. I asked her if the smell bother her in any way and she said that it did not bother her. Great price for the quantity!</li>
            <li> WORK OUTSIDE IN THE COLD AND USE PURE LANOLIN ON FACE AND HANDS. CLEARED UP A DRY PATCH I HAD ON SIDE OF NOSE. HANDS ARE MUCH SOFTER AND SMOOTH CONSIDERING I AM A FREQUENT HAND WASHER.WORKING ON DRY ELBOWS AND FEET AND SEE IMPROVEMENT. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. WIFE SAYS SHE SMELLS A SLIGHT MUSKY SCENT BUT IT DOES NOT BOTHER HER OR ME. DOES NOT SOAK INTO THE SKIN LIKE OTHER LOTIONS, YOU WILL KNOW IT IS THERE 2 HOURS LATER...WORKING AND PROTECTING. WILL BE BUYING AGAIN WHEN I GET LOW. THE ONLY CON IS WHEN USED ON FACE IT MAY APPEAR GLOSSY OR GREASY LIKE VASOLINE.</li>
            <li> Used this to precondition and old baseball glove and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend mixing this into homemade lotions for eczema.  The relief it brought my daughter&#x27;s skin was almost instant.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been amazing from lanolozing wool, to treating cracked skin! However has a very natural barn&#x27;ish smell. Not completely terrible... I would buy again</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft lanolin. I had some that was so very sticky that it was hard to scoop out. I love using this. It is just the stuff for dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it claims to be.  And it smells like it too.  If you need something that doesn&#x27;t smell like a wet sheep, don&#x27;t buy it.  If you&#x27;re using it for soap, or leather, or boots, it&#x27;s great.  If you&#x27;re putting it on chapped pink parts that are beneath your nose, you may find the odor a bit offensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  The smell is trivial, unless you are using it on a large area, you won&#x27;t notice a thing.  We used this initially as a diaper cream, better than any of the creams out there!  A great barrier that doesn&#x27;t rub off (unlike Butt creams)  This stuff is great for eczema patches, dry skin, even chapped lips.  Great stuff for an amazing price, and it is all natural.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate it sooooo bad. It stinks sooooo bad that I cannot even stand to open the jar, much less has it on my body. I tried mixing it with some heavily scented lotion and that did not even help.</li>
            <li> I use it on both my feet and hans overnight. Very sticky, even turned my gloves yellow. I&#x27;m not sure it works ideally. But it does feel better in the morning, but it seems you can&#x27;t stop using it. It only shows &#x27;instant&#x27; effect, not chronicle improvement.</li>
            <li> Thick, pure, Lanolin!  No fillers or junk to dilute it.  I use it on my hands daily--especially before putting on gloves.  This is the only thing that seams to help with the psoriasis on my hands.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my hands and feet soft. Workd very well, also works well on my face if I keep it away from the oily area right around my nose. If I rub it in pretty well it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is good lanolin, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey for how much you get and not so easy to melt into your skin as another brand I&#x27;ve gotten.  Melts very slowly.  I took off a star for price paid vs. quantity delivered.</li>
            <li> good stuff! use it on ballgloves, soars---just about everything like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure lanolin and worked well in my mustache wax recipe (50/50 lanolin and beeswax).</li>
            <li> I had a cold sore on my lip that would not go away with any other preparations, I put this product on it, and it was gone in one day. Very nice and pure product.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty intense. I&#x27;m not awfully sensitive with smells but this product does smell. It is a problem? Depends. If you use it on your cracked heels at night, no one cares. If you plan on using it on more exposed areas of your skin during the day I would pick a odorless pharmaceutical grade lanolin instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a body cream for salt water swimming.  It smells strongly like lanolin as I would expect from a natural product.  This isn&#x27;t the same as barnyard animal stank to me.  I wanted the more unrefined version so that it would contain a higher variety of natural lipids that would more closely mimic my skin&#x27;s variety of lipids.  I melted it gently over the stove to make my swimmer&#x27;s cream, and the product became clear, indicating it is also quite pure in that it contains no undissolved solids.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how my cream turned out!</li>
            <li> I wanted to recreate Burts Bees LipBalm since all my friends love that stuff but the price for it can become a little to much, So i found a great replica recipe and now they stopped buying it and ask me to make some more for them, All i need to do is find some non-liquid food coloring to make them tinted.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need.  A great for moisturing hands/feet especially during the winter months.  Too thick to use alone, must mix with oil. This pure lanolin has a smell and is very thick compare to the liquid lanolin.  Because of this, it is harder to mix than the liquid lanolin.  Once it melts, it goes well with oils such as jojoba, avocado oil, apricot oil and works great to hydrate the skin. The smell do disappear after a few minutes.  I rub the lanolin/oil mixture on my hands &amp; feet at night and the next morning, they are very soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Lanolin is great to hydate and soften skin, but I will stick with the LIQUID lanolin, which is easier to work with and has no smell.  This jar will last you forever.</li>
            <li> The pure lanolin I ordered was just as I expected it to be, and much cheaper than the brands available in stores near me, even with the shipping charges. It is an excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this before I spent way too much on another product that works just the same. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has dry fingertips that split (which can be very painful) Not only that but for any type of DRY skin, Like bottom of foot, heels, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after lanolin has soaked in.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s and I&#x27;m not a believer in high-priced cosmetics and moisturizers.  I have good skin naturally so I&#x27;d like to keep it that way so I use natural products as much as possible.  The oils that I like on my skin are Coconut Oil and 100% organic Argan Oil (cold-pressed of course).  Given the thickness of the lanolin, I&#x27;ve found coconut oil to work best in thinning this down to a consistency that will spread and absorb easily.  I just mix it up in my hands by the way.  The coconut oil also minimizes the smell of the lanolin.  Argan oil does an okay job with the smell but Argan oil seems to absorb onto my skin more quickly than the lanolin because I&#x27;m just mixing it in my hands.  This is also the first thing that goes on my lips as soon as I&#x27;m out of the shower.  Also if I&#x27;m not wearing lipstick, this is the stuff I put on my lips to keep them moisturized.  Works so much better than any chap stick or lip balm on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lanolize my wool diaper covers. It worked well, but has a strong lanoline smell, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking for the same purpose. It worked well when emulsified and applied to my covers, though.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  It is healing up a very dry cracked spot on my hand.  Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Love this lanolin!!  Price is great, keeps my skin looking great throughout the year!</li>
            <li> Very thick and effective on moisturizing.  A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> It does have a smell to it, not overpowering, but very persistent. The Lanolin, however, is exactly what was wanted &amp; does what I need.</li>
            <li> Super sticky and smelly.  By some of the comments I read I thought the smell would dissipate once the lanolin was rubbed into the skin well, but it stuck with me all day.  I have to heat it with a hairdryer to make it soft enough to apply to the skin.  It&#x27;s super thick and sticky and does not absorb well, contrary to other reviews I&#x27;ve read.  I feel it heavy on my skin all day.  I wish I had ordered the scented lanolin cream I saw on Amazon instead.  Lanoline definitely has excellent benefits, but I most likely will never use the majority of the contents of this tub because of the downsides.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work but my husband hated the smell so much I had to give it away. But very think must be moisturizing</li>
            <li> BOught this for my mom who often has to use it because of rashes on her bottom. She hasnt been able to find anything (before this) that didnt sting or irritate her bottom until this product! She told me this is the best stuff out there as it soothes her and helps with the itching. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fabulous! The product smells like lanolin-not an unpleasant scent at all. I would buy this product again. It takes a minute to work it into my skin (expected) but after few minutes my hands are silky smooth for hours (or until I wash the dishes again).</li>
            <li> This is really pure lanolin and has to be heated to liquify for use.  Otherwise it is like trying to rub a bar of soap into your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good Lanolin! Good quality for good price. I have sore, cracked, dry painful skin on my hands because of Eczema. This product helps me. There is a scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like a barnyard or sheep! It smells like some ointment.</li>
            <li> It leaves your  hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I use this as cuticle oil, lip balm, for cuts, dry skin, diaper rash etc. endless uses</li>
            <li> Nice, creamy lanolin.  I&#x27;m a big fan of lanolin and decided to try this brand...so glad I did.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I had heard about lanolin through /skincareaddicts to use on chapped lips and it has been really good! My lips and fingers dry/crack up easily and especially in the cold.</li>
            <li> Good product, a little on the expensive side. As described.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong...</li>
            <li> Nothing better than lanolin for treating dry, natural rawhide drum heads, like congas, bongos, etc. Works great to treat drummers&#x27; hands too, if you care about that sort of thing. Just a little (very little) on your hands, rub it in and go play your drums for awhile. This small container has enough lanolin in it to last me for years of treating drum heads. Pure lanolin, no alcohol, fragrance etc.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It really helps with dry cracking skin. However, it does have a smell to it. You can get more processed lanolin that doesn&#x27;t have the smell but I&#x27;m ok with smelling like wet sheep for a little bit. Just put it on at night and the put socks over the area to keep it from getting everywhere. I&#x27;m sure you could mix it with something else to help mask the smell but I don&#x27; find it necessary to do so.</li>
            <li> Looks like earwax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like... idk, sheep earwax?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to lanozine some wool I was recycling into diapers and nursing pads, and although I did not use them heavily, it seamed to work because I didn’t have urine or milk soak through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used under my nose when I’ve had really bad allergies so that I don’t rub it raw with all the nose blowing. Not the most pleasant smell, but doable, and a good protectant.</li>
            <li> Yes, there&#x27;s a scent. It is mild and goes away quickly. The scent is not an issue for me.  My focus is on cost and effects. It costs far less than comparable options, and it really works. I have tried a slew of products for dry, cracked feet - this has been the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> as explained in other reviews, this one is this cheap because it&#x27;s unprocessed, meaning, for lanolin, that it is very efficient, but oh my this thing stink like an old forgotten drawer in a house with humidity problems!! very efficient but wow...</li>
            <li> If you have any skin problems then this is a must have. If you want to stay young longer then you NEED this now. If I had the money I would buy this for every pretty girl I saw so they would stay that way longer.</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than the tiny tube lanolin; great for first weeks of nursing, and on baby&#x27;s bottom--starting to use it on super dry feet or elbows.  smells earthy but not a bad smell to me</li>
            <li> Great value! High quality product!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and what I expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, can&#x27;t beat the price for lanolin - works great, and is nice and clean (if you&#x27;ve ever got stuff directly from a farm, you would know that this can be a problem).  Still has a slight smell to it - but that&#x27;s almost to be expected from a tub of this size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I use this to make a lanolin wash for my wool items.  Its pure lanolin and works wonderfully for my purpose.  It smells like lanolin- not too strong in my opinion, and not too refined either.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it, especially a greater substitution for vaseline (petroleum) that my wife used to use on her self &amp; our young daughter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and thick, just as expected. It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in, yet also hard to wash off. It also has a distinct smell, which took me about a week to get used to. Once I got used to it, it&#x27;s not that bad. I guess it may be a different story had I been pregnant.</li>
            <li> The price for this is amazing. I was purchasing lanolin from local stores for breastfeeding and it was more money and a whole lot less product.  This will last me a long time! It doesn&#x27;t have a horrible strong smell, it smells like a bigger container of lanolin.</li>
            <li> Truly moisturizing and Hemp products are also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> We use cloth diapers and this product is great.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, slightly &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; until rubbed on your hands.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Melts away in water wonderful to lanolize my cloth diaper wool covers. Enough to last forever!</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. It is so thick it is almost unusable as it comes straight out of the jar. What I do is to find a good but not too costly liquid moisturizing product and stir this in until the thick stuff becomes more malleable. Then I smear it on my feet, wrap my feet in cellophane wrap and the next day my tootsies are gorgeous, not a callus in sight. In summer, sandal time, I do this once a week. This system  works even if I didn&#x27;t take a bath first. If you soak your feet first, you only have to do this once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> It was as it was described.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is a must for nursing mothers, particularly with a newborn.  Healing to nipple trauma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sons love this for chapped lips.  It works overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with castor oil  (equal parts, maybe, I didn&#x27;t measure) and melted them together on very low heat.  It made a creamy salve that is perfect for dry chapped hands.  The salve is greasy but it works and is safe and natural.</li>
            <li> Good quality at a great price. One tub will last forever. I use it to make salve for my wife. If you don&#x27;t like the smell try melting it together with a 1/3 oil (jojoba or almond are good choices), 1/3 bees wax, 1/3 lanolin and a couple drops of essential oil you like. Heat in the microwave. Done. Best cream money can buy.</li>
            <li> I use this product to lubricate the turnbuckles on my sailboat.  It is nearly water proof and provides excellent lubrication and corrosion protection on the bronze turnbuckles on my 44 year old Morgan 24</li>
            <li> purchased this for our little one&#x27;s bottom. couldn&#x27;t be happier and have ordered numerous times. much better value than any thing out there</li>
            <li> For the price and function this produce it great.  I couldn&#x27;t live with out lanolin while I was breastfeeding my boy.  My one thing that I didnt like was the yellow stain it left on my washable breastpads.  Not a big deal, but thats why I gave it a 4 star.  The other more expensive brands must do something to take the pure lanolin color away.</li>
            <li> In the last year I developed a horrible case of dishydrotic eczema on my feet which was spreading to my hands. I bought this lanolin hoping it would help soften the thick, dry, scaling that resulted from this condition (after trying just about everything else). I apply this every day and the healing of my skin has been nothing short of miraculous. It even helps calm the unbearable itching. In less than 2 months the skin on my feet is now completely smooth. Sure, the smell is not \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; nor like heavily fragranced lotions and cosmetic skin applications, but it&#x27;s not horrible either. After a short time, you get used to the natural odor of this lanolin. Further, once applied, it lasts for a long time, even after washing dishes my hands are still hydrated and smooth. This product is well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Sure - it goes on like axel grease...but it is unbeatable for dry, itchy skin.  Use it on my baby who suffers from extremely dry skin and eczema right after her bath and and her skin is soft and smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I supposed it is a very pure lanolin.  What I did not expect is it has a fairly strong odor when I made it into lotion.</li>
            <li> This product has an awful smell and a different texture than other brands of lanolin. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the low price, buy other brands before choosing this.</li>
            <li> Lanolin is awesome!!! lived in Australia for a bit. good for the hands, diaper rash, anti-sieze of threads on a bolt, boat building. look it up if you don&#x27;t believe me. Great Natural product for the world.</li>
            <li> Most lip balms really do not go a great job at protecting and moisturizing lips for an extended time after application. They quickly dry and lose effectiveness. Lanolin presents a thick weight heavy moisturizer that stays on lips, works really well even with only a light coating, can help speed healing, and is fantastic for extremely dry/cracked lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lanolin is good. It is pure, with almost no scent, consistent in thickness, and does not have any added products, byproducts, or dirt. The containers they use are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is really price given lanolin is expensive and these products are more expensive than a gigantic jar of lanolin due to the packaging requirements. While I use this as a lip balm, lanolin can be used on other parts of the skin in need of intense moisturizers plus protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give this a try and compare to your current lip balm or moisturizer. I think you will be floored by the difference. Not only does it moisturize more, but it also does a MUCH better job at protecting lips and skin from damage such as wind burn.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my very sore nipples (breastfeeding). It smells like sheep, so not something I was comfortable putting in my son&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use as a tuning slide grease for brass instruments.  Mix with mineral oil for a faster slide.  Holds well and lasts.</li>
            <li> This is the very best out of a dozen different ointments for the bottom I have tried. No more open wounds or sores. The BEST!</li>
            <li> I bought this to make some foot balm (to emulate &amp;#34;bag balm&amp;#34;).  It worked well and smells just like Bag Balm.  This is a good price on this much Lanolin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for extremely dry skin (e.g., feet area). You may not like the smell or the thickness though.</li>
            <li> Works great - fraction of cost of Lansinoh brand, I wish I knew about  this brand on Amazon before.  This item works well on very dry skin and helps keep feet from getting hard and calloused.  Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have the lasinoh lanolin and prefer this type. It&#x27;s more soothing, rubs in better and protects more. Plus Its much cheaper than the other kinds. So worth it!</li>
            <li> This is pure but not ultra-purified lanoline, I&#x27;ve used Lansinosh first and in comparison this is slightly heavier and smellier, but it&#x27;s a better product and a better-priced product per ounce than store-bought varieties (like CVS).</li>
            <li> I bought this product for lanolizing my son&#x27;s wool diaper soakers.  It works wonderfully for that, and the price was right, definitely!  (I can&#x27;t believe people buy Lansinoh for this purpose, because it&#x27;s practically like buying liquid gold.  SO EXPENSIVE for that purpose.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little did I know that I would use this for so much more!  I love having it handy, and have used it for the following purposes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s diaper rash (works better than any other cream I have used.  Just be sure to put in a liner!  It does strip out of diapers easily by using blue Dawn though, as I had to discover after forgetting to tell my husband to make sure to use a liner...  Oops!  No harm done, though!)&lt;br /&gt;On my son&#x27;s eczema (I smear it on like lotion before putting him in his jammies.  It is like a miracle!)&lt;br /&gt;Chapped lips and face&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;To put over cuts and such to provide water resistance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback may be the smell.  It is 100% pure, so it does have what I like to call a &#x27;sheepy&#x27; smell.  This isn&#x27;t a problem for me, because I was raised around sheep, so it&#x27;s somewhat nostalgic.  My husband, on the other hand, is not so appreciative of picking up our baby who smells like a little tiny sheep.  He thinks it stinks.  But since little man is so sensitive to anything perfumed, this is the way to go for me!  If the smell of lanolin bothers you, you may want to go with the really expensive kind, such as Lansinoh, or maybe a perfumed kind, such as Pure and Simple New Zealand.  But for me, this is fantastic, and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all reviews. I have to say that i expected it too smell really bad, but also i expected that it will do the trick for my cracked from cold hands and feet. I have to say that I was surprised when i opened the container- the smell was not too bad! And after application it was almost gone.  So applied Lanolin on my bad looking hands and feet, and i have to say that after first time my hands look and feel so much better. Feet feels already better and smoother too!&lt;br /&gt;So  great product!</li>
            <li> Bought three jars of this stuff. One for each grandchild and for dry hands. What a nice product. Very happy. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> perfect for my rough heels</li>
            <li> Excellent product that helped manage severely dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> Very good quality lanolin ... don&#x27;t think about the smell. You will just get used to it. A slight grease and papaya smell ...</li>
            <li> the best for any skin ailment... chap lips, skin, cheeks, diaper rash, etc.</li>
            <li> Product was great.  It gave a non-polar protective layer on top of damaged skin.  Shipping and handling was rough.  Multiple dents in jar, lid cracked, inside of bubble mailer had product on it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3RRQW40PHVGU7]]Sorry the mic built into my computer isn&#x27;t that great. Hope you can hear me. I didn&#x27;t feel like typing up a review, so I made a video review instead.</li>
            <li> The odor of this product is very unpleasant.  I can only use it at night on my feet with cotton socks.  The liquid lanolin from Now Foods has a more tolerable odor.</li>
            <li> This stuff has great healing properties and uses in cosmetics or lotion bars however it smells awful and is extremly hard to mask. I suggest buying the refined stuff works just as well without the odor</li>
            <li> Ive had severe chapped lips this year like NEVER before in my life. I read blogs to try to find&lt;br /&gt;the best remedy. This product did it within 48 hours. Excellent value &amp; fast shipper!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I use it on my daughter that has severe ezcema and it worked overnight</li>
            <li> Love. This. Very. Good Thank. You</li>
            <li> Just what is described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick and sticky.  Those wanting it for skin application may prefer a thinner dilution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it to mix with anhydrous alcohol for a metal lubricant.  It works for that, but it separates out and one has to shake the bottle before use.  Maybe a more liquid one of those would work better, maybe not.</li>
            <li> Now Pure Lanolin is a very good quality. This is my first time to purchase lanolin so I didn&#x27;t know how thick it would be. Really thick. But after mixing it with other oils and ingredients it really worked great. I wanted to make home made suntan lotion for me and my kids because of the bad stuff in store brands. With this lanolin my recipe turned out great and for the first time my daughter actually tanned instead of getting red and sunburned. Our skin looked so good after being all day at the pool everyone was surprised. Very good product and great price too.</li>
            <li> Nothing is as moisturizing as pure lanolin but it&#x27;s not easy to apply in its solid form.  I mix this with shea butter, coconut oil and argan oil and whip it to a lovely creamy texture that is a pleasure to apply.  By adding the argan oil and some water, the combination whips up beautifully and remains in the creamy state.  Most purchased moisturizing creams and lotions have a frightening list of artificial ingredients, even hydrogenated oil which I wouldn&#x27;t eat and don&#x27;t want to apply to my skin either.  And further, many purchased creams don&#x27;t give a lasting effect.  Mostly they smell good, but that&#x27;s about all you can say for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to use more pure and natural organic products but shea butter, coconut oil and lanolin are all solid at room temperature and not easy to apply.  I was thrilled to find that they could be whipped together to produce such a delicious feeling cream that is super effective.  Now all my friends and relatives are asking for my cream.</li>
            <li> It is really smelly! Like sheep. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using this much.</li>
            <li> Great product - reasonable price - add a little to regular lotion to add to the moisturizing effects of the lotion. Does seem to help scabs, scars, and even small wounds. Good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my wool diaper covers and do really like it. After 9 months, I still have a mostly full container, so economically-speaking, this is good. I read some articles recently about how lanolin can contain a lot of residual chemicals from sheep being &amp;#34;dipped&amp;#34; in chemical baths to contain fleas, which apparently is standard practice. I mean really really bad chemicals. So....I wish there was an organic version out there but I just don&#x27;t see one. This is a good alternative, but for that reason, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on skin/in skincare. Has been working great for my woolies though.</li>
            <li> I have been using lanolin for the last year and it keeps my skin super soft.  It smells like lanolin, which I happen to like.  It does not continue to smell after a few minutes on my skin.  The price is absolutely excellent.</li>
            <li> Great product....its pure and its a legit product. I put some on my feet...smooth instantly!! I also put some on my hands, feels smooth as well. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! Very sticky!</li>
            <li> This is a great natural additive to lotions to make them thicker and to lock moisture into the skin but oh boy the smell is strong.  I even tried adding several oils to combat the barn like scent but the lanolin overpowers them.  I probably just added too much of it and need to re-proportion my ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little sticky (greasy) even when mixed with other ingredients, so its (in my opinion) better for a bedtime lotion.</li>
            <li> I make my own facial lotion with Lanolin and Shea butter, also 1/3 of water. It works very well with my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lanolin does smell a bit, but not strong for me. Maybe some people will think it&#x27;s strong like my husband.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my face. Nothing would ever moisturize well and I always had flakes. Using this, my skin is no longer dry. I am sure it would not be good for everyone. Some might break out from it, but so far, for me, I have not had any breakouts. And I love that there are no scary ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this for diaper rashes and it works perfectly, it clears the rash up in 2 days!</li>
            <li> using as a lube for reloading / case sizing and work excellently....and the skin on my fingers doesn&#x27;t crack in the winter.</li>
            <li> This works well for my dog&#x27;s dry skin areas.  Seems completely pure.</li>
            <li> Great for use on wool diaper covers, soaker pads, etc.  We also put a dab of it on our daughter&#x27;s skin to keep urine away from her diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I use this to lanolize wool diaper covers and it works well. I also discovered that I can rub it on my hands before doing dishes to prevent them from getting horribly dry and cracked since it doesn&#x27;t rinse off in water. Also, it smells like lanolin, no getting around that. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong at all and I sort of like it. Some people seem to be extra sensitive or something.</li>
            <li> Bought from Nature and Herbs &amp; fulfilled by Amazon. Best price so far. under $9. seal on bottle intact, i.e., new product. as it should be. Reading all bad reviews, I expecting horrible smell. personally, I like the smell. better than bengay. Lanolin smell does not permeate entire room of 15fts radius. bengay will do that. so far after 10 applications over 3 days, my eczema fingers getting better. hope not placebo effect. Too early to tell. If lanolin works, it so much cheaper than doctor specialist co-pay. First ever buying Now product. after this positive exprience, I will continue buying Now products &amp; products sold by Nature and Herbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1question to anyone who knows the answer. WHAT the expiration date of this lanolin? Bottom of bottle has some numbers. I don&#x27;t understand &amp; unable to decode.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product curious as to what it would smell like, being familiar with sheep smell, having handled sheep and bundled wool after shearing, and it is one of my least favorite aromas from childhood.  Received the lanolin and immediately opened to see what I had ordered.  I was pleasantly surprised with the smell which was very mild and kind of pleasant.  I immediately rubbed a small amount on my left knee which had been scaly and whitish from being chapped and the next day was much improved and the following day looked almost normal.  I was amazed since creams hadn&#x27;t fazed the knee.  This is an amazing product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Now Foods Pure Lanolin because my hands get so dry and crack.  I work outside in the cold so I mean DRY.  I smear the lanolin, yes smear as it is really thick, all over my hands and then I pull a pair of those bedtime gloves on my hands.  I pay particular attention to my fingertips.  I have done this five times and it has helped my hands.  It has a neutral scent.  Remember, it is really thick and I have to put gloves on over the lanolin, but it does work.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to lanolize my wool diaper covers. It gets the job done and is so much cheaper than using the popular nipple cream. It does have a &amp;#34;sheepy&amp;#34; smell, but I don&#x27;t mind that. The smell goes away once the wool is dry.</li>
            <li> I had wanted another brand of Hydrous Lanolin which is apparently no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;This was a substitute.  It does the job on my Winter hands, but it has an unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;smell as natural lanolin does.  Just have to live with it.  If you have a really bad time&lt;br /&gt;with cracked skin in the Winter, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Lifetime supply of Lanolin...</li>
            <li> I use it on my foot and for my dog&#x27;s paws too.  It is not smell that bad like some user described.&lt;br /&gt;Most of time my dog and I are very sensitive about some scent, but my dog seems ok with this one and it really heals his paw specially during the rough winter season.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick and hard to use.</li>
            <li> This lanolin is amazing. Used on several different skin ailments, all with positive results. Even used in place of a steroid cream on hands and worked beautifully. Very heavy so I use at night just before I crawl into bed. Intense moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This item was returned as this product is a semi solid a gel. I thought it was a liquid was a desent price compared to most. But after having to pay to return it and not used.</li>
            <li> I have been using lanolin for some time now for severely dry skin. Unfortunately this product had an medicine odor that makes it very difficult to use. It simply doesn&#x27;t seem to be as purified as other brands of lanolin I&#x27;ve used. I would not recommend this product and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was using Lansinoh Lanolin to lanolize my wool diaper covers at a huge cost difference. This lanolin is just as good at a far better price. i couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Some people complained about the smell of this product but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice anything outside of a usual lanolin smell. Lanolin has a particular smell its that simple. It smells like Lanolin should and its not a bad smell by any means. This came in such a big jar that I no longer felt guilty about using it for other things too, like my dry feet. It worked beautifully. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used to lanolize my wool cloth diapers. Great price compared to some other brands. Would definatly recommend. Don&#x27;t know what others use it for :)</li>
            <li> Totally amazing-- the only thing that would soothe my lips when I was on Accutane. Smells a little like sheep on its own. I used the pure stuff to sleep with. I cut it with coconut oil, beeswax, honey, and rosemary oil for a nice lip balm for daytime use.</li>
            <li> Now products are all I buy stuffs great</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been looking for and will buy more.  I have a skin condition similar to psoriasis and, so far, pure lanolin seems to be the only natural treatment that does any good.  Finding pure lanolin is not the easiest thing to do so I gave this product a chance and I am so happy that I did.  It is great and I will stocking up on it as this condition can only be controlled but it never goes away.  I, too, have been using it on my cuticles because with fall here and winter to soon follow behind, it is so easy to have my hands and cuticles become dry and cracked.  Thank you seller and Amazon.</li>
            <li> but i dont like the barnyard scent.  i mixed it with some (ok.. a lot..) lilac soap scent oil and it covered the &amp;#34;barnyardiness&amp;#34; fairly well.  when i put it on at night the barnyard scent is gone by morning but the lilac sent remains. that was an unexpected surprise. :) will buy again and some stronger soap scent.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this brand of lanolin. Can&#x27;t say enough about the excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Naturally wonderful!  Excellent product!  Perfect for chapped lips or dry hands.  No worries on harmful ingredients such as petroleum/petrolatums, this is 100% natural from the wool of those cuddly sheep.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, thanks for quick shipping</li>
            <li> I have been ordering 2 of these per year for the past two years.  Lanolin works wonders on baby diaper rash, rough spots, sore noses, minor cuts and scrapes.  I had no idea how awesome it is and this is the best deal for your money!</li>
            <li> Definitely has the strong lanolin smell, but it works.</li>
            <li> Great for dry cracked hands. Sticky for 5-10 minutes until absorbed, then no need to apply lotion all day. I&#x27;m a nurse so I wash my hands several times an hour and don&#x27;t have time to lotion up all the time.</li>
            <li> I used this to lanolize some wool diaper covers. They came out great! This lanolin is cheaper than everything else I could find, doesn&#x27;t smell, worked great.</li>
            <li> Smells like wet sheep! Bought this for nursing because it was inexpensive compared to other lanolins. Made the milk stink and the smell wouldn&#x27;t wash out of the nursing pads. Will stick with the more expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this product to make my own tanning lotion. It worked really good!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell to see how well it would or wouldn&#x27;t work for my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very sticky and doesn&#x27;t smell that great. You get a bunch of it and you kind of don&#x27;t want to use it because it is so annoyingly sticky. I&#x27;m sure it works great but ugh, so sticky.</li>
            <li> Ok enough.  Not sure I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> This a good company and this Lanolin is a great quality. It&#x27;s just the right size for small jobs.</li>
            <li> I have never used lanolin before, instead seeking a skin creme to solve dry and severely cracked skin. I do not find smearing this stuff around very pleasant yet it works so well that I no longer care. Fantastic for my mechanics hands after a day in the shop and for my feet after a day running around barefoot. I only wish I had tried it decades ago.</li>
            <li> My horsey neighbor told me Bag Balm was the stuff to get for dry skin, but I saw from reviews that BB stinks of gasoline and contains toxins banned in healthier countries.  So i searched for pure lanolin and this is it.  THICK.  I have four different moisturizers scattered through the house so I can&#x27;t say if this works better than others, but I really like that it is one natural ingredient.  The aroma doesn&#x27;t bother me, but then, my house smells like a barn because of those horses next door.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible heat rash that I healed by drying it out. Once it was dry, all of my skin was terrible dry as well. I ordered this because it was all natural, no dies or fragrance. I was expecting an oil like substance, but this is more like a wax. Once I was getting the dryness under control, I mixed it with some smelly lotion and it turned out great! It is a very thick substance, that moisturizes extraordinarily well!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pure lanolin and the price is amazing but it does smell like band aids.  It works awesome at healing any skin condition and to lanolize wool soakers.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s my recipe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1C shea butter [[ASIN:B002N6SBJ6 32oz. African FILTERED CREAMY Shea Butter from Ghana]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2T Lanolin (this stuff)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2T coconut oil [[ASIN:B0009P4PZC Cococare Coconut Oil -- 4 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1T Vitamin E oil or jojoba oil [[ASIN:B0000535TD Jason Natural Cosmetics Pure Beauty Oil, 5,000 IU Vitamin E Oil - 4 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;warm it all in a pan till melted and mixed.  pour into baby food jars, used lotion tubs, or for a perfect packet into GoTubbs[[ASIN:B0095Q51O0 GoTubb, Medium, 3 Count]] which let you open them with one hand while the other is holding the feets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let cool for a bit, pop it in the fridge (essential) overnight and then take out and use.  After it&#x27;s been in the fridge magic happens and it gets solid and stays that way, but stays easy to spread.  adjust the jojoba/coconut oil to change viscosity.</li>
            <li> did not really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sticky and not so great smelling.  I&#x27;m surprised that my LO didn&#x27;t seem to mind it as much as I did.  I bought 2, and they sit practically unused after 4 months.</li>
            <li> This product works well even though it is a little sticky. It has been very effective moisturizing my dry lips. I do not use it outside thought.</li>
            <li> Great but really stinky.  I think there are other brands that smell more mildly.  My poor kid smells like a wet lamb when I put this on him!</li>
            <li> Could not use this because it smelled so bad.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for lanolizing your babies wool diaper covers.  Yes, it does have a stronger odor than the commonly sold brand.  At a fraction of the cost, I will take the little stronger odor. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell that reminds me of sheep on the farm as a kid, but I am hyper sensitive to smells. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and love it; however, after randomly doing some research on lanolin I was surprised to find that it has residual pesticides in it from the cleaning of sheep&#x27;s wool before processing it to take out the oils &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up switching over to a pharmaceutical grade lanolin that has been purified with no pesticides. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else on my lips or (once) dry and cracked hands...</li>
            <li> I have used pure lanolin before, but in liquid form. This is version is great for spreading on the body, and less messy. A little bit goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily on my lips, and it keeps them from getting too chapped. I much prefer it to petrochemiccal based lip products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using this daily on a new surgical scar, and it seems to be doing a great job of healing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this came in a tube so it could be more easily applied while keeping it sterile.</li>
            <li> This is definitely what he was looking for to keep his skin from flaking and peeling so much, and one weekly application is all he&#x27;s asked for, done after cleaning, drying, and applying antifungal ointment.</li>
            <li> I had never tried lanolin before ordering here on amazon. I am starting to make my own skin care products and through some research discovered that lanolin would be great for a lip balm! I have not added this product to any of my lip balm recipes yet but I have used it directly on my lips. It has a good amount of drag and it not greasy. You could consider it a little sticky.. but not much. I also found that the smell is not as bad as many have made is sound! I am elated that I decided to purchase this product and I am sure it will be a great addition to my products.</li>
            <li> good quality and just what i expected</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonably priced.  I am using it to make my own hand lotion and this will meet my purposes</li>
            <li> I sent it back.  The odor was like old duplicate receipt paper chemical smell.  If this is what lanolin is supposed to smell like, I am going to have to rethink my lip balm recipe.  I ordered a different brand.  Hopefully it will not smell like this.  I never got past the smell to use it for anything.  I&#x27;m sorry if this is how it is supposed to smell, but I could not take it.  I definitely could not put it on my lips.</li>
            <li> This works for my other remedies and the thickness of it keeps the other stuff from being to thin. I like it for my heat rub especially as it helps keep from drying out the skin</li>
            <li> Yes, lanolin is an animal product. It&#x27;s a wax naturally produced by sheep to make their fleeces waterproof, and is extracted during the routine sheering and wool treating process. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the fluffy cute sheepies at all, so even the most snooty of vegans and vegetarians should probably shut up and slap this stuff on your skin. It&#x27;s probably the best moisturizer and protective barrier you can get that isn&#x27;t petroleum based (Hey, isn&#x27;t petroleum dead dinosaurs?! OH THE HORROR. SAVE THE DINOS!) or full of synthetic crap that can do more harm that good. It absorbs well, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and conditioned. I bought this to make lip balm with, since it&#x27;s one of the only things that work. Your body needs natural lipids to maintain moisture, and this stuff is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell? Yeah, there&#x27;s a bit of a smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like a barnyard. It smells like good quality lanolin, and a little bit goes a long way on your hands and feet in the winter. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This lanolin is softer and more pungent than the other brands I have tried but seems to work well. The smell is a bit like a wet dog to me but the comfort of having my baby suck on my hands after I put it on and not worry about toxic chemicals is worth the smell factor.</li>
            <li> Great value, works well for dry, cracked skin.  Not the greatest smell, but if you can get over it, it&#x27;s so much better of a value than the lansinoh nipple cream.  I use it for that, and my husband uses it for his knuckles (after I convinced him that it&#x27;s sheep sebum, not , well, you know...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with eczema for most of my life. This product is the first (prescribed or otherwise) to actually heal the rashes.</li>
            <li> omg I bought this to put in a mixture I was making and it smelled terrible. but i&#x27;ve had odorless ones before this is the 1st stinky 1. ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww lol</li>
            <li> Product just as described in description and other reviewers were right, has a smell but it&#x27;s not horrible. Great price for the size!</li>
            <li> Ordered it because it is supposed to help thicken your skin to help hide aging in the hands.  My hands have improved but I&#x27;m hoping for better results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> The quality is exactly what I expected.... GREAT lol.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my homemade lotion and it works great.</li>
            <li> I originally tried 1oz Lansinoh lanolin, which is devoid of smell or color. Now Solutions 7oz pure lanolin is a greater value and the same thick, \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; texture as Lansinoh, but it does have a strong smell and amber color. If you are okay with strong oil smells like olive oil, you may be perfectly okay with the regular wear of this product. I found that if I use pure lanolin on my hands (which is why I bought this product) then wash with a scented handsoap, the smell is no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> I use this for dry areas all over my body.  I have psoriasis and lanolin is a great moisturizer to use with my prescription creams.</li>
            <li> So amazing on your skin -- especially dry/cracked hands and feet. Also great to put around your nose when you have a cold.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably purchase the solid lanolin next time.  This is so greasy and sticky and it stinks to high heaven, as you would expect.  I found it a bit cumbersome to work with and mix into my lotions/lip balms.  The cleanup was a nightmare but I think overall, that is what you get with Lanolin.  Just be prepared for messy and smelly.</li>
            <li> great petroleum jelly alternative.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product for his hands. It helps to keep his hands from cracking with the dry winter weather that we experience living in Downeast Maine.</li>
            <li> Beware this is PURE lanolin!! I used it to make a body cream and even a large amount of essential oil and aloe gel couldn&#x27;t over power the smell. The lotion is very moisturizing but it is also VERY stinky (like a sheep).</li>
            <li> The ad indicated you may use Prime, but when you order it , you pay shipping!  It either is or isn&#x27;t PRIME eligible. If it isn&#x27;t the symbol needs removed from the ad .</li>
            <li> I now have enough lanolin to do woolen diaper covers till potty training.  Convenient tub, scent free, easy to dissolve in hot water if you add a squirt of baby wash or draft liquid.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Good price, good product, and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Pure Lanolin is hard to find it in stores,and when you do it&#x27;s very expensive. I was happy to find it on Amazon for such a good price. I bought it to use in my homemade soaps. It&#x27;s also wonderful for chapped skin,diaper rash,cuts and burns.</li>
            <li> It stinks and it&#x27;s to goopy/sticky/tacky and somewhat difficult to smear on dry skin. Works best on damp skin just out of the shower.Its def the real stuff. I mixed 1 part to 3 parts cocoa butter/mineral oil mix.</li>
            <li> Awesome price it&#x27;s like 10x cheaper then most other options</li>
            <li> I love this lanolin so much better than the tube of &amp;#34;nipple cream&amp;#34; you buy in stores.  In my humble opinion, this Now brand melts so much better and STAYS melted better than the stuff in the tube.  I use it for lanolizing baby&#x27;s wool covers, and it has worked perfectly.  You only need a little bit too, so the jar has lasted quite a long time; and I STILL have more than half left!  Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Item is exactly what it says, a tub of pure lanolin. As the other reviews have stated it does have a chemically smell to it, but so does most pure lanolin.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this same product. Smells a little sheepy but is a great price for a lot of lanolin. Obviously isn&#x27;t for use on nipples for breastfeeding but works great for lanolizing wool diaper covers or garments.</li>
            <li> It works best for dry skin. I use it mainly for dry hands and prefer it over lotions and salves as it generally works better even without the extra ingredients. It does smell a bit barnyardy which I&#x27;m ok with, especially when used at home or before bed. Gets a little thick and hard to apply in winter and can turn liquid in summer so you have to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price vs effectiveness, I highly prefer this product. A jar lasts a little over a year.</li>
            <li> Stinky!  Smells like lanolin</li>
            <li> Moisturizes okay, but definitely has a smell.  It&#x27;s not a manure smell as some reviewers have mentioned, but it is definitely a farm smell.  It didn&#x27;t bother me too much since I used it at bedtime and then just put socks on.  It&#x27;s definitely a better value than buying purified lanolin, especially if  you need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end though, I switched back to the purified version of lanolin because I just didn&#x27;t feel like this moisturized as well as the purified version and the smell just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> This has so many uses, but primarily we use it with other ingredients mixed together as a burn ointment.  Our pharmacist has been making this for our family for over 35 years and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Healed seriously dry and cracked skins on hands over one application. The smell is tolerable, as long as the product is not applied over large areas on body.</li>
            <li> Stinks to the point of nausea!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use daily on my nipples for breastfeeding. I was using the lanish (?) brand/purple container before which worked fine but was about $10/oz I  bought this because it eas much cheeper. Other said this product has a sheep smell, which I kind of agree with but for the price it was well worth it. I compounded a tbs of this with 3 drops of tea tree oil and a few drops of water to help with the smell and to make it smoother/thinner to spread more easily.</li>
            <li> This is a truly convenient product with no additives. Kept me from getting windburn when I did outdoor chores and cared for three horses this winter. Great anytime for keeping skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> Hydrating but has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> This product is so thick it can be difficult to apply and get down into fine cracks and callouses. (It&#x27;s about the consistency of cold butter, but much slower to melt) I experimented with putting a dollop onto a saucer and warming in the microwave first and it goes on SO much better and soaks in MUCH faster- so I highly recommend just warming it a bit. (not too hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using corona ointment but they switched their formula to using less lanolin and I could tell- this product has been great for healing my hands between outbreaks of dyshidrotic eczema (unfortunately still need a prescription to tame that)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is yellowish, not grey, in the batch I got and the smell was not pleasant, but not a problem. I&#x27;ve wondered if this lanolin could be warmed and essential oil added for scent?</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd brand of lanolin we have tried and is a bit thicker than the last brand. Haven&#x27;t really heard that my husband loves it but also hasn&#x27;t said he hates it. Will probably stick with this brand as it is a good price and the convenience of ordering it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> fast  fast ,love this product really hydrate the skin .please give this a try for dry skin . ok ok</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product.  My jar of lanoline was a thicker consistency than described, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I used it to heal diaper rushes and it usually heals in less than one day.&lt;br /&gt;A must have with babies and toddlers.</li>
            <li> I love this product but my husband thinks I smell like a barn when I wear it. To me, it just smells earthy, not dirty. I will continue to use it, though. it is a lifesaver for my skin! the texture is sticky but absorbs into your skin, especially when mixed with other oils. The only other lanolin I have used was Lansinoh HPA lanolin. The texture is the same, but Lansinoh is clear and odorless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with some hesitation after reading the reviews about how bad it smells.  Let me tell you, coming from someone that is very familiar with lanolin, there is nothing strange about the smell of this.  The reviews about the bad smell must be from people that are not familiar with what raw lanolin smells like.  This smells totally normal.  We personally don&#x27;t find it offensive, (admittedly, it doesn&#x27;t smell like a rose garden, but it does work great which for us, makes it totally worth the trade off.)  We use it as a natural diaper cream that works like no other, for dry hands, the children&#x27;s owies and for lanolizing their woolies to make them water resistant.  I love that it comes in a very convenient container and at a reasonable price.  I once purchased a one pound bag of lanolin, and while it was a little cheaper, it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle of trying to dig it out of it&#x27;s plastic bag.  This is a much better option and only slightly more expensive which I feel is worth it for the convenience.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lanolise my wool diaper covers and yes this is a great buy. It works great and ye sit smells, but it smells like real lanolin. It smells like a bandaid really. It s perfect for wool covers, and also cleared up my daughters diaper rash way faster then creams did. highly recommend</li>
            <li> as is described awesome product</li>
            <li> Very nice lanolin at a good price and quantity. Great for work roughened hands and really has some staying power. Yes, it can smell a little sheepy, but not strong.</li>
            <li> Actually have used sheep lanolin for years to help my skin stay in top shape. Initially used it 40 years ago when I was seriously burned on high tension wires and couldn&#x27;t afford skin graphs. Lost track of a source for it until I discovered a wonderful company called Amazon that has just about everything in the world available and I started using it again.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing. It smells like the real thing too (aka sheep)! :P  I bought it for making modeling beeswax and I&#x27;m afraid that the smell will overpower everything else I use to make it, including the nice beeswax smell. It might take me a while to get to the point where I will use it on my skin, as I cannot imagine going around smelling like a sheep! The smell is very strong and makes me nauseated, but I have a very sensitive stomach, so that may not be the case with everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;My sisters tell me that they can&#x27;t really smell anything bad about it, even when they stick their noses into it, so I suppose it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
            <li> Mixed this with Safeway&#x27;s 99% alcohol, at a 1:10 ratio, to make a case lubricant for reloading rifle cases.  Warm both of them and measure carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when working in the clay of our soil, I wash my hands (to moisten the skin), and apply this &#x27;case lube&#x27;.  The mixture leaves a light waxy film on my skin, preventing the clay from sucking all the moisture out of my skin.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this lanolin has a distinct odor but it is much less expensive than the one in the purple package. I was unsure at first but the product works great baby doesn&#x27;t mind the smell at all! I also really like having a jar I can just dip my finger in rather than a tube that requires two hands; anyone will a newborn knows that anything you can do one handed is a big bonus!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lanolin to wash my wool diaper covers. It keeps the wool soft and water-resistant- great for my daughter because she pees A LOT. Sometimes I can&#x27;t keep up with her changes, so this product really keeps the wool resistant and keeps her clothes dry as well. I also use this product for diaper rashes, it cleaned up my daughters rash much better than any other products. I also use it for myself in winter, when my skin hands become ultra dry and cracked. Yeah. It smells. It&#x27;s lanolin, and it&#x27;s pure. Each container is different- I have used about 4 so far and each has it&#x27;s own smell and color. Once you get past the smell, you&#x27;ll realize what a great product it is.</li>
            <li> my husband has diabetes, i bought this for him and it works great, his dry skin is gone, you really have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> This is really nice pure lanolin. I use it to protector my skin from friction and weather. It is also great for dry patches of skin. The faint scent smells natural, and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It smells like it&#x27;s supposed to! I am very happy with this jar of lanolin from Now Foods. A great product.</li>
            <li> I recieved it yesterday used it only once but omg feels great on my extremely dry skin. I usually have to keep reapplying moisturizer all day but only once. I live in Alaska and it has made my skin look so ashy no matter how much i moisturize. I think I have the cure. Will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. I use it nightly as a deep conditioning treatment for my hands, which get dry from constant washing throughout the day. I mix it with Now Foods shea butter and slip my hands in some gloves. When I wake up, my hands are soft and supple and feel comfortable and moisturized throughout the day, even after several washings. Lanolin is also great at moisturizing my cuticles, the ends of my hair, my feet, chapped lips, knees, and elbows. It has kind of an earthy odor, so be aware of that. The texture is extremely waxy, not unlike earwax. It doesn&#x27;t sink in quickly at all, so this is definitely a product where a little goes a long way and to use it only on tougher, dry areas or as a deep conditioning treatment. I think this is a great deal and an excellent product, and with only half the tub empty after 4 months of daily use I can imagine I will continue to get a lot of use out of one tub. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We use this for to heal dry heals and dry lips. Works excellent if left on overnight.</li>
            <li> It smells like a farm yard. VERY strong.  I am going to try to add some essential oil to it and see it that helps just so it will not go to waste. Have used other brands that do not have such a strong smell so I was very suprised at this one.</li>
            <li> I use this for lanolizing wool diaper covers and it works great!</li>
            <li> good product but not what needed.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but horrible smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong. I don&#x27;t understand why it smells this way if it&#x27;s so pure. It may be a good product, but I&#x27;ve never used it long enough to tell how effective it is on my skin because the smell is so bad. It nauseates me. I feel like I&#x27;m going to puke after I put it on my lips. It isn&#x27;t stinky, exactly. It smells like a cologne a grandfather would wear or the smell of a men&#x27;s suit store. But I am going to try a different brand, because I just can&#x27;t bear this smell. Also, it is very sticky and hard to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after you&#x27;ve had it on your skin for a while, the smell still lingers. The smell is annoying, like it bothers you in the middle of the day, you know? Gah... why Now, why?! They&#x27;re such a good company, usually. But I guess lanolin isn&#x27;t their thing...</li>
            <li> Excellent as a lip and hand humectant. The smell is a bit petrol like but that could be the scent of the Sheep themselves. All and all, I like it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I mixed half of this with 91% alcohol in a spray bottle and it makes supreme case lubricant for resizing brass cases.</li>
            <li> Every winter my skin feels like it&#x27;s going to dry up and blow away. Lanolin makes all the difference. I add a little regular lotion to it to help work it into the skin. It&#x27;s pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Lanolin in my house is used for the following issues.  My son uses it for his eczema instead of Vaseline.  We use it for minor scrapes and burns after we disinfect.  We use it for chapped lips or wind burn.  We use it for cracked hands.  It&#x27;s great to waterproof baby clothing.  It can be used to keep leather soft and good.  Any boo boo or owie that has no explanation, gets lanolin.  Think of it as you everything bandaid.</li>
            <li> Is too thick. Takes too long to apply, but works very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for excessively dry skin and the slits that come of it, as a result.  My hope was that this would put an end to the perpetual fight I am having with my own skin.  Ultimately, it didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic info:  It is very thick, very dense.  Think of vaseline, only thicker.  It does have an odor which I find hard to describe.  The best, closest way I can describe it is, as &#x27;earthy.&#x27;  Not in that it smells like dirt, but it has a &#x27;natural,&#x27; smell.  I have a very strong sense of smell and am highly allergic to perfumes, chemical-y smells, etc.  This smell is not like that.  It&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the best and most practical way to use this product is at night and to cover the area of use, if possible.  I was using it on my hands and simply wore cotton gloves so that I didn&#x27;t get it all over the linens.  While it DID soften, it also seemed to me to dry, rather than moisturize, so as I said, it didn&#x27;t help me in the long run.  However, your issue may be different and for the reasonable price, I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble trying to not buy a ton of lansinoh hpa lanolin, but this product is isticky and has a slight smell.  I could deal with the smell since I&#x27;m using it on my baby, but it&#x27;s so sticky I couldn&#x27;t touch it after opening the jar.  I had to use dish soap and the scratchy side of a sponge to get most of it off my fingers from opening the jar.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but I had no idea what pure lanolin was like so I&#x27;ll just have to keep buying 1 oz tubes of lansinoh for $10.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lanolin products over the past few decades, but I&#x27;ve yet to buy any that smelled worse than this one. I&#x27;m struggling to think of the best way to characterize it. It has a very strong lanolin odor (not good) mixed with an odd chemical smell that makes me instantly want to wash it off and put up with dry hands instead of that terrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board, Now Foods. This product needs stat revision.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> The price is great! Perfect for my babies dry skin. Smells no different than the way too expensive medela or lanisoh brand lanolins.</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my hands. Rub it on and put a pair of old socks on my hands and in the morning skin, nails, cuticles are all smooth and refreshed. It&#x27;s a very thick texture with a distinct mild smell.</li>
            <li> I use this to lanolize my sons wool diaper covers, but I also mix it with different oils and Shea Butter for our skin. I love it.</li>
