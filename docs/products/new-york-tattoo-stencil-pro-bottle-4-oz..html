            <li>but honestly I would recommend it to anyone.</li>

            <li>Makes transferring a pattern so easy!</li>
            <li>It works like a charm I used the same stencil like 3 times before it faded &amp; it holds forever! :D</li>
            <li>its just okay.</li>
            <li>just use greensoap :)</li>
            <li>got it quick and am very pleased with it and the price.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, it has applies stencils to the skin vibrantly, doesn&#x27;t rub off.  </li>
            <li>Will barely get a good stencil.</li>
            <li>and you aren&#x27;t familiar with.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy!</li>
            <li>thought i was bidding on a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>it seems to come off pretty easily in my opinion.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;nt.i will be buying from them alot and tell all my friends about the quick service&#x27;s,that means alot when you need tattoo supplies,not to have to wait forever.i reccomend this co. highly,and</li>
            <li>Easy transaction and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Easy and simple and from my understanding, more sanitary than using deodorant like some people do.</li>
            <li>worth a try</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to use a ball-point pen and put down the rest, with this it lays down just perfect, a 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li>you be let down take the time to learn more and you will grow more in your field.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stay with speed stick, but it did arrive quickly and was packaged very well</li>
            <li>Just be sure to give it adequate time to dry otherwise you might as well use greensoap.</li>
            <li>but like I said that is my fault really!</li>
            <li>this product is exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>Will be buying more from you in the future.</li>
            <li>will buy more definitely.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>this stuff really is great leaps and bounds better than green soap or any other stencil product ive used.</li>
            <li>Thanks will be purchasing more things in the future</li>
            <li>works how i expected it to drys fast nice even transfer will buy again</li>
            <li>but it dose work make sure u let it dry before u start the tattoo</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, though, and if you like the squeeze bottle, and the thickness; just may be what you are looking for~not me though.</li>
            <li>i just wish i could buy it in the gallon haha</li>
            <li>I expected it to work better.</li>
            <li>Its not what is advertised and it doesn&#x27;t hold the stencil very well when its placed.</li>
            <li>i dont really recomend  </li>
            <li>I think green soap works just as well honestly.</li>
            <li>I really do love stencil-pro, I was using some kind of stencil oil to lay the designs down, but it wouldn&#x27;t lay the whole design down</li>
            <li>Bottle came a little empty, not like in the picture all full to the top, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 4 oz precise</li>
            <li>The transfere seems fine as long as u act fast before it dries.</li>
            <li>make sure you let this product dry completely before you begin your tattoo...</li>
            <li>stencil pro will lay a clean stencil on any flat area skin, surfboards, skateboards, snowboards cars</li>
            <li>but for its name i have to say it doesnt quite live up to it as well as you would think.</li>
            <li>JUST make sure you let the skin DRY completely before starting or it will wipe away.</li>
            <li>lol, crazy rick</li>
            <li>Only real concern is its a bit watery even after shaking it, where it may drip off onto floor or wherever.</li>
            <li>Too thick, clumpy, and doesnt work appropriately for a stencil application.</li>
            <li>this pruduct is pricey but worth every penny i have been useing this stuff for a few years now.</li>
            <li>I have used better but then again have used worse so</li>
            <li>stencil stayed on a long time and very clear on skin.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast, so fast its hard to get the stencil on before it dries up.</li>
            <li>Decent product and arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using green soap to transfer stencils, and those ones actually held up a little better than ones I did with this.</li>
            <li>,i did a tattoo in very small letters and this stuff laided the stencil out with out no smearing and clean.</li>

            <li> ,i did a tattoo in very small letters and this stuff laided the stencil out with out no smearing and clean.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you get when you try another product that isn&#x27;t used by other professional tattoo artist</li>
            <li> holds transfers for a long time.</li>
            <li> when I ordered it I also ordered a lot of other stuff and may not have looked close enough</li>
            <li> but if you let is dry for about 20 to 30 minutes</li>
            <li> i bought this product because a friend once used this on me when he did my tattoos and idk how he did it to make it stay because i wiped with dry napkins</li>
            <li> The whole &amp;#34;whipping away the ink&amp;#34; thing isn&#x27;t necessary if you use a thin coat of Valsoline, it beads the ink</li>
            <li> so other artist wouldn&#x27;t know his secrets what a bomber</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any other users.</li>
            <li> After dried stencils stayed longer then others even with constant use of green soap while tattooing.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the larger size bottle would actually prohibit me from having to buy again so soon, but alas!</li>
            <li> why would you use green soap for a stencil if you&#x27;re cleaning</li>
            <li> it was green soap?</li>
            <li> When it was applied to a few of my clients skin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur money.</li>
            <li> I am never buying this again, it was a waste of money !</li>
            <li> It also was watery and not like the usual stencil solutions like &amp;#34;stencil stuff&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so Im over all saticfied with my purchase but am not sure if I would buy it again ...</li>
            <li> Not happy,  I got in mail a few days ago and used it 2 days ago and all it did was smuged the stencil ink and have had burning feeling on my arm and the stencil pro stuff smells like bleach.</li>
            <li> The liquid itself was thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> i mean anything that isnt pouras(im</li>
            <li> Have to find something else now, to replace this poor product.</li>
            <li> with any product if you fail to research it and use it incorrectly</li>
            <li> Once I received this I only had 1 bottle and the price for 1 bottle of this stuff was outrageous.</li>
            <li> So Needless to say I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> this stuff was bad</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed</li>
            <li> but over all horrible product</li>
            <li> Worst buy ..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Too thick, clumpy, and doesnt work appropriately for a stencil application. I had hoped that the larger size bottle would actually prohibit me from having to buy again so soon, but alas! Have to find something else now, to replace this poor product. Fast delivery, though, and if you like the squeeze bottle, and the thickness; just may be what you are looking for~not me though.</li>
            <li> not as pictured.  thought i was bidding on a full bottle.  is this the item described?  do i return or try what appears to be used product?</li>
            <li> This product works great however, when I ordered it I also ordered a lot of other stuff and may not have looked close enough but I personally thought that I was going to get 3 bottles and when it came and there was only one bottle....  for the price I was a bit disappointed but like I said that is my fault really!</li>
            <li> couldnt be happier great stuff</li>
            <li> Great product with good scent</li>
            <li> this pruduct is pricey but worth every penny i have been useing this stuff for a few years now. stencil pro will lay a clean stencil on any flat area skin, surfboards, skateboards, snowboards cars i mean anything that isnt pouras(im sure i spelled that wrong) and yes if you lay the stencil and start working it comes off quikly but if you let is dry for about 20 to 30 minutes thats stencil isnt going anywhere ( break out a skrub brush kids no joke) this stuff really is great leaps and bounds better than green soap or any other stencil product ive used. with any product if you fail to research it and use it incorrectly you be let down take the time to learn more and you will grow more in your field. and i think there is products that smell way funkier. i give it a 10 stars out of 5 i just wish i could buy it in the gallon haha</li>
            <li> works like it should,no issues</li>
            <li> The price I saw was shown to be 3 bottles of the solution not 1 therefore I thought it was acceptional. Once I received this I only had 1 bottle and the price for 1 bottle of this stuff was outrageous. Find this product some place else for cheeper</li>
            <li> Good service!! Thanks will be purchasing more things in the future</li>
            <li> Not happy,  I got in mail a few days ago and used it 2 days ago and all it did was smuged the stencil ink and have had burning feeling on my arm and the stencil pro stuff smells like bleach. I am never buying this again, it was a waste of money !</li>
            <li> make sure you let this product dry completely before you begin your tattoo... it seems to come off pretty easily in my opinion. I think green soap works just as well honestly. worth a try I suppose.</li>
            <li> i got the stencil pro in a couple days and this co. did there job like some co&#x27;s. don&#x27;nt.i will be buying from them alot and tell all my friends about the quick service&#x27;s,that means alot when you need tattoo supplies,not to have to wait forever.i reccomend this co. highly,and the stencil pro is the best i&#x27;ve used,because i&#x27;ve use them all,its a five star product,if you use it right,i had no problem with it&#x27;it was fast and the stencils turned out perfect,i did a tattoo in very small letters and this stuff laided the stencil out with out no smearing and clean. i also reccomend this prduct to pro&#x27;s and beginners.  lol, crazy rick</li>
            <li> The whole &amp;#34;whipping away the ink&amp;#34; thing isn&#x27;t necessary if you use a thin coat of Valsoline, it beads the ink and you can simply. dab it to soak up the ink.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re Welcome :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping not the best but it dose work make sure u let it dry before u start the tattoo</li>
            <li> i bought this product because a friend once used this on me when he did my tattoos and idk how he did it to make it stay because i wiped with dry napkins and it still wiped off and i had to keep drawing the stencil on with a pen but till my friend pulled me aside and said that that was stencil stuff in the bottle was using but he just placed it in a stencil pro bottle so other artist wouldn&#x27;t know his secrets what a bomber but over all horrible product</li>
            <li> Works good! JUST make sure you let the skin DRY completely before starting or it will wipe away. Easy and simple and from my understanding, more sanitary than using deodorant like some people do.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff alot! It works like a charm I used the same stencil like 3 times before it faded &amp; it holds forever! :D</li>
            <li> I love this!  My first stencil applied went on perfectly - the lines all transferredperfectly!  I couldn&#x27;t have been happier.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS WONDERFULLY, MY SON-IN -LAW DOES TATTOOS AND HE SAID THIS IS PERFECT, HE HAS ALREADY DONE 3 SINCE RECEIVING THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> The liquid itself was thick and clumpy. Didn&#x27;t transfer anything over. I will not use this again. I&#x27;ll stay with speed stick, but it did arrive quickly and was packaged very well</li>
            <li> Tried it and worked great.  stencil stayed on a long time and very clear on skin.  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I really do love stencil-pro, I was using some kind of stencil oil to lay the designs down, but it wouldn&#x27;t lay the whole design down and I&#x27;d have to use a ball-point pen and put down the rest, with this it lays down just perfect, a 5 star for sure.</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
            <li> works great. holds transfers for a long time. After use let stand for about 7 to 10 min before tattooing.</li>
            <li> Love Love the product, works great, it smells better than most. Will be buying more from you in the future.</li>
            <li> it does the job...but for its name i have to say it doesnt quite live up to it as well as you would think. maybe its different with different skin types but ive noticed that it doesnt work all that great.</li>
            <li> got it quick and am very pleased with it and the price.</li>
            <li> why would you use green soap for a stencil if you&#x27;re cleaning it was green soap? Just something to think about...</li>
            <li> The best product I have found for placing tattoo stensils</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s s***. Will barely get a good stencil. Worst buy ..</li>
            <li> I prefer the stencil stay as opposed to this stencil pro but honestly I would recommend it to anyone. Just be sure to give it adequate time to dry otherwise you might as well use greensoap.</li>
            <li> Makes transferring a pattern so easy!</li>
            <li> I expected it to work better. I&#x27;d been using green soap to transfer stencils, and those ones actually held up a little better than ones I did with this.</li>
            <li> works how i expected it to drys fast nice even transfer will buy again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff works as good as the men&#x27;s deoderant. Didn&#x27;t have any luck at all with it.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, it has applies stencils to the skin vibrantly, doesn&#x27;t rub off.  I agree with sonsoflokitattoo.  If you don&#x27;t know what your doing then of course it won&#x27;t work as desired.  I also helps with skin puffiness if client has a reaction to tattooing.  The smell is great.  Only real concern is its a bit watery even after shaking it, where it may drip off onto floor or wherever.</li>
            <li> Even for a beginner it made transferring stencils to skin very easy. After dried stencils stayed longer then others even with constant use of green soap while tattooing. Will buy again. Easy transaction and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use the Spirit stencil cream. this stuff was bad</li>
            <li> Product works best when you slather it on. It is not as good as stencil stay, but better than deodorant. Good price, container is secure.</li>
            <li> When it was applied to a few of my clients skin they had a reaction to the stencil solution.  It also was watery and not like the usual stencil solutions like &amp;#34;stencil stuff&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s what you get when you try another product that isn&#x27;t used by other professional tattoo artist and you aren&#x27;t familiar with. So Needless to say I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work could not get any ink or graphite to peel off paper.It&#x27;s in a different bottle than it is shown.</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would product does not work at all</li>
            <li> Bottle came a little empty, not like in the picture all full to the top, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 4 oz precise but whatever. The bottle also came with a flip cap, and not like in the picture with a point cap, besides that, it works good</li>
            <li> Its not what is advertised and it doesn&#x27;t hold the stencil very well when its placed. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to any other users.</li>
            <li> Good value, works great.</li>
            <li> Product is way awesome...100% legit! will buy more definitely.</li>
            <li> excellent and fast shipping and well wrapped and got exactly what I ordered and have zero complaints this product is excellent and I would reccomend to anyone I will be buying it aain</li>
            <li> its a real good product</li>
            <li> I have used better but then again have used worse so its just okay. It dries really fast, so fast its hard to get the stencil on before it dries up. The transfere seems fine as long as u act fast before it dries. Ppretty well priced though so Im over all saticfied with my purchase but am not sure if I would buy it again ...we will see.</li>
            <li> All i got to say is very good</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Fast and easy!</li>
            <li> awesome will buy from seller again</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste ur money. do ur research, don&#x27;t buy..</li>
            <li> it just dosnt work as well as greensoap i dont really recomend  it save ur money just use greensoap :)</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Decent product and arrived faster than expected.</li>
