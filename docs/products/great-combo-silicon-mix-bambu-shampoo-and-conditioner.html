            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird because the hair is soft, and appears thicker, but it feels dry and has no/ low sheen.</li>

            <li> I would strongly recommend it to any one with badly- damaged thick dry afro type hair.</li>
            <li> It did just that, but I do believe that it has dried out the hair a bit.</li>
            <li> so it used to get alittle frustrated every morning trying to get her ready to school</li>
            <li> but I am afraid to try simply because it contains sulfate !</li>
            <li> Another product that smells and stinks up the house.</li>
            <li> Not to crazy about the shampoo because</li>

He couldn&#x27;t get it out of the bottle .It was embarrassing.!! Couldn&#x27;t return the item because it was going to cost me over 7.00 to be return. The product itself is fabulous but the company I have purchased it from should be ashamed when doesn&#x27;t even bother to check for quality control of the product send to customers.Will never purchased from them again.</li>

            <li> Like the conditioner but it the shampoo</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix Bamboo is an excellent product for weak damaged hair. I&#x27;v tried the original silicon and loved it too. The Silicon Mix Bamboo makes the hair soft,strong,and healthy looking. I purchased it for my sister too. Her hair was struggling to live. It was dry, and very corse it looked like Don King&#x27;s hair. After trying silicon mix bamboo, her hair is silky, strong, and moisturized. I would strongly recommend it to any one with badly- damaged thick dry afro type hair. this product is good for all types of hair. If it works on severley damaged afro- nappy hair, it will work wonders on all types of hair. The shampoo is great. Its moisturizing and smells great. It cleans the hair without stripping it. the treatment smells great too.</li>
            <li> This product is great for weave. I used it one time and it has brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Used twice (I wash my hair once a week) already and I will be ordering more.  Found this product at a Chinese hair supply store but it was way more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo,  and conditioner both are very &amp;#34;perfumeie&amp;#34; but  don&#x27;t mind!  leaves hair soft and silky. although my hair is relaxed I think it would be great on &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> This product brought my virgin hair back to life great product....my hair looks great...I will definitely continue using and recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> Really works well and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and I love this with the Kanechom.</li>
            <li> Think you so much it really helps my hair will order again</li>
            <li> Its amazing for my hair</li>
            <li> Nice product and shipping!</li>
            <li> Everybody must get this shampoo and especially the conditioner. Its the best and the price is awesome. You hair get&#x27;s so soft and shinny. There is no expensive brand that I can compare with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could revive my Wigs and Weaves. It did just that, but I do believe that it has dried out the hair a bit. It&#x27;s weird because the hair is soft, and appears thicker, but it feels dry and has no/ low sheen. This hair I&#x27;m describing is Indian human hair. I also washed and conditioned  a kinky curly weave before I attached it to a wig cap. That hair is amazing. It&#x27;s soft, doesn&#x27;t tangle and isn&#x27;t any drier than your standard Kinky Curly hair. The smell is strong and I thought it was weird, but my mom thought it smelled ok soooo yeah. Clearly that didn&#x27;t stop me from using it</li>
            <li> really like the conditioner but the shampoo i found to be a little harsh. i use it on my extensions and it leaves them more manageable. when i use coconut oil with this regimen it really softens the hair.</li>
