            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>My beloved stylist told me she loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It does smell nice, too.</li>
            <li>Super Skinny and Heat Glide both have a great smell to them.  </li>
            <li>Love it more than Redken&#x27;s antisnap product!</li>
            <li>I wash my hair before and it is so strong that my husband nor I liked my coming to bed smelling like a perfume factory.</li>
            <li>I am not so sure if this works!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It does work at protecting the hair though, as my hair still feels healthy after blowing it out and curling it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>I believe this could be a really good product for the right hair type.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and this just doesn&#x27;t hold up for me, although looks great at first.</li>
            <li>She must use it in perfect combination with other products, because when she puts it on me I do see the benefits it claims to have.</li>
            <li>and Redken&#x27;s Heat Glide (love it!), but was interested in Pillow Proof Primer because it&#x27;s a spray</li>
            <li>the only thing i liked about it, was that it smells really good</li>
            <li>my hair stays pretty nice after sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is fine</li>
            <li>light misting is all you need.  </li>
            <li>My initial reaction is that the smell is not that great.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells like maple syrup to me, but it works so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look great the next day</li>
            <li>blow dry, it looks absolutely beautiful...</li>
            <li>that is why I gave it 4 stars, but it really works!!!</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to get your hands full of product to apply it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair to look drop dead gorgeous with this product!</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>And it may be awesome for girls who are lucky enough to have nice, thick tresses.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels great and dries in half the time like the product states.</li>
            <li>I have been a long time user of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny (love it!)</li>
            <li>Seller great, produce heavy and will caused the feeling of weight.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have baby-fine hair, which I just had cut to right below my shoulders (7&amp;#34; was cut off).  </li>
            <li>so much so that it takes hours to foil-highlight (by the way- NOT a process that is great for such fine hair; as I learned last year).  </li>
            <li>really great for thin fine hair</li>
            <li>I love that it primes my hair, protects it from the heat, it gives you volume specially for my fine hair, and best of all it reduces a lot of blow drying time, and I love that, the only thing is that it smells awful!!!</li>
            <li>I was younger :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether it actually makes a difference or not, but I do like that</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like a floraly perfume</li>
            <li>thick, smooth and lovely!</li>
            <li>Yes, I did shake the bottle and no, I didn&#x27;t use a large amount.  </li>
            <li>I only wash my hair maybe twice a week (its fine and color processed besides curly), so</li>
            <li>I think you people that think it is sticky and drying are using too much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has much of a lingering smell either.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li>it holds my style (whether it&#x27;s curled or straight) and</li>
            <li>just like the name says, it is really pillow</li>
            <li>Your hair starts out light and vocalized but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I use it my style really does seem &#x27;&#x27;pillow proof&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>It really does help it hold the style for a couple days vs if you didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend....</li>
            <li>Noticed significant difference in dry time.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair which is very curly underneath in the hairs near the lower scalp, and takes a lot of effort to get it smoothed out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the only blow dry primer that works on my fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I notice that my hair stays shiny and smooth (less frizz and flyaways) with this product.  </li>
            <li>I use a really expensive, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and have never had these issues when using Super Skinny or Heat Glide, so there is something in this primer that is more drying to the scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair too.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in the time it took to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really does help my hair dry faster and protects well against heat from the blow dryer and flatiron.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t understand the more negative reviews, unless the users overdid it on the product or maybe have very coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I use other products on my hair before I apply any type of heat (i.e. blow dryer, hot iron) but hey this was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so why not try it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t change or use different hair product often because I have a sensitive scalp, but this Pillow Proof didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation at all!</li>
            <li>But for those of us with really fine, delicate hair?  </li>
            <li>I have the most frustrating hair that takes forever to brush through.</li>
            <li>trick with this product is to shake it up first, then just a few sprays, not</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take that long and then after I have flat ironed my hair it is so soft</li>
            <li>It goes on very sticky and leaves hair a little crunchy after styling.</li>
            <li>I think I will continue to use this product, and just rotate it with the other ones I use, so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used small portions which only exposed minimal smell that was quickly masked by hairspray.</li>
            <li> My long, thick hair blow-dries quickly after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a different formula or what, but I dislike the smell and too much of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a must have - for daily styling or especially for a LONG night out.</li>
            <li> made my hair a bit flat and greasey, but did protect from heat.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> This cons down the friends and natural curling my hair for straightening purposes .</li>
            <li> However, there are two negative things I have to say about consistently using this primer for several days in a row: it made my scalp itchy and it made my hair look and feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I put this in my hair before I blow dry and then style as necessary -</li>
            <li> I bought it to help cut back on my blow dry time - it made no difference.</li>
            <li> This spray has a strange smell.</li>
            <li> but it does have a strange smell.</li>
            <li> I have long hair...and LOTS of it, which takes forever to blow dry.  </li>
            <li> also helps hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the dry time, what I did notice was the sticky feel and the smell...</li>
            <li> dry, crunchy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to make your hair dry faster.  </li>
            <li> This product has been the ONLY product that has cut my hair styling in half.</li>
            <li> While it did dry my hair in about half the time, it seemed like my hair looked dry and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I can see a minimal difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> So I had this on my shopping list on here, but since the cupboard under my bathroom sink is full of products that I bought and hated, I didn&#x27;t want to buy the full-sized product before trying it first.  </li>
            <li> Oh and let me tell you a little goes a long way, this bottle will last a few months for me.</li>
            <li> min blow dry easily in half.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair sticky as I read on some other reviews.</li>
            <li> I spray it on my towel dried hair and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> it offers heat protection for my hair at the very least.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that I blow dry and flat iron.</li>
            <li> dries hair in about half the time.  </li>
            <li> After I spray it on, it temporarily (before blow drying) seems a little sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mix of maple syrup + dried plums/raisins.</li>
            <li> I had a blow-out a few weeks ago and my stylist swore by this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday like wen</li>
            <li> too heavy</li>
            <li> So I waited a few days and tried it again.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and ice been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this spray doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and drastically cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> Pillow proof truly cuts drying time in half!</li>
            <li> and it was stiff.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with my hair looking decent instead of crazy.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> With that being said, this product reduced my blow drying time by at least half, if not more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the small bottle at Ulta for $8 and tried it.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to do both, but this spray definitely helps in cutting down that time.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a VERY HEAVY perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got to work, the little bends I put in my hair with my flat iron were gone and I looked like my hair was dirty, stringy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> (Hard to tell since it&#x27;s so humid in StL)  </li>
            <li> I always give a product a second chance, since we all know that any number of things can contribute to a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> I hate drying, takes so long, this helps</li>
            <li> this stuff STINKS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sure-fire way to guarantee a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> But that is not what really disappointed me.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can see a minimal difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> I think you people that think it is sticky and drying are using too much. light misting is all you need.  my hair stays pretty nice after sleeping on it.  I don&#x27;t think it has much of a lingering smell either.  I think it works well.  also helps hair dry faster.  my hair is pretty thick. I hate drying, takes so long, this helps</li>
            <li> While I do think this product helps with drying time, it also dries out the hair.  Also, it has a VERY HEAVY perfume smell.  I wash my hair before and it is so strong that my husband nor I liked my coming to bed smelling like a perfume factory.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this on me so I thought I&#x27;d buy it at home. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a different formula or what, but I dislike the smell and too much of it makes my hair greasy. She must use it in perfect combination with other products, because when she puts it on me I do see the benefits it claims to have. Maybe I&#x27;m just not using it right.</li>
            <li> Great product. Noticed significant difference in dry time.</li>
            <li> after blow drying my hair looked like i had teased it and it was stiff. the only thing i liked about it, was that it smells really good</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the dry time, what I did notice was the sticky feel and the smell...both of which were unnoticeable after a while.  But that is not what really disappointed me.  By the time I got to work, the little bends I put in my hair with my flat iron were gone and I looked like my hair was dirty, stringy and greasy.  Yes, I did shake the bottle and no, I didn&#x27;t use a large amount.  Not a product for me.</li>
            <li> Really works. My hair feels great and dries in half the time like the product states. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This cons down the friends and natural curling my hair for straightening purposes .</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that I blow dry and flat iron. It takes forever to do both, but this spray definitely helps in cutting down that time. I spray it on my towel dried hair and then blow dry. It doesn&#x27;t take that long and then after I have flat ironed my hair it is so soft and I do not have the frizzies. I know there were some complaints about the smell but I think it is fine and it does not make my hair stinky.</li>
            <li> I can get my hair to look drop dead gorgeous with this product! After I spray it on, it temporarily (before blow drying) seems a little sticky. But after I&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry, it looks absolutely beautiful...thick, smooth and lovely! Thumbs up all the way!</li>
            <li> I am not so sure if this works!&lt;br /&gt;But it makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> This is the only blow dry primer that works on my fine, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Love it more than Redken&#x27;s antisnap product!</li>
            <li> made my hair a bit flat and greasey, but did protect from heat.</li>
            <li> I have long hair...and LOTS of it, which takes forever to blow dry.  I have been a long time user of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny (love it!) and Redken&#x27;s Heat Glide (love it!), but was interested in Pillow Proof Primer because it&#x27;s a spray and you don&#x27;t have to get your hands full of product to apply it.  My initial reaction is that the smell is not that great.  Super Skinny and Heat Glide both have a great smell to them.  With that being said, this product reduced my blow drying time by at least half, if not more.  I was very impressed.  However, there are two negative things I have to say about consistently using this primer for several days in a row: it made my scalp itchy and it made my hair look and feel dry.  I use a really expensive, moisturizing shampoo and conditioner and have never had these issues when using Super Skinny or Heat Glide, so there is something in this primer that is more drying to the scalp and hair.  It took several uses for it to happen, but it was something I noticed.  I think I will continue to use this product, and just rotate it with the other ones I use, so it doesn&#x27;t dry me out too much.</li>
            <li> This spray has a strange smell. It&#x27;s a mix of maple syrup + dried plums/raisins. It goes on very sticky and leaves hair a little crunchy after styling. It does work at protecting the hair though, as my hair still feels healthy after blowing it out and curling it.</li>
            <li> It did provide heat protection but I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in the time it took to dry my hair.  I really didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I love that it primes my hair, protects it from the heat, it gives you volume specially for my fine hair, and best of all it reduces a lot of blow drying time, and I love that, the only thing is that it smells awful!!! that is why I gave it 4 stars, but it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Works, but left my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Great product to give hair body.  I use it each time I wash my hair and it gives my hair tons of body.</li>
            <li> This stuff is INCREDIBLE.  I had a blow-out a few weeks ago and my stylist swore by this product.  I put this in my hair before I blow dry and then style as necessary - it holds my style (whether it&#x27;s curled or straight) and just like the name says, it is really pillow proof!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have - for daily styling or especially for a LONG night out. Also, I notice that my hair stays shiny and smooth (less frizz and flyaways) with this product.  Sometimes I even skip the hairspray!</li>
            <li> this stuff STINKS. It smells like perm solution!!! I bought it to help cut back on my blow dry time - it made no difference. The Kenra platinum spray is the best to save time.</li>
            <li> I believe this could be a really good product for the right hair type.  I found that it made my already dryish hair even drier and discontinued using it.</li>
            <li> Your hair starts out light and vocalized but it doesn&#x27;t last.  My hair is fine and this just doesn&#x27;t hold up for me, although looks great at first.</li>
            <li> Product came within two days of purchasing and would buy from again! I have the most frustrating hair that takes forever to brush through. This product has been the ONLY product that has cut my hair styling in half. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a couple months ago when I purchased a small sample bottle at my sons barber shop. I use other products on my hair before I apply any type of heat (i.e. blow dryer, hot iron) but hey this was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so why not try it. I absolutely fell in love with this product. I don&#x27;t use a lot, and spray it on just after I have combed through my hair prior to blow drying. The shine that comes from using this product is AWESOME. I don&#x27;t change or use different hair product often because I have a sensitive scalp, but this Pillow Proof didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation at all! Oh and let me tell you a little goes a long way, this bottle will last a few months for me. I have pretty long hair too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday like wen I was younger :) It helps keep the style</li>
            <li> I brought a sample my stylist gave to me on a trip to Europe. I have very thick and long hair and it cut my 20+ min blow dry easily in half.  I used small portions which only exposed minimal smell that was quickly masked by hairspray. I had great hair days every day...and it rained the entire week. Came home and ordered ASAP. Loved it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a stylist recently and so I got it. I have wavy hair which is very curly underneath in the hairs near the lower scalp, and takes a lot of effort to get it smoothed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick with this product is to shake it up first, then just a few sprays, not too heavy handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it my style really does seem &#x27;&#x27;pillow proof&#x27;&#x27; and I wake up with my hair looking decent instead of crazy. I only wash my hair maybe twice a week (its fine and color processed besides curly), so this helping my blow out last is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t understand the more negative reviews, unless the users overdid it on the product or maybe have very coarse hair. It really does help it hold the style for a couple days vs if you didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. As for the product itself, I use it every time I style my hair. I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether it actually makes a difference or not, but I do like that it offers heat protection for my hair at the very least. It does smell nice, too. I don&#x27;t think it makes my hair sticky as I read on some other reviews.</li>
            <li> this product does not give you 1970&#x27;s volume....it gives you beautiful controlling body.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend....besides which it smells beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It really does help my hair dry faster and protects well against heat from the blow dryer and flatiron. Only problem is the scent of this product. It kind of smells like maple syrup to me, but it works so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Seller great, produce heavy and will caused the feeling of weight.</li>
            <li> So I had this on my shopping list on here, but since the cupboard under my bathroom sink is full of products that I bought and hated, I didn&#x27;t want to buy the full-sized product before trying it first.  I&#x27;m really glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the small bottle at Ulta for $8 and tried it.  While it did dry my hair in about half the time, it seemed like my hair looked dry and crunchy.  For reference, I have baby-fine hair, which I just had cut to right below my shoulders (7&amp;#34; was cut off).  While my hair is baby-fine, there is a LOT of it...so much so that it takes hours to foil-highlight (by the way- NOT a process that is great for such fine hair; as I learned last year).  But I digress.  I always give a product a second chance, since we all know that any number of things can contribute to a bad hair day.  So I waited a few days and tried it again.  Same results: dry, crunchy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this product does do as advertised- dries hair in about half the time.  And it may be awesome for girls who are lucky enough to have nice, thick tresses.  But for those of us with really fine, delicate hair?  It&#x27;s a sure-fire way to guarantee a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> My beloved stylist told me she loves this stuff.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.  It&#x27;s supposed to make your hair dry faster.  (Hard to tell since it&#x27;s so humid in StL)  But it does help prevent damage from the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Mef</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and ice been using it ever since. It makes my hair look great the next day but it does have a strange smell. At first it seemed like a floraly perfume but then it has a syrupy smell. I have thick hair and this spray doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and drastically cuts down on drying time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of it, and it seems to try out my hair. It definitely works though! My long, thick hair blow-dries quickly after using this stuff.</li>
            <li> really great for thin fine hair</li>
            <li> Love this! I have very thick hair and takes forever to dry. Pillow proof truly cuts drying time in half!</li>
