    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Probably not the best thing to buy if you are like me and just looking to reduce the appearance of hair loss.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed the thinning SINCE, so I think L&#x27;Oreal has a really great product!</li>
            <li>My best choice ...</li>
            <li>Good shampoo for men!</li>
            <li>works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>This smells great but haven&#x27;t seen the results yet.  </li>
            <li>What a great product....</li>
            <li>I do not automatically reach for a hat since I began using this great shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a really, really great product and I&#x27;m dumbfounded that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it.</li>
            <li>Great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Shampoo, because it would help a lot, and is still a great product, but this stuff blows it out of the water.  </li>
            <li>Great product, no issues</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, no problem there.</li>
            <li>This product is very amazing and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>So again this product is very amazing</li>
            <li>Good product at great price.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product as I am equally impressed with the professionalism of its vendors.</li>
            <li>Works good for him.</li>
            <li>Have to keep trying it and see if I get good results.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s good for women as well.</li>
            <li>Good lather.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I am able to find it here.</li>
            <li>Results are coming in great, and perhaps there will be more results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li>I love how this product works for me and my hair and it smells great as well.  </li>
            <li>Product is good and nice.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular but certainly good for the buck.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, nice smell</li>
            <li>I feel so sexy when I use this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I also like the scent, mild but pleasant for men (unlike the stronger perfume scent of many shampoos that appear to target women).  </li>
            <li>This product does what it says, at a very cheap price.</li>
            <li>His hair is healthy looking....</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure the results will be even better.</li>
            <li>I have used Nexxus Diametress for years, but I think this is even better.</li>
            <li>For a better thickening shampoo at a better price that smells better, go with Dove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stuck with it for a year or more.  </li>
            <li>My husband started getting me to use this shampoo many months ago when Axe changed their hair-thickening product line.</li>
            <li>Safe to say that is where I go now.</li>
            <li>Without being able to order it online</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker and has more shine to it.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for many years.</li>
            <li>so better use this one</li>
            <li>My husband love it</li>
            <li>It is the best shampoo I have ever used in my life and I, as a woman trying various mascara&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It works well and gets the hair clean with a nice manly scent.</li>
            <li>Even better to choose the subscribe and save option, you save more and get free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is some real good shampoo, I can&#x27;t get it at wal mart store or any other store that i know of.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first wash, it makes your hair more full, it will not regrow it if that&#x27;s what you think.  </li>
            <li>My husband said it wasn&#x27;t as good as the bottle we purchased at the pharmacy for 4.99 same size bottle.</li>
            <li>, I fell that it really does help my hair have a more full and managable appearance.  </li>
            <li>and I love Loreal products so far its fine.</li>
            <li>The best course of action at this point is to start experimenting with other volumizing shampoos marketed to women.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available at local drug stores, but glad I can buy online.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>its worth the money ...&lt;</li>
            <li>u will have better hair rest is hyped up in the market stick to old school it helps and saves money .&lt;br</li>
            <li>(God knows why they&#x27;d discontinue such a great product), but Dollar General agreed to sell it exclusively.</li>
            <li>I bought it from here first to test it</li>
            <li>get it from Amazon, because the price is way better than you&#x27;ll find in your local beauty store (please correct me in the comments if you found it cheaper elsewhere).</li>
            <li>I am the one who cuts my husband&#x27;s hair.. when I first started noticing his hair thinning</li>
            <li>I grinned the first time I used this and feel it helped improve my appearance from day one and ever since.  </li>
            <li>It actually felt stronger and more flexible.</li>
            <li>This did not happen with my first order with them.  </li>
            <li>you see 2x a year that smells like strong after shave that lingers until the next time you see him.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this as long as L&#x27;Oreal keeps making it, although I am not holding out much hope because I really liked their old Style Infusion formula and that was discontinued.</li>
            <li>The hair is really thicker and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally light ash blonde hair</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t grow fast at all</li>
            <li>It works very well in conjunction with a thickening hair styling product.</li>
            <li>not do much for me in terms of creating a thicker hair look</li>
            <li>But I will definitely enjoy this variety and stock up on it while supplies last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve considered trying Rogaine or Propecia for my receiting hairline but the cost and the fact that you have to continuously use these products for the results to be &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; really turned me off.  </li>
            <li>real, I use it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>But i didn&#x27;t really notice any thickening of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cant really recommend it.  </li>
            <li>you now really do feel the difference.</li>
            <li>Your hair looks much fuller using this product.</li>
            <li>His hair is thinning but since he started using this thickening shampoo, it truly seems like it&#x27;s thinning much slower.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo adds so much volume to my hair</li>
            <li>Better than some of the other products.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any overwhelming results, but after a few days, my ponytail began to feel thicker.</li>
            <li>Not sure if you have to use it for an extended period of time in order for it to be effective?</li>
            <li>But the shampoo purchased most recently has different smell and irritates the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prefect for older men.</li>
            <li>Why are prices so high for this product?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to man, woman, child.  </li>
            <li>Cost is to high for product compared to store prices, who discontinued this product.  </li>
            <li>I called Loreal, and the ONLY store this is available in is Dollar General stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price if you know how to portion a use properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle shampoo, but good for those with thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using that shampoo from last weeks (twice right now) and I like the effect which I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>They said they were going to discontinue it in favor of their new \\&quot;Fusion 5\\&quot; or whatever</li>
            <li>The new Fusion 5 doesn&#x27;t even look to do what this does (and believe me, this stuff worked).</li>
            <li>You also can wash your head less often - since now your head stay clean much longer (I don&#x27;t know the reason) -</li>
            <li>However I got lucky and found these as normal stock in Dollar General stores and they are priced at only $2.50 plus tax per bottle.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very masculine and instead of picking one strand of hair</li>
            <li>, for example, have finally found a shampoo I will use as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>If it is thickening the actual strands I certainly cannot tell.</li>
            <li>Hair really does feel thicker after repeated use, and you can use daily.  </li>
            <li>, I find I don&#x27;t have to shampoo everyday because it makes my hair feel fantastic for days.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo I have used in years that makes my thin, fine hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>the prices on here are for the most part ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>Thin hair almost never looks good for long, or at all - ever.  </li>
            <li>The product leaves my hair shiny and thick - full!  </li>
            <li>and I found some at Dollar General for $2.50 a bottle, I bought 5 of them there.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it 1 star was because I was just in the Dollar General and saw it on the shelf for $2.50 and I paid $10 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it works whoever has issues with thin hair and loss of hair I would advise them to give it a try ... its simple and cheap with no much of odor ,I was loosing hair as they were becoming thin because of strong shampoos we use daily</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as other people simply looking to have thicker hair, this product really does work.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spend so much money on conditioner and other solutions and nothing can fix it.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been soft and moist but after using this religiously my hair has been so dry</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine &amp; thin</li>
            <li>I am a woman, I have fine thin hair and actually use Rogaine for hair loss.  </li>

            <li> it works whoever has issues with thin hair and loss of hair I would advise them to give it a try ... its simple and cheap with no much of odor ,I was loosing hair as they were becoming thin because of strong shampoos we use daily</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as other people simply looking to have thicker hair, this product really does work.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spend so much money on conditioner and other solutions and nothing can fix it.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been soft and moist but after using this religiously my hair has been so dry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine &amp; thin</li>
            <li> I am a woman, I have fine thin hair and actually use Rogaine for hair loss.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for about a week now and it has Left My hair feeling flat</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s pointless paying so much money for a discontinued product.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for long enough to write this review</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available in stores, which is why these sellers are setting these absurd prices online.</li>
            <li> I started noticing minor results after about 5-7 days, and now after 2 weeks I am seeing that my hair looks darker, as time goes on</li>
            <li> However, at the price you don&#x27;t really have anything to lose, and you have some thick hair to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried all the OTHER hair thickening products out there until I finally found Vive Pro for Men-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> u loose hair</li>
            <li> : I use this product, then I blow dry my hair which seems to add a little volume, then I either use American Crew Forming Cream or Fiber, depending on the look I am going for.  </li>
            <li> As a result it is harder to use because of the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> as they become thin as far as you keep the thickness and apply hair oil regularly trust me ..</li>
            <li> A little bit of static and made my hair look a little dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to understand why there isn&#x27;t a single other reasonably priced shampoo for men that can add volume to hair without making fallacious claims of hair</li>
            <li> Not worth the $11 I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I would be stuck with some other product that doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> My hair grew so thick I had to have some of it chemically removed because my barber broke three pairs of scissors and a brand new buzzer trying to tame it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry and looks dead now.</li>
            <li> What other reviewers failed to mention was that this smells like that old uncle</li>
            <li> there is no special smell -</li>
            <li> Also, this shampoo didn&#x27;t turn my hair into an oil slick after a few days of use like lots of other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and it even made my hair a tad less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It did not do that, but I notice my hair is a little darker</li>
            <li> This shampoo works to make your hair look a little fuller, but is somewhat pricey.</li>
            <li> the price gouging itself should serve as an indicator for Loreal as to what they&#x27;re missing out on.</li>
            <li> also I have left this shampoo and trying to get back on it as I can feel the difference I used other sick shampoos in the market</li>
            <li> Very odd.  </li>
            <li> Ladies who are typically repulsed by my thin hair find themselves drooling over my slightly thicker hair after using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like writing bad reviews but this shampoo has done irreversible damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Used product in the past for myself.......</li>
            <li> No more ordering for me.</li>
            <li> If you are a man like me and had very thin hair to the point that you can actually pick a strand of hair and feel it in your finger than trust me when I tell you that this product will thicken your hair.</li>
            <li> But for whatever reason it is so hard to find these at any store and</li>
            <li> before after 3-4 days my hairs look very-very dirty, now it is almost the same as after a wash.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I looked around for volumizing and thickening shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Too BAD they don&#x27;t realize it and promote it as such!-</li>
            <li> My hair had a couple spots that were very thin and some spots that were thick, now after using this product plenty of times my hair is now thick to the point that it covers those spots.</li>
            <li> Works well for congenitally thin hair</li>
            <li> it didnt make it look thin one bit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not one within 50 miles of me.</li>
            <li> How disappointing.</li>
            <li> I did notice that some of my thinner hairs don&#x27;t look so bad</li>
            <li> Buy it - you will not be disappointed at all!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is some real good shampoo, I can&#x27;t get it at wal mart store or any other store that i know of.It makes your hair thicker and fuller like it says it will. My son in law left a bottle or part of a bottle in my camper and I use some and have been looking for it ever since.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo but can&#x27;t find it in the local stores. It makes his hair thicker. I am so happy I am able to find it here. Now it will be delivered and I don&#x27;t have to think aobut it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and your hair is thinning then this is the product for you. works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s hair is thinning as he ages......  Used product in the past for myself....... Works good for him. His hair is healthy looking....</li>
            <li> This smells great but haven&#x27;t seen the results yet.  I know this is for men, but I thought I would try it since another woman said she used it too even though it was for men.  Have to keep trying it and see if I get good results.</li>
            <li> I have been using that shampoo from last weeks (twice right now) and I like the effect which I&#x27;ve got. The hair is really thicker and shiny. You also can wash your head less often - since now your head stay clean much longer (I don&#x27;t know the reason) - before after 3-4 days my hairs look very-very dirty, now it is almost the same as after a wash. Now, the price is even cheaper, so I will definitely recommend this shampoo for regular use. I actually don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s called &#x27;for men&#x27; cause there is no special smell - so I guess it&#x27;s good for women as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  Hair really does feel thicker after repeated use, and you can use daily.  I also like the scent, mild but pleasant for men (unlike the stronger perfume scent of many shampoos that appear to target women).  Wish it was available at local drug stores, but glad I can buy online.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says, at a very cheap price. Even better to choose the subscribe and save option, you save more and get free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I didn&#x27;t want to dish out money on products that help with hair growth (I am starting to lose hair do to heredity). I knew this wouldn&#x27;t help me grow hair, but I was hoping it would help reduce the appearance of my hair loss. It did not do that, but I notice my hair is a little darker so I know it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for about two weeks. I take a shower every day so this product is being used every day. Results are coming in great, and perhaps there will be more results as I keep using it. I did notice that some of my thinner hairs don&#x27;t look so bad anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not the best thing to buy if you are like me and just looking to reduce the appearance of hair loss. However, at the price you don&#x27;t really have anything to lose, and you have some thick hair to gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as other people simply looking to have thicker hair, this product really does work. I started noticing minor results after about 5-7 days, and now after 2 weeks I am seeing that my hair looks darker, as time goes on i&#x27;m sure the results will be even better.</li>
            <li> What a great product.... I noticed a difference after the first wash, it makes your hair more full, it will not regrow it if that&#x27;s what you think.  I bought it from here first to test it and I found some at Dollar General for $2.50 a bottle, I bought 5 of them there.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I have used in years that makes my thin, fine hair look fuller. I do not automatically reach for a hat since I began using this great shampoo. I have used Nexxus Diametress for years, but I think this is even better.</li>
            <li> What other reviewers failed to mention was that this smells like that old uncle you see 2x a year that smells like strong after shave that lingers until the next time you see him. It also took the shine from my hair &amp; made it feel course. A little bit of static and made my hair look a little dirty. I have naturally light ash blonde hair and it&#x27;s fine &amp; thin so I&#x27;m always looking for something that works. The reason I gave it 1 star was because I was just in the Dollar General and saw it on the shelf for $2.50 and I paid $10 on Amazon. That ticks me off and cheapens the product.</li>
            <li> Product is good and nice.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $11 I spent on it. It&#x27;s just a regular shampoo that makes you hair feel thicker and look marginally thicker. For a better thickening shampoo at a better price that smells better, go with Dove.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and I have to color it just to damage it so I have some body.  It also doesn&#x27;t grow fast at all so when I get it cut and I don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;m stuck with it for a year or more.  I like this because it makes my hair feel thicker.  I know it said for men, but a lot women said they use it and I love Loreal products so far its fine.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shampoo.  It seems you can no longer buy it in stores.  I hope they have not stopped making it!</li>
            <li> My husband started getting me to use this shampoo many months ago when Axe changed their hair-thickening product line. It works very well in conjunction with a thickening hair styling product. It smells &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; and I alternate it with an antidandruff shampoo (I&#x27;ve researched that using Selsun blue prevents fungus, which inherently can prevent hair loss).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get it from Amazon, because the price is way better than you&#x27;ll find in your local beauty store (please correct me in the comments if you found it cheaper elsewhere).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a combined shampoo/conditioner which I didn&#x27;t expect. As a result it is harder to use because of the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Does not do much for me in terms of creating a thicker hair look</li>
            <li> My hair grew so thick I had to have some of it chemically removed because my barber broke three pairs of scissors and a brand new buzzer trying to tame it. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I love how this product works for me and my hair and it smells great as well.  But for whatever reason it is so hard to find these at any store and the prices on here are for the most part ridiculous.  However I got lucky and found these as normal stock in Dollar General stores and they are priced at only $2.50 plus tax per bottle.  Safe to say that is where I go now.</li>
            <li> I think it depends on you hair type, but this didn&#x27;t do it for me.  Not any fault of the produce...</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a man, I chose this shampoo because it works just as well as women&#x27;s shampoo without the cloying floral scent. At first, I didn&#x27;t notice any overwhelming results, but after a few days, my ponytail began to feel thicker. Also, this shampoo didn&#x27;t turn my hair into an oil slick after a few days of use like lots of other \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and it even made my hair a tad less frizzy. I will continue to use this as long as L&#x27;Oreal keeps making it, although I am not holding out much hope because I really liked their old Style Infusion formula and that was discontinued. But I will definitely enjoy this variety and stock up on it while supplies last.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like writing bad reviews but this shampoo has done irreversible damage to my hair. My hair has always been soft and moist but after using this religiously my hair has been so dry and I&#x27;ve spend so much money on conditioner and other solutions and nothing can fix it. My hair is so dry and looks dead now. Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered trying Rogaine or Propecia for my receiting hairline but the cost and the fact that you have to continuously use these products for the results to be &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; really turned me off.  So I decided to just let nature take its course.  In the mean time I looked around for volumizing and thickening shampoos.  This is the only shampoo that actually worked for thickening up my thinning hair. Started using it years ago and haven&#x27;t stopped.  I can actually see the difference on days I dont use it.  My routine: I use this product, then I blow dry my hair which seems to add a little volume, then I either use American Crew Forming Cream or Fiber, depending on the look I am going for.  Both seem to help with the volume.  Seems as if I added YEARS to my reciting hairline.  Can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore, which leads me to believe that maybe it has been discontinued (PLEASE NO!).  So I buy it here or in lots on eBay.</li>
            <li> Good product at great price.  I feel so sexy when I use this shampoo!  Ladies who are typically repulsed by my thin hair find themselves drooling over my slightly thicker hair after using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For real, I use it.  It&#x27;s not a miracle shampoo, but good for those with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am the one who cuts my husband&#x27;s hair.. when I first started noticing his hair thinning I tried all the OTHER hair thickening products out there until I finally found Vive Pro for Men- it has worked WONDERS for YEARS! I have not noticed the thinning SINCE, so I think L&#x27;Oreal has a really great product! Too BAD they don&#x27;t realize it and promote it as such!- THEN maybe we could find it in the stores! My Walgreens was the last to carry it and now they don&#x27;t either, so here I am once again buying products from Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Works well for congenitally thin hair</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a week now and it has Left My hair feeling flat And as if I never washed after about an hour or so. If it is thickening the actual strands I certainly cannot tell.</li>
            <li> This is a really, really great product and I&#x27;m dumbfounded that L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued it. Now the only remaining options for men with thinning hair are the overpriced snake oils. How disappointing. I&#x27;m unable to understand why there isn&#x27;t a single other reasonably priced shampoo for men that can add volume to hair without making fallacious claims of hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck the price gouging itself should serve as an indicator for Loreal as to what they&#x27;re missing out on. Honestly it&#x27;s pointless paying so much money for a discontinued product. The best course of action at this point is to start experimenting with other volumizing shampoos marketed to women.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and I can&#x27;t get it locally. Without being able to order it online I would be stuck with some other product that doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> Thin hair almost never looks good for long, or at all - ever.  I grinned the first time I used this and feel it helped improve my appearance from day one and ever since.  Simply put - it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> Better than some of the other products. Good lather. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. Leaves it manageable . Nothing spectacular but certainly good for the buck. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works to make your hair look a little fuller, but is somewhat pricey. So, try to find on sale.</li>
            <li> Great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple...it just works!  I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders Clinical Strength Shampoo, because it would help a lot, and is still a great product, but this stuff blows it out of the water.  It&#x27;s well worth the price if you know how to portion a use properly.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, nice smell, I fell that it really does help my hair have a more full and managable appearance.  I order often</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product as I am equally impressed with the professionalism of its vendors. My hair is thicker and has more shine to it.</li>
            <li> This product is no longer available in stores, which is why these sellers are setting these absurd prices online. I called Loreal, and the ONLY store this is available in is Dollar General stores. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s not one within 50 miles of me. They said they were going to discontinue it in favor of their new \\&quot;Fusion 5\\&quot; or whatever (God knows why they&#x27;d discontinue such a great product), but Dollar General agreed to sell it exclusively. Very odd.  The new Fusion 5 doesn&#x27;t even look to do what this does (and believe me, this stuff worked).</li>
            <li> I liked the smell. But i didn&#x27;t really notice any thickening of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t necessarily dislike the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for many years. But the shampoo purchased most recently has different smell and irritates the scalp. I called L&#x27;Oreal and reported the problem. I asked if any similar problems have been reported. They seem not care about this.&lt;br /&gt;I switched the shampoo to the different brand. I will not ever go back to using L&#x27;Oreal.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the shampoo was provided by YYZ Supply and sold by Amazon. I purchased it on October 6, 2013.</li>
            <li> As a regular shampoo, this product gets 5 stars. However, I have been using it for about two months now and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in hair thickness. I will continue to use it and will update this review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the thickness of my hair.  Cant really recommend it.  Not sure if you have to use it for an extended period of time in order for it to be effective?</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, could&#x27;t find it in store.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for long enough to write this review it works whoever has issues with thin hair and loss of hair I would advise them to give it a try ... its simple and cheap with no much of odor ,I was loosing hair as they were becoming thin because of strong shampoos we use daily so better use this one also I have left this shampoo and trying to get back on it as I can feel the difference I used other sick shampoos in the market My best choice ...pls give it a try ...its worth the money ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also u loose hair as they become thin as far as you keep the thickness and apply hair oil regularly trust me ..u will have better hair rest is hyped up in the market stick to old school it helps and saves money .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks ,&lt;br /&gt;Max</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a much bigger bottle. My husband said it wasn&#x27;t as good as the bottle we purchased at the pharmacy for 4.99 same size bottle. No more ordering for me.</li>
            <li> This product is very amazing and does what it says it will do. If you are a man like me and had very thin hair to the point that you can actually pick a strand of hair and feel it in your finger than trust me when I tell you that this product will thicken your hair. My hair had a couple spots that were very thin and some spots that were thick, now after using this product plenty of times my hair is now thick to the point that it covers those spots. The smell is very masculine and instead of picking one strand of hair you now really do feel the difference. Also I use hair gel daily for work since I work at a bar and my biggest concern was that if I apply gel will it show my spots, well you dont have to worry about that either cause everytime I applied gel to my hair it didnt make it look thin one bit. It actually felt stronger and more flexible. So again this product is very amazing and I do recommend it and will purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product. It&#x27;s prefect for older men. Your hair looks much fuller using this product. But it!</li>
            <li> My husband love it and he saw difference with his hair since he started use it.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this shampoo.  His hair is thinning but since he started using this thickening shampoo, it truly seems like it&#x27;s thinning much slower.  It works well and gets the hair clean with a nice manly scent.</li>
            <li> Great product, no issues</li>
            <li> Why are prices so high for this product? I can get it off the shelf at a local store for $2.50!</li>
            <li> I am a woman, I have fine thin hair and actually use Rogaine for hair loss.  This shampoo adds so much volume to my hair, I find I don&#x27;t have to shampoo everyday because it makes my hair feel fantastic for days.  The product leaves my hair shiny and thick - full!  I highly recommend this product to man, woman, child.  It is the best shampoo I have ever used in my life and I, as a woman trying various mascara&#x27;s, for example, have finally found a shampoo I will use as long as it is available.  Buy it - you will not be disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Cost is to high for product compared to store prices, who discontinued this product.  The product itself is great, no problem there.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo for men!</li>
            <li> WHAT IS GOING ON. HOW CAN THIS BOTTLE BE $16.00 PLEASE FIX THIS. IT USED BE $3.99. WHY IS THE PRICE SO JACKED UP. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. THE PRODUCERS MUST STEP IN AND FIX THE PROBLEM</li>
            <li> The item name is &amp;#34;Thickening Shampoo.&amp;#34;  I was sent 2-in-1.  This did not happen with my first order with them.  The pictures of the item shows both 1 correct image, and 1 incorrect image (of 2-in-1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon would not let me do a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1*</li>
