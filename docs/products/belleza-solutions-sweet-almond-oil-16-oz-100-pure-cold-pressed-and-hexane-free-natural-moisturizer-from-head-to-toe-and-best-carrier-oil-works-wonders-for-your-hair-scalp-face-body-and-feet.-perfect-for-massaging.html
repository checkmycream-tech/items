            <li>and im very please with the quality in comparison to others i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet Almond oil is probably the most popular base for massage oils because of its luxurious emollient feel and its ready absorbability.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For optimum results do so regularly for a couple of weeks at least.</li>
            <li>If you have any dry skin that will take care of the problem right</li>
            <li>if you want silk smooth hair with a lot of shine - mix a little almond oil with any detangling leave in you have on hand.</li>
            <li>This product will make your hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and silky and it does not clog pores.</li>
            <li>There is no overabundance taste of almond, it actually brings out the real taste of the food.</li>
            <li>Keep all oils in a cool, dark place to preserve freshness.</li>
            <li>and well absorbed into the wet skin</li>
            <li>Its light enough for the skin and extra lite as a coating for my hair which tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li>I had very unmanageable dry hair.</li>
            <li>I do recommend storing the container in a dark place as it&#x27;s clear and will not protect your delicate oil from becoming rancid due to light.</li>
            <li>Lastly, while almond oil is a bit expensive to use in reed diffusers, I also love to use this in those because it works really well because it isn&#x27;t super thick, but it also isn&#x27;t the absolute thinnest.</li>
            <li>It works very well than any other lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different Sweet Almond oils before and always had an issue with them not absorbing completely and making my skin look shiny.</li>
            <li>The texture is very watery ,smells a little different .</li>
            <li>I generally fill a smaller dark glass bottle if I&#x27;m using the oils directly, and use it from there.</li>

            <li> Sweet Almond oil is probably the most popular base for massage oils because of its luxurious emollient feel and its ready absorbability. It is used both by itself and in combination with other oils to make custom blends. Almond oil is rich in vitamin A, B and E, which are great for skin health. In fact, most skin care products have these vitamins loaded in them. The oil helps maintaining moisture levels of the skin and gets absorbed in a jiffy without blocking the pores. If you are looking for a natural solution to get rid of dark under eye circles, almond oil is most suitable. Simply apply the oil before going to bed and allow it to work while you sleep. For optimum results do so regularly for a couple of weeks at least. The treatment will help you get rid of dark circles as well as reduce dark eyelids and crow’s feet.  May be used as a massage or moisturizing oil by applying to the skin or moisturizing oil by applying to those you may add your favorite essential skin as desired. Fragrance Free. If you choose you may add your favorite essential oil for fragrance. Keep all oils in a cool, dark place to preserve freshness. Overall, almond oil for skin care helps:&lt;br /&gt;• Improve the complexion and retaining glow&lt;br /&gt;• Moisturize better and deeper&lt;br /&gt;• Soothe skin irritation and skin inflammation&lt;br /&gt;• Relieves dry and irritated skin&lt;br /&gt;• Nourish skin, making it softer and smoother, cures chapped lips and body rashes. I received this for discount price in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> Product works well and is of good quality.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different Sweet Almond oils before and always had an issue with them not absorbing completely and making my skin look shiny. I didn&#x27;t like that because it was almost as if it was greasy. This brand rubs into your skin super quickly and completely! Afterwards, I had no shiny appearance whatsoever. I also like almond oil because it is super light and nearly scent free! This specific oil is also cold pressed which is something that I always look for because when heat is used in the making of oils, it takes away some of the health benefits. Lastly, while almond oil is a bit expensive to use in reed diffusers, I also love to use this in those because it works really well because it isn&#x27;t super thick, but it also isn&#x27;t the absolute thinnest. Just very happy that I got to try this at a discount in exchange for my honest review! (:</li>
            <li> I used it for my hair, skin, and my face. Can&#x27;t say enough about this great sweet almond oil. I recommended to my coworker as well. She has bleach her hair. This product will make your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Belleza Almond Oil is a great treat for your skin.  I have used it to make my body lotion &amp; it&#x27;s better than any prepared lotion you can buy.  I am now going to dry it for my dark circles under my eyes. It is great used alone also.  You sure don&#x27;t need much to feed your skin. Wonderful to use on dried up feet &amp; then put socks on!  Then go to bed.  You wake up with beautiful soft feet.  That will be nice to do this winter also.  For cuticles, it seems to work really fast!  I didn&#x27;t know it helps with sore muscles.  A little lavender oil &amp; then use this as your carrier oil.  That will be my next experiment. I did receive this oil at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. It&#x27;s great! Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> i love this Sweet Almond Oil.  Its light enough for the skin and extra lite as a coating for my hair which tends to get dry.  I am really satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I love making body oils with my essential oils and  a good quality carrier oil.  The Belleza Sweet almond oil makes an amazing whipped butter with Lavender.  Its silky smooth and has a very nice pleasant smell.  Overall this is a wonderful almond oil and im very please with the quality in comparison to others i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My wife is pregnant and using if stretch. She likes it because oil don&#x27;t have bat annoying odor and well absorbed into the wet skin</li>
            <li> I use it as a makeup remover and it does such a great job. Also in winter I use it in a spray bottle as a body moisturizer. It makes the skin feel silky smooth. If you have any dry skin that will take care of the problem right away.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you want silk smooth hair with a lot of shine - mix a little almond oil with any detangling leave in you have on hand. It will do magic on your hair. Just remember little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer, I received the product at a discount for testing. This is my honest and unbiased review. I hope I could help someone with this review.</li>
            <li> This oil smells more nutty than sweet, which is within the range of what sweet almond oil should smell like.  It is a little heavier than I like as a moisturizer, but it mixes readily with lighter oils and then doesn&#x27;t sit as long on the skin.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I can say that it makes my skin smooth and satin like. Superb quality and brand</li>
            <li> Loving this product. Great moisturizer for me and my skin is loving it too</li>
            <li> I use almond oil (as well as many others oils)  on my skin and hair. I vary them depending upon my needs and even what the weather conditions are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would give this oil a try as it was very economical and I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with the quality of it. I do recommend storing the container in a dark place as it&#x27;s clear and will not protect your delicate oil from becoming rancid due to light. I generally fill a smaller dark glass bottle if I&#x27;m using the oils directly, and use it from there. I take larger portions from my stored container if I&#x27;m mixing it into a lotion or other recipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I imagine this fine oil would be great to cook with ... I&#x27;ve honestly just never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to share with others who may be looking into this product for cosmetic intrests is that I&#x27;ve found that if you have skin irritation due tomorrow o use of acids on your skin; Glycolic (or other) peels for example, almond oil is soothing as an anti itch remedy to agitated just treated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;ve paid more for almond oil and not found it to be any better quality than this brand.</li>
            <li> This works well however I wish it smelled more almond like.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love Almond as  an all over moisturizer. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this so much. It has become my daily moisturizer after shower. I put Melaleuca essential oil on my keratosis spots and age spots, then follow up with a couple drops of this. Put in my palm and pat on face, then spread out and massage in. Leaves skin feeling soft and silky and it does not clog pores. Good for cooking too! LOL</li>
            <li> I have never used almond oil before, so I don&#x27;t have a means of comparing brands, but I am pleased with this purchase.  I use it in my home made shea butter lotion, as well as a facial treatment at night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I use this after shower, it moisturizers my skin gives it a healthy shine. It works very well than any other lotion. Not greasy at all and absorbs quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair. Feels Shiny soft strong hair. I massage it before washing my hair. Gives smooth soft touch. I had very unmanageable dry hair. Now those fuzzy days were gone. Hair quality improves a lot which saves lot of time during my day...</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I love almond oil, and this company did not disappoint me with theirs. I use almond oil to cook with, it brings out and gives flavors to many different kinds of foods, and a great replacement when baking. There is no overabundance taste of almond, it actually brings out the real taste of the food.</li>
            <li> The texture is very watery ,smells a little different . It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Did not contain the 16oz as advertised.  More like 12.  Nothing else in the box was oily, so it didn&#x27;t leak, it was shipped to me short of the advertised volume.  NOT HAPPY.</li>
