            <li>I love Skinceuticals</li>
            <li>I love this product and Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li>Maybe would work better for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, sunscreen and moisturizers for years and love them, so I thought I&#x27;d try this as a nighttime treatment.  </li>
            <li>I may expect more from this product from reviews I&#x27;ve read before purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Skin Ceuticals prods for many years, and I also work in the Derm field.&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my skin at night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction and product.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I ordered this product and although pricey, I love the fact that it comes out as a gel.</li>
            <li>but I feel my skin looks more luminous.</li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>Its a nice light serum.</li>
            <li>I love how it smooths my aging skin.</li>
            <li>Easy application</li>
            <li>Great product which was recommended to me as part of my medically based skin care regime.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it made my skin breakout , hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li>After some debate at first I continued on with this and do believe it helps at night w a night cream on top.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Ok I admit, I feel conned into believing this was completely unique and that this technology would&amp;#34;build collagen&amp;#34; in just two weeks by my local medispa  (Nice promo materials illustrating that)</li>
            <li>i also was concerned if this might not be a true SkinCeuticals product.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and my skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me in this case.  </li>
            <li>Started using it for a week and can&#x27;t tell any significant different in appearance of my skin but the very mild sensation after applied.</li>
            <li>I love Skinceuticals C E Ferulic very much and use it day and night, I want to try something for the night only and bought this one.</li>
            <li>I am able to actually see a difference when using this.</li>
            <li>It takes time for ingredients such as SkinCeutiacals Resveratrol B E contains, but you sure aren&#x27;t going to see those results before the container runs out.  </li>
            <li>First applied to my cleansed face in the evening before moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Resveratrol BE for about 6 weeks, after receiving a few samples from a SkinCeuticals rep, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever loved a product so much!</li>
            <li>Love SkinCeuticals and this is finally the &amp;#34;night serum&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been waiting for in their line, yay!!</li>
            <li>I loved this when I first got it, I loved all the skinceuticals products, however after a weekend out of town, I come back and use my products only to find that I developed a sudden allergy!</li>
            <li>I received 2 large samples of this from my dermatologists office</li>
            <li>It really works for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I used tanning beds (regret this so much now) throughout my life until 10 years ago and my face (hyperpigmentation and texture) improved so much after adding this product about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>It is very pricey though</li>
            <li>I rec this to everyone who wants to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Itr just brightens your whole face.</li>
            <li>A new product from Skin Ceuticals, the first nighttime repair for your PM routine.</li>
            <li>It does really help combat that dry, tight feeling, so I am mostly happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I loved it for the first few days, the texture is thick and rich but light at the same time after applying.</li>
            <li>There certainly is not enough to be able to evaluate it properly.</li>
            <li>I do HIGHLY recommend Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum</li>
            <li>high  quality.</li>
            <li>Might consider continue another bottle though, as preventive product normally wouldn&#x27;t yield detectable immediate improvement.</li>
            <li>and I am fairly sure it is the dimethicone in this formula that is breaking me out as I have used other products with a large amount of &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; and I always get the same reaction on my face.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin density has improved, and the tiny fine lines around my eyes are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li>I have new skin each morning.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers mention, this cooling gel manages to still feel rich and hydrating on the skin.</li>
            <li>My dark spots have since lighten and my skin appears smooth.</li>
            <li>I have used a nightly retinA for years and was interested in combining the two especially since use of the retin in winter is so drying.</li>
            <li>I have a dark mark on the side of my face and as I started to use this fantastic product  </li>
            <li>but I have been using it along with other products for many years and at 41 people always mistake me for being in my mid 20&#x27;s and early thirties .</li>
            <li>But I also use a lot of Paula&#x27;s Choice products and Elta Clear UV suncreen that have also helped a lot.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, melts into the skin, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Have used 1 bottle of this so far and like the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>so perhaps my skin is too far gone.</li>
            <li>but like it so far.</li>
            <li>The price is very high for what you are actually getting since the reservatrol is only 1% of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s POSSIBLE that I got a defective container that was half full.</li>
            <li>and I would not buy on Amazon only direct from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>My skin was starting to look better than ever, but now it&#x27;s been set back at least a month or two.  </li>
            <li>the consistency seemed different than one I purchased directly from the manufacturer</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the consistency seemed different than one I purchased directly from the manufacturer</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after only a few days of using this product, my always clear skin was covered with over 10 breakouts and a few bright red spots.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin at all, be very very careful.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to those whom price is not a factor and are not sensitive to dimethecone.</li>
            <li> because I spent my entire youth in the sun without sunscreen as a lifeguard</li>
            <li> My skin does feel really soft, and MAYBE I can see a few lines in my face smoothing out a bit.</li>
            <li> I was also hoping it would combat the dry flaky skin I get around my nose</li>
            <li> If you find you are dry during winter or sporadic &#x27;dry skin&#x27; spells, then by all means, use a moisturizer, BUT BTW Hyaluronic Acid, touted by Dr. OZ, et al, CANNOT absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The color was very yellow and not clear like previous products.  </li>
            <li> I did not use this with any other product for fear of an interaction with other ingredients, and used only Skinceuticals CE Ferulic and moisturizer during the day...</li>
            <li> It made the skin very dry and scaly, and made it appear saggy.</li>
            <li> I take care of my skin usually anyway with the other SkinCeuticals products, but adding this to my nighttime regime allows me to wake up to plump beautifully soft skin.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s very little product in the bottle and, although used as directed, it did not last as long as it should have.</li>
            <li> I was out of this for one month and the change in my skin was alarming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month, and not very faithfully until the last few days.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, a little goes a long way, which helps with the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to fight the dry, tight way my skin feels after a night out drinking alcohol or flying.</li>
            <li> but I felt dry after applying and nothing changed for few weeks.</li>
            <li> I tested an area on my body for any allergic reaction (because other reviewers here and online said they had a bad reaction), and it seemed just fine.  </li>
            <li> They are pricey, but less so on Amazon.</li>
            <li> since this is my 1st to use this product, not sure the yellow thick cream is not expired.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful, just warm, tight, itchy and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This was a bit too harsh on my neck.</li>
            <li> Ran out before I ordered it again and could tell the difference in&lt;br /&gt;just a few days.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I started developing a small rash on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see the benefits I had seen in the past.</li>
            <li> I had bad experience to receive skinceuticals cream that was old and color</li>
            <li> it slowly seems to fade Thank you.</li>
            <li> My face looks dry and damaged :(</li>
            <li> VERY Painful and RED.  </li>
            <li> It is just an expensive moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , it is also very expensive</li>
            <li> so the severe chemical burn and rash, without a doubt, are a result of this Resveratrol B E.  Horrible experience!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was out of this for one month and the change in my skin was alarming. I am back on this treatment and after three weeks my skin shows a noticeable improvement. It really works for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Skinceuticals so I was very excited to try this new product. I received 2 large samples of this from my dermatologists office and I loved it for the first few days, the texture is thick and rich but light at the same time after applying. Unfortunately, after only a few days of using this product, my always clear skin was covered with over 10 breakouts and a few bright red spots. I looked at the ingredient list and I am fairly sure it is the dimethicone in this formula that is breaking me out as I have used other products with a large amount of &amp;#34;cones&amp;#34; and I always get the same reaction on my face. The price is very high for what you are actually getting since the reservatrol is only 1% of the product. I would recommend this product to those whom price is not a factor and are not sensitive to dimethecone. I do HIGHLY recommend Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum, it is also very expensive but I have been using it along with other products for many years and at 41 people always mistake me for being in my mid 20&#x27;s and early thirties . I attribute a lot of of improvement to the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic Serum because I spent my entire youth in the sun without sunscreen as a lifeguard and I used tanning beds (regret this so much now) throughout my life until 10 years ago and my face (hyperpigmentation and texture) improved so much after adding this product about 5 years ago. But I also use a lot of Paula&#x27;s Choice products and Elta Clear UV suncreen that have also helped a lot. Here is the ingredient list for the Reservatrol BE: Aqua / Water / Eau, Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Niacinamide, Alcohol Denat., Glycerin, Caffeine, Sodium Chloride, PEG/PPG-18/18 Dimethicone, Tocopherol, Resveratrol, Scutellaria Baicalensis Extract / Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract, Disodium EDTA.</li>
            <li> I love this product and Skinceuticals. They are pricey, but less so on Amazon. Fortunately, a little goes a long way, which helps with the cost. I am able to actually see a difference when using this. It is definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> The color was very yellow and not clear like previous products.  It must have turned</li>
            <li> This was a bit too harsh on my neck. It made the skin very dry and scaly, and made it appear saggy. Maybe would work better for someone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know where I could write that I haven&#x27;t received 1 of this SkinCeuticals Resveratrol B E, 1 Fluid Ounce. I ordered 2 but got only 1!!</li>
            <li> I loved it!.... high  quality.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.  I had no irritation and worked well.  This is the second time I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This is a great line and I like a lot of their products, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it made my skin breakout , hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Works great. My skin never looked so good</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually works on aging, but it hydrates the skin, which makes the appearance of wrinkles diminished</li>
            <li> Excellent anti oxidant</li>
            <li> The product itself appears to be excellent. It contains resveratrol, the reason I bought it, and does have a very good chance of making a difference, except for one thing. There is almost nothing in this bottle. There certainly is not enough to be able to evaluate it properly. It takes time for ingredients such as SkinCeutiacals Resveratrol B E contains, but you sure aren&#x27;t going to see those results before the container runs out.  That means you&#x27;ll have to buy again before you even know if your skin is benefiting from it.  It wasn&#x27;t worth it for me in this case.  It&#x27;s POSSIBLE that I got a defective container that was half full. There&#x27;s no way to know.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and my skin is amazing.  I take care of my skin usually anyway with the other SkinCeuticals products, but adding this to my nighttime regime allows me to wake up to plump beautifully soft skin. I layer a firming cream over it and add Marula oil.  I&#x27;m 44 and my skin has never looked better.  I have combination skin btw.</li>
            <li> Great product which was recommended to me as part of my medically based skin care regime.  First applied to my cleansed face in the evening before moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I love Skinceuticals C E Ferulic very much and use it day and night, I want to try something for the night only and bought this one. but I felt dry after applying and nothing changed for few weeks. I won&#x27;t buy this again but contiune to use CEF.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> product is not sealed having no expiration date.  suggest seller includes these information on his/her add.  since this is my 1st to use this product, not sure the yellow thick cream is not expired.  I had bad experience to receive skinceuticals cream that was old and color had changed.  I ended to use the cream on hands instead of face.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this product, it was recommended by my sister who has had good performance from the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month, and not very faithfully until the last few days.  My skin does feel really soft, and MAYBE I can see a few lines in my face smoothing out a bit.</li>
            <li> This product is amaizing</li>
            <li> After some debate at first I continued on with this and do believe it helps at night w a night cream on top.  Just ordered more.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mention, this cooling gel manages to still feel rich and hydrating on the skin. I use it in the morning and at night before moisturizing. I bought this product hoping to fight the dry, tight way my skin feels after a night out drinking alcohol or flying. It does really help combat that dry, tight feeling, so I am mostly happy with my purchase. It helps even my skin tone as well. It is very pricey though and I would not buy on Amazon only direct from the manufacturer. I was also hoping it would combat the dry flaky skin I get around my nose and it has not done that. So not a miracle product by any means, but helpful and one I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic, sunscreen and moisturizers for years and love them, so I thought I&#x27;d try this as a nighttime treatment.  I tested an area on my body for any allergic reaction (because other reviewers here and online said they had a bad reaction), and it seemed just fine.  After only one application on my face and neck, I woke up to parched skin with redness and sensation of a chemical burn.  It wasn&#x27;t painful, just warm, tight, itchy and uncomfortable.  By the end of the day I started developing a small rash on my cheeks.  Morning of day two, I woke up with a severe rash on my face and neck with tons of unsightly red bumps all over!  I did not use this with any other product for fear of an interaction with other ingredients, and used only Skinceuticals CE Ferulic and moisturizer during the day...so the severe chemical burn and rash, without a doubt, are a result of this Resveratrol B E.  Horrible experience!  My skin was starting to look better than ever, but now it&#x27;s been set back at least a month or two.  My face looks dry and damaged :(</li>
            <li> Started using it for a week and can&#x27;t tell any significant different in appearance of my skin but the very mild sensation after applied. I may expect more from this product from reviews I&#x27;ve read before purchasing the product. Might consider continue another bottle though, as preventive product normally wouldn&#x27;t yield detectable immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my skin. My dark spots have since lighten and my skin appears smooth. It helps with clearing up break outs.</li>
            <li> A new product from Skin Ceuticals, the first nighttime repair for your PM routine. Great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Skin looks and feels great with Resveritol! I feel like my skin is maintaining its health vs continual decline with age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Resveratrol BE for about 6 weeks, after receiving a few samples from a SkinCeuticals rep, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever loved a product so much! I&#x27;ve been a fan of Skin Ceuticals prods for many years, and I also work in the Derm field.&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my skin at night, I apply this all over my face/neck/chest, and it goes on like butter. It melts into your skin, and it makes it feel like silk! I have noticed that my skin density has improved, and the tiny fine lines around my eyes are starting to diminish. I rec this to everyone who wants to fight the signs of aging. This product is a perfect companion to the SC CE Ferulic, applied in the morning. Antioxidants day&amp; night! What more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> Great product! Saved $50 shopping with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the transaction and product.</li>
            <li> I had heard on the Doctor Radio Show (Sirius XM 81) about the use of resveratrol in combination with a retinoid.  They have no affiliation with SkinCeuiticals. I have used a nightly retinA for years and was interested in combining the two especially since use of the retin in winter is so drying. Anyhow, I ordered this product and although pricey, I love the fact that it comes out as a gel. Easy application and it may be the placebo effect but I feel my skin looks more luminous. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> If y&#x27;all ladies are not using this at night, you are not protected.  Do your research, and get this product.  I did and this one is the best.  Not heavy, melts into the skin, not greasy.  Get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and use Skinceuticals C serum in the morning, followed by sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this procedure if you have oily T zone skin, and combination facial skin everywhere else.  If you find you are dry during winter or sporadic &#x27;dry skin&#x27; spells, then by all means, use a moisturizer, BUT BTW Hyaluronic Acid, touted by Dr. OZ, et al, CANNOT absorb into the skin.  It is just an expensive moisturizer.  If you want Restalyn ( which is hyaluronic acid) you have to get the injections.</li>
            <li> At 78, my skin is good except for wrinkles.  Now on my second bottle, I use it each evening after cleansing and the B5 Gel.  I have new skin each morning.</li>
            <li> Have used 1 bottle of this so far and like the results I&#x27;m seeing. Have purchased a second time.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. The purchase arrived on time.</li>
            <li> With out any doubt, this has been the best night serum I have ever used.  Ran out before I ordered it again and could tell the difference in&lt;br /&gt;just a few days.</li>
            <li> I like this serum....my skin feels refreshed and pampered when I put it on at night.  Its a nice light serum.</li>
            <li> Ok I admit, I feel conned into believing this was completely unique and that this technology would&amp;#34;build collagen&amp;#34; in just two weeks by my local medispa  (Nice promo materials illustrating that) Well unfort I haven&#x27;t noticed anything and I paid 145.  I am 52 so perhaps my skin is too far gone.</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals and this is finally the &amp;#34;night serum&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been waiting for in their line, yay!! Great product, great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s very little product in the bottle and, although used as directed, it did not last as long as it should have. i also was concerned if this might not be a true SkinCeuticals product. the consistency seemed different than one I purchased directly from the manufacturer and I didn&#x27;t see the benefits I had seen in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every penny!  I love how it smooths my aging skin.</li>
            <li> product works well and offers excellent results</li>
            <li> Great overnight treatment, I would definitley buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have only used 3 weeks but like it so far.</li>
            <li> I loved this when I first got it, I loved all the skinceuticals products, however after a weekend out of town, I come back and use my products only to find that I developed a sudden allergy! I used to use the C AHA regularly, this moisturizer at night and the A.G.E. interrupter during the day.  Well, now every time I use any of these products it is like acid burning my skin. VERY Painful and RED.  I had to use cortisone on my skin and after 10 days tried this again last night, and the same problem. Woke up itchy, red and burned. If you have sensitive skin at all, be very very careful.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Itr just brightens your whole face. I have a dark mark on the side of my face and as I started to use this fantastic product  it slowly seems to fade Thank you.</li>
