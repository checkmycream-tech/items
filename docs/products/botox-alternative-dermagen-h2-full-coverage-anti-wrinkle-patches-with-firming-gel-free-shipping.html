    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best wrinkle solution I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t win!</li>
            <li>but these are a great temporay fix.  </li>
            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; often leave marks that I&#x27;m sure would eventually turn into wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Put a patch on, and the area becomes very smooth.....</li>
            <li>But you feel and look better for awhile.  </li>
            <li>But for the money I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I have bought them several times and they work great!</li>
            <li>I wear them for 2-3 weeks now, I can tell that most of the fine lines on my forehead become unnoticable.  </li>
            <li>Also, if I ever find something better than Dermagen, I&#x27;ll certainly post that too! :-)</li>
            <li>So far these don&#x27;t seem to give the good results Frownies have.  </li>
            <li>I thought they&#x27;d be better because they aren&#x27;t paper, but so far that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  </li>
            <li>With the Dermagen patches, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of the gel being used with the full forehead patch (my favorite - dips down between your eyes), but it does smooth the wrinkles when worn overnight.  </li>
            <li>I especially love the full coverage forehead patches but really wish that they could be purchased by themselves than with the other ones that I do not really want.  </li>
            <li>I can say I like these Dermagen patches better than the brand &#x27;Facial Smoothies Wrinkle Remover Strips&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>but, where the patch ends...a new wrinkle begins!  </li>
            <li>As for &#x27;Facial Smoothies&#x27; - those really seem little more than glorified scotch tape.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it does help a little.</li>
            <li>I saw absolutely NO improvement in my nasolabial folds (smile lines), nor did I see an improvement in my skin&#x27;s resilience and elasticity.  </li>

            <li> I can say I like these Dermagen patches better than the brand &#x27;Facial Smoothies Wrinkle Remover Strips&#x27;.  With the Dermagen patches, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combination of the gel being used with the full forehead patch (my favorite - dips down between your eyes), but it does smooth the wrinkles when worn overnight.  Mind you - ALL these patches are a temporary mechanical fix - so by the end of the day, your wrinkles are making their appearance again.  But you feel and look better for awhile.  I think they help.  As for &#x27;Facial Smoothies&#x27; - those really seem little more than glorified scotch tape.  There&#x27;s just no substance to them. The caption on their box says - &#x27;start when you&#x27;re 30 and you&#x27;ll never look 40&#x27;.  So if you&#x27;re already 40, they&#x27;re telling us not to bother - and as for me, I won&#x27;t - ever again!  Also, if I ever find something better than Dermagen, I&#x27;ll certainly post that too! :-)</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO improvement in my nasolabial folds (smile lines), nor did I see an improvement in my skin&#x27;s resilience and elasticity.  My search is on.</li>
            <li> No difference,  product was painful to remove.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything.</li>
            <li> The pads for the neck doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin . The test of the patches works well .</li>
            <li> Looks like this is going to help.</li>
            <li> I especially love the full coverage forehead patches but really wish that they could be purchased by themselves than with the other ones that I do not really want.  I have forehead lines and used these with the included gel and after using for about a week noticed a dramatic improvement!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! The &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; often leave marks that I&#x27;m sure would eventually turn into wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I wear them for 2-3 weeks now, I can tell that most of the fine lines on my forehead become unnoticable.  the patches are reusable when use with lotion. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference, but it does help a little. If these worked as well as the chest pads, it would put a lot of plastic surgeons out of business!</li>
            <li> I DID NOT USE THE GEL AS IT DID NOT AGREE WITH MY SKIN . BUT THE OTHER TAPES DO WORK AND STICK WELL</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t work good</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird but these are a great temporay fix.  I tend to frown I am sleeping.  I put these on and the next morning my lines were dimished.</li>
            <li> So far these don&#x27;t seem to give the good results Frownies have.  I thought they&#x27;d be better because they aren&#x27;t paper, but so far that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.  I have to admit I am disappointed at this point, but will continue to give them a try and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> It is not a filler but it does reduce lines. They are not permanent and you have to wear them after a few days. But for the money I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these. I have bought them several times and they work great! The best wrinkle solution I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> Put a patch on, and the area becomes very smooth.....but, where the patch ends...a new wrinkle begins!  You can&#x27;t win!</li>
            <li> Not Botox Alter. BUT after Botox they retain the muscle from being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I use at night to maintain longer effects of Botox,&lt;br /&gt;they make skin on eyes feel softer in morning but I don&#x27;t trust re using them ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oil skin etc  in on the pads when u remove them.&lt;br /&gt;I tired wiping with wet cloth and reapplying with the gel and does not have same affect as first use.</li>
            <li> It actually works! Every night I slept with it on my face, the next day my wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
