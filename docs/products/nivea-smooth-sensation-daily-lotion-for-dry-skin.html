            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to make this purchase, just do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>This body lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>but Nivea provides an amazing feel</li>
            <li>It also has a light scent that smells great.</li>
            <li>Great add on for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Amazon always have good deals and Love their products.</li>
            <li>This one is stickier and doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.  </li>
            <li>I saw a popular talk show host extoll the virtue of Niviea and thought I would give it a try for use immediately after a shower.  </li>
            <li>It soothes skin and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This lotion is inexpensive and effective, it does not leave me greasy when I apply it</li>
            <li>Creams and lotions are nice.</li>
            <li>I liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I liked this when rubbed on hands you can feel the smoothness.</li>
            <li>Really nice lotion.</li>
            <li>Good product, I&#x27;ve been using for decades, as a result, a healthy skin.</li>
            <li>try once to make your own judgement</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another kind, it is the one.</li>
            <li>Nivea makes great lotions for quick absorption.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, and I loved the value almost more.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>Best Nivea lotion I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li>but I like this some particularly because this has very good aroma.</li>
            <li>The smell is OK but very strong.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is not greasy but makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Light, creamy, airy, fast absorbing, non greasy and pleasant smelling, and the best part...</li>
            <li>but when it&#x27;s available at a very good price, it&#x27;s certainly more than good enough.</li>
            <li>love this lotion and the e-coupon made it an even better value</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>nice light sent.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and she says it is her favorite lotion now.</li>
            <li>Great price - shipped fast</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, it keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea products.</li>
            <li>and I love my Prime for meeting my shipping needs....</li>
            <li>I would apply it before I go to sleep and everything would be nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>so I need a lotion that will make my skin feel smooth and moisturized, and this does just that!</li>
            <li>Among many body lotions, I like Nivea the best except &#x27;Essentially Enriched body lotion&#x27; .&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>not leave you with an oily feeling; which i LOVE about it&lt;</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still okay for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>

            <li>I LOVE the way this lotion smells.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li>I always love Nivea body lotion .</li>
            <li>I have got the best price for Nivea products only in Amazon</li>
            <li>so I have stopped looking for this lotion in Target or Walmart where the cost 3 times more .</li>
            <li>My all time favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the body wash two years ago.</li>
            <li>Love all things nivea.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also odorless so it won&#x27;t compete with your perfume, which I love.  </li>
            <li>So just watch to make sure you&#x27;re not getting ripped off.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this.</li>

            <li>never use anything else.the best lotion out there,doesnt dry up your skin,not to greasy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, dries easily and leaves you smooth!</li>
            <li>a bit more watery than i like my lotions, but fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a lot of good ones that I would certainly recommend as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using different brands of body moisturizer trying to find one that hydrates my skin, Nivea Smooth Sensation has been a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>But Nivea Smooth Sensation is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li>It also works great on my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>GOOD DEAL AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>This is good lotion that does a good job moisturizing my dry elbows.</li>
            <li>I started making my own because I could never find the right lotion for me, and</li>
            <li>Love it , my whole family&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wouldnt buy anything else, to the value and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Lovely hint of a nice smell, and really soothing.</li>
            <li>It works well and the dispenser is easily utilized.</li>
            <li>I almost feel like coughing and gagging because the smell is sooo strong.</li>
            <li>The fragrance smell seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li>okay, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>First ,it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine with the smell as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin love to use on my feet during the winter</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>and you do not need a large quantity for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>As expected from Nivea, this is a very good body lotion, you feel the protection and coverage of your skin.</li>
            <li>I can already tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can see why this had such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries even and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>I put it on after every shower and it leave my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day.</li>
            <li>Absorbs well into the skin leaving a smooth barrier.</li>
            <li>Its such a great product</li>
            <li>light on skin but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, yet keeps your skin well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I apply in the morning - by evening, my skin still feels smooth where applied.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even comments on how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth &amp; creamy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin moist all day and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>After bath your skin feels silky soft and it is also good for the feet.</li>
            <li>I tried it right out of the box and fell in love with it &amp;#34;au natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, smooth and buttery -also dries up fast to not leave your hands oily, but didn&#x27;t find anything special that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong nor too mild.  </li>
            <li>What a great cream for dry skin with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>Given the time of the year, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it on really dry &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin, but I&#x27;m guessing it would do a really good job, possibly better than Fruit of the Earth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago.</li>
            <li>rich lotion that works great on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at moisturizing, lasts a long time, is not too perfumey, and is just the right price!</li>
            <li>Thick, smooth, and lasts all day -- perfect for the never-ending winter that has descended on the eastern seaboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a clean powder like scent.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li>Super light, it made mine, mom and dad&#x27;s skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>Been using this body lotion over 10 years and my whole family love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
            <li>The 16.9 oz size is a good value and will last you a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, good value</li>
            <li>I use it more for scent than moisture, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The Nivea is much thicker than Fruit of the Earth and absorbs into the skin better.  </li>
            <li>and I think it actually is more effective with moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin and found this product about three years ago and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it feels going on and seems to moisturize adequately.</li>
            <li>It hydrates and its super light which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I first used a coupon to get a trial size version of this for free.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I am lucky enough to get foot rubs with this lotion and it is effective without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li>a little on the greasy side, but great for the winter</li>
            <li>inexpensive and useful</li>
            <li>This body lotion is so moisturizing and has a lovely soft scent.  </li>
            <li>this is worth zero stars....</li>
            <li>I love how soft it feels and the smell</li>
            <li>But I was hoping for a more thicker style lotion, although this feels good going on - it is not as thick as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to find the un-scented Nivea&#x27;s these days which I loved because it does not mix with colognes or perfumes.</li>
            <li>maybe a different kind</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, leaves your skin feeling really soft after applying.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It seems to have just the right amount of everything</li>
            <li>I probably will consider subscription from Amazon as the price is right</li>
            <li>I just apply right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Absorbs so quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft, dewy and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>I love how this lotion makes my dry skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Overall a great lotion with a medium scent.. it will wear off by the mid day though.</li>
            <li>Using this after quite sometime, they immediately felt this was the same nivea scent from good old days years ago.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be dry, but I apply this in the morning and my skin feels nice all day.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and skin allergies, and my dermatologist recommended Nivea Smooth Sensation lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used this before and like it very much for body lotion.</li>
            <li>Good for very dry skin, can be greasy for normal skin</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday lotion that is moisturizing yet not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Best smell, not too greasy, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>sinks into your skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>I also prefer the generic Trader Joe&#x27;s body lotion more, and that&#x27;s always $4/bottle for a sizeable amount.</li>
            <li>glides and is absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>and I love it, especially during winter months tho</li>
            <li>Will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>In the future I will contact the Nivea customer service to get more details and recommendations for my type of skin.</li>
            <li>Helps my skin so much!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely become my go-to lotion &amp; a part of my hygiene routine!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big lotion fan, but I may just start using it more now.</li>
            <li>It might not be my first choice if price were not a factor</li>
            <li>OK, so I have to admit, I only purchased the Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion to mix with my homemade body butters/creams, to give them a little more body and creamy texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s better than dry shaving! :D</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong at first but does dissipate, leaving a light fresh scent on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another kind of lotion &amp; for a matter of fact just ordered this again the other day.</li>
            <li>Smells nice compared to other Shea butter stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why other didn&#x27;t like this, mine went on smooth not heavy or greasy light feeling, light smell.</li>
            <li>I mixed it up with richer cream to get enough moisture and still be able to spread out easily.</li>
            <li>I wish the scent was more potent, if you like lotions with a medium to heavy scent, this isn&#x27;t for you!!</li>
            <li>I know Nivea since I was a little girl and this brand has proven that generally speaking its products are great.</li>
            <li>But all in all this is an amazing lotion, it makes my dry elbows and knees really soft!</li>
            <li>As usual, Nivea offers another great product.</li>
            <li>Large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Also this lotion last pretty close to 24hrs too which I&#x27;ve found its hard to find a lotion that will stick with you &amp; keep your skin looking nice, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>Even the smell is different than the typical Nivea body lotions that smell so great.</li>
            <li>Its wonderful, thick and creamy, and really soothes dry, damaged skin.</li>
            <li>I can spread it on quickly after a shower &amp; I get compliments all day on the nice but subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Way too much perfume cent&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
            <li>I also think it is very well priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.  </li>
            <li>I have that it makes my face really oily and causes me to break out if I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>and it sets up for the whole family use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really get all of the product out at the end.</li>
            <li>Very smooth&lt;br /&gt;hydrating&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li>Regardless it&#x27;s a very soothing lotion.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It smells very nice-almost perfumey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive after $2 off coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li>A lot for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Nivea has been around for a long, long time for good reason.  </li>
            <li>And while it is scented, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances when I chose to wear them.</li>
            <li>This is a great lubricant that requires application of only a small amount of product to desired areas where moisture is lacking.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all but a bit heavy if you want something light.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and highly recommend it for people who have dry skin and wants to achieve soft skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I use only in the winter months, when our skin dries out more because of the cold , great price.</li>
            <li>Hand down, this has been my favorite body lotion for years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a decent product.</li>
            <li>Not too thick; very moisturizing; smells nice.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions over the last few years in an attempt to find the one I like the most.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked, used the Nivea Smooth Sensation exclusively for a week and the dry spot is gone!</li>
            <li>my little  girls love the smell</li>
            <li>Almost all body lotions are sufficiently moisturizing, although most do not last very long.</li>
            <li>My heels which are normally dry and cracked during the summer are even starting to get better.</li>
            <li>long lasting, deep moisten, I love it very much</li>
            <li>Has a great subtle scent, lasts long, and does not feel caked on or greasy.</li>
            <li>We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without body lotions all year around.</li>
            <li>I live 5000 feet up</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but really nice.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, yet subtle.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Keeps skin very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>About the product - its not watery, but has medium consistency which makes application easy, and is lasts long enough so that I do not have to reapply within the day.</li>
            <li>Too strong of a fragrance, thankfully does not last a long time.</li>
            <li>Wow this lotion makes your skin feel SO silky!</li>
            <li>Third, it really does work!</li>
            <li>From the first time I put this on, it made a noticeable lasting difference.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday lotion!</li>
            <li>If you use it consistently you&#x27;ll definitely see the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell a little strong, so if you&#x27;re scent-sensitive, this would not be the lotion for you.</li>
            <li>I like the white bottle much better, also a Nivea for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells like powder and old ladies - i just want lotion, not perfume...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft for days after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoith soft and silky</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my body soft all the time.</li>
            <li>This lotion is VERY creamy and it only takes a drop for your hands.</li>
            <li>The scent is neutral enough that both of us can use it, and the subscribe and save price is very competitive.</li>
            <li>Not too light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and silky now.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with at least 5 bottles.</li>
            <li>Wish it were all natural.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and my skin is soft without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>In it&#x27;s place, I have soft, supple, and yes touchable skin.</li>
            <li>I trusted the several reviews posted in Amazon regarding this new Smooth Sensation lotion and because I have an extremely sensitive dry skin, decided to try it, actually thinking that it was the same that I used some years ago (</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend either the Nivea and Fruit of the Earth to anyone that has dry skin.</li>
            <li>This years dry weather had really been taking a toll on my skin and after just a couple weeks use</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised that the lotion not only exceeded my expectations, but clearly surpassed them.</li>
            <li>I like Nivea, like the price compared to other much higher prices lotions and Nivea</li>
            <li>Generally I like Nivea&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m diabetic and this is the only lotion that keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job combating dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and this lotion has helped me keep my skin moisturized all year long.</li>
            <li>Because of mild nature, I used it in summer as well and using it fro past 9 months.</li>
            <li>Though it doesn&#x27;t advertise healing properties she had some constantly dry spots that haven&#x27;t come back since she began using this as her normal lotion.</li>
            <li>A few coats of this keeps my skin pretty well in control.</li>
            <li>a lot better).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the &amp;#34;smoothing sensation&amp;#34; is created by a way too high dose of glycerin that makes the lotion extremely sticky and tending to stay on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she was surprised how well it worked on her dry skin.  </li>

            <li> Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li> but I like this some particularly because this has very good aroma.</li>
            <li> The smell is OK but very strong.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is not greasy but makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Light, creamy, airy, fast absorbing, non greasy and pleasant smelling, and the best part...</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s available at a very good price, it&#x27;s certainly more than good enough.</li>
            <li> love this lotion and the e-coupon made it an even better value</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> nice light sent.  </li>

            <li> Love Nivea products.</li>
            <li> and I love my Prime for meeting my shipping needs....</li>
            <li> I would apply it before I go to sleep and everything would be nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> so I need a lotion that will make my skin feel smooth and moisturized, and this does just that!</li>
            <li> Among many body lotions, I like Nivea the best except &#x27;Essentially Enriched body lotion&#x27; .&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> not leave you with an oily feeling; which i LOVE about it&lt;</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still okay for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>

            <li> I LOVE the way this lotion smells.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion.</li>
            <li> I always love Nivea body lotion .</li>
            <li> I have got the best price for Nivea products only in Amazon</li>
            <li> so I have stopped looking for this lotion in Target or Walmart where the cost 3 times more .</li>
            <li> My all time favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the body wash two years ago.</li>
            <li> Love all things nivea.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also odorless so it won&#x27;t compete with your perfume, which I love.  </li>
            <li> So just watch to make sure you&#x27;re not getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, bit sticky but ok.</li>
            <li> her skin looking beautiful  and soft</li>
            <li> never use anything else.the best lotion out there,doesnt dry up your skin,not to greasy.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, dries easily and leaves you smooth!</li>
            <li> a bit more watery than i like my lotions, but fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a lot of good ones that I would certainly recommend as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using different brands of body moisturizer trying to find one that hydrates my skin, Nivea Smooth Sensation has been a very pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> But Nivea Smooth Sensation is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li> It also works great on my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> GOOD DEAL AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> This is good lotion that does a good job moisturizing my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> I started making my own because I could never find the right lotion for me, and</li>
            <li> Love it , my whole family&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wouldnt buy anything else, to the value and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy flowing body lotion, does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> and it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Lovely hint of a nice smell, and really soothing.</li>
            <li> It works well and the dispenser is easily utilized.</li>
            <li> I almost feel like coughing and gagging because the smell is sooo strong.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smell seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li> okay, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> First ,it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine with the smell as well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin love to use on my feet during the winter</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> and you do not need a large quantity for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> As expected from Nivea, this is a very good body lotion, you feel the protection and coverage of your skin.</li>
            <li> I can already tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can see why this had such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries even and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> I put it on after every shower and it leave my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well into the skin leaving a smooth barrier.</li>
            <li> Its such a great product</li>
            <li> light on skin but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, yet keeps your skin well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I apply in the morning - by evening, my skin still feels smooth where applied.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even comments on how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth &amp; creamy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moist all day and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> After bath your skin feels silky soft and it is also good for the feet.</li>
            <li> I tried it right out of the box and fell in love with it &amp;#34;au natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, smooth and buttery -also dries up fast to not leave your hands oily, but didn&#x27;t find anything special that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong nor too mild.  </li>
            <li> What a great cream for dry skin with a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> Given the time of the year, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it on really dry &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin, but I&#x27;m guessing it would do a really good job, possibly better than Fruit of the Earth.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago.</li>
            <li> rich lotion that works great on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at moisturizing, lasts a long time, is not too perfumey, and is just the right price!</li>
            <li> Thick, smooth, and lasts all day -- perfect for the never-ending winter that has descended on the eastern seaboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean powder like scent.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> Super light, it made mine, mom and dad&#x27;s skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> Been using this body lotion over 10 years and my whole family love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
            <li> The 16.9 oz size is a good value and will last you a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, good value</li>
            <li> I use it more for scent than moisture, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The Nivea is much thicker than Fruit of the Earth and absorbs into the skin better.  </li>
            <li> and I think it actually is more effective with moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin and found this product about three years ago and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it feels going on and seems to moisturize adequately.</li>
            <li> It hydrates and its super light which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I first used a coupon to get a trial size version of this for free.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough to get foot rubs with this lotion and it is effective without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> a little on the greasy side, but great for the winter</li>
            <li> inexpensive and useful</li>
            <li> This body lotion is so moisturizing and has a lovely soft scent.  </li>
            <li> this is worth zero stars....</li>
            <li> I love how soft it feels and the smell</li>
            <li> But I was hoping for a more thicker style lotion, although this feels good going on - it is not as thick as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find the un-scented Nivea&#x27;s these days which I loved because it does not mix with colognes or perfumes.</li>
            <li> maybe a different kind</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, leaves your skin feeling really soft after applying.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It seems to have just the right amount of everything</li>
            <li> I probably will consider subscription from Amazon as the price is right</li>
            <li> I just apply right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Absorbs so quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft, dewy and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li> I love how this lotion makes my dry skin so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Overall a great lotion with a medium scent.. it will wear off by the mid day though.</li>
            <li> Using this after quite sometime, they immediately felt this was the same nivea scent from good old days years ago.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry, but I apply this in the morning and my skin feels nice all day.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and skin allergies, and my dermatologist recommended Nivea Smooth Sensation lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and like it very much for body lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for very dry skin, can be greasy for normal skin</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday lotion that is moisturizing yet not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Best smell, not too greasy, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> sinks into your skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer the generic Trader Joe&#x27;s body lotion more, and that&#x27;s always $4/bottle for a sizeable amount.</li>
            <li> glides and is absorbed very well.</li>
            <li> and I love it, especially during winter months tho</li>
            <li> Will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> In the future I will contact the Nivea customer service to get more details and recommendations for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin so much!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely become my go-to lotion &amp; a part of my hygiene routine!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth, soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big lotion fan, but I may just start using it more now.</li>
            <li> It might not be my first choice if price were not a factor</li>
            <li> OK, so I have to admit, I only purchased the Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion to mix with my homemade body butters/creams, to give them a little more body and creamy texture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s better than dry shaving! :D</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong at first but does dissipate, leaving a light fresh scent on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another kind of lotion &amp; for a matter of fact just ordered this again the other day.</li>
            <li> Smells nice compared to other Shea butter stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other didn&#x27;t like this, mine went on smooth not heavy or greasy light feeling, light smell.</li>
            <li> I mixed it up with richer cream to get enough moisture and still be able to spread out easily.</li>
            <li> I wish the scent was more potent, if you like lotions with a medium to heavy scent, this isn&#x27;t for you!!</li>
            <li> I know Nivea since I was a little girl and this brand has proven that generally speaking its products are great.</li>
            <li> But all in all this is an amazing lotion, it makes my dry elbows and knees really soft!</li>
            <li> As usual, Nivea offers another great product.</li>
            <li> Large bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> Also this lotion last pretty close to 24hrs too which I&#x27;ve found its hard to find a lotion that will stick with you &amp; keep your skin looking nice, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> Even the smell is different than the typical Nivea body lotions that smell so great.</li>
            <li> Its wonderful, thick and creamy, and really soothes dry, damaged skin.</li>
            <li> I can spread it on quickly after a shower &amp; I get compliments all day on the nice but subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Way too much perfume cent&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
            <li> I also think it is very well priced.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.  </li>
            <li> I have that it makes my face really oily and causes me to break out if I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> and it sets up for the whole family use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really get all of the product out at the end.</li>
            <li> Very smooth&lt;br /&gt;hydrating&lt;br /&gt;does</li>
            <li> Regardless it&#x27;s a very soothing lotion.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It smells very nice-almost perfumey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive after $2 off coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li> A lot for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Nivea has been around for a long, long time for good reason.  </li>
            <li> And while it is scented, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances when I chose to wear them.</li>
            <li> This is a great lubricant that requires application of only a small amount of product to desired areas where moisture is lacking.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all but a bit heavy if you want something light.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and highly recommend it for people who have dry skin and wants to achieve soft skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I use only in the winter months, when our skin dries out more because of the cold , great price.</li>
            <li> Hand down, this has been my favorite body lotion for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a decent product.</li>
            <li> Not too thick; very moisturizing; smells nice.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions over the last few years in an attempt to find the one I like the most.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, used the Nivea Smooth Sensation exclusively for a week and the dry spot is gone!</li>
            <li> my little  girls love the smell</li>
            <li> Almost all body lotions are sufficiently moisturizing, although most do not last very long.</li>
            <li> My heels which are normally dry and cracked during the summer are even starting to get better.</li>
            <li> long lasting, deep moisten, I love it very much</li>
            <li> Has a great subtle scent, lasts long, and does not feel caked on or greasy.</li>
            <li> We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without body lotions all year around.</li>
            <li> I live 5000 feet up</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle but really nice.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, yet subtle.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Keeps skin very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> About the product - its not watery, but has medium consistency which makes application easy, and is lasts long enough so that I do not have to reapply within the day.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a fragrance, thankfully does not last a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow this lotion makes your skin feel SO silky!</li>
            <li> Third, it really does work!</li>
            <li> From the first time I put this on, it made a noticeable lasting difference.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday lotion!</li>
            <li> If you use it consistently you&#x27;ll definitely see the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell a little strong, so if you&#x27;re scent-sensitive, this would not be the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> I like the white bottle much better, also a Nivea for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells like powder and old ladies - i just want lotion, not perfume...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft for days after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoith soft and silky</li>
            <li> It helps to keep my body soft all the time.</li>
            <li> This lotion is VERY creamy and it only takes a drop for your hands.</li>
            <li> The scent is neutral enough that both of us can use it, and the subscribe and save price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> Not too light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and silky now.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with at least 5 bottles.</li>
            <li> Wish it were all natural.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and my skin is soft without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s place, I have soft, supple, and yes touchable skin.</li>
            <li> I trusted the several reviews posted in Amazon regarding this new Smooth Sensation lotion and because I have an extremely sensitive dry skin, decided to try it, actually thinking that it was the same that I used some years ago (</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend either the Nivea and Fruit of the Earth to anyone that has dry skin.</li>
            <li> This years dry weather had really been taking a toll on my skin and after just a couple weeks use</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised that the lotion not only exceeded my expectations, but clearly surpassed them.</li>
            <li> I like Nivea, like the price compared to other much higher prices lotions and Nivea</li>
            <li> Generally I like Nivea&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m diabetic and this is the only lotion that keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job combating dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and this lotion has helped me keep my skin moisturized all year long.</li>
            <li> Because of mild nature, I used it in summer as well and using it fro past 9 months.</li>
            <li> Though it doesn&#x27;t advertise healing properties she had some constantly dry spots that haven&#x27;t come back since she began using this as her normal lotion.</li>
            <li> A few coats of this keeps my skin pretty well in control.</li>
            <li> a lot better).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the &amp;#34;smoothing sensation&amp;#34; is created by a way too high dose of glycerin that makes the lotion extremely sticky and tending to stay on the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she was surprised how well it worked on her dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is not to thick or runny, but just right.</li>
            <li> They make my skin feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other lotion.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find a lotion that leaves my hands super soft in the morning after using it the night before, and this one has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> The Nivea body lotion is long lasting and soothing to the touch.</li>
            <li> The next day by afternoon time my hands and feet were dry already.</li>
            <li> They are the only lotion to keep my dry skin moist.</li>
            <li> have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, MAKES MY TERRIBLE DRY SKIN ON MY FEET REALLY SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is very fair-at least when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Aveeno user.</li>
            <li> after a bath it takes a long time before you can dress.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea lotion for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I used it a long time ago and found it did not absorb well, leaving a greasy residue on the skin.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s sticky and never stops being sticky, no matter how long you leave it on.</li>
            <li> moisturizer stays long.</li>
            <li> the lotion is very, very greasy, and absorbs very, very slowly.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy but also helps the dry skin like I have.  </li>
            <li> Makes my dry skin glow.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have had a stubborn dry spot on my ankle forever.</li>
            <li> and the air is killer dry.  </li>
            <li> Helps for dry skin and irritation.</li>
            <li> I purposely stopped using my homemade remedies for one week, and just used the Nivea, and the dry, chapped skin stayed away.</li>
            <li> It does facilitate treating dry skin but with limited impact.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, get it!</li>
            <li> I especially like it because my skin is so dry during this winter season, and I apply just a little in the morning</li>
            <li> I use this and the very dry skin lotion.</li>
            <li> She has very dry skin</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hands have reached the point of splitting and bleeding, although my elbows, knees and feet haven&#x27;t gotten to that point (thank Heavens), they do become very dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and it is hard to fine a lotion that works well for me without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using Rite Aid store brand and that seemed watery compared to this and did not really rub all the way in.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Second ,it is just the right consistency,not to thick or thin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like it sinks in as well as other lotions by Nivea.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this lotion goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Is not too thick nor too thin and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The other Nivea lotions are either too oily or too watery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other types of Nivea lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea and other brands for years.  </li>
            <li> I prefer thick (I mean THICK) lotion, and I was worried that this seemed too light -</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and have been searching for a product that treats the dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell that my husband will hate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too thick and has enough moisture.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Thick enough that I feel moisturized throughout the day, but not gloppy.</li>
            <li> Irritating on cuts and sensitive areas of skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other crappy runny lotion, this stuff sticks to skin (doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;evaporate\\&quot; in 2 minutes!)</li>
            <li> and it lingers not something i would buy just because this is not mild scented at all.</li>
            <li> Amazon is always my Fav. Place to buy stuffs and a little Discount counts</li>
            <li> A little oily.</li>
            <li> (The scent is a little heavy - don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like perfumed lotion)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few yrs now</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> I never thought my skin could be so silky and as a few others have noted &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> without feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy, nauseating scent.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the fragrance, but</li>
            <li> The scent is a little stronger than I prefer, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> and I could not wait to try it, especially since my skin gets really dry during the winter months and Lubriderm just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, and in the winter it becomes even worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find it on sale along with coupons.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not runny or too thick.</li>
            <li> and I feel a little silly writing a review for lotion</li>
            <li> leaves a tiny bit of oily film but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I try to tough it out, but within minutes, I end up running to the sink to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money, so I&#x27;ve tried several times to use this lotion.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Has a horrible medicine smell that is very typical of Nivea product.</li>
            <li> I feel it decreases the effectiveness, and is painful to dried/cracked skin.</li>
            <li> but i HATE the smell its so overpowering</li>
            <li> I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> very, very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best Nivea lotion I&#x27;ve used so far. Best smell, not too greasy, a little goes a long way! Recommend!</li>
            <li> GOOD DEAL AND FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, she loves the stuff</li>
            <li> Way too much perfume cent&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
            <li> Wow this lotion makes your skin feel SO silky! The smell is a little strong at first but does dissipate, leaving a light fresh scent on your skin.  I am hooked for life - I can see why this had such great reviews. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or sticky, and hours later I can&#x27;t stop feeling my skin - softer than a babies bottom!</li>
            <li> As usual, Nivea offers another great product. I use this and the very dry skin lotion. I prefer this during the summer</li>
            <li> Been using this body lotion over 10 years and my whole family love it.</li>
            <li> Has a horrible medicine smell that is very typical of Nivea product. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion. The scent is pleasant without being overpowering, and it moisturizes incredibly well. It is difficult to find a lotion that leaves my hands super soft in the morning after using it the night before, and this one has exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend this product.  Thank you Nivea!</li>
            <li> love this lotion and the e-coupon made it an even better value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this lotion.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, smooth and buttery -also dries up fast to not leave your hands oily, but didn&#x27;t find anything special that makes it stand out.</li>
            <li> great moisturizing lotion</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. I&#x27;ve tried many different lotions over the last few years in an attempt to find the one I like the most. I&#x27;ve found a lot of good ones that I would certainly recommend as well. But Nivea Smooth Sensation is currently my favorite. It hydrates well and is not too oily. It seems to have just the right amount of everything and I&#x27;m fine with the smell as well. I also think it is very well priced. I&#x27;ve tried some more expensive lotions, but still prefer this to any of them.</li>
            <li> I like ve this product</li>
            <li> Bought for my honey.  He loves the scent and quality of the lotion. I have to order in bulk next time!</li>
            <li> inexpensive and useful</li>
            <li> Smells like powder and old ladies - i just want lotion, not perfume... and I&#x27;m a man, can we not make me smell like a woman?  Thanks.</li>
            <li> goodï¼Œ smells well, long lasting, deep moisten, I love it very much</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and skin allergies, and my dermatologist recommended Nivea Smooth Sensation lotion. Its wonderful, thick and creamy, and really soothes dry, damaged skin. If you&#x27;ve got psoriasis or exzema, this is for you!  I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash.  Love this!</li>
            <li> This body lotion is so moisturizing and has a lovely soft scent.  I especially like it because my skin is so dry during this winter season, and I apply just a little in the morning and I&#x27;m all set! If you have dry skin, get it!</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great. I think this actually heals scars faster. I hurt my self recently and the lotion stink on the scar. After a week it felt great. This will last me a while. Amazon always have good deals and Love their products.</li>
            <li> nice light sent.  rich lotion that works great on dry skin.  sinks into your skin nicely.  you don&#x27;t need to use much for it to work.  leaves a tiny bit of oily film but not too bad.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is amazing. I use Nivea products exclusively and this is the best that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> We regularly purchase this item. Great for the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Aveeno user. The price convinced me to try Nivea and I think it actually is more effective with moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just received this lotion in the mail and I could not wait to try it, especially since my skin gets really dry during the winter months and Lubriderm just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  Amazing lotion!  Absorbs so quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft, dewy and lightly scented.  I am a fan for life!  Buy this now, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Pretty good! Not is the best in mercado, But the price is good</li>
            <li> this is worth zero stars.... the lotion is very, very greasy, and absorbs very, very slowly. after a bath it takes a long time before you can dress. very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Goes on smooth, dries even and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother. She has very dry skin and she says it is her favorite lotion now.</li>
            <li> The only lotion my son can use! it works amazing!</li>
            <li> Great price - shipped fast</li>
            <li> Nivea makes great lotions for quick absorption. I use this interchangeably with their Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion as part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a fragrance, thankfully does not last a long time. Otherwise, a decent product.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every time she comes out of the keeps her skin looking beautiful  and soft she even uses it on our children my little  girls love the smell</li>
            <li> Have used Nivea products for years.  Excellent.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I first used a coupon to get a trial size version of this for free. I like it because it is not greasy but makes my skin very smooth. I have psoriasis and it is hard to fine a lotion that works well for me without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is working great for me.  I had been using Rite Aid store brand and that seemed watery compared to this and did not really rub all the way in.  I have not had that issue since changing to Nivea.  This years dry weather had really been taking a toll on my skin and after just a couple weeks use I can already tell a huge difference.  My heels which are normally dry and cracked during the summer are even starting to get better.</li>
            <li> I like the white bottle much better, also a Nivea for extra dry skin.  This one is stickier and doesn&#x27;t smell as nice.  Worked okay, but nothing special.  I also prefer the generic Trader Joe&#x27;s body lotion more, and that&#x27;s always $4/bottle for a sizeable amount.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite lotion from Nivea, I always like to use this after I get out of the shower. It leaves my skin soft for days after. Only problem I have that it makes my face really oily and causes me to break out if I put it on my face. But otherwise it smells great, has a nice texture and works like a charm. The 16.9 oz size is a good value and will last you a while. Do recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, it keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does the job and it sets up for the whole family use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldnt buy anything else, to the value and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great bargain.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and like it very much for body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It hydrates and its super light which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, use it every morning. Will be buying more and with a coupon and S&amp;S its way cheaper than walmart!</li>
            <li> We love Nivea for body lotion, best bang for the buck. We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea lotion for a long time.  It is not greasy but also helps the dry skin like I have.  The scent is not too strong nor too mild.  it fits my style and flavor.  I probably will consider subscription from Amazon as the price is right and it is so convenient that it delivers to your door.</li>
            <li> Astonished it worked.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea products. This is a great one too. It&#x27;s smoith soft and silky</li>
            <li> Nivea is a very good product.  I would give it 5 stars but you can&#x27;t really get all of the product out at the end.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and works great!</li>
            <li> Works well.Makes my dry skin glow.It is worth the price,wait and the quality and quantity makes it superb.Great product.Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My crack. I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this moisturized well but I did like the scent.</li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin and found this product about three years ago and never looked back. No moisturizer is as good. It&#x27;s deeply moisturizing, good value and they also make a travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really my go-to!</li>
            <li> Amazon is always my Fav. Place to buy stuffs and a little Discount counts and I love my Prime for meeting my shipping needs....</li>
            <li> This stuff works I guess. I would apply it before I go to sleep and everything would be nice and smooth. The next day by afternoon time my hands and feet were dry already. I was hoping for something that would have a longer lasting effect.</li>
            <li> This lotion works well on my skin. I have dry skin so I need a lotion that will make my skin feel smooth and moisturized, and this does just that!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion! First ,it smells amazing. Second ,it is just the right consistency,not to thick or thin. Third, it really does work! I have had a stubborn dry spot on my ankle forever. Nothing worked, used the Nivea Smooth Sensation exclusively for a week and the dry spot is gone!</li>
            <li> Has Nivea improved?  I used it a long time ago and found it did not absorb well, leaving a greasy residue on the skin.  I saw a popular talk show host extoll the virtue of Niviea and thought I would give it a try for use immediately after a shower.  It is great.  Absorbs well and leaves my skin smooth and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> Thick, smooth, and lasts all day -- perfect for the never-ending winter that has descended on the eastern seaboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little strong, so if you&#x27;re scent-sensitive, this would not be the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> A very nice product for winters. It soothes skin and smells nice. The moisturizer works well and holds for enough time.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it feels and the smell</li>
            <li> Nivea is the best product. It helps to keep my body soft all the time. It has taken me forever to find a product that would work and this works perfectly. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> a little on the greasy side, but great for the winter</li>
            <li> easy flowing body lotion, does work as advertised. I apply it at night before going to bed, and the effect lasts all night. what else to write...go buy this.</li>
            <li> This lotion is inexpensive and effective, it does not leave me greasy when I apply it and you do not need a large quantity for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> But I was hoping for a more thicker style lotion, although this feels good going on - it is not as thick as I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will just have to keep looking.  Shipping was great, product came just as promised!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft. I&#x27;m diabetic and this is the only lotion that keeps my feet soft. The other Nivea lotions are either too oily or too watery. This one is perfect!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without body lotions all year around. Among many body lotions, I like Nivea the best except &#x27;Essentially Enriched body lotion&#x27; .&lt;br /&gt;It is not too thick and has enough moisture.&lt;br /&gt;It glides and is absorbed very well. No residue feeling.</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast service, awesome product. This lotion is VERY creamy and it only takes a drop for your hands. I have been using this product for a few yrs now and I love it, especially during winter months tho I use it year round. GREAT body lotion, for legs, arms and hands ..May God bless! .</li>
            <li> This is a great all over moisturizer.I put it on after every shower and it leave my skin silky smooth.It absorbs with no greasy feeling on my skin.Will buy again</li>
            <li> Very good lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day. I recommend it for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> i only used the sample pack and it moisturizes well but i HATE the smell its so overpowering and it lingers not something i would buy just because this is not mild scented at all. I almost feel like coughing and gagging because the smell is sooo strong.</li>
            <li> Generally I like Nivea&#x27;s products. I just don&#x27;t like moisturizers that contain alcohol, and feel it should be disclosed on the details of the product. I feel it decreases the effectiveness, and is painful to dried/cracked skin.</li>
            <li> The skin becomes mush softer. Great! But the smell might start bothering you after the application. The smell is OK but very strong.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, great smell and absorption.</li>
            <li> Not too thick; very moisturizing; smells nice.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff.  It&#x27;s great at moisturizing, lasts a long time, is not too perfumey, and is just the right price!</li>
            <li> Not bad at all but a bit heavy if you want something light. It&#x27;s great lotion as most Nivea products are. It&#x27;s harder to find the un-scented Nivea&#x27;s these days which I loved because it does not mix with colognes or perfumes. Overall a great lotion with a medium scent.. it will wear off by the mid day though.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite lotion. For the price too, you just can&#x27;t beat it. The smell is subtle but really nice.  I never thought my skin could be so silky and as a few others have noted &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34;. From the first time I put this on, it made a noticeable lasting difference. Will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I know Nivea since I was a little girl and this brand has proven that generally speaking its products are great. I trusted the several reviews posted in Amazon regarding this new Smooth Sensation lotion and because I have an extremely sensitive dry skin, decided to try it, actually thinking that it was the same that I used some years ago ( a lot better).&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the &amp;#34;smoothing sensation&amp;#34; is created by a way too high dose of glycerin that makes the lotion extremely sticky and tending to stay on the surface of the skin. Even the smell is different than the typical Nivea body lotions that smell so great. I will keep using it on my legs but will never buy it again. In the future I will contact the Nivea customer service to get more details and recommendations for my type of skin.</li>
            <li> Have beed using it for years! It is my go to lotion for all seasons. I live in Arizona and this lotion has helped me keep my skin moisturized all year long. Love Nivea products!!</li>
            <li> great nivea lotion..highly recomend</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, the scent was too perfumed for my preference.</li>
            <li> Very smooth&lt;br /&gt;hydrating&lt;br /&gt;does not leave you with an oily feeling; which i LOVE about it&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;will buy again or maybe a different kind but Nivea provides an amazing feel&lt;br /&gt;Great quality lotion Plus benifits</li>
            <li> Good for very dry skin, can be greasy for normal skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like it sinks in as well as other lotions by Nivea.  But it&#x27;s still okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, leaves your skin feeling really soft after applying. I wish the scent was more potent, if you like lotions with a medium to heavy scent, this isn&#x27;t for you!!</li>
            <li> nice quality.. feels good</li>
            <li> Great price, lovely scent!</li>
            <li> During the winter season, lotion is essential, and Nivea is a winner! I love this brand, and I loved the value almost more. Great price!!â€‹</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a great price. Only rated four stars because I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the smell. Regardless it&#x27;s a very soothing lotion.</li>
            <li> good quality, very easy to use. I mixed it up with richer cream to get enough moisture and still be able to spread out easily. Reasonable price</li>
            <li> I am lucky enough to get foot rubs with this lotion and it is effective without being overly greasy. The scent is neutral enough that both of us can use it, and the subscribe and save price is very competitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I feel a little silly writing a review for lotion but this is the best lotion I have ever used. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy or sticky. I get compliments daily from the scent. The smell is neutral.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a clean powder like scent. Not perfumey or flowery. Great lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Good purchase price. Speedy delivery.  Excellent product no matter where it is purchased.  I have used it for years.  Very satisfied with the rests.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> Helps my skin so much!  I live 5000 feet up and the air is killer dry.  A few coats of this keeps my skin pretty well in control.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will not use anything else moving forward.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this lotion, just wish it didn&#x27;t have the methylparabens in it.</li>
            <li> never use anything else.the best lotion out there,doesnt dry up your skin,not to greasy.</li>
            <li> I love how this lotion makes my dry skin so smooth and silky. It works great after you have been in the sun and got a sunburn because it moistures so well! It makes your skin stay hydrated for over 24 hours! Skin is so soft! Great product.</li>
            <li> FUVFIVE STARS I LOVE IT.KEEP SENDING IT. THANKS</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money, so I&#x27;ve tried several times to use this lotion. But it&#x27;s sticky and never stops being sticky, no matter how long you leave it on. I try to tough it out, but within minutes, I end up running to the sink to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Nivea is good brand for body care products. Creams and lotions are nice. They are not as good as the pricey ones like Olay. But for the price they are great. I got these as Add-On for about $10 I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought one and gifted one to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Have been using for some time and love it.  Not too oily.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the way this lotion smells. It&#x27;s a great consistency, too. Thick enough that I feel moisturized throughout the day, but not gloppy. I can spread it on quickly after a shower &amp; I get compliments all day on the nice but subtle smell. It&#x27;s absolutely become my go-to lotion &amp; a part of my hygiene routine!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she was surprised how well it worked on her dry skin.  Though it doesn&#x27;t advertise healing properties she had some constantly dry spots that haven&#x27;t come back since she began using this as her normal lotion.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, MAKES MY TERRIBLE DRY SKIN ON MY FEET REALLY SMOOTH.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea products exclusively for years.  From my neck to my ankles after every shower.  I need a product that moisturizes well and it easy to apply.  This product does that.</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion. Smells very good. Because of mild nature, I used it in summer as well and using it fro past 9 months.</li>
            <li> Super light, it made mine, mom and dad&#x27;s skin super smooth. My nails started shining (even if temporarily). Using this after quite sometime, they immediately felt this was the same nivea scent from good old days years ago.</li>
            <li> Smells good and has a lot or moisture.</li>
            <li> What a great cream for dry skin with a fantastic scent. Not to oily. I would definitely buy this product again and again</li>
            <li> basic moisturizer, I use it morning and night.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion. I have been using it for over 6 years now. It leaves my skin smooth, soft and silky. My skin never drys out while I&#x27;m using this lotion. This lotion locks in moisture in my skin. A little bit of this lotion goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. The consistency of the lotion is not to thick or runny, but just right. I love this lotion and highly recommend it for people who have dry skin and wants to achieve soft skin.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion. Doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy yet keeps my skin smooth all day. I recommend it for anyone with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always love Nivea body lotion . but I like this some particularly because this has very good aroma. I have got the best price for Nivea products only in Amazon so I have stopped looking for this lotion in Target or Walmart where the cost 3 times more .</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday lotion! Not greasy, dries easily and leaves you smooth!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite lotion.  Has a great subtle scent, lasts long, and does not feel caked on or greasy.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the body wash two years ago. I got one bottle that had a sample of lotion with it . Now I&#x27;m in love with it too lol. They make my skin feel so soft and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like other lotion. It also has a light scent that smells great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I&#x27;m picky when it comes to lotion because I just can&#x27;t stand the ones that makes me oily. This lotion doesn&#x27;t make me oily, but gives my skin this nice moisturized shiny look &amp; it feels great! Also this lotion last pretty close to 24hrs too which I&#x27;ve found its hard to find a lotion that will stick with you &amp; keep your skin looking nice, shiny &amp; healthy. I will never buy another kind of lotion &amp; for a matter of fact just ordered this again the other day.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.  Absorbs well into the skin leaving a smooth barrier.</li>
            <li> Not too light and not too heavy. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love all things nivea. Its such a great product</li>
            <li> I love Nivea! It&#x27;s the best lotion out there. If you use it consistently you&#x27;ll definitely see the difference in your skin. My skin is so soft and silky now. I LOVE it. It&#x27;s like crack for my skin. I always make sure I&#x27;m stocked up with at least 5 bottles. And you can&#x27;t beat the price on here especially for the size. It&#x27;s hard to find it on sale along with coupons.</li>
            <li> Good product .  Very satisfied ...</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday lotion that is moisturizing yet not thick or greasy.  It&#x27;s also odorless so it won&#x27;t compete with your perfume, which I love.  Great consistency and one of the better inexpensive body lotions I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and have been searching for a product that treats the dry skin, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell that my husband will hate. This fit the bill perfectly! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best &amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34; scent ever! I use it more for scent than moisture, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great deal on subscribe and save!!!!</li>
            <li> great moisturizer. value for money indeed .does what it promise to do. light on skin but moisturizer stays long. thanks</li>
            <li> The best lotion. Smells wonderful and keeps the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion that does a good job moisturizing my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body lotion! It smells very nice-almost perfumey. Some people may not like the smell, but I personally do. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. I just apply right after I get out of the shower. The steam from the shower would have made the lotion easier to absorb into the skin. The price on Amazon is very fair-at least when I bought it. The only thing I notice is that the price may fall and rise drastically-one day it&#x27;s $3 and one day it&#x27;s $10. So just watch to make sure you&#x27;re not getting ripped off. But all in all this is an amazing lotion, it makes my dry elbows and knees really soft! And if I run out of shaving gel, I&#x27;ll just use this. It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s better than dry shaving! :D</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizing lotion. Is not too thick nor too thin and absorbs fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great. Wish it were all natural.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it leaves my skin soft and smooth.  My skin tends to be dry, but I apply this in the morning and my skin feels nice all day.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other types of Nivea lotion but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, no stickiness.</li>
            <li> This lotion doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and moisturizes my skin for over 24 hours. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Very inexpensive after $2 off coupon from amazon.</li>
            <li> Good hand and body lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other didn&#x27;t like this, mine went on smooth not heavy or greasy light feeling, light smell. Maybe it&#x27;s because I use only in the winter months, when our skin dries out more because of the cold , great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great lubricant that requires application of only a small amount of product to desired areas where moisture is lacking.</li>
            <li> Lovely hint of a nice smell, and really soothing. A lot for a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this lotion.  It&#x27;s light, yet keeps your skin well moisturized.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nivea and other brands for years.  I like Nivea, like the price compared to other much higher prices lotions and Nivea is as compatible for the skin.  I have and will buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this seems to work well. Large bottle for the price. Great add on for free shipping.</li>
            <li> product was all it said it would be. After bath your skin feels silky soft and it is also good for the feet.</li>
            <li> bought 2 of them, works great.</li>
            <li> I liked this when rubbed on hands you can feel the smoothness. I purchased it for my mom whose 87.</li>
            <li> Really nice lotion. Keeps skin very soft and moisturized. Not a huge fan of the fragrance, but I don&#x27;t let that stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent deal.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;ve been using for decades, as a result, a healthy skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smell seems to be too strong.</li>
            <li> An awesome product. I prefer thick (I mean THICK) lotion, and I was worried that this seemed too light - but it&#x27;s a perfect consistency. Unlike other crappy runny lotion, this stuff sticks to skin (doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;evaporate\\&quot; in 2 minutes!) without feeling sticky or heavy. I apply in the morning - by evening, my skin still feels smooth where applied. Plus, it smells great. (The scent is a little heavy - don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like perfumed lotion)</li>
            <li> Big hit at our household. Went and purchased more since then! I&#x27;m not a big lotion fan, but I may just start using it more now.</li>
            <li> I have been using different brands of body moisturizer trying to find one that hydrates my skin, Nivea Smooth Sensation has been a very pleasant surprise.  I highly recommend this product.  My search is finally over.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea lotions! They are the only lotion to keep my dry skin moist.</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the lotion not only exceeded my expectations, but clearly surpassed them. About the product - its not watery, but has medium consistency which makes application easy, and is lasts long enough so that I do not have to reapply within the day. Its not greasy, and has a muted fragrance. Overall, I like my purchase !</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin love to use on my feet during the winter</li>
            <li> Great product at great price</li>
            <li> Helps for dry skin and irritation.</li>
            <li> Hand down, this has been my favorite body lotion for years. Almost all body lotions are sufficiently moisturizing, although most do not last very long. This does. But the best thing about this lotion, what makes it irreplaceable, is how quickly my skin absorbs it. No residue. And while it is scented, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t clash with other fragrances when I chose to wear them.</li>
            <li> Smooth. Smells nice compared to other Shea butter stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try once to make your own judgement</li>
            <li> Fells good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I smell good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body lotions for years. I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this. I smells good and moisturize amazing. Love it.</li>
            <li> I think this must be the best body cream. It everything I want in a body cream, smells great leaves your skin feeling ever so great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Arrived on time shipping was no problem.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as described.</li>
            <li> Love the hydration and smell. The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin. Holds up great in Florida summer heat!</li>
            <li> A little oily. But good moisture! Long lasting.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E body lotion and I like it.  It does a decent job combating dry winter skin.  However, after some research I decided to try a bottle of the Nivea.  The Nivea is much thicker than Fruit of the Earth and absorbs into the skin better.  The scent is a little stronger than I prefer, but not overwhelming.  Given the time of the year, I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it on really dry &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; skin, but I&#x27;m guessing it would do a really good job, possibly better than Fruit of the Earth.  I would certainly recommend either the Nivea and Fruit of the Earth to anyone that has dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service!!</li>
            <li> Nivea gets the job done.</li>
            <li> my new favorite. Great smell</li>
            <li> Nivea has been around for a long, long time for good reason.  It&#x27;s effective.  I use it every day and my skin is soft without a greasy feel.  It&#x27;s the only body lotion I care to use.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  The scent is nice, yet subtle. It leaves my skin feeling soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> a bit more watery than i like my lotions, but fine otherwise. good price.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! I will never buy another kind, it is the one. My boyfriend even comments on how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have to admit, I only purchased the Nivea Smooth Sensation Body Lotion to mix with my homemade body butters/creams, to give them a little more body and creamy texture. I tried it right out of the box and fell in love with it &amp;#34;au natural&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my homemade lotions too, but sometimes you just can&#x27;t make it, be it time, ingredients, desire, whatever. When that happens, this is my go to lotion. I started making my own because I could never find the right lotion for me, and my skin type. I have extremely dry skin, and in the winter it becomes even worse. My hands have reached the point of splitting and bleeding, although my elbows, knees and feet haven&#x27;t gotten to that point (thank Heavens), they do become very dry and chapped. My dermatologist prescribed Eucerin cream, and though it may be soothing, it did not remedy the problem.  THIS lotion does!!! I purposely stopped using my homemade remedies for one week, and just used the Nivea, and the dry, chapped skin stayed away. In it&#x27;s place, I have soft, supple, and yes touchable skin. This lotion is amazing! Light, creamy, airy, fast absorbing, non greasy and pleasant smelling, and the best part... it&#x27;s inexpensive, and I don&#x27;t have to do any work to get it! I now have a staple that I can rely on for my skin care. Don&#x27;t hesitate to make this purchase, just do it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin super soft and smells great. It also works great on my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li> The Nivea body lotion is long lasting and soothing to the touch. It works well and the dispenser is easily utilized. However, the odor is definitely noticeable. If you want odorless then this is not the lotion for you. It does facilitate treating dry skin but with limited impact. The lotion is not runny or too thick. It&#x27;s just that the odor smells like burnt coconut and latex.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell. Moisturizing wise it&#x27;s fine but I can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Love Nivea. Have used their lotions for over 20yrs and this is a great price!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  Good protection.</li>
            <li> its good for jerking off  10/10 best lotion i ever used thanks barack obama</li>
            <li> Has a great &amp;#34;rich&amp;#34; texture. I like the way it feels going on and seems to moisturize adequately. It might not be my first choice if price were not a factor but when it&#x27;s available at a very good price, it&#x27;s certainly more than good enough.</li>
            <li> Love it , my whole family&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> This body lotion is the best!!!</li>
            <li> the only lotion that i&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> I have only used this with combination with Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion, and it have improved my skin condition!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, bit sticky but ok.</li>
            <li> Heavy, nauseating scent. Irritating on cuts and sensitive areas of skin.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever! It is so smooth &amp; creamy and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> As expected from Nivea, this is a very good body lotion, you feel the protection and coverage of your skin. I will definitely continue buying it.</li>
            <li> Great product that serves its purpose. Keeps the skin moist all day and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I use for moisturizing my skin. It helps a  lot w/o leaving my skin feeling and looking&lt;br /&gt;greasy.</li>
    </ol>
