            <li>I have never had tweezers with such an amazing point.</li>
            <li>That’s what we’re here for, right?</li>
            <li>These actually do the job without injuring self with the point of the tweezers, unlike many on the market today.</li>
            <li>I have to purchase another to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li>I had a mini-learning curve at first, thinking that the tweezer was not picking up the finest hairs around my brow.</li>
            <li>With less than a minute’s practice, I was able to pluck any size of hair, no matter how fine, with this tweezer.</li>
            <li>or wherever you would normally keep tweezers,  I received these at a very low price in order to test them and report my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product when you are trying to get a very small sliver or ingrown hair out.</li>
            <li>The design is contemporary and fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve included a picture which illustrates the difference in these and normal tweezers so that you can see how the sharp edges offer a much more precise work area.</li>
            <li>Was debating on getting these or replacing my older Tweezerman pointed which have been sharpened several times and do work much better.  </li>
            <li>Between rough and tumble children, and outdoor loving pooches, these tweezers have really come in handy a lot since I received them a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>I like that they come in their own little pouch.</li>
            <li>The tweezers themselves feel very sturdy and durable, they also have a coating on the outside that makes it easier to grip the tweezers when plucking those fine hairs.</li>
            <li>These tweezers have a sharp,pointy edge which works very well for all types of tweezing.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very well made product.</li>
            <li>Work very well for removing slivers.</li>
            <li>It is very well made.</li>
            <li>but I tried them on an ingrown hair and they weren&#x27;t anything really helpful.</li>
            <li>The tweezer fits very snuggly sideways.</li>
            <li>This tweezer performs very well.</li>
            <li>Can grab the very start of a hair poking through the skin with no problems.</li>
            <li>They get all those ingrown hairs that the razor just doesn&#x27;t touch, and do so better than any other tweezers I have tried.</li>
            <li>Not only are they stylish with the compact purple case, they are far more functional than your normal, everyday slant edged tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get them to even remove a normal hair.</li>
            <li>ISSUE FOR THE CASE: Due to the lack of suppleness of the case material, the end of the flap closure lays FLAT instead of molding over the body of the case, increasing the likelihood of the corners catching on things in one’s purse.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp therefore allowing you to really find the ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>Castle Rock Essential  does exactly what it says it can do😃 Made from quality material.</li>
            <li>Super pin point tip, but with a wide stable place to put your fingers.  </li>
            <li>These are super sharp.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that you will not waste your money with these.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are made from stainless steel, so they won&#x27;t rust or corrode and will last for years.</li>
            <li>My husband was so excited to see this review item arrive, that even he has used them a few times.  </li>
            <li>There is no slipping of the fingers while using the Tweezers for Ingrown Hair .  </li>

            <li> I was really happy to have the chance to try and review these as part of a promotion, especially when they are exactly what i have been looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The included matching case keeps them enclosed safely until you are ready to use them</li>
            <li> They are super sharp and sturdy and work great.  </li>
            <li> They are very well made and strong.  </li>
            <li> It fits very well in your hand and makes grabbing easy whether you are grabbing a splinter or an ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> This is so cool, the tip is so unique, because it can really get even the smallest ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The tip is nice and sharp to make tweezing easy.  </li>
            <li> It come with a really neat case that the tweezers fit inside if neatly.  </li>
            <li> I have never had tweezers with such an amazing point.</li>
            <li> That’s what we’re here for, right?</li>
            <li> These actually do the job without injuring self with the point of the tweezers, unlike many on the market today.</li>
            <li> I have to purchase another to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I had a mini-learning curve at first, thinking that the tweezer was not picking up the finest hairs around my brow.</li>
            <li> With less than a minute’s practice, I was able to pluck any size of hair, no matter how fine, with this tweezer.</li>
            <li> or wherever you would normally keep tweezers,  I received these at a very low price in order to test them and report my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product when you are trying to get a very small sliver or ingrown hair out.</li>
            <li> The design is contemporary and fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included a picture which illustrates the difference in these and normal tweezers so that you can see how the sharp edges offer a much more precise work area.</li>
            <li> Was debating on getting these or replacing my older Tweezerman pointed which have been sharpened several times and do work much better.  </li>
            <li> Between rough and tumble children, and outdoor loving pooches, these tweezers have really come in handy a lot since I received them a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I like that they come in their own little pouch.</li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves feel very sturdy and durable, they also have a coating on the outside that makes it easier to grip the tweezers when plucking those fine hairs.</li>
            <li> These tweezers have a sharp,pointy edge which works very well for all types of tweezing.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy</li>

            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> Work very well for removing slivers.</li>
            <li> It is very well made.</li>
            <li> but I tried them on an ingrown hair and they weren&#x27;t anything really helpful.</li>
            <li> The tweezer fits very snuggly sideways.</li>
            <li> This tweezer performs very well.</li>
            <li> Can grab the very start of a hair poking through the skin with no problems.</li>
            <li> They get all those ingrown hairs that the razor just doesn&#x27;t touch, and do so better than any other tweezers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Not only are they stylish with the compact purple case, they are far more functional than your normal, everyday slant edged tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get them to even remove a normal hair.</li>
            <li> ISSUE FOR THE CASE: Due to the lack of suppleness of the case material, the end of the flap closure lays FLAT instead of molding over the body of the case, increasing the likelihood of the corners catching on things in one’s purse.</li>
            <li> They are super sharp therefore allowing you to really find the ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> Castle Rock Essential  does exactly what it says it can do😃 Made from quality material.</li>
            <li> Super pin point tip, but with a wide stable place to put your fingers.  </li>
            <li> These are super sharp.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that you will not waste your money with these.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are made from stainless steel, so they won&#x27;t rust or corrode and will last for years.</li>
            <li> My husband was so excited to see this review item arrive, that even he has used them a few times.  </li>
            <li> There is no slipping of the fingers while using the Tweezers for Ingrown Hair .  </li>
            <li> I seem to have a bit of a learning curve with them after using a different style tweezer for so long.  </li>
            <li> The black interior feels soft and a bit fuzzy, almost like velvet, though I would not call it velvet.</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to any other brand after using these.  </li>
            <li> The color is a dark purple, and is aesthetically pleasing enough for this price level.</li>
            <li> I get them on the inside of my leg all of the time and typically I use regular tweezers, which gouge my skin out, with a needle to pull the hair out which seems to take forever</li>
            <li> Aside from that possible small hitch, the benefit of the accessory case is a big plus at this price level, and so I won’t be deducting points for this</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I slipped it sideways back into its snug little pocket case, and felt quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also used these for getting splinters out as the tip is so sharp, you can use it like a needle.  </li>
            <li> I bought these sharp needlepoint tweezers with a discount</li>
            <li> They come in a compact, yet durable purple case...perfect for protecting you from poking yourself on the sharp edges.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll stick with Tweezerman, like I usually do.</li>
            <li> Our skin usually takes a beating with traditional tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have bought several tweezers that say they work for &#x27;splinter removal &#x27; &amp; hard to get hairs but do not.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave or pluck my hair, and no matter how long I take</li>
            <li> I usually miss the very little hairs and can never seem to get them with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> No fun!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are quite sharp and pointed to grasp small hairs or slivers.</li>
            <li> Ample room is given for the tip of the tweezer where the case folds over, and the case seals with a firmly adhered velcro</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of them for the intended use</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you don’t like purple, you might be on the wrong product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you don’t like purple, you might be on the wrong product page.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that they are precision calibrated as they claim, if so, mine are way off.  </li>

            <li> I have PCOS, and unfortunately as a woman it gives me awful facial hair.</li>
            <li> so I can pull random hairs and even shape and style my brows while I&#x27;m out and about.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These tweezers have a sharp,pointy edge which works very well for all types of tweezing. Very sturdy and they come in their own purple case so they are easy to spot in your purse or makeup case. Very happy to get them as a promotion.</li>
            <li> This tweezers work GREAT for ingrown hair first time I tried it I was already in love with it</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1b536e5c7bb78e8df2f27658c83855ba]] These tweezers are perfect for pulling out those stubborn hairs that just don&#x27;t know when its time to let it go.  It come with a really neat case that the tweezers fit inside if neatly.  The tweezers themselves feel very sturdy and durable, they also have a coating on the outside that makes it easier to grip the tweezers when plucking those fine hairs. They are well made and there aren&#x27;t any gaps at the tip that would cause the tweezers to not function properly. Best of all is the color, my favorite and it prevents the husband from carrying them off. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and opinion.</li>
            <li> I love these for ingrown hairs! I get them on the inside of my leg all of the time and typically I use regular tweezers, which gouge my skin out, with a needle to pull the hair out which seems to take forever and it&#x27;s painful. It&#x27;s a hassle and ineffective frankly. These tweezers are a great combo of sharp and precise and are perfect to get those stubborn hairs out. They aren&#x27;t as sharp as a needle, or as thin, but they don&#x27;t have to be. I love having these around, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them for when the kids get splinters too.</li>
            <li> Love these!!  They come in their own matching case. Precision tips on these will get the tiniest shortest hair. Definitely recommend these</li>
            <li> Who would have thought I would have fallen in love with some tweezers, but it happened.  It&#x27;s so precise and can get into an area you need it to.  This is a must have for your collection of tweezers.  I was so glad that I could purchase this during a promotional period, but it&#x27;s well worth the money at full price.  And I love the color purple.</li>
            <li> Very sharp! Great product!</li>
            <li> Super pin point tip, but with a wide stable place to put your fingers.  You have great control because of the wide area for your fingers.</li>
            <li> These purple tweezers are AMAZING!!  They are super sharp therefore allowing you to really find the ingrown hair.  I have also used these for getting splinters out as the tip is so sharp, you can use it like a needle.  The carry case is wonderful to keep them in as they are so sharp that hunting for these in a drawer could be damaging.  I received these through a promotion and I can tell you that you will not waste your money with these.  They are strong, effective, and simply fabulous!!  I highly recommend these to have in your purse or in the home for many uses!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are made from stainless steel, so they won&#x27;t rust or corrode and will last for years. The tips are pointed, allowing for pinpoint precision when plucking an ingrown hair. No more poking around creating ugly looking sores just to nab one piece of hair. They are lightweight, pretty to look at and come in a nice case so you can tuck them away in your purse. I am thrilled with how easy I can now remove ingrown hair without creating sores or scars. I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Great for splinters and ingrown hairs. These are super sharp. They have needle like points so they are great at getting stubborn ingrown hairs. In addition, these little tweezers are perfect for getting out splinters in your skin, even glass. These are great to have on hand. I keep mine by my bandages so I can find them easily when needed. I like that they come in their own little pouch. The purple pouch has a Velcro closure and it secures them nicely. The tweezers will not fall out of it. I bought these sharp needlepoint tweezers with a discount and I could not be happier with them. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for splinters or hard to get hairs.  They are very well made and strong.  The tip is nice and sharp to make tweezing easy.  I like the convenient case for carrying them in my purse.</li>
            <li> I had to get a pair for me because my husband took mine. great product and my husband said they are nice and pointy.Very well made product.</li>
            <li> discounted item for honest feedback! not working for ingrown. just for regular hair</li>
            <li> Great quality. Perfect to keep in your purse in the stylish case. Work very well for removing slivers.</li>
            <li> I received this tweezers during a promotional period and I am glad that I did. They are super sharp and sturdy and work great.  They come in a convenient case that makes for easy storage and portability.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great product for ingrown hair!  I feel these tweezers are a good value.  These actually do the job without injuring self with the point of the tweezers, unlike many on the market today.</li>
            <li> The tweezers have a nice feel to them. I seem to have a bit of a learning curve with them after using a different style tweezer for so long.  I tried using them on stragglers (not ingrown) and the tweezers broke the hairs instead of removing them.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Used these last to pull a splinter out. Worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of tweezers! It comes in a very nice purple case which is perfect since the tip of this set of tweezers has a sharp edge. It fits very well in your hand and makes grabbing easy whether you are grabbing a splinter or an ingrown hair. It is very well made. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive the Tweezers for Ingrown Hair Sparkles with Super Cute New Purple Case as part of a promotion.  In my honest opinion, these are the greatest tweezers ever created.  Not only are they stylish with the compact purple case, they are far more functional than your normal, everyday slant edged tweezers.  Splinters, ingrown hairs, and ticks are a common theme in our household.  Between rough and tumble children, and outdoor loving pooches, these tweezers have really come in handy a lot since I received them a few weeks ago.  While many people may use their precision tweezers for eyebrow hair removal, I have yet to try it.  They are so functional, and the unique handle design makes them easy to get a good grip.  There is no slipping of the fingers while using the Tweezers for Ingrown Hair .  My husband was so excited to see this review item arrive, that even he has used them a few times.  A great product for anyone looking for that perfect, useful set of tweezers.  I will not be going back to any other brand after using these.  For sure!!!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by the quality. These are great for stubborn ingrown hairs and splinters.  I have to purchase another to add to my first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I received these treezers at a greatly reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion about them. They are very easy to hold and use and they work exceptionally well. This is a great product when you are trying to get a very small sliver or ingrown hair out.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to finally find a pointed nose tweezer, which is great for ingrown hairs and for removing splinters. I just cannot say enough about the case they come in. It&#x27;s protects the tweezers and may them easy to drop in your bag and go. I purchased them during a promotional period and my review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is so cool, the tip is so unique, because it can really get even the smallest ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have bought several tweezers that say they work for &#x27;splinter removal &#x27; &amp; hard to get hairs but do not. Castle Rock Essential  does exactly what it says it can do😃 Made from quality material. They work great!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in these tweezers they aren&#x27;t sharply pointed allowing you to remove an ingrown hair. Can&#x27;t get them to even remove a normal hair. Was debating on getting these or replacing my older Tweezerman pointed which have been sharpened several times and do work much better.  Just don&#x27;t drop them on the floor.  Will be going back to Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Helps get out unwanted ingrown hairs without unnecessary skin butchering.</li>
            <li> I bought these for splinters and fine detail craft work but I tried them on an ingrown hair and they weren&#x27;t anything really helpful. Not a huge fan of them for the intended use but it is still a helpful tool.</li>
            <li> I was sold this product at a deep discount in exchange for an honest review, and I can promise you that this will be an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CASE: The outside of the case is made up of a man-made material that is meant to mimic a leather-type look. The black interior feels soft and a bit fuzzy, almost like velvet, though I would not call it velvet. The case holds the tweezer very nicely, but lacks the suppleness that real leather provides. This is appropriate at this price level and the pocket case adds significant value to the product, making the tweezer easier to find in a purse or drawer. The color is a dark purple, and is aesthetically pleasing enough for this price level. The tweezer fits very snuggly sideways. Ample room is given for the tip of the tweezer where the case folds over, and the case seals with a firmly adhered velcro closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE ISSUE FOR THE CASE: Due to the lack of suppleness of the case material, the end of the flap closure lays FLAT instead of molding over the body of the case, increasing the likelihood of the corners catching on things in one’s purse. The issue is not severe, but I thought I would point it out since some individuals carry a plethora of items at the bottom of their purse. I would likely slip this tweezer case into a side/slender pocket of my purse to avoid any such issues. Aside from that possible small hitch, the benefit of the accessory case is a big plus at this price level, and so I won’t be deducting points for this maybe-it-is-maybe-it-isn’t-an-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TWEEZER: That’s what we’re here for, right? This tweezer performs very well. I had a mini-learning curve at first, thinking that the tweezer was not picking up the finest hairs around my brow. I was wrong. This is a precision tweezer, requiring precision handling as well. With less than a minute’s practice, I was able to pluck any size of hair, no matter how fine, with this tweezer. Afterwards, I slipped it sideways back into its snug little pocket case, and felt quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SPARKLES: Yes, this tweezer has them. Because of the darker purple color, the sparkles don’t appear overwhelming. If you have an aversion to looking overly Rainbows-CandyCanes-and-Unicorns, this should suit you well enough. Obviously, if you don’t like purple, you might be on the wrong product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING: This tweezer performs very well, is a good purchase at this price, and is rated as a strong buy in this price category.se, and felt quite impressed.

            <li> What an excellent set of tweezers! I was given a coupon for these in exchange for an unbiased and completely honest review, so I was happy to put them to the test! They come in a compact, yet durable purple case...perfect for protecting you from poking yourself on the sharp edges. They fit perfectly in your hand, allowing your thumb to grip them firmly, which is imperative for instances when you&#x27;re trying to remove glass or splinters. I&#x27;ve included a picture which illustrates the difference in these and normal tweezers so that you can see how the sharp edges offer a much more precise work area. These are a must have for everyone. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Product works well.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Like the length in my hand but hair &amp; thread slip through the end.  I&#x27;m not sure that they are precision calibrated as they claim, if so, mine are way off.  Next time I&#x27;ll stick with Tweezerman, like I usually do. Don&#x27;t think I ever received that ebook that was mentioned either.</li>
            <li> Very precise tweezer. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> Received my item.  Love the color and feel.  Easy to use after receiving instructions.  I was able to purchase the item with a tremendous discount from joining, elitedealclub.com.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are perfect for precise tweezing, splinter removal and even for crafts where you need to add or remove small threads, beads, etc. The included matching case keeps them enclosed safely until you are ready to use them and it also makes them easy to find in your cosmetic bag, craft drawer or wherever you would normally keep tweezers,  I received these at a very low price in order to test them and report my honest opinion.  I am pleased to say that I would have paid full price for them as they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> these tweezers are awesome!!! I Purchased these tweezers as a promo deal but the opinions are my own. I have never had tweezers with such an amazing point. Wonderful for ingrown hairs or splinters. Can grab the very start of a hair poking through the skin with no problems. A household must have!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these tweezers existed. Our skin usually takes a beating with traditional tweezers. So glad I found these.</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job, tweezerman does a much better job for the price.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, and unfortunately as a woman it gives me awful facial hair. No fun! I usually have to shave or pluck my hair, and no matter how long I take I usually miss the very little hairs and can never seem to get them with regular tweezers. I was really happy to have the chance to try and review these as part of a promotion, especially when they are exactly what i have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color and matching case. The case makes them perfect to throw in my purse. Even more important I love how they work! They get all those ingrown hairs that the razor just doesn&#x27;t touch, and do so better than any other tweezers I have tried. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Great set of tweezers! They are stylish, with an attractive handy case which makes it easy to store in my glove box, a perfect place so I can pull random hairs and even shape and style my brows while I&#x27;m out and about. The tweezers are quite sharp and pointed to grasp small hairs or slivers. I rarely find a pair of tweezers that I like, but this is a quality, attractive set. I was able to get an awesome coupon towards my purchase as well! The design is contemporary and fun.</li>
