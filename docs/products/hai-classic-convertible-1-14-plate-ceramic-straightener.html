    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Needed this item asap and seller was awesome.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still working great!  </li>
            <li>Good quality!</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>I love the flatiron and was really impressed by the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I really loved it</li>
            <li>i got the chi before the hai, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>i love this straightener!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t catch your hair and gives you a flawless straighten.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and the result is spectacular!</li>
            <li>Great product, great seller, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but i wanted a really good straightener and this seemed too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but I have lots of it!</li>
            <li>I went to visit my BFF in Vegas and fell in Love with hers...</li>
            <li>I feel in love with my hairdresser&#x27;s HAI flatiron.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love that you can change the temperature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find this item here for such a great price!</li>
            <li>I like how the HAI has a setting dial, and it also seems to feel more substantial than the Chi.  </li>
            <li>I probably damaged my hair at first thinking having it on a higher setting was better, but I&#x27;ve been able to dial in the heat setting that works best for my hair, and I love that I can change it.</li>
            <li>I also love that it makes wonderful curls that last a million times longer than any curling iron I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I will pay more to have the luxury of a warranty or exchange.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is the best!</li>
            <li>It arrived in one day without special shipping!</li>
            <li>(of course i have shortish, fine hair) to straighten</li>
            <li>The light started blinking on and off about a week ago.  </li>
            <li>I only have good things to say about this product :)</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this flat iron on my hair and I always wondered if it was more than hair products that create a good look at a salon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Had a Paul Mitchell flat iron for 2 years and loved it, but it stopped working and it 2 years ago was 120.00.</li>
            <li>I loved this flat iron, it kept my hair shiney and pretty and didn&#x27;t fry my hair, but after 3 months it crapped out.</li>
            <li>It came within a few days of ordering and has been working great.</li>
            <li>It straightens and makes her hair very silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and if 3 years later it delivered such result!I knew it was a good iron as i  was gonna spend more on a chi iron</li>
            <li>its cut my getting ready time down to 20 minutes which is great</li>
            <li>my hair was so soft i couldn&#x27;t stop touching it and shine so much everyone commented on it.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it used to nor</li>
            <li>so I bought another one exactly like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my mom&#x27;s Chi and felt it worked pretty comparable to this HAI.</li>
            <li>My first Hai lasted about a year</li>
            <li>I used it about 4 times a week and never had the heat turned up too hot.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by anyone, I just found it on sale a few years ago and it had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in the mail very quickly, it heats up fast, gets my hair straight and soft!</li>
            <li>I love this Flat Iron-</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron...</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and really hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly and it will straighten with not even blow drying it straight first.</li>
            <li>It finally died today, but I love it so much that I am contemplating buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast</li>
            <li>The light would blink on and off and after messing with the cord for about 10 minutes it would finally turn on.</li>
            <li>Every time I used it it would take longer and longer for the light to stay on, I finally gave up on it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>When I bought this one years ago it was MUCH cheaper than the Chi, but now there&#x27;s not too much price difference.  </li>
            <li>(this is probably due to my not taking good care of it, I&#x27;m pretty rough on things like this).  </li>
            <li>The cord is super long so you dont have to sit right near the outlet.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really straight, soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>My hair was improved after a few times of use :)</li>
            <li>It still works fine, but seems to take longer to heat up and the blue coating is starting to come off at the ends</li>
            <li>This straightener is cool because you can also curl your hair by turning it while pulling straight down.</li>
            <li>This was my first flat iron.  </li>
            <li>did it leave my hair as soft as the HAI.</li>
            <li>It still worked but would turn off unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li>the hai leaves my hair so soft, it stays straight much longer, and takes less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>My new one lasted about 3 months and had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>, the red light started blinking on and off, had to mess with the cord to keep it on, and then finally just quit.</li>

            <li> The price was about half what I paid for my first one.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is really worth the $65 that I spent.</li>
            <li> A few days ago I donated about a foot of hair and got a new sassy short haircut.</li>
            <li> This flat iron a friend told me about.</li>
            <li> then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> To avoid damaging the power cord, do not wrap the cord around your flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron a while ago</li>
            <li> I wait till my hair is dry</li>
            <li> Instead, store the cord loosely coiled.    </li>
            <li> Customers who have problems with the power cord for the HAI Convertable Ceramic Flat Iron or for any flat iron often have one thing in common: They tightly wrap the power cord around their flat iron prior to placing them away.</li>
            <li> We purchased 4 at Christmas and the other 3 are still working...</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on it and follow the advice of other reviewers who said that you shouldn&#x27;t wrap the cord tightly around the straightner, as that damages the connection and causes it to stop working.  </li>
            <li> This is the flat iron my hair stylist recommended, it was a gift to my granddaughter who has very thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Its really bailed me out of a bad hair cut too.</li>
            <li> I have 3 small kids.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not too expensive for the quality you get.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was a bit weary about buying something like this online. i didnt want to spend a lot of money but i wanted a really good straightener and this seemed too good to be true. I had read some of the reviews and I thought it might break but i went ahead anyway and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive had it for about 2 months or so and Ive had no problems at all. It arrived in the mail very quickly, it heats up fast, gets my hair straight and soft! The cord is super long so you dont have to sit right near the outlet. I only have good things to say about this product :)</li>
            <li> I love this Flat Iron- I went to visit my BFF in Vegas and fell in Love with hers... Came home and placed my order!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect flat iron. It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t catch your hair and gives you a flawless straighten. For this price you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and the result is spectacular! My hair was improved after a few times of use :)</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron...its cut my getting ready time down to 20 minutes which is great cause I have 3 small kids. Its really bailed me out of a bad hair cut too. It makes my hair really straight, soft and shiny!  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> A few days ago I donated about a foot of hair and got a new sassy short haircut. I feel in love with my hairdresser&#x27;s HAI flatiron. I have a CHI and it wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it used to nor did it leave my hair as soft as the HAI. I ordered this on Sunday night and got it on Tuesday! I love the flatiron and was really impressed by the speedy delivery. I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Had a Paul Mitchell flat iron for 2 years and loved it, but it stopped working and it 2 years ago was 120.00. This flat iron a friend told me about. I love it. It heats up fast and really hot. My hair is really curly and it will straighten with not even blow drying it straight first. I wait till my hair is dry then flat iron it. Great price. Ordered it on a Saturday had it by Tuesday. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I have had it for about a year and a half.  The light started blinking on and off about a week ago.  I kept having to jiggle the cord.  It finally died today, but I love it so much that I am contemplating buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this straightener after my Chi broke. It came within a few days of ordering and has been working great. Heats up fast and I love that you can change the temperature. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This straightener is cool because you can also curl your hair by turning it while pulling straight down. Good quality!</li>
            <li> I owned this straightener and dropped it about 100 times.   It still worked but would turn off unexpectedly.  I really loved it so I bought another one exactly like it.  The price was about half what I paid for my first one. It arrived in one day without special shipping!</li>
            <li> I loved this flat iron, it kept my hair shiney and pretty and didn&#x27;t fry my hair, but after 3 months it crapped out. The light would blink on and off and after messing with the cord for about 10 minutes it would finally turn on. Every time I used it it would take longer and longer for the light to stay on, I finally gave up on it and I&#x27;m buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> Needed this item asap and seller was awesome.  Great product, great seller, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00134PI9U Hai Classic Convertable 1265 1 1/4\\&quot; Blue Ceramic Flat Iron 1.25\\&quot;]]  This is the flat iron my hair stylist recommended, it was a gift to my granddaughter who has very thick, long hair.  She loves it.  It straightens and makes her hair very silky and smooth.  Great price.  I shopped around locally and it was $99.99 in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find this item here for such a great price! Thanks.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this flat iron on my hair and I always wondered if it was more than hair products that create a good look at a salon.  Now I know.  This flat iron is the best!</li>
            <li> This was my first flat iron.  It was recommended by anyone, I just found it on sale a few years ago and it had good reviews.  I&#x27;ve had it for over 3 years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it until now.  It still works fine, but seems to take longer to heat up and the blue coating is starting to come off at the ends (this is probably due to my not taking good care of it, I&#x27;m pretty rough on things like this).  Now that I&#x27;m shopping around I&#x27;m debating between buying this same one or a CHI. When I bought this one years ago it was MUCH cheaper than the Chi, but now there&#x27;s not too much price difference.  I&#x27;ve used my mom&#x27;s Chi and felt it worked pretty comparable to this HAI. I like how the HAI has a setting dial, and it also seems to feel more substantial than the Chi.  All in all, I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair health is definitely improving since using this straightener.  I don&#x27;t know how, but I can see the difference from the last one I used.  I highly recommend this.  Also, it is not too expensive for the quality you get.</li>
            <li> My friend did my hair with her iron and it felt like i just came from the hair dresser my hair was so soft i couldn&#x27;t stop touching it and shine so much everyone commented on it.When my friend told me she paid almost 200 hundred on them 3 years ago at this price i could not let it go and if 3 years later it delivered such result!I knew it was a good iron as i  was gonna spend more on a chi iron and i read lots of mix revues on chi and even after shipping it was still cheaper here than everywhere else.Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Customers who have problems with the power cord for the HAI Convertable Ceramic Flat Iron or for any flat iron often have one thing in common: They tightly wrap the power cord around their flat iron prior to placing them away. This improper method of storage will severely damage a power cord for any product. To avoid damaging the power cord, do not wrap the cord around your flat iron. Instead, store the cord loosely coiled.    Once this change in habbit was made, I never saw another problem with a power cord again.</li>
            <li> i love this straightener! i got the chi before the hai, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. the hai leaves my hair so soft, it stays straight much longer, and takes less than 10 minutes (of course i have shortish, fine hair) to straighten</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a bit of hesitation after hearing people complain about the straightner giving up on them shortly after their purchase.  I decided to take a chance on it and follow the advice of other reviewers who said that you shouldn&#x27;t wrap the cord tightly around the straightner, as that damages the connection and causes it to stop working.  I&#x27;ve had this straightner for 2 1/2 years now, traveled with it multiple times (never wrapping the cord around the straightner though!) and it&#x27;s still working great!  I have fine hair, but I have lots of it! I probably damaged my hair at first thinking having it on a higher setting was better, but I&#x27;ve been able to dial in the heat setting that works best for my hair, and I love that I can change it. I&#x27;m not stuck with whatever the manufacturers think the heat needs to be at!  I also love that it makes wonderful curls that last a million times longer than any curling iron I&#x27;ve used! If this iron ever dies on me, I would come back and get another in a heart beat!</li>
            <li> My first Hai lasted about a year, the red light started blinking on and off, had to mess with the cord to keep it on, and then finally just quit. My new one lasted about 3 months and had the same problem.  We purchased 4 at Christmas and the other 3 are still working...but one seems to be on the blink (pun intended).  I&#x27;m giving up on the internet for this product. I will pay more to have the luxury of a warranty or exchange.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron a while ago and I had it for about 6 months and then one day it just wouldn’t turn on. I used it about 4 times a week and never had the heat turned up too hot. Not sure if it is really worth the $65 that I spent.</li>
