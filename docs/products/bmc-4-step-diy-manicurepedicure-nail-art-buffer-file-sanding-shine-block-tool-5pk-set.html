            <li>recommend for every one  .n awesome</li>
            <li>Very happy with product</li>
            <li>These are no exception -- VERY happy; can have some at home, some at office and one in my car for nail emergencies.</li>
            <li>A great value</li>
            <li>Great buffing blocks for the price.</li>
            <li>I become more impressed with BMC products every time I order one.</li>
            <li>The BMC 4 step manicure/Pedicure nail buffers are working out good.  </li>
            <li>Defintiely not as good quality as the ones in mall kiosks try to demo and sell - the the Buffer Block  </li>
            <li>nails have never looked so good</li>
            <li>Not that great but ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the value!</li>
            <li>This buffer file works great to put a shine on your nails and to smooth out the ridges before applying polish.</li>
            <li>they are so amazing</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered these, but they work as good as any I have bought in the store before.  </li>
            <li>I own a ton of them.  </li>
            <li>Perfect either to leave your nails unpolished or as a super smooth foundation for polish.</li>
            <li>I love four-sided nail files and buffers.  </li>
            <li>also like that there were so many, one for work, one for home,</li>
            <li>you nails will love it</li>
            <li>but these were of better quality.</li>
            <li>These work great and put a lovely shine on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>When the chance came to own an entire bag for a great price, I jumped on it.  </li>
            <li>You get 5 blocks per package, which should last many many months - so a great deal.</li>
            <li>Sides 3 and 4 are fine, but if you&#x27;re looking to shape/buff, this isn&#x27;t the nail file for you.  </li>
            <li>The grit on Side 1 is so fine that it will take you twice the time to even your nails or buff out ridges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool.</li>
            <li>these buffers are a girls to dream come true .</li>
            <li>Not bad, but it wears it wears out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Liked another type better because of slightly rougher service..</li>
            <li>I have a whole bag full, I will donate.</li>
            <li>So far, have lasted a good long while, too.</li>
            <li>But they are easy to use, each block seems to last quite a while, and really do make nails super shiny.</li>
            <li>They make my nails look like they&#x27;re made of really shiny plastic.</li>
            <li>These 4-sided soft blocks are fantastic to achieve uber shiny nails, whether they are acrylic or natural.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s a PLAN, and the four surfaces are clearly labeled besides (and really work well.)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last as long as the cheaper ones, but are worth the slightly extra expense as they last 3x or more longer than the cheaper versions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t mind a little less shine, it&#x27;s a good buy for the value.</li>
            <li>Nothing special Average</li>
            <li>Not like the &#x27;professional&#x27; quality ones used in salons.</li>
            <li>Side 2 isn&#x27;t that distinctive from Side 3 (and side 1 isn&#x27;t that far from side 3 either).</li>
            <li>I use on my natural fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Not what I expected, not rough enough service, too smooth for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>Since I have kind-of papery-nails, not really as hard or thick as I would like them to be, I often only need to use sides 3 and 4 or even just 4 to get the shine I want without thinning my nails too much.</li>

            <li> it did not buff nails at all.. because buffing is too weak</li>

            <li> Nothing special Average</li>
            <li> These 4-sided soft blocks are fantastic to achieve uber shiny nails, whether they are acrylic or natural. Start, of course, with the roughest side and work your way around. Perfect either to leave your nails unpolished or as a super smooth foundation for polish. My only complaint is the smell right out of the container - it&#x27;s awful. But they are easy to use, each block seems to last quite a while, and really do make nails super shiny. You get 5 blocks per package, which should last many many months - so a great deal.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered these, but they work as good as any I have bought in the store before.  I am really pleased with the value!</li>

            <li> All the sides appear to be the same. Not like the &#x27;professional&#x27; quality ones used in salons. Not worth the $!</li>
            <li> The BMC 4 step manicure/Pedicure nail buffers are working out good.  I like the fact that you get 5 in a pack.</li>
            <li> I love four-sided nail files and buffers.  I own a ton of them.  When the chance came to own an entire bag for a great price, I jumped on it.  Sadly, there is a slight problem with the grit on sides 1 &amp; 2.  Sides 3 and 4 are fine, but if you&#x27;re looking to shape/buff, this isn&#x27;t the nail file for you.  The grit on Side 1 is so fine that it will take you twice the time to even your nails or buff out ridges.

            <li> They work well and they are affordable.  I do recommend then to others as I would buy them again .</li>
            <li> it did not buff nails at all.. because buffing is too weak&lt;br /&gt;but the price is really good !!! !</li>

            <li> these buffers are a girls to dream come true . luv this product . recommend for every one  .n awesome</li>
            <li> I like these buffing/shining blocks, but I find that they don&#x27;t get my nails as shiny as the ones in nail salons. I am not sure what the difference is. Having said that, the price is really low, so if you don&#x27;t mind a little less shine, it&#x27;s a good buy for the value.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> I become more impressed with BMC products every time I order one. These are no exception -- VERY happy; can have some at home, some at office and one in my car for nail emergencies. Now that&#x27;s a PLAN, and the four surfaces are clearly labeled besides (and really work well.) So far, have lasted a good long while, too.</li>
            <li> Not that great but ok for the price. I used to have one like this (not this brand obviously) I bought at one of the little mall kiosks and it held up for YEARS. After a couple of months with these I&#x27;d gone through one of the five, only using it maybe a handful of times. I&#x27;ll probably try something else once the rest of these give</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it wears it wears out rather quickly.  Defintiely not as good quality as the ones in mall kiosks try to demo and sell - the the Buffer Block  that they sell with the Israeli dead sea products sold in the mall kiosks.  I guess it s nt bad for the price, will run out quickly</li>
            <li> These work great and put a lovely shine on my natural nails.  Since I have kind-of papery-nails, not really as hard or thick as I would like them to be, I often only need to use sides 3 and 4 or even just 4 to get the shine I want without thinning my nails too much.</li>
            <li> This buffer file works great to put a shine on your nails and to smooth out the ridges before applying polish. I use on my natural fingernails.  These blocks are a bit larger than other brands which I have used, so they will last longer.  I prefer the four step buffer block over a two step type, and this one fits the bill.  A great value; I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> These were bigger than I thought they would be.  I am not complaining, size makes them easier to work with and yields faster results.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that there were so many, one for work, one for home, gave one to my room-mate, and a couple left over.&lt;br /&gt;My nails have never looked so good</li>
            <li> I have a Spa Saloon and I recommend it they are so amazing you nails will love it</li>
            <li> Great buffing blocks for the price. I&#x27;ve ordered other buffing blocks online but these were of better quality. They don&#x27;t last as long as the cheaper ones, but are worth the slightly extra expense as they last 3x or more longer than the cheaper versions.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this item and the seller.</li>
