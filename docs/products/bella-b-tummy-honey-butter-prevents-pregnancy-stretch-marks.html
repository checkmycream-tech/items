            <li>When I purchased this I was looking for a cream, this is more of a wax.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to all moms to be! :)</li>
            <li>lighweight, nongreasy, and light fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I feel stretch marks are more genetic.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream, it is more of a ointment...</li>
            <li>my gene pool was surely going to have stretch marks.</li>
            <li>:) I love the consistancy of the product.</li>
            <li>Overall it does the job so that great!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell it is so comforting.</li>
            <li>its ok coz</li>
            <li>I Love this cr&amp;egrave;me</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it again ...</li>
            <li>It really works great ...</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I have only been using this belly butter for one month now, but it feels great and smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastics, is easy to wash off your hands, and will make you a hero in your wife&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also it smells good and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for more itchy time as my tummy grows more bigger.</li>
            <li>What more could a pregnant woman ask for in a lotion.  </li>
            <li>but still it&#x27;s important to do sth to prevent it.</li>
            <li>It helps with itching and keeps skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet honey smell which is not too strong</li>
            <li>Tried and true</li>
            <li>I do use a lot, so I go through the tub quickly, but I feel like it is effective so far and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>The point is, your wife will be happy and might actually enjoy the experience of the taming the pregnancy hormones for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now 17 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and my weight before I was pregnant</li>
            <li>I am 29 weeks pregnant and am just now about to run out.</li>
            <li>When your pregnant wife asks you to order her &amp;#34;Honey Butter&amp;#34;, so that you can rub it on her belly so she doesn&#x27;t get stretch marks ....</li>
            <li>I cannot recommend this product more highly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, it did exactly what it states!</li>
            <li>Be aware of this before purchasing!</li>
            <li>I used this during my first pregnancy, and it worked!</li>
            <li>So far this product has been great, and it has a slight honey smell :)</li>
            <li>I guess if it works then its all worth it right?</li>
            <li>My heightened sense of smell finds this product just right.</li>
            <li>It does have a very light plesant scent but its a little more oily than I like.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, but I am just starting to show.</li>
            <li>but I can easily say that I&#x27;ve never used another product that makes my skin so soft and moist.</li>
            <li>i completely think this product works and strongly recommend it</li>
            <li>and I used it with the first</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that makes it feel better.</li>
            <li>I used this with my first pregnancy Which i gained 50lbs.</li>
            <li>I gained 35 pounds with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I used this with my first pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Since its my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>and this is my first try for anti stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I used it with my first child 7 years ago</li>
            <li>I am 24 weeks pregnant and gained 22 lbs, so far I don&#x27;t see any stretch marks and it reduces itchiness of my skin.</li>
            <li>when i used this cream i feel my skin tight.i believe the whole stretch mark thing is genetic</li>
            <li>It is very oily and a bit sticky</li>
            <li>A must read for anyone who wants to succeed.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really feel it prevents stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>and it does not rub into your skin very well</li>
            <li>Hoping that it will really works.</li>
            <li>I even have stretch marks from puberty and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I really like this tummy butter and use it faithfully every night.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes the skin and really help prevent stretch marks...</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, it is a little greasy but doesn&#x27;t transfer onto clothes and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and and a small amount makes wonders.</li>
            <li>I am now pregnant with my second child about 6 weeks in</li>
            <li>i used it every day from 3m pregnant on my belly lower back and hips and didnt get one strech mark.  </li>
            <li>I am now 6 weeks pregnant with my second child</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i used it during my first pregnancy and now in the second, highly recommended</li>
            <li>I feel extremely moisturized with this butter -- it is quite waxy and does not absorb quickly at all, but I kind of like that -- I use it after my showers and since the weather outside is super cold and dry, I feel like I need this moisture barrier to help prevent stretch marks or dry itchy skin -- which I thankfully haven&#x27;t experienced at all so far!</li>
            <li>This was more than likely due to my pregnancy and not the product itself.</li>
            <li>This book will help change your mindset, and will help you understand the true meaning if both success and failure.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get a gritty batch in the end when the grit may have actually hurt against my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have not gotten any stretch marks so far (at 24 weeks), and hopefully this will continue to work til the end of the pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is still early during my pregnancy</li>
            <li>so I would rub it on at night and wear an old t-shirt that I didn&#x27;t mind getting greasy and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>So far</li>
            <li>but I wish they would make these products with little to no scent for us pregnant women who are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend who is very petite used this product and did not get one stretch mark after carrying a long and big 8 lb baby!</li>
            <li>After my son was born I had not a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li>I was pregnant and have only noticied a few stretch marks on my hips.  </li>
            <li>After two pregnancies NO STRETCHMARKS - except for a tiny .5 inch on my hip bone - barely noticable.</li>
            <li>so I recommend it applied before bed after the shower and wear a loose old t-shirt</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but it does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I got stretch marks, mostly in this last month when my belly has grown like crazy.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that I go thru it quite fast.</li>
            <li> The main negative comment I have is that it is so oily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that some orders where gritty.</li>
            <li> I ran out last week for a few days and was in a ton of pain from the burning and itching.</li>
            <li> All three pregnanancies and minimal stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I also used shea butter and palmers and other oils.</li>
            <li> Creating small project to achieve big dreams is what I got from this book.  </li>
            <li> I did not smell anything with the odor like other reviews say.</li>
            <li> Price is average compared to the other ones I&#x27;ve seen online.</li>
            <li> This is very waxy and difficult to get out if the container</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be it is greasy</li>
            <li> less itching too...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a first time father, this whole process of rubbing creme on my wife&#x27;s belly to prevent stretch marks was terrifying.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I am 27 weeks now and have been using this products for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Used this everyday.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, gather round and listen to my words of wisdom.</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase of this product and unfortunately i tried other brands between my purchases.</li>
            <li> It prevented stretch marks, or at least it assisted in making my skin stretchy and less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I am not sure what causes this or why</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how the end result will be</li>
            <li> I put a small (really small) amount during mornings and it stays till the evening.</li>
            <li> and I have a small frame.  </li>
            <li> I am about to deliver any day and have gone through at least 8 of these throughout my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try to at least minimize the marks.</li>
            <li> I believe without it my skin would be a lot worse</li>
            <li> I owe it to Joli Mere.</li>
            <li> But what DID work for me was a vitamin called Joli Mere!</li>
            <li> and my mother had terrible strech marks</li>

            <li> I have only been using this belly butter for one month now, but it feels great and smells really nice.  I have not gotten any stretch marks so far (at 24 weeks), and hopefully this will continue to work til the end of the pregnancy.  I found the cheapest price on this product at Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is my second purchase of this product and unfortunately i tried other brands between my purchases. i will see the results after labor but for now it worked for me. when i used this cream i feel my skin tight.i believe the whole stretch mark thing is genetic but still it&#x27;s important to do sth to prevent it. by the way i think using with an oil (like mother&#x27;s blend)will result better because it&#x27;s somehow difficult to apply</li>
            <li> I am 24 weeks pregnant and gained 22 lbs, so far I don&#x27;t see any stretch marks and it reduces itchiness of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second pregnancy and I used it with the first and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. Is stops the itching and it doesnt leave any oil marks on my shirt. I will keep using this as honey butter until the end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I used this product starting from 3 months along until I delivered my baby. I never got one stretch mark. In the beginning I absolutely loved the scent, but around month 6 I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. I had to cover my nose and mouth while my husband applied it on me because it made me nauseous. This was more than likely due to my pregnancy and not the product itself. Anyone else experience this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it did exactly what it states! It prevented stretch marks, or at least it assisted in making my skin stretchy and less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use next time we&#x27;re expecting!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I was looking for a cream, this is more of a wax.  It does have a very light plesant scent but its a little more oily than I like.  I do believe it will protect you from stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am about to deliver any day and have gone through at least 8 of these throughout my pregnancy. I have to say that if you are prone to stretch marks you&#x27;re going to get them no matter what product you use. I got stretch marks, mostly in this last month when my belly has grown like crazy. I&#x27;m slim build and all tummy - my skin just could not handle the stretching. This product was great bc I believe without it my skin would be a lot worse AND it totally soothes the skin. I ran out last week for a few days and was in a ton of pain from the burning and itching. This product is the only thing that makes it feel better. I highly recommend it. I also used shea butter and palmers and other oils. This was the only thing I would continue to go back to. My only complaint is that some orders where gritty. I am not sure what causes this or why but I just kept using it, I would have preferred to never have received a gritty batch but it all works the same and I didn&#x27;t get a gritty batch in the end when the grit may have actually hurt against my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The picture shows &#x27;Stretch Mark Prevention&#x27;, but the items received are &#x27;Stretch Mark Fading&#x27;, not as shown on the picture, the package is also different, so upset...</li>
            <li> I started using this at 12 weeks. I am now 17 weeks pregnant. So far so good, but I am just starting to show. We&#x27;ll see..but as far as the scent goes, its perfect. My heightened sense of smell finds this product just right. Price is average compared to the other ones I&#x27;ve seen online. The only negative thing is that I go thru it quite fast. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Great product, smells good, not greasy.  Hope to avoid stretch marks so we shall see!  Good luck, you will have to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Well, it is still early during my pregnancy so I am not sure how the end result will be but I can easily say that I&#x27;ve never used another product that makes my skin so soft and moist. I put a small (really small) amount during mornings and it stays till the evening. Smells nice and and a small amount makes wonders. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product was given to me from a close friend of mine. I used this with my first pregnancy Which i gained 50lbs. Now I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and my weight before I was pregnant was about 115lbs. After my son was born I had not a single stretch mark! I am now pregnant with my second child about 6 weeks in and I&#x27;m defiantly going to purchase this product once again. It is very oily and a bit sticky so I recommend it applied before bed after the shower and wear a loose old t-shirt you don&#x27;t mind getting gunky. I recommend it to all moms to be! :)</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this and it had great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I was not expecting a waxy consistency (I thought it was a cream or &amp;#34;Butter&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s called. It&#x27;s not.). The main negative comment I have is that it is so oily. It never dries on your skin! I put this on before bed and I wake up in the morning and my skin is still oily and it gets all over my clothes &amp; bed sheets! I can&#x27;t put it on after the shower in the morning because then it will get all over my clothes. Be aware of this before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Our mindset determines failure or success. This book will help change your mindset, and will help you understand the true meaning if both success and failure. Creating small project to achieve big dreams is what I got from this book.  A must read for anyone who wants to succeed.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful &amp; a must have during your pregnancy. I have had 3 children &amp; used this product with each pregnancy. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks &amp; I&#x27;m using it again for baby #4. This products instantly removes the itchy feeling &amp; is soothing.</li>
            <li> i used this and loved it!  the smell was great.  i used it every day from 3m pregnant on my belly lower back and hips and didnt get one strech mark.  i also gained about 50 lbs and my mother had terrible strech marks so i figured i was doomed.  i completely think this product works and strongly recommend it</li>
            <li> lighweight, nongreasy, and light fragrance!  What more could a pregnant woman ask for in a lotion.  I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really feel it prevents stretch marks.  I feel stretch marks are more genetic.  However, I have been using this product since I found out I was pregnant and have only noticied a few stretch marks on my hips.  I wish it was a little cheaper but it does last a long time.  I am 29 weeks pregnant and am just now about to run out.</li>
            <li> My stomach feels like and moisturized when I use this. It creates a nice coat on my belly but it can get on clothes. I use this when I am just going to be around the house or when I have time to let it soak in. I don&#x27;t want to get oil stains on clothes.</li>
            <li> This is very waxy and difficult to get out if the container and it does not rub into your skin very well so your clothes will stick to your stomach. The smell wasn&#x27;t the greatest either!</li>
            <li> Love this cream, it is more of a ointment... i used it during my first pregnancy and now in the second, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I gained 35 pounds with my first pregnancy. All in my belly. No stretch marks. Used this everyday. Plus there were times where my skin literally burned from the stretching and this offered immediate help. I cannot praise this product enough. I loved it!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend who is very petite used this product and did not get one stretch mark after carrying a long and big 8 lb baby! My mother and sister both have multiple stretch marks from their pregnancies so I knew it was in my genes. I thought I would give it a try to at least minimize the marks. After two pregnancies NO STRETCHMARKS - except for a tiny .5 inch on my hip bone - barely noticable. I cannot recommend this product more highly. I gained 50 lbs and 40 lbs with my pregnancies and with my gene pool was surely going to have stretch marks. I wore a bikini this summer! Thank you Bella B!</li>
            <li> I recently found out I am expecting twins &amp; wanted to start moisturizing my body in preparation. So far this product has been great, and it has a slight honey smell :)</li>
            <li> I am 27 weeks now and have been using this products for a little over a month. I have no stretch marks on my belly or my breasts which is awesome :) I love the consistancy of the product. It is almost like a petrolium jelly. It has a sweet honey smell which is not too strong but I wish they would make these products with little to no scent for us pregnant women who are sensitive to smell. Overall it does the job so that great!</li>
            <li> I used this with my first pregnancy.  I used it every night for basically my entire pregnancy.  I gained 50 lbs and I have a small frame.  I didn&#x27;t get one single stretch mark.  My only complaint would be it is greasy so I would rub it on at night and wear an old t-shirt that I didn&#x27;t mind getting greasy and go to sleep.  I am now 6 weeks pregnant with my second child and I will be ordering this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so greasy. Its like slathering crisco shortening all over. Then my clothes just cling to me. I guess if it works then its all worth it right? I&#x27;ll have to see.</li>
            <li> Tried and true I love this stuff. All three pregnanancies and minimal stretch marks. I love the smell it is so comforting.</li>
            <li> Since its my first pregnancy and this is my first try for anti stretch marks. So far its ok coz im just on my second trimester. also it smells good and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for more itchy time as my tummy grows more bigger. Hoping that it will really works.</li>
            <li> This is a God Send. It helps with itching and keeps skin smooth. I thought I was doomed with my genetics and have used this 2-3X daily since 5 months. I even have stretch marks from puberty and this stuff really does the trick. Great ingredients, it is a little greasy but doesn&#x27;t transfer onto clothes and lasts a long time. I did not smell anything with the odor like other reviews say. The ONLY downfall is the tub is only 4oz ... I had to restock every 3 weeks so it can get pricey! They should know that pregnancy takes 9 months and increase the size!</li>
            <li> I used this during my first pregnancy, and it worked! So I&#x27;m using it again this time. So far so good! I really like this tummy butter and use it faithfully every night.</li>
            <li> I Love this cr&amp;egrave;me I used it with my first child 7 years ago and I&#x27;m glad I found it again ...It really works great ...it moisturizes the skin and really help prevent stretch marks...less itching too...</li>
            <li> I feel extremely moisturized with this butter -- it is quite waxy and does not absorb quickly at all, but I kind of like that -- I use it after my showers and since the weather outside is super cold and dry, I feel like I need this moisture barrier to help prevent stretch marks or dry itchy skin -- which I thankfully haven&#x27;t experienced at all so far! I do use a lot, so I go through the tub quickly, but I feel like it is effective so far and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on baby #2 with no stretch marks yet (4 weeks to go) and they do run in my family.  I buy this stuff in bulk.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, gather round and listen to my words of wisdom. When your pregnant wife asks you to order her &amp;#34;Honey Butter&amp;#34;, so that you can rub it on her belly so she doesn&#x27;t get stretch marks .... ORDER THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a first time father, this whole process of rubbing creme on my wife&#x27;s belly to prevent stretch marks was terrifying. THen I ordered Bella B Tummy Honey Butter. This stuff smells fantastics, is easy to wash off your hands, and will make you a hero in your wife&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it actually work? Who knows. That&#x27;s not the point. The point is, your wife will be happy and might actually enjoy the experience of the taming the pregnancy hormones for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and invest in this tub of butter.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. I just felt like it was a greasy substance sitting on my skin. But what DID work for me was a vitamin called Joli Mere! [...]. It&#x27;s a prenatal vitamin that also prevents stretch marks because it contains ingredients that nourish your skin! And let me tell you... I have a beautiful stomach with NOT ONE stretch mark! I owe it to Joli Mere. This prenatal vitamin is GOLD IN A BOTTLE!</li>
