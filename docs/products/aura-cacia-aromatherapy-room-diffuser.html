            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best ways to diffuse aroma into your room without also adding humidity through water,</li>
            <li>and it fills the room with my wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li>My best guess is that the pads are the cause.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a bedroom to diffuse oils.</li>
            <li>this is one of my best purchases!</li>
            <li>Awesome!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, and mESSENTIALS is a great place to shop.</li>
            <li>Room smells great for an hour or so</li>
            <li>Great alternative to oil burners and reed diffusers.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Love how it works with my oils to make my house smell great!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that could give a pleasant scent in my kitchen that was not toxic and</li>
            <li>Great for adding a nice scent to a room  </li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>customer service is good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very potent for like 3 hours.</li>
            <li>It works great and scent projection is strong.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>and it remains warm but not overheated.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it doesn&#x27;t need to sit on a surface and is up out of the way in an outlet when in use and that it isn&#x27;t a humidifier.</li>
            <li>(But your finger will smell nice.)  </li>
            <li>The diffuser comes with 5 cotton pads, which is nice.</li>
            <li>When I touch it it is barely warm</li>
            <li>This worked great for the first 20 minutes</li>
            <li>The car diffuser I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I like that this is an inexpensive diffuser that I can move from room to room where I need it most</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy more than one, because if you don&#x27;t you will have to place another order.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have been better</li>
            <li>For the price, its okay</li>
            <li>but i would spend a bit more for something better than this.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with more pads though</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to leave anything like this plugged in continuously.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work too well in Chicago homes where the electric outlet is top to bottom.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was cheap</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t smell it more than five feet from the bed.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t write an immediate review</li>
            <li>You would do better spending some money and getting a better one.  </li>
            <li>Worked a lot better than I was thinking it would.</li>
            <li>I like these much better than lamp diffusers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out how this works.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but it came with the longer pads which I like much better.</li>
            <li>Love it with lavender for sleeping or oils for overnight sinus relief in my room, use it with oils that help with sleeping and epilepsy in my son&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>No problem with the seller at all :)</li>
            <li>LOVE THE DIFFUSER AND</li>
            <li>I love this product and the auracacia blended oils as well.</li>
            <li>and it would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li>Use this in my office, love it.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product, and the idea is good, but-it really does not perform well.  </li>
            <li>Working great so far!</li>
            <li>Smells good and is definitely more cost effective than essential oils.</li>
            <li>This shipped fast, and was a good price so...</li>
            <li>Dries out very quickly.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, inexpensive</li>
            <li>i purchased it with the Breathe Easy essential oil and found it works great for stuffy noses.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like this diffuser and think that it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s a nice smell, and sometimes not so much.</li>
            <li>I had hoped for a continuous, light scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>(and I got free shipping for it on another site) and that I could use whichever oil(s)</li>
            <li>Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the filter that you put the oil on, wouldn&#x27;t stay securely in place</li>
            <li>this works great since I can use which ever essential oils I choose.</li>
            <li>Works better than the higher priced so-called room diffusers.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>i use it for my small bedroom and the amount of scent diffused is perfect.</li>
            <li>Extra strips came in handy!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a great place to keep that one anymore with a little kid and two cats added to the household, although it did work considerably better than this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this product has worked perfectly for me especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Really a good product to use for your essential oils.</li>
            <li>In this way it is not only aromatheraputic, but a good idea to maintain health.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the cool thing to do.</li>
            <li>Love the product, price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>good for smaller area</li>
            <li>Plug next to my side of the bed and use &amp;#34;sleeping potion&amp;#34; oil for a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s cool...</li>
            <li>It stays cool to the touch</li>
            <li>Love product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>works really well in my office, i&#x27;ll be buying more of these</li>
            <li>The first couple times I noticed the scent was strong for about an hour, then it faded quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries the oil out to quick.</li>
            <li>Works well and quickly spreads the aroma throughout the room and then some.  </li>
            <li>I went cheap &amp; got what I paid for - no problems with the seller - just a cheap product advise spending a little more for a better one.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>you can also adjust how strong it is by how many drops of essential oil you put on it.</li>
            <li>and this is simple and I can leave it and not worry about it catching fire.</li>
            <li>I have used it once and had no complaints other than I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered it that apparently it isn&#x27;t as good to heat the oils when using them for aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li>With the right oil, this diffuser could provide some stress relief at your desk.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t smell anything unless you are right at it.</li>
            <li>It was pretty self explanatory though and as I have said, so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy being able to use 100% pure essential oil with this diffuser</li>
            <li>The diffuser gets quite hot when plugged in so it may be too hot and that is why the smell dissipates so quickly.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t sit securely in the outlets I tried in my new home&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use several (10-15) drops of the oils, and am happy to say the scent is obvious as soon as I enter the room.  </li>
            <li>It requires more assistance than commercial air freshers, but it&#x27;s healthier and worth it.</li>
            <li>Normally this works very well, infusing the room strongly.</li>
            <li>I very much like this room diffuser.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this oil diffuser, but it didn&#x27;t live up the hype.</li>
            <li>I think it gets to hot...</li>
            <li>It works so well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li>It works ok but only in the area it&#x27;s plugged into.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and was looking for an inexpensive and unobtrusive way to diffuse them in my home.  </li>
            <li>This plug in is pretty simple, but I think it could have been designed a lot better than it was.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t love the construction of it for basic use -</li>
            <li>Is it too hot?</li>
            <li>The strength of the fragrance is determined by how many drops of essential oil are used on the cotton pads.</li>
            <li>The diffuser does not get overly hot</li>
            <li>More of a room air freshener than an essential oils diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I just started my love affair with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>in my kitchen/living room that I generally try to keep free of plastic, that doesn&#x27;t really go with the flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it for what I needed it for, which is a limited area (I use lavender and tangerine at night to help me sleep)</li>
            <li>This is the epitome of simple and works just fine that way.  </li>
            <li>You just place a few drops of your favorite essential oil and it will pleasantly provide aroma to a bedroom or smaller living room.</li>
            <li>Pier1... add oil in the little basin and light a tea light candle.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>and they all seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really diffuse the scent very well</li>
            <li>The pads don&#x27;t hold scent for more than a few hours but are good to reuse a few times.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just because the product can&#x27;t hold that much -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it provides much aroma.</li>
            <li>I have had nothing but success with both my units so far.</li>
            <li>so of course it doesn&#x27;t difuse much scent.</li>
            <li>I really like using this room diffuser.</li>
            <li>I can put several different oils and plug it in and smells great and last throughout the night!</li>
            <li>It works well to diffuse essential oil in a small room or bathroom and is a great alternative to chemical fragrances.</li>
            <li>waste of my good pure essential oils.</li>
            <li>Essential oils get used up quickly by this method, so I started using my Pier1 diffuser oil on the pad.</li>
            <li>I love essential oils though, and believe that this would be the ticket for using them in your personal space at work.</li>
            <li>I use what was recommended as high grade oil , but after about 45 minutes the smell is gone</li>
            <li>and I use high quality oil.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have high expectations for a diffuser.</li>
            <li>downside for me was exactly what other people had said: the scent wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li>But then if you&#x27;ve had it plugged in for awhile, it&#x27;s hard to avoid touching the pad surface which on my unit was really hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just placing a few drops on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>YOU JUST USE A FEW DROPS OF YOUR FAVORITE FRAGANCE AND</li>
            <li>Other then that it works fine.</li>
            <li>Using lemon essential oil right now.  </li>
            <li>Its been plugged in for about an hour now and you have to put your nose right next to it to smell it.</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;re being manufactured in a new way or I received a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch of pads.</li>
            <li>Cardboard cards for oil dry up quickly.</li>
            <li>I have it right next to my bed, too, so I&#x27;m really surprised</li>
            <li>However, I reused the first pad with a different fragrance and and had no scent overlap.</li>
            <li>They get really hot within minutes using high quality essential oils - a major fire hazard.</li>
            <li>even when I saturate the pad (25 drops) it doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li>if you want to avoid the bad chemicals from most commercially sold plug ins and prefer natural essential oils then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li>Dries out the essential oils way too fast.</li>
            <li>sometimes I forget to unplug it, but so far the product doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat.</li>
            <li>This worked very well for my essential oils .</li>
            <li>The fragrance depends completely on what oils the user likes.</li>
            <li>I was just surprised that the scent disappeared from the pad before 8 hours were over.</li>
            <li>Works very well with the essential oil.  </li>
            <li>Actually it emits through the whole house.</li>
            <li>cheap garbage don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anybody who wants to use oils.</li>
            <li>The pads dry out so very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2-3 months for my room, takes about 5-7 minutes for it to warm up the essential oil enough to diffuse</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of getting a different type of diffuser as this one doesn&#x27;t seem to spread the essential oils out much.</li>
            <li>I will say what is pictured is not what I got, it was not in a box just a clear plastic bag and had no directions, it is the same plug in unit just without the name stamped in the plastic.</li>
            <li>This time it barely works...?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still thinking I want more power behind it/</li>
            <li>i usually use just plain lavender oil and it makes my room smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Super small, plug in device.  </li>
            <li>If you have a very large master bedroom or open concept house, the aroma tends to be significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li>A open space such as a living room wont be too noticeable until you go near it.</li>
            <li>The scent only lasts for a few hours, so you have to continuously apply essential oil multiple times a day and the strips will wear out quickly if you do that.</li>
            <li>The last couple times I used it I barely noticed the scent at all.  </li>
            <li>I can also see purchasing the refill pad would be annoying, but I have been able to reuse the same paper pad using the same scent and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It barely throws a scent and if so only for a very short period.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and not effective!</li>
            <li>So the oil sometimes sticks to the little teeth on top and it is impossible to clean.</li>

            <li> LOVE THE DIFFUSER AND</li>
            <li> I love this product and the auracacia blended oils as well.</li>
            <li> and it would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li> Use this in my office, love it.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product, and the idea is good, but-it really does not perform well.  </li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> Smells good and is definitely more cost effective than essential oils.</li>
            <li> This shipped fast, and was a good price so...</li>
            <li> Dries out very quickly.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, inexpensive</li>
            <li> i purchased it with the Breathe Easy essential oil and found it works great for stuffy noses.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this diffuser and think that it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a nice smell, and sometimes not so much.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a continuous, light scent throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> (and I got free shipping for it on another site) and that I could use whichever oil(s)</li>
            <li> Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the filter that you put the oil on, wouldn&#x27;t stay securely in place</li>
            <li> this works great since I can use which ever essential oils I choose.</li>
            <li> Works better than the higher priced so-called room diffusers.</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> i use it for my small bedroom and the amount of scent diffused is perfect.</li>
            <li> Extra strips came in handy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a great place to keep that one anymore with a little kid and two cats added to the household, although it did work considerably better than this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this product has worked perfectly for me especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Really a good product to use for your essential oils.</li>
            <li> In this way it is not only aromatheraputic, but a good idea to maintain health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cool thing to do.</li>
            <li> Love the product, price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> good for smaller area</li>
            <li> Plug next to my side of the bed and use &amp;#34;sleeping potion&amp;#34; oil for a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s cool...</li>
            <li> It stays cool to the touch</li>
            <li> Love product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> works really well in my office, i&#x27;ll be buying more of these</li>
            <li> The first couple times I noticed the scent was strong for about an hour, then it faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries the oil out to quick.</li>
            <li> Works well and quickly spreads the aroma throughout the room and then some.  </li>
            <li> I went cheap &amp; got what I paid for - no problems with the seller - just a cheap product advise spending a little more for a better one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> you can also adjust how strong it is by how many drops of essential oil you put on it.</li>
            <li> and this is simple and I can leave it and not worry about it catching fire.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and had no complaints other than I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered it that apparently it isn&#x27;t as good to heat the oils when using them for aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li> With the right oil, this diffuser could provide some stress relief at your desk.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t smell anything unless you are right at it.</li>
            <li> It was pretty self explanatory though and as I have said, so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to use 100% pure essential oil with this diffuser</li>
            <li> The diffuser gets quite hot when plugged in so it may be too hot and that is why the smell dissipates so quickly.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t sit securely in the outlets I tried in my new home&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use several (10-15) drops of the oils, and am happy to say the scent is obvious as soon as I enter the room.  </li>
            <li> It requires more assistance than commercial air freshers, but it&#x27;s healthier and worth it.</li>
            <li> Normally this works very well, infusing the room strongly.</li>
            <li> I very much like this room diffuser.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this oil diffuser, but it didn&#x27;t live up the hype.</li>
            <li> I think it gets to hot...</li>
            <li> It works so well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> It works ok but only in the area it&#x27;s plugged into.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and was looking for an inexpensive and unobtrusive way to diffuse them in my home.  </li>
            <li> This plug in is pretty simple, but I think it could have been designed a lot better than it was.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t love the construction of it for basic use -</li>
            <li> Is it too hot?</li>
            <li> The strength of the fragrance is determined by how many drops of essential oil are used on the cotton pads.</li>
            <li> The diffuser does not get overly hot</li>
            <li> More of a room air freshener than an essential oils diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I just started my love affair with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> in my kitchen/living room that I generally try to keep free of plastic, that doesn&#x27;t really go with the flow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it for what I needed it for, which is a limited area (I use lavender and tangerine at night to help me sleep)</li>
            <li> This is the epitome of simple and works just fine that way.  </li>
            <li> You just place a few drops of your favorite essential oil and it will pleasantly provide aroma to a bedroom or smaller living room.</li>
            <li> Pier1... add oil in the little basin and light a tea light candle.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> and they all seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really diffuse the scent very well</li>
            <li> The pads don&#x27;t hold scent for more than a few hours but are good to reuse a few times.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just because the product can&#x27;t hold that much -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it provides much aroma.</li>
            <li> I have had nothing but success with both my units so far.</li>
            <li> so of course it doesn&#x27;t difuse much scent.</li>
            <li> I really like using this room diffuser.</li>
            <li> I can put several different oils and plug it in and smells great and last throughout the night!</li>
            <li> It works well to diffuse essential oil in a small room or bathroom and is a great alternative to chemical fragrances.</li>
            <li> waste of my good pure essential oils.</li>
            <li> Essential oils get used up quickly by this method, so I started using my Pier1 diffuser oil on the pad.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils though, and believe that this would be the ticket for using them in your personal space at work.</li>
            <li> I use what was recommended as high grade oil , but after about 45 minutes the smell is gone</li>
            <li> and I use high quality oil.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have high expectations for a diffuser.</li>
            <li> downside for me was exactly what other people had said: the scent wears off too quickly.  </li>
            <li> But then if you&#x27;ve had it plugged in for awhile, it&#x27;s hard to avoid touching the pad surface which on my unit was really hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off just placing a few drops on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> YOU JUST USE A FEW DROPS OF YOUR FAVORITE FRAGANCE AND</li>
            <li> Other then that it works fine.</li>
            <li> Using lemon essential oil right now.  </li>
            <li> Its been plugged in for about an hour now and you have to put your nose right next to it to smell it.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;re being manufactured in a new way or I received a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch of pads.</li>
            <li> Cardboard cards for oil dry up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have it right next to my bed, too, so I&#x27;m really surprised</li>
            <li> However, I reused the first pad with a different fragrance and and had no scent overlap.</li>
            <li> They get really hot within minutes using high quality essential oils - a major fire hazard.</li>
            <li> even when I saturate the pad (25 drops) it doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and a half.  </li>
            <li> if you want to avoid the bad chemicals from most commercially sold plug ins and prefer natural essential oils then this is a good solution.</li>
            <li> Dries out the essential oils way too fast.</li>
            <li> sometimes I forget to unplug it, but so far the product doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for my essential oils .</li>
            <li> The fragrance depends completely on what oils the user likes.</li>
            <li> I was just surprised that the scent disappeared from the pad before 8 hours were over.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the essential oil.  </li>
            <li> Actually it emits through the whole house.</li>
            <li> cheap garbage don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anybody who wants to use oils.</li>
            <li> The pads dry out so very fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2-3 months for my room, takes about 5-7 minutes for it to warm up the essential oil enough to diffuse</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of getting a different type of diffuser as this one doesn&#x27;t seem to spread the essential oils out much.</li>
            <li> I will say what is pictured is not what I got, it was not in a box just a clear plastic bag and had no directions, it is the same plug in unit just without the name stamped in the plastic.</li>
            <li> This time it barely works...?</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still thinking I want more power behind it/</li>
            <li> i usually use just plain lavender oil and it makes my room smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Super small, plug in device.  </li>
            <li> If you have a very large master bedroom or open concept house, the aroma tends to be significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> A open space such as a living room wont be too noticeable until you go near it.</li>
            <li> The scent only lasts for a few hours, so you have to continuously apply essential oil multiple times a day and the strips will wear out quickly if you do that.</li>
            <li> The last couple times I used it I barely noticed the scent at all.  </li>
            <li> I can also see purchasing the refill pad would be annoying, but I have been able to reuse the same paper pad using the same scent and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It barely throws a scent and if so only for a very short period.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and not effective!</li>
            <li> So the oil sometimes sticks to the little teeth on top and it is impossible to clean.</li>
            <li> Maybe if they came up with one that could hold a reservoir of oil (like one of the nasty chemical plug-ins) it would be able to last a more considerable amount of time, but there&#x27;s no way a few drops on a little pad isn&#x27;t going to fade away in pretty short order.  </li>
            <li> However, if one wanted to use a larger amount to fragrance a larger room or a room with a high vault, this little difuser has the power to do it.</li>
            <li> It comes with 5 pads, and replacements can be purchased separately; however, the same pad can be reused multiple times as long as the same oil is used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance (using essential oils)  doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would, but I don&#x27;t consider that a flaw in the product itself.</li>
            <li> That is really a case of lazy use, so I don&#x27;t think it would impact others&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Lasts about as long and actually sends the fragrance throughout the room.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is that when I switch to a differett pad to use a new oil, I can still smell the undertones of the last oil I used in the diffuser mixed with the new scent.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser very much but don&#x27;t like the very small pads that was sent with it.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I read the other reviews that said that it could only scent a small space and as I planned to use it for a very small bathroom thought it would be ok.</li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m not breathing in any artificial fragrance (which is an known allergen and most products</li>
            <li> I purchased quite a few of these, but the oils burn off so fast, it&#x27;s not really worth the electricity.  </li>
            <li> I expected the scents to last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried fragrance oils and essential oils, and not much change in a 10x20 bedroom</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t freshen the air very long</li>
            <li> Another huge benefit is that antiseptic and antiviral essential oil blends, like Theive&#x27;s Oil, can be diffused into the air during cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> if I just put a few drops of essential oil on one of the pads and left it sitting out.</li>
            <li> Within half an hour the entire downstairs was overly fragranced, which was my fault.</li>
            <li> However it only lasts a few hours as the inserts dry out.</li>
            <li> This is the second diffuser I&#x27;ve tried (the other was a small ceramic dish from Aveda that held a pool of oils and needed to stay plugged in by a very short cord to heat the oil.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected as I have used these before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but the diffuser works well and as advertised.</li>
            <li> some* fragrance doled out, but it&#x27;s really not made to do that.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I tried lavendar, about 7 drops.</li>
            <li> A few drops of essential oils are needed on the pad, and then the diffuser is plugged in an outlet.</li>
            <li> I wasted alot of product until I purchased a proper diffuser (ZAQ DEW diffuser).</li>
            <li> Have other products from this company</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t say that about other plug ins or candles.</li>
            <li> Not sure I wouldn&#x27;t get the same result</li>
            <li> But that may be due to the quality of my oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and one worked, the other one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Will purchase additional down the road for other rooms.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not a powerful machine at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> in the long run maybe I&#x27;ll use it in a bathroom or small place.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of oil and at least daily for me to smell anything.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works, but it will be expensive if you have to replace the strips constantly and to me, that&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint - which may be just my way of using the item - is that I am often dropping oil in late at night after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t worry about leaving it in the wall; it warms slightly.</li>
            <li> This basically does not work for even my small bathroom, and I usually add 10 drops of essential oils.</li>
            <li> No chance of a mess.</li>
            <li> It just heats up a little foam pad that diffuses the oil into the air.  </li>
            <li> I wish it lasted a little longer but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The oils will hold their smell for a few hours then vanish.</li>
            <li> it has some sort of mechanism to turn it off after few hours since</li>
            <li> and then I think the pad dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, oil smells were no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I know that a dinky little diffuser like this won&#x27;t make that happen (even in a dinky little condo like mine), but I thought it could at least be a reliable way to have *</li>
            <li> usually does&#x27;t specify what makes up those fragrance).</li>
            <li> but I have a small room</li>
            <li> Not sure if the problem is with the diffuser or the pads.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since it arrived in the mail!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little bit disappointing!</li>
            <li> I got two of these one for upstairs one for down, I hate using the chemical sprays or plug ins</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> The aroma also disappears within minutes wasting 10 drops of expensive oils.</li>
            <li> For all the people that have posted bad reviews on this product, I&#x27;m confused.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have returned this item, I am so disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Dries out very quickly.I think it gets to hot...</li>
            <li> Dries out the essential oils way too fast. I ordered two to put in the front room and the hallway to the bedrooms. The oils will hold their smell for a few hours then vanish. I even left the house and came back in to test it out, and the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> I very much like this room diffuser. Seems to work very well. Have other products from this company and they all seem to work very well. The car diffuser I absolutely love. I like that this is an inexpensive diffuser that I can move from room to room where I need it most and it didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. It also doesn&#x27;t take up valuable counter space but just plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> I use several (10-15) drops of the oils, and am happy to say the scent is obvious as soon as I enter the room.  I cannot attest to how it would perform if I used only 2 or 3 drops.  I purchased one for a friend and she likes hers, as well.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like this diffuser and think that it was worth the money. The only real complaint I have is that when I switch to a differett pad to use a new oil, I can still smell the undertones of the last oil I used in the diffuser mixed with the new scent. Sometimes it&#x27;s a nice smell, and sometimes not so much. Overall though, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Great for adding a nice scent to a room  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my office</li>
            <li> Really a good product to use for your essential oils. I suggest you buy more than one, because if you don&#x27;t you will have to place another order.  I really like this product.  Works better than the higher priced so-called room diffusers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I expected the scents to last longer. It may be just me.</li>
            <li> So far this product has worked perfectly for me especially for the price. I really enjoy being able to use 100% pure essential oil with this diffuser knowing I&#x27;m not breathing in any artificial fragrance (which is an known allergen and most products usually does&#x27;t specify what makes up those fragrance). I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 2-3 months for my room, takes about 5-7 minutes for it to warm up the essential oil enough to diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would have been better it has some sort of mechanism to turn it off after few hours since sometimes I forget to unplug it, but so far the product doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat. I can also see purchasing the refill pad would be annoying, but I have been able to reuse the same paper pad using the same scent and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Works well...if only  for a brief time and you put it close to where you are sitting.</li>
            <li> I have one in the bedroom and one in my craft/sewing room.  It works so well and is not expensive.</li>
            <li> Just as promised 😀😀😬😬</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Using lemon essential oil right now.  Will purchase additional down the road for other rooms.  So simple to operate.</li>
            <li> This worked great for the first 20 minutes and then I think the pad dried out. I have it right next to my bed, too, so I&#x27;m really surprised I can&#x27;t smell it. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the aroma would last longer, found that it does not. I use what was recommended as high grade oil , but after about 45 minutes the smell is gone</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really diffuse the scent very well</li>
            <li> great product, just what i was needing!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.  I used 100% essential oils.  It barely throws a scent and if so only for a very short period.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It dries the oil out to quick. I wish I would have returned this item, I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Not a lot of information on how to use this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my massage room. It works ok but only in the area it&#x27;s plugged into. Not a powerful machine at all. The pads don&#x27;t hold scent for more than a few hours but are good to reuse a few times. For the price, its okay but i would spend a bit more for something better than this.</li>
            <li> I used this device maybe five times.  The first couple times I noticed the scent was strong for about an hour, then it faded quickly.  The last couple times I used it I barely noticed the scent at all.  I&#x27;m disappointed.  I had hoped for a continuous, light scent throughout the day.  This device did not provide that.  Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected as I have used these before</li>
            <li> This diffuser is inexpensive and easy to use. Exactly what I expected. I would recommend it to every one. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These do not disburse the oil at all and I use high quality oil. Very disappointed! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This worked very well for my essential oils . I wish it came with more pads though and maybe update it so the switch is rotatable ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but the diffuser works well and as advertised. The aroma kicks in within 10 minutes. The fragrance (using essential oils)  doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would, but I don&#x27;t consider that a flaw in the product itself. The oil is going to evaporate when exposed to air and heat - that&#x27;s just basic science. Essential oils get used up quickly by this method, so I started using my Pier1 diffuser oil on the pad. Smells good and is definitely more cost effective than essential oils. I love essential oils though, and believe that this would be the ticket for using them in your personal space at work. With the right oil, this diffuser could provide some stress relief at your desk. I&#x27;ll be testing that theory myself at some point.&lt;br /&gt;Safety - I&#x27;ve kept it plugged in for hours at a time and it remains warm but not overheated. However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to leave anything like this plugged in continuously.</li>
            <li> Love how it works with my oils to make my house smell great!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work too well in Chicago homes where the electric outlet is top to bottom.</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and was looking for an inexpensive and unobtrusive way to diffuse them in my home.  This plug in is pretty simple, but I think it could have been designed a lot better than it was. This is the second diffuser I&#x27;ve tried (the other was a small ceramic dish from Aveda that held a pool of oils and needed to stay plugged in by a very short cord to heat the oil. I don&#x27;t have a great place to keep that one anymore with a little kid and two cats added to the household, although it did work considerably better than this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to this product.  I liked that it was cheap (and I got free shipping for it on another site) and that I could use whichever oil(s) I wanted to.  I also liked that it doesn&#x27;t need to sit on a surface and is up out of the way in an outlet when in use and that it isn&#x27;t a humidifier. (These summers are already so swampy I can&#x27;t bear to think of adding to the humidity in here.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside for me was exactly what other people had said: the scent wears off too quickly.  It&#x27;s really just because the product can&#x27;t hold that much - even when I saturate the pad (25 drops) it doesn&#x27;t last for more than an hour and a half.  I literally get identical results just sprinkling a bit of it around the room (I found out by accident that eucalyptus oil doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my upholstery). I also don&#x27;t love the construction of it for basic use - the pads are under a grille of plastic tines and you have to catch the edge of it with your fingernail to pull it out to refill it (because the tines are too close together to drop the oil on it where it is). But then if you&#x27;ve had it plugged in for awhile, it&#x27;s hard to avoid touching the pad surface which on my unit was really hot to the touch. (Ow.) (But your finger will smell nice.)  Also, it&#x27;s a fist-sized beige plastic ball sticking out of your outlet - in my kitchen/living room that I generally try to keep free of plastic, that doesn&#x27;t really go with the flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my home to smell like the spa where I took my honeymoon.  I know that a dinky little diffuser like this won&#x27;t make that happen (even in a dinky little condo like mine), but I thought it could at least be a reliable way to have *some* fragrance doled out, but it&#x27;s really not made to do that.  Maybe if they came up with one that could hold a reservoir of oil (like one of the nasty chemical plug-ins) it would be able to last a more considerable amount of time, but there&#x27;s no way a few drops on a little pad isn&#x27;t going to fade away in pretty short order.  I&#x27;d say save your $ on this one.</li>
            <li> How is this supposed to work? I put five drops of lavender essence on it, smelled it for about two hours then it was gone. Is it too hot?</li>
            <li> I was excited about this oil diffuser, but it didn&#x27;t live up the hype. The scent only lasts for a few hours, so you have to continuously apply essential oil multiple times a day and the strips will wear out quickly if you do that. Overall, it works, but it will be expensive if you have to replace the strips constantly and to me, that&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy one of the oil diffuser candles/lamps and melt unscented wax on the diffuser, and add essential oil. It will last all day compared to just a couple of hours with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Working great so far!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent alternative to chemical-laden room plug ins. The fragrance depends completely on what oils the user likes. The strength of the fragrance is determined by how many drops of essential oil are used on the cotton pads. When I had a headached I used 20 drops of peppermint and plugged the unit into a downstairs bedroom. Within half an hour the entire downstairs was overly fragranced, which was my fault. The label recommends 7 to 10 drops. However, if one wanted to use a larger amount to fragrance a larger room or a room with a high vault, this little difuser has the power to do it. You can&#x27;t say that about other plug ins or candles. A few days later I tried lavendar, about 7 drops. Excellent! The diffuser comes with 5 cotton pads, which is nice. However, I reused the first pad with a different fragrance and and had no scent overlap. The diffuser does not get overly hot so I don&#x27;t worry about leaving it in the wall; it warms slightly. Another huge benefit is that antiseptic and antiviral essential oil blends, like Theive&#x27;s Oil, can be diffused into the air during cold and flu season. In this way it is not only aromatheraputic, but a good idea to maintain health. I used Aura Care oils. You should get one. It&#x27;s the cool thing to do.</li>
            <li> It works well to diffuse essential oil in a small room or bathroom and is a great alternative to chemical fragrances. A few drops of essential oils are needed on the pad, and then the diffuser is plugged in an outlet. It comes with 5 pads, and replacements can be purchased separately; however, the same pad can be reused multiple times as long as the same oil is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength and persistence of the fragrance depends on the essential oil used; I, for one, prefer grapefruit oil which is among the weakest in terms of persistence, so I have to refresh the pad often. With stronger oils the fragrance may persist for days. It requires more assistance than commercial air freshers, but it&#x27;s healthier and worth it.</li>
            <li> I have this beside my bed and it works well for that area of the room, but if you are looking for a diffuser to work in even a medium size room, this one is not it.  I love it for what I needed it for, which is a limited area (I use lavender and tangerine at night to help me sleep) but I can&#x27;t smell it more than five feet from the bed. Since they call it a &#x27;room diffuser&#x27; that&#x27;s a little bit disappointing!</li>
            <li> Did not work after three days</li>
            <li> Did not like the product. It always smells like it is going to catch on fire any second.</li>
            <li> I have anxiety and insomnia so I bought this to use with a relaxing oil blend in my bedroom at night. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li> Love the product, price &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Cardboard cards for oil dry up quickly. After a few hours, oil smells were no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Lasts 2 days, and you can reuse the pads with the same oil.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the epitome of simple and works just fine that way.  It just heats up a little foam pad that diffuses the oil into the air.  It diffuses enough to definitely have an impact.  I think this is one of the best ways to diffuse aroma into your room without also adding humidity through water,</li>
            <li> GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.  Works well and quickly spreads the aroma throughout the room and then some.  i purchased it with the Breathe Easy essential oil and found it works great for stuffy noses.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fills my entire room with lavender. So worth it!</li>
            <li> When I got this it was not in the box. So I contacted the buyer because I think it was used. They contacted me but said they would look into the problem but never got back to me. This diffuser only works for a short time ( only 30 min .) I will not buy again !</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very simple to use. It comes with I think 6 pads that last about a week before getting brown, at which point, the instructions say to discard. You just place a few drops of your favorite essential oil and it will pleasantly provide aroma to a bedroom or smaller living room. If you have a very large master bedroom or open concept house, the aroma tends to be significantly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off just placing a few drops on a cotton ball. A bit bulky considering it doesn&#x27;t diffuse the essential oil.  I wasted alot of product until I purchased a proper diffuser (ZAQ DEW diffuser).</li>
            <li> Great diffuser for the price would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this, and I&#x27;ve tried, but I just can&#x27;t smell it.  I&#x27;ve tried fragrance oils and essential oils, and not much change in a 10x20 bedroom</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t write an immediate review - I used it twice over a 3 month period and it just stopped working - I went cheap &amp; got what I paid for - no problems with the seller - just a cheap product advise spending a little more for a better one.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product, and the idea is good, but-it really does not perform well.  You would do better spending some money and getting a better one.  This is really a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the price. Worked a lot better than I was thinking it would. I would highly recommend this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like these much better than lamp diffusers.  These diffuse the oils faster and provide a stronger aroma.  I use 10-15 drops of oil on each pad, and the aroma lasts several hours.  I&#x27;m happy with the product, and mESSENTIALS is a great place to shop.</li>
            <li> Room smells great for an hour or so and then it&#x27;s gone. Not sure I wouldn&#x27;t get the same result if I just put a few drops of essential oil on one of the pads and left it sitting out.</li>
            <li> All was delivered and came as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister along with some fragrance oils. It works great and scent projection is strong. Great alternative to oil burners and reed diffusers. No chance of a mess. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well. I was just surprised that the scent disappeared from the pad before 8 hours were over. But that may be due to the quality of my oil.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the essential oil.  I have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased quite a few of these, but the oils burn off so fast, it&#x27;s not really worth the electricity.  I&#x27;ve recently purchased a soapstone diffuser from Pier1... add oil in the little basin and light a tea light candle.  Lasts about as long and actually sends the fragrance throughout the room.</li>
            <li> good for smaller area</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out how this works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very potent for like 3 hours.But the problem is that you need to like 30 drops until it actually works.Also the smell only works in a confined space.A open space such as a living room wont be too noticeable until you go near it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it provides much aroma. You must use alot of oil to get aroma.</li>
            <li> Super small, plug in device.  I guess you get what you pay for. More of a room air freshener than an essential oils diffuser.  Not a deal</li>
            <li> Use in my home and classroom!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to use, inexpensive and it fills the room with my wonderful fragrance. Am about to order some refills.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser very much but don&#x27;t like the very small pads that was sent with it. I already have one just like this one but it came with the longer pads which I like much better. Other then that it works fine.</li>
            <li> Normally this works very well, infusing the room strongly. This time it barely works...? My best guess is that the pads are the cause. Maybe they&#x27;re being manufactured in a new way or I received a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch of pads. I&#x27;ll try again because when things are working, it&#x27;s does its job well.</li>
            <li> if you want to avoid the bad chemicals from most commercially sold plug ins and prefer natural essential oils then this is a good solution. the downside is, the scent only last for about 6 hours tops i would say.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and had no complaints other than I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered it that apparently it isn&#x27;t as good to heat the oils when using them for aroma therapy.  This diffuser uses heat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t freshen the air very long</li>
            <li> This basically does not work for even my small bathroom, and I usually add 10 drops of essential oils. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a nearby co-op......it works well....the oils only last a short time on the pads.(because they evaporate)..but that is the way essential oils work (it isn&#x27;t a chemical \\&quot;Glade plug in\\&quot; that lasts for days and days).  I write the name of the oil I use on the pad...so I can reuse it again and again.  Overall happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Works well. Plug next to my side of the bed and use &amp;#34;sleeping potion&amp;#34; oil for a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t sit securely in the outlets I tried in my new home&lt;br /&gt;the filter that you put the oil on, wouldn&#x27;t stay securely in place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not likely ti even use</li>
            <li> Perfect for a bedroom to diffuse oils. Love it with lavender for sleeping or oils for overnight sinus relief in my room, use it with oils that help with sleeping and epilepsy in my son&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> For all the people that have posted bad reviews on this product, I&#x27;m confused. I got two of these one for upstairs one for down, I hate using the chemical sprays or plug ins and this is simple and I can leave it and not worry about it catching fire. I have had nothing but success with both my units so far. The scent sticks around for days depending on which oil you use. I will say what is pictured is not what I got, it was not in a box just a clear plastic bag and had no directions, it is the same plug in unit just without the name stamped in the plastic. It was pretty self explanatory though and as I have said, so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have high expectations for a diffuser. It works, it&#x27;s cool... but I have a small room and I&#x27;m still thinking I want more power behind it/a stronger fragrance. Unless, maybe my senses are off and it is knocking everyone else&#x27;s socks off. This shipped fast, and was a good price so... in the long run maybe I&#x27;ll use it in a bathroom or small place. No problem with the seller at all :)</li>
            <li> The scent covers a room for a solid hour. I wish it lasted a little longer but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I read the other reviews that said that it could only scent a small space and as I planned to use it for a very small bathroom thought it would be ok. Also, I like Aura Cacia oils so Itrusted the brand. Its been plugged in for about an hour now and you have to put your nose right next to it to smell it. When I touch it it is barely warm so of course it doesn&#x27;t difuse much scent. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Terrible product!  Cheap and not effective!</li>
            <li> this is one of my best purchases! i use it for my small bedroom and the amount of scent diffused is perfect. you can also adjust how strong it is by how many drops of essential oil you put on it. i usually use just plain lavender oil and it makes my room smell amazing. definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of oil and at least daily for me to smell anything.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that the lights would automatically change colors, as I have one similar to this one &amp; the lights do automatically change.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the problem is with the diffuser or the pads.  The oil scent is gone within an hour of putting the pad in the diffuser.  The diffuser gets quite hot when plugged in so it may be too hot and that is why the smell dissipates so quickly.</li>
            <li> Lasts 4-5 hours and performs as advertised. It stays cool to the touch and I&#x27;ve used the same pads for several weeks on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE DIFFUSER AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THE AROMA LASTS!!  YOU JUST USE A FEW DROPS OF YOUR FAVORITE FRAGANCE AND THE SMELL LASTS FOR HOURS!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that could give a pleasant scent in my kitchen that was not toxic and this works great since I can use which ever essential oils I choose. Actually it emits through the whole house. However it only lasts a few hours as the inserts dry out.</li>
            <li> cheap garbage don&#x27;t waste your money. over priced does not work. only smell the oils for 5 minutes. waste of my good pure essential oils. customer service is good.</li>
            <li> They get really hot within minutes using high quality essential oils - a major fire hazard. The aroma also disappears within minutes wasting 10 drops of expensive oils. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the auracacia blended oils as well. My only complaint - which may be just my way of using the item - is that I am often dropping oil in late at night after a long day at work. So i don&#x27;t always take the pad out to place oil on it. So the oil sometimes sticks to the little teeth on top and it is impossible to clean. That is really a case of lazy use, so I don&#x27;t think it would impact others&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I just started my love affair with essential oils.  I bought this plug in diffuser trying to save money and I definitely got what I payed for.  The pads dry out so very fast.  Only works for a short time and then the oil smell is gone.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Pay the extra money and purchase the ZAQ Allay!  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I really like using this room diffuser. I can put several different oils and plug it in and smells great and last throughout the night!</li>
            <li> Excellent warmer! I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since it arrived in the mail! Extra strips came in handy! I would definitely recommend to anybody who wants to use oils.</li>
            <li> This works for all of 10 minutes and dies. Absolutely worthless. I could have just put the EO on a cotton ball, left it on the dresser and it would&#x27;ve worked better</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t smell anything unless you are right at it.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these and one worked, the other one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> works really well in my office, i&#x27;ll be buying more of these</li>
            <li> I am thinking of getting a different type of diffuser as this one doesn&#x27;t seem to spread the essential oils out much.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  I put all kinds of different oils in it..and smells throughout the room I have it in.</li>
            <li> Use this in my office, love it.</li>
    </ol>
