            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Great natural ingredients that make me feel good about my choice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cooling, soothing product, more of a gel than a cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The label lists all kinds of \\&quot;wildcrafted\\&quot; ingredients that come to culmination in a lovely, soothing eye gel.  </li>
            <li>Soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products before</li>
            <li>and I love how moisturizing it is.</li>
            <li>I have a more &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better about what I put in and on my body;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Cooling, refreshing, smoothing.</li>
            <li>directions on the cardboard box suggest that this eye gel can be used all over the face as a facial treatment, and while out of town one weekend I gave that a try, with delightful results.</li>
            <li>Well, I really don&#x27;t see any yet, except that since it&#x27;s the best cream I found for my hands as well as my face, it goes kind of fast.</li>
            <li>bought this product for my sister &amp; she loves it, saw pretty great results on the first try (within 20 min.) &amp; better now that a week has gone by!</li>
            <li>It smells very clean and comes in a velvet bag along with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Nice eye gel, arrived quickly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction of many fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes like me.</li>
            <li>This is the most important thing for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs easily, so applying makeup is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it feels great on the face, it may be more cost prohibitive for such liberal use.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully, and made my dark circles almost disappear</li>
            <li>I do my homework on natural beauty care products, and organic is a top priority to me - only the very best for my skin, no weird additives or chemicals, and this eye gel has all the good stuff.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reduced fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell, one I would compare to cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free product in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than enough anti aging eye moisturizers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing, feels amazingly nice with a cooling affect after applying.</li>
            <li>It does feel nice and cool when you first put it on, but then it dries sticky.  </li>
            <li>This produc.smells fresh and feel cool and refreshing when applying I would purchase.again</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone with lightly oily, deeply sunken eyes &amp; it&#x27;s great for those with sensitive skin &amp;/or allergies. :)</li>
            <li>I am constantly on the lookout for good skin products.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried other creams, but this is really great.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I got multiple compliments on how fresh I look, so it must be doing something good after 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so light and natural :)</li>
            <li>The tingling sensation I feel as the gel dries reminds me of a facial toner, and my skin looked vibrant, radiant, healthy and more even-colored with a reduction in fine</li>
            <li>It always feels light, which is important to my very SENSITIVE skin.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh cut cucumber and it leaves a soothing tingly feeling on your skin after you put it on.</li>
            <li>More of an update later if things change, but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>The little spatula is very handy, no chance of accidental contamination</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant cucumber smell, and a slight tingle when first applied.  </li>
            <li>I could never get the exact right amount</li>
            <li>Used it on my lips and hands and it works amazingly to moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this eye gel to women who struggle with trying to keep the skin surrounding their eyes looking young and bright.</li>
            <li>Overall, happy with the purchase, will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li>First of all, this eye gel comes packaged fantastically, in a decorative box with a velvet bag covering the jar.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd bottle, I love it.</li>
            <li>but within the last six months or so I&#x27;ve started to notice that the lines around my eyes are getting deeper and more noticeable and</li>
            <li>Absorbs really well - in comparison, often creams feel like they &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my skin, not fully absorbed.  </li>
            <li>stellar quality ingrediants</li>
            <li>Has a clean, crisp and natural scent.  </li>
            <li>Most products say to put under your eye, but not on your eyelid, but I found this one gentle enough to use on the crease of my eyelid as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn’t completely sure what “wildcrafted” meant, but according to Wikipedia, it is the “harvesting of plants in their natural or wild habitat for medicinal or food purposes.”  </li>
            <li>And it comes in a little bag, so it would make a nice present, too. :)</li>
            <li>One Eye Gel feels cooling to my skin when first applied, and then I noticed a gentle tingling sensation that was almost to a level of feeling burning... with no indication on my skin of rash.</li>
            <li>At first application (btw, the little spatula is so handy)</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and comes with a simple applicator</li>
            <li>I am very pleased, the only thing that isn&#x27;t really a negative but some would find slightly interesting</li>
            <li>after my shower, I apply it, then get dressed, and I am ready to apply make-up.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It’s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>After doing a ton of research to buy a reasonably priced eye cream I chose this brand.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I really really like it.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my whole face, neck and even hands</li>
            <li>It is really working.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the dark glass vs throwaway plastic;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Those with more sensitive skin may be reassured that I applied this twice daily for two weeks with only positive results</li>
            <li>Upon opening the little jar, you get a lovely waft of cucumbers.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural eye treatment.</li>
            <li>should mention that I have sensitive skin, and am very cautious about the types of skin care creams, lotions, and salves I use, so the tingling sensations I feel might not be felt by all users of this gel.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t bother writing a review, but I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a month now</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve also noticed that my eyes LOOK better since using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I take these sensations as indications during use that something is actually happening, which is nice to know on the first few applications before visible results are clearly evident.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other products out there, but I&#x27;m happy with the results and so is my wife.</li>
            <li>morning and night, this has made a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes and the tightness and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>As I get older, I get more serious about my skin care.  </li>
            <li>It’s natural.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a natural product, that works, this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t suit my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t consider myself a vain person, far from it...</li>
            <li>As a well over 50 year old woman, I have probably tried everything under the sun to reverse the signs of ageing.</li>
            <li>With that being said I was very pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>and I never knew how much of the product is left.</li>
            <li>Of course, nothing will completely get rid of the dark circles, short of surgery, but this product does a nice job of making them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried at least five eye creams and this gel is the only thing that has worked to smooth it out!</li>
            <li>The jar is small enough to fit inside a makeup bag</li>
            <li>But it is a lot better than the heavy, perfumed and artificial smell of most skin</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be giving me an overall fresher look around my eyes...</li>
            <li>Love the little jar that fits in my quite small cosmetics pouch.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which products I choose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After time in the sun or a long day of work ... this is a soothing treatment to the eyes and the face in general.  </li>

            <li> Those with more sensitive skin may be reassured that I applied this twice daily for two weeks with only positive results</li>
            <li> Upon opening the little jar, you get a lovely waft of cucumbers.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural eye treatment.</li>
            <li> should mention that I have sensitive skin, and am very cautious about the types of skin care creams, lotions, and salves I use, so the tingling sensations I feel might not be felt by all users of this gel.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t bother writing a review, but I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a month now</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve also noticed that my eyes LOOK better since using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I take these sensations as indications during use that something is actually happening, which is nice to know on the first few applications before visible results are clearly evident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other products out there, but I&#x27;m happy with the results and so is my wife.</li>
            <li> morning and night, this has made a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes and the tightness and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I get more serious about my skin care.  </li>
            <li> It’s natural.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a natural product, that works, this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t suit my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t consider myself a vain person, far from it...</li>
            <li> As a well over 50 year old woman, I have probably tried everything under the sun to reverse the signs of ageing.</li>
            <li> With that being said I was very pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> and I never knew how much of the product is left.</li>
            <li> Of course, nothing will completely get rid of the dark circles, short of surgery, but this product does a nice job of making them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried at least five eye creams and this gel is the only thing that has worked to smooth it out!</li>
            <li> The jar is small enough to fit inside a makeup bag</li>
            <li> But it is a lot better than the heavy, perfumed and artificial smell of most skin</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be giving me an overall fresher look around my eyes...</li>
            <li> Love the little jar that fits in my quite small cosmetics pouch.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which products I choose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After time in the sun or a long day of work ... this is a soothing treatment to the eyes and the face in general.  </li>
            <li> For the past about of three weeks of using this Eye Cream I can see real result.</li>
            <li> I work long hours in front of the computer, so the soothing relief was enough of a reason to purchase it.</li>
            <li> easily - really feel it has improved the condition of my delicate eye area -</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry, especially around the eyes, so I have to be careful with what I put on</li>
            <li> It immediately got rid of the dry flaky skin under my eyes, doesn&#x27;t break me out and isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> : Always let it dry before putting any make-up on over it.</li>
            <li> Fairly quickly it was apparent that she was crazy about the product.  </li>
            <li> Even after only a few uses, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes were less obvious.  </li>
            <li> It is actively making a difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed visible improvement in reduction of dark circles under my eyes after using Optimal One Revitalizing Eye Gel for just a few days, with further improvement after another few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to get bags and dark circles under my eyes</li>

            <li> I like that this product was an all natural product, unfortunately it irritated my eyes.</li>

            <li> I have a small wrinkle in the corner of my eye, probably from the way I sleep. I have tried at least five eye creams and this gel is the only thing that has worked to smooth it out! I am very pleased, the only thing that isn&#x27;t really a negative but some would find slightly interesting is that before it dries it can be a little bit sticky. But like I said, it isn&#x27;t a negative for me just something I noticed.</li>
            <li> bought this product for my sister &amp; she loves it, saw pretty great results on the first try (within 20 min.) &amp; better now that a week has gone by! would recommend to anyone with lightly oily, deeply sunken eyes &amp; it&#x27;s great for those with sensitive skin &amp;/or allergies. :)</li>
            <li> Nice eye gel, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Feels cooling, works well under eye makeup</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully, and made my dark circles almost disappear</li>
            <li> I am 51, I take excellent care of myself, but wrinkles happen. I can say I see a definite improvement around my eyes. I have tried other creams, but this is really great. It is a bit sticky before it dries so after my shower, I apply it, then get dressed, and I am ready to apply make-up. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> half way gone..it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I like that this product was an all natural product, unfortunately it irritated my eyes. But I think overall it&#x27;s a great product if you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes like me.</li>
            <li> Blah blah blah. This does not work or help.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.Thanks</li>
            <li> This eye gel feels so good. It&#x27;s a cooling, soothing product, more of a gel than a cream. It has a light smell, one I would compare to cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used all around my eye area with noticeable results. I put it under and even on my eyelid and it&#x27;s reduced fine lines and puffiness. Most products say to put under your eye, but not on your eyelid, but I found this one gentle enough to use on the crease of my eyelid as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs easily, so applying makeup is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> This is a truly amazing product. So often you don&#x27;t get what the manufacturer promises in their description, but in this case, you will. First of all, this eye gel comes packaged fantastically, in a decorative box with a velvet bag covering the jar. The jar is small enough to fit inside a makeup bag so it is perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel itself has a very mild and pleasant scent and feels good on the skin. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which products I choose. I have been using this now for the past week without a single issue. The gel is cooling and after just a few minutes, you can see a visible difference in the way the skin surrounding your eyes looks. The puffiness and small lines and wrinkles look reduced and after a few hours look even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used morning and night, this has made a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes and the tightness and texture of my skin. The product is easy to use and comes with a simple applicator so you don&#x27;t have to get it all over your fingers and under your nails. I wear it under my usual makeup and you can&#x27;t even tell that it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this eye gel to women who struggle with trying to keep the skin surrounding their eyes looking young and bright. A wonderful product, well worth the time to use.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I get more serious about my skin care.  I am constantly on the lookout for good skin products.  I am delighted to be introduced to this eye product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  This is the most important thing for me.  Even after only a few uses, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes were less obvious.  Of course, nothing will completely get rid of the dark circles, short of surgery, but this product does a nice job of making them less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It’s gentle on my skin.  My skin is very dry, especially around the eyes, so I have to be careful with what I put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It’s natural.  I wasn’t completely sure what “wildcrafted” meant, but according to Wikipedia, it is the “harvesting of plants in their natural or wild habitat for medicinal or food purposes.”  When I read the ingredient list for retail skin creams, it’s all unpronounceable chemical names.  This product has things like:  aloe vera, geranium, and periwinkle.  Sounds like a delightful herb garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is medicinal, which might take some getting used to.  But it is a lot better than the heavy, perfumed and artificial smell of most skin creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural product, that works, this is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than enough anti aging eye moisturizers and this one is by far the best.  After doing a ton of research to buy a reasonably priced eye cream I chose this brand.  It immediately got rid of the dry flaky skin under my eyes, doesn&#x27;t break me out and isn&#x27;t oily. Been using it twice a day for the past 2 months and I&#x27;ve seen a reduction of many fine lines around my eyes. This is very moisturizing, feels amazingly nice with a cooling affect after applying. It smells very clean and comes in a velvet bag along with a spatula. I feel like my eyes are perked up when I put it on. This is a must have product!!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the little jar, you get a lovely waft of cucumbers.  The label lists all kinds of \\&quot;wildcrafted\\&quot; ingredients that come to culmination in a lovely, soothing eye gel.  It provides a cooling sensation immediately upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After time in the sun or a long day of work ... this is a soothing treatment to the eyes and the face in general.  Although it feels great on the face, it may be more cost prohibitive for such liberal use.  It does feel absolutely wonderful though.  Soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle, I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells like fresh cut cucumber and it leaves a soothing tingly feeling on your skin after you put it on. I suffer from sensitivity and acne and this has helped figh off wrinkles, blemishes, and discoloration. I have had it for a couple of weeks and I use it morning and night. The packaging is great. Comes in a little black bag in a box with an application tool.</li>
            <li> My friend actually told me about it. She loves it and now I see why. Normally I wouldn&#x27;t bother writing a review, but I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a month now and I must say I really really like it. I&#x27;ve used many products before but I never could find something that would feel good on my skin. This one feels great, smells great, has wonderful natural ingredients. At first application (btw, the little spatula is so handy) you feel a pleasant warming sensation and then cooling. It always feels light, which is important to my very SENSITIVE skin. It&#x27;s been about a month and I see that my eyes look brighter, the skin tighter. I tried it on my whole face, neck and even hands and I love how moisturizing it is. Overall, happy with the purchase, will definitely keep using it. I recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin and aversion to nasty chemicals in other creams.</li>
            <li> Great Eye Product. Helps reduce lines and tightens skin around the eye. Will see a difference within a week of use.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! It is really working. For the past about of three weeks of using this Eye Cream I can see real result. Strongly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t suit my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 3 months, two times a day, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes.  No reduction in darkness under eyes.  No reduction in appearance of wrinkles.  It does feel nice and cool when you first put it on, but then it dries sticky.  My hair sticks to it under my eyes when I&#x27;m blow drying and it&#x27;s annoying.  (And yes, I&#x27;ve tried using less.  Still sticky.)  It hasn&#x27;t been problematic when mixing with makeup, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over a week now and there are already improvements in the dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve also stopped using eye make-up for a time as wearing it and cleaning cause me to rub my eyes which is a terrible habit. This product feels clean, smells good, and is not a just-for-this evening&#x27;s-date kind of product. It is actively making a difference. More of an update later if things change, but so far I&#x27;m loving it. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this cream using my account about a month ago.  Fairly quickly it was apparent that she was crazy about the product.  Within a week she had talked me into giving it a try.  Now I don&#x27;t consider myself a vain person, far from it... but within the last six months or so I&#x27;ve started to notice that the lines around my eyes are getting deeper and more noticeable and I have a more &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look.  So somewhat reluctantly I applied the eye cream as directed morning and evening.  I have to say, I felt a tightening of my skin almost immediately.  It has a pleasant cucumber smell, and a slight tingle when first applied.  So far it seems to be giving me an overall fresher look around my eyes... less noticeable lines, firmer skin and it&#x27;s lightening my faint dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks use it looks like I am going to have to get another jar so we don&#x27;t have to fight over the current one.  I&#x27;ve never used a facial product before so I&#x27;m not sure how this compares to other products out there, but I&#x27;m happy with the results and so is my wife.</li>
            <li> I can say without any hesitation that this product is going to have a permanent spot in my vanity. I had a chance to try this through a friend and could not believe the immediate cooling and tightening sensation that I had around my eyes. (Tip: It&#x27;s also good for the neck area!) I work long hours in front of the computer, so the soothing relief was enough of a reason to purchase it. However(!), I&#x27;ve also noticed that my eyes LOOK better since using this for a few weeks. So it&#x27;s a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural eye treatment. And it comes in a little bag, so it would make a nice present, too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Always let it dry before putting any make-up on over it.</li>
            <li> It cools the area under the eye, feels refreshed, recommended</li>
            <li> As a well over 50 year old woman, I have probably tried everything under the sun to reverse the signs of ageing. As a result I am not as naïve as some people to think that there is a miracle out there that will undo half of century worth of neglect or bad habits. I don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations any more. With that being said I was very pleasantly surprised with this product. I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I&#x27;m on my fifth jar and I felt like sharing my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels and smells wonderful;&lt;br /&gt;- Love the little jar that fits in my quite small cosmetics pouch. I have tried different products that come in those airless pumps but it&#x27;s been a frustrating experience for me. I could never get the exact right amount and I never knew how much of the product is left. Plus, I love the dark glass vs throwaway plastic;&lt;br /&gt;- Used it on my lips and hands and it works amazingly to moisturize my dry skin. I put it on my hands before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;- Great natural ingredients that make me feel good about my choice. I&#x27;m getting better about what I put in and on my body;&lt;br /&gt;- The little spatula is very handy, no chance of accidental contamination&lt;br /&gt;- I got multiple compliments on how fresh I look, so it must be doing something good after 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Well, I really don&#x27;t see any yet, except that since it&#x27;s the best cream I found for my hands as well as my face, it goes kind of fast. I will update if I find any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product. I am very happy with it so far. I recommend it to all my friends and they seem to like it too.</li>
            <li> Great! Cooling, refreshing, smoothing. I love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel!!  Has a clean, crisp and natural scent.  Absorbs really well - in comparison, often creams feel like they &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on my skin, not fully absorbed.  I do my homework on natural beauty care products, and organic is a top priority to me - only the very best for my skin, no weird additives or chemicals, and this eye gel has all the good stuff. I tend to get bags and dark circles under my eyes easily - really feel it has improved the condition of my delicate eye area - will write a review in a couple of months to update progress.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I noticed visible improvement in reduction of dark circles under my eyes after using Optimal One Revitalizing Eye Gel for just a few days, with further improvement after another few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Optimal One Eye Gel feels cooling to my skin when first applied, and then I noticed a gentle tingling sensation that was almost to a level of feeling burning... with no indication on my skin of rash. I take these sensations as indications during use that something is actually happening, which is nice to know on the first few applications before visible results are clearly evident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the cardboard box suggest that this eye gel can be used all over the face as a facial treatment, and while out of town one weekend I gave that a try, with delightful results. The tingling sensation I feel as the gel dries reminds me of a facial toner, and my skin looked vibrant, radiant, healthy and more even-colored with a reduction in fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I have sensitive skin, and am very cautious about the types of skin care creams, lotions, and salves I use, so the tingling sensations I feel might not be felt by all users of this gel. Those with more sensitive skin may be reassured that I applied this twice daily for two weeks with only positive results noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a complimentary sample of this product in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> So great! so light and natural :)</li>
            <li> This produc.smells fresh and feel cool and refreshing when applying I would purchase.again</li>
            <li> this is good, does what is promised. stellar quality ingrediants</li>
