            <li>I have always liked using nail polish colors that will go with my outfits.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love OPI.  </li>
            <li>I am really glad I got this color.  </li>
            <li>However, if you like sparkles you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;d be a liiiitle better without them.</li>
            <li>I love the polish makes me feel like a kid again.</li>
            <li>I love the sparkle.</li>
            <li>The kids love it and makes for cute toes for grown ups too.</li>
            <li>I loved the Fresh Frog of Bell Air OPI nail color.  </li>
            <li>The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one</li>
            <li>I love the glitter.</li>
            <li>But the color is great, and very sparky and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>(my wife&#x27;s words), and stays one for awhile without easily chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It went on easy and was easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>Love this Color and Sparkle, just takes a couple of coats for the  true color pay off..</li>
            <li>It has more silver glitter than what appears in the picture but will still be a fun color to wear.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see this color available that I ordered it without reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>This color was So cool with gettin miss piggy with it for Christmas</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It looks great over another green or black, for a nice sparkly top coat .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments because it&#x27;s not a typical color</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look right when I apply it.</li>
            <li>This product is of typical OPI quality, which is to say that it&#x27;s quite good.  </li>
            <li>this OPI nail polish is pretty.  </li>
            <li>Also, pretty for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations.</li>
            <li>and it came so fast!</li>
            <li>also have the red Miss Piggy one :)</li>
            <li>I am very picky about green nail polish and this shade was absolutely perfect since it not ony looked great with my green outfits but outfits of other colors as well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Fresh Frog of Bell Air if you are looking for a good shade of green nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is very runny and seems to be thinned out.  </li>
            <li>The color is very festive version.</li>
            <li>and it really pops.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a bit more green in color than what it really is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, but it had really big silver flakes in it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li>better than just a matte green for a change!  </li>
            <li>only reason I give this 3/5 (and not 5/5) is because my wife prefers solid colors, and this one has a lot of sparkles that take away from the depth and apparent awe generated by a more solid finish.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
            <li>color is a hard to find glad I made the purchase and went with a different color and style.</li>
            <li>Mermaid&#x27;s Tears(a medium bluish green), and \\&quot;Jade is the New Black\\&quot; (a darker green which imparts depth to Fresh Frog of Bel Air).</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the glitter sinks and you&#x27;re basically applying the clear.</li>

            <li> O.P.I&#x27;s Fresh Frog of Bel Air has a clear base, which makes it an excellent over layer to a single layer of O.P.I&#x27;s green shades, such as Stranger Tides (a pale green sage),</li>
            <li> OPI Nail Lacquer, Jade Is The New Black, 0.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I needed 3 coats to really make it sparkly and it has peeled off in one piece, as other glitter nail polishes have, but not right away.  </li>
            <li> This is clear polish with green and silver sparkles.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is the way the polish was intended, but it isn&#x27;t like any other OPI glitter polish I&#x27;ve used, and that includes several from the Muppets line.</li>
            <li> big pieces of silver glitter with smaller green glitter!</li>
            <li> grass green with larger silver glitter throughout.</li>
            <li> The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color for my wife, in addition to her other 9,281 OPI colors.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> The bottle of polish that I received in the mail was not full and seemed as if it had already been used.</li>
            <li> If you like green</li>
            <li> I used a non OPI base coat and my nails got stained an off yellow color for months requiring me to have my nails painted constantly because they looked gross.</li>
            <li> The color is &amp;#34;Kermit&amp;#34; green.  </li>
            <li> This is a glittery, emerald green shade.  </li>
            <li> In fact, on your toes it lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the polish itself was very thin and had a very strong smell, so bad that my eyes were watering when I opened it.</li>
            <li> but you need to apply it after a base because it will leave a very sheer look.</li>
            <li> I have TONS of OPI nail polishes and this one seemed weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the opi brand base coat would made a difference or not.</li>

            <li> If you like green this OPI nail polish is pretty.  Also, pretty for St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted! big pieces of silver glitter with smaller green glitter! looks great :) yeah yeah</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see this color available that I ordered it without reading the reviews.  It arrived, and I immediately noticed something off about it when I unwrapped the bottle.  It is very runny and seems to be thinned out.  Maybe this is the way the polish was intended, but it isn&#x27;t like any other OPI glitter polish I&#x27;ve used, and that includes several from the Muppets line.</li>
            <li> I received the nail polish and its just as I had imagined. It&#x27;s a nice sparkly touch as a top coat!</li>
            <li> The bottle of polish that I received in the mail was not full and seemed as if it had already been used. Additionally, the polish itself was very thin and had a very strong smell, so bad that my eyes were watering when I opened it. I have TONS of OPI nail polishes and this one seemed weird. I have a feeling it was used and then thinned out with a nail polish thinner or remover. Buyer beware...</li>
            <li> This color was clearly blue. Not like the picture at all. I like it...but it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it!!  It is a great color.  I love OPI.  I am really glad I got this color.  I highly recommend OPI.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this color for my wife, in addition to her other 9,281 OPI colors.  This product is of typical OPI quality, which is to say that it&#x27;s quite good.  It coats well (my wife&#x27;s words), and stays one for awhile without easily chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this 3/5 (and not 5/5) is because my wife prefers solid colors, and this one has a lot of sparkles that take away from the depth and apparent awe generated by a more solid finish.  However, if you like sparkles you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the store and just as I expected it to be! I even bought an extra one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Color was what I wanted and was perfect. I used a non OPI base coat and my nails got stained an off yellow color for months requiring me to have my nails painted constantly because they looked gross. I&#x27;m not sure the opi brand base coat would made a difference or not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty, but it had really big silver flakes in it. I think it&#x27;d be a liiiitle better without them. But the color is great, and very sparky and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> Sent it to a girlfriend, she painted her toes and fingers and sent me pics. I like the color and she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this Color and Sparkle, just takes a couple of coats for the  true color pay off..all in all I Love it! better than just a matte green for a change!  and it came so fast! and was expertly bubble wrapped!..so buying more! yay!</li>
            <li> The color received is not the color I ordered and is NOT the color that is shown!!! But it&#x27;s a useable color.</li>
            <li> I love the polish makes me feel like a kid again. The colors remind me of a time when the muppets were always on TV</li>
            <li> I love this polish :), it is amazing!!!!! I love the sparkle. you definitley have to use a shade of nail polish underneath it to get it to show all the sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the red Miss Piggy one :)</li>
            <li> The color is very festive version. The texture goes on well and doesn&#x27;t come out clumpy it is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a hard to find glad I made the purchase and went with a different color and style.</li>
            <li> Another great OPI glitter in &amp;#34;Fresh Frog of Bell Air&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Vibrant grass green with larger silver glitter throughout. SHAKE WELL and shake periodically during application. Otherwise, the glitter sinks and you&#x27;re basically applying the clear.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I thought it would be a bit more green in color than what it really is. It has more silver glitter than what appears in the picture but will still be a fun color to wear.</li>
            <li> This is clear polish with green and silver sparkles.  The kids love it and makes for cute toes for grown ups too.</li>
            <li> I have always liked using nail polish colors that will go with my outfits.  I loved the Fresh Frog of Bell Air OPI nail color.  It goes perfectly with a great number of my outfits.  I am very picky about green nail polish and this shade was absolutely perfect since it not ony looked great with my green outfits but outfits of other colors as well.  It went on easy and was easy to maintain.  I highly recommend Fresh Frog of Bell Air if you are looking for a good shade of green nail polish.</li>
            <li> This nail lacquer has a great color but you need to apply it after a base because it will leave a very sheer look. I don´t recommend it...</li>
            <li> I bought this polish for my 30-something daughter.  She has a tattoo of all the Sesame characters around her ankle, in color, including the lamp post.  The color is &amp;#34;Kermit&amp;#34; green.  I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> The wife and daughter have already had many a nail painting party with this one and they say it has already passed the test, best brand out there!  Dries quickly,  does not chip,  and last long!</li>
            <li> Still a totally awesome glitter polish. It looks great over another green or black, for a nice sparkly top coat .</li>
            <li> Perfect bling for the Christmas or St Patty&#x27;s Day bling. I love the glitter. The product came as expected but took a while to ship.</li>
            <li> This is a glittery, emerald green shade.  I needed 3 coats to really make it sparkly and it has peeled off in one piece, as other glitter nail polishes have, but not right away.  In fact, on your toes it lasts a few weeks.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments because it&#x27;s not a typical color and it really pops.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
