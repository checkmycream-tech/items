            <li>It&#x27;s as wonderful as the Ivory that saw me through my earliest years and so easy to apply!</li>
            <li>With this body wash I found that I have to use A LOT to get a good lather(I</li>
            <li>Good for both men and women.</li>
            <li>This is a troubling trend in labeling and one I can&#x27;t support with my dollar, in good conscience.</li>
            <li>Ivory makes one of the best body washes that there is, it leaves the skin smooth since the body wash rinses off well, there is no residue, and it lathers very easily.</li>
            <li>I saw this Ivory product and smelled it, it smelled very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Best price available and shipping is free!</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell of the ivory soap bars!</li>
            <li>Nice size, nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t want to wash their sins away in this kind of bubbly euphoria?</li>
            <li>so it is almost (but not quite) as nice</li>
            <li>The soap smells great-- just clean.</li>
            <li>The REAL original formula was just right...until they dun goofed it up and brought it into Perfumeland.</li>
            <li>It is - far and away - the best body wash I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>The light scent is pleasant and is appropriate for men as well as women.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely in a wash cloth or a loofah, and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to stock up and order it through the Subscribe and Save option on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Nothing more but a comment on the smell -  I thought it would smell like the bar soap Ivory, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this on Amazon, so I&#x27;m set for a while.</li>
            <li>So I am glad I found that amazon carrys this.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out--</li>
            <li>but it could be a while :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ivory bar soap for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the size of the bottles and the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that Ivory would have the product lather a bit more and smell more like the bars themselves............</li>
            <li>and I was in love.  </li>
            <li>The smell alone will make you fall in love.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite body soap for years.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have all of those fragrances.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It a bit more scented than I would like</li>
            <li>I really love this body wash.</li>
            <li>and I thought that I&#x27;d be ok with this since it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>love everything about this body wash: the scent, it is not too girly (even my husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li>Happy, clean, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so clean and fresh and the shower gel does feel great on skin</li>
            <li>Just as advertised, this body wash makes me feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, light, fresh, clean, scent.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this, every person who smelled it and used it, loved it.  </li>
            <li>Keeps you clean!</li>
            <li>Feel clean, no filmy feeling upon rinsing off!</li>
            <li>Great for young children as well.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so I am happy when I find a body wash that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>I love the ivory original scent body wash.  </li>
            <li>We thought it would rinse easily from the skin and have simpler ingredients.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working ok, smells nice and is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t easily wash off the \\&quot;scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I like it better than the bar plus make bathroom easier to clean</li>
            <li>I liked the old formula mostly because it did not fall into the girly-flower perfume trap that most big-bottle body washes are in.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and it gives you a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original formula for years and liked it very much because I do not like a strong scent on my body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to buy in bulk, but it sure is nice knowing</li>
            <li>This body wash is so gentle and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like the fragrance free soap.  </li>
            <li>price and qty can not be beaten along with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Its light and airy.</li>
            <li>It is as good as the Ivory soap bars that I used for years but not nearly as messy.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>the original Ivory scent.</li>
            <li>We tried this as an alternative to spending $15 for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap, because it said \\&quot;clean wash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I just want to smell clean.</li>
            <li>i lvoe the scent its fresh and clean and rinses away easily</li>
            <li>and you feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>I smells clean, but not perfumy.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, shampoo like smell.  </li>
            <li>It just smells like what a body wash should smell like, not perfume-y or fruity, but just a person who smells clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will fall off your hand before you can even use it to clean yourself because it is so runny.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice scent and it is nice and thick so</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh smell, without that overpowering perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>Ivory had a real winner with this one and most people didn&#x27;t even recognize it.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Compared to the cost at the store 8 months ago this was a good buy and lasted 8 months (on last bottle now).  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I can&#x27;t find this in local stores.</li>
            <li>It still gets the job done for a good price, but I definitely preferred the scent before reformulation.</li>
            <li>It is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean in shower.</li>
            <li>Super product, super value.</li>
            <li>the 6-pack was a terrific find and the pricing is exceptional.</li>
            <li>Your marketing people have betrayed you and you have lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I use the soap everyday and its light smells great and I will buy another case when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I love the smell -- lightly floral, clean, and simple.</li>
            <li>Bath and Body Works body washes are much better and a small drop would provide a good lather.  </li>
            <li>I use this as an all around shower soap and it never fails to clean even the muddiest child</li>
            <li>Like bathing in the froth of angel wings or the laugh of a child.  </li>
            <li>Fresh is the word I would describe it as.</li>
            <li>Just ordered the \\&quot;Pack of Six\\&quot; 24 oz bottles, and will continue pouring the soap into the less-slippery white bottle from the original (and better)</li>
            <li>Gentle, clean smell and can use with confidence.  </li>
            <li>This Ivory body wash gives me a clean feeling without too much fragrance.</li>
            <li>For the last 66 years I have been an ivory baby ;) and love the original scent product.</li>
            <li>It is a highly perfumed body wash that in no way reminds me of original Ivory -</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and these big bottles are so economical.</li>
            <li>It is also very very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of suds, just the right amount of a gentle fragrance...</li>
            <li>Very gentle on sensitive skin, and lightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Natural, gentle, nice soft Ivory scent, lots of bubbles  </li>
            <li>The first generation was so</li>
            <li>This soap is never on the shelf on a consistent basis in my area.  </li>
            <li>I got my first Ivory shower gel from a friend a year ago</li>
            <li>I really hope they dont stop making it!</li>
            <li>It has definitely been good for my dog&#x27;s skin condition as it is not dry and flaky like before</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural fragrance and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nothing fancy, just pure, simple cleanness.</li>
            <li>I love this and have been using it since I was pregnant and couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of any other body wash or soap.</li>
            <li>this new Simple Clean stuff is a loser compared to the original.</li>
            <li>Simply Ivory an easy five stars, but</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t find the large bottles at any stores around me.  </li>
            <li>Just a pure bottle of hope and salvation.  </li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t perfumed.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a real bargain.</li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ivory soap my whole life (I just turned 55)</li>
            <li>Fast efficient - will buy again.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really wash;</li>
            <li>The smell on this is very overpowering.</li>
            <li>It takes too much of the Ivory body wash to get a lather.  </li>
            <li>....another product I use daily that is not always available in stores...I buy in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; so I never run out...</li>
            <li>I tend to use too much as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to perfumes</li>
            <li>photo on this item page is now accurate, it no longer shows the white bottle from the original Simply Ivory.</li>
            <li>Go back to the original formula and I will return to,using your product.</li>
            <li>Simply Ivory Original Scent Body Wash, 24-Ounce Bottles</li>
            <li>Only Ivory can get you this clean.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Simple Clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also washes off quite easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; after use, but it neither makes me feel dry.</li>
            <li>Growing up, Ivory soap was the gold standard among moms who wanted to get their kids clean.</li>
            <li>Smelled simple and clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh and clean without being overpowering like some other body wash brands.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe this product is not more popular</li>
            <li>Such a fresh scent and it gently stays with you for the day.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this here because my local store (the only one I could find this at) stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you like the clean scent of Ivory and want a body soap that goes a long way then this is the soap for you.  </li>
            <li>Lots of soft, gentle lather.</li>
            <li>We normally use a bath/shower product that costs 3 times the price of i bottle of Ivory Body Wash.  </li>
            <li>It cleans my body well for a shower everyday, and the bottle lasts for many showers.</li>
            <li>I loved the original Simply Ivory Body Wash, it smelled so fresh and was reasonably priced compared to others out there, and had hoped to stock up on it as it was beginning to get \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; in the usual shopping spots.</li>
            <li>I used the original because it had a minimal odor.</li>
            <li>Just wondering if your marketing people have ever heard of New Coke?</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve decided to give this new version of Ivory Body Wash another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the NEW FORMULA, not the pre-2015 product.</li>
            <li>I received six 21-oz bottles of the new (un)improved stuff.</li>
            <li>The newly designed bottle is still way too slippery when wet, so I&#x27;m using the original bottle because it&#x27;s easier to handle in the shower and pouring the soap from the new bottle to the old one!</li>
            <li>Ivory Simple Clean Body Wash is obviously not manufactured in the U.S. and P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t want you to know where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different body washes...cheap ones from the drugstore, expensive ones from the natural foods store, and so many in between the two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several body washes on the market and Ivory is simply the best body wash for sensitive skin, so if you have sensitive skin like myself, you will not go wrong with this product .</li>
            <li>My only concern is how long will it continue to be available?</li>
            <li>I really love Simple Clean Ivory scent that has been used until the product got &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; in approximately the beginning of 2015.</li>
            <li>Simply stated Ivory is the only thing that I can use on my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for Ivory now at this point, but whoever it is, please revert back to the old formula!</li>
            <li>It moistens my skin and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li>I will be trying to find the old stuff online</li>
            <li>If I cannot find the old formula online I will cease using Ivory body wash completely and you will i have lost a customer forever.</li>
            <li>I nearly dropped it on my toe, so had to hold onto it with both hands.</li>
            <li>Would have given the old</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;re looking for the old scent/bottle.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find Ivory Body Wash on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This smells and cleans like the Ivory of old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and a smaller bottle of this is $6.00 at the corner drug store.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell awfully good (or bad for that matter), but nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a way to cut down on our trips to the local unnamed super store.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause my back to break out, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
            <li>this is the only baody wash that does not break out my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Barely, but does.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it might have happened in shipping, but there were no loose pieces in the box.  </li>
            <li>It is so hard to find this stuff in stores, but luckily I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>it leaves a clean but subtle scent and not overpowering like some bodywash.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or tight and the scent is not strong or overwhelming.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> With this body wash I found that I have to use A LOT to get a good lather(I</li>

            <li> It is - far and away - the best body wash I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> The light scent is pleasant and is appropriate for men as well as women.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely in a wash cloth or a loofah, and leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to stock up and order it through the Subscribe and Save option on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Nothing more but a comment on the smell -  I thought it would smell like the bar soap Ivory, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this on Amazon, so I&#x27;m set for a while.</li>
            <li> So I am glad I found that amazon carrys this.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out--</li>
            <li> but it could be a while :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ivory bar soap for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the size of the bottles and the product itself.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that Ivory would have the product lather a bit more and smell more like the bars themselves............</li>
            <li> and I was in love.  </li>
            <li> The smell alone will make you fall in love.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite body soap for years.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have all of those fragrances.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It a bit more scented than I would like</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash.</li>
            <li> and I thought that I&#x27;d be ok with this since it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> love everything about this body wash: the scent, it is not too girly (even my husband loves this stuff</li>
            <li> Happy, clean, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so clean and fresh and the shower gel does feel great on skin</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, this body wash makes me feel nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, light, fresh, clean, scent.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this, every person who smelled it and used it, loved it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps you clean!</li>
            <li> Feel clean, no filmy feeling upon rinsing off!</li>
            <li> Great for young children as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I am happy when I find a body wash that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> I love the ivory original scent body wash.  </li>
            <li> We thought it would rinse easily from the skin and have simpler ingredients.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working ok, smells nice and is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t easily wash off the \\&quot;scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I like it better than the bar plus make bathroom easier to clean</li>
            <li> I liked the old formula mostly because it did not fall into the girly-flower perfume trap that most big-bottle body washes are in.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and it gives you a fresh clean feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using the original formula for years and liked it very much because I do not like a strong scent on my body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to buy in bulk, but it sure is nice knowing</li>
            <li> This body wash is so gentle and has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell like the fragrance free soap.  </li>
            <li> price and qty can not be beaten along with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Its light and airy.</li>
            <li> It is as good as the Ivory soap bars that I used for years but not nearly as messy.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> the original Ivory scent.</li>
            <li> We tried this as an alternative to spending $15 for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap, because it said \\&quot;clean wash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just want to smell clean.</li>
            <li> i lvoe the scent its fresh and clean and rinses away easily</li>
            <li> and you feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> I smells clean, but not perfumy.</li>
            <li> It has a clean, shampoo like smell.  </li>
            <li> It just smells like what a body wash should smell like, not perfume-y or fruity, but just a person who smells clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will fall off your hand before you can even use it to clean yourself because it is so runny.  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice scent and it is nice and thick so</li>
            <li> It has a light, fresh smell, without that overpowering perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> Ivory had a real winner with this one and most people didn&#x27;t even recognize it.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Compared to the cost at the store 8 months ago this was a good buy and lasted 8 months (on last bottle now).  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I can&#x27;t find this in local stores.</li>
            <li> It still gets the job done for a good price, but I definitely preferred the scent before reformulation.</li>
            <li> It is not bad.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean in shower.</li>
            <li> Super product, super value.</li>
            <li> the 6-pack was a terrific find and the pricing is exceptional.</li>
            <li> Your marketing people have betrayed you and you have lost a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I use the soap everyday and its light smells great and I will buy another case when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love the smell -- lightly floral, clean, and simple.</li>
            <li> Bath and Body Works body washes are much better and a small drop would provide a good lather.  </li>
            <li> I use this as an all around shower soap and it never fails to clean even the muddiest child</li>
            <li> Like bathing in the froth of angel wings or the laugh of a child.  </li>
            <li> Fresh is the word I would describe it as.</li>
            <li> Just ordered the \\&quot;Pack of Six\\&quot; 24 oz bottles, and will continue pouring the soap into the less-slippery white bottle from the original (and better)</li>
            <li> Gentle, clean smell and can use with confidence.  </li>
            <li> This Ivory body wash gives me a clean feeling without too much fragrance.</li>
            <li> For the last 66 years I have been an ivory baby ;) and love the original scent product.</li>
            <li> It is a highly perfumed body wash that in no way reminds me of original Ivory -</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and these big bottles are so economical.</li>
            <li> It is also very very fragrant.  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount of suds, just the right amount of a gentle fragrance...</li>
            <li> Very gentle on sensitive skin, and lightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Natural, gentle, nice soft Ivory scent, lots of bubbles  </li>
            <li> The first generation was so</li>
            <li> This soap is never on the shelf on a consistent basis in my area.  </li>
            <li> I got my first Ivory shower gel from a friend a year ago</li>
            <li> I really hope they dont stop making it!</li>
            <li> It has definitely been good for my dog&#x27;s skin condition as it is not dry and flaky like before</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural fragrance and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Nothing more, nothing fancy, just pure, simple cleanness.</li>
            <li> I love this and have been using it since I was pregnant and couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of any other body wash or soap.</li>
            <li> this new Simple Clean stuff is a loser compared to the original.</li>
            <li> Simply Ivory an easy five stars, but</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find the large bottles at any stores around me.  </li>
            <li> Just a pure bottle of hope and salvation.  </li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t perfumed.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a real bargain.</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ivory soap my whole life (I just turned 55)</li>
            <li> Fast efficient - will buy again.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really wash;</li>
            <li> The smell on this is very overpowering.</li>
            <li> It takes too much of the Ivory body wash to get a lather.  </li>
            <li> ....another product I use daily that is not always available in stores...I buy in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; so I never run out...</li>
            <li> I tend to use too much as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very allergic to perfumes</li>
            <li> photo on this item page is now accurate, it no longer shows the white bottle from the original Simply Ivory.</li>
            <li> Go back to the original formula and I will return to,using your product.</li>
            <li> Simply Ivory Original Scent Body Wash, 24-Ounce Bottles</li>
            <li> Only Ivory can get you this clean.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Simple Clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also washes off quite easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; after use, but it neither makes me feel dry.</li>
            <li> Growing up, Ivory soap was the gold standard among moms who wanted to get their kids clean.</li>
            <li> Smelled simple and clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is so fresh and clean without being overpowering like some other body wash brands.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe this product is not more popular</li>
            <li> Such a fresh scent and it gently stays with you for the day.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this here because my local store (the only one I could find this at) stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you like the clean scent of Ivory and want a body soap that goes a long way then this is the soap for you.  </li>
            <li> Lots of soft, gentle lather.</li>
            <li> We normally use a bath/shower product that costs 3 times the price of i bottle of Ivory Body Wash.  </li>
            <li> It cleans my body well for a shower everyday, and the bottle lasts for many showers.</li>
            <li> I loved the original Simply Ivory Body Wash, it smelled so fresh and was reasonably priced compared to others out there, and had hoped to stock up on it as it was beginning to get \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; in the usual shopping spots.</li>
            <li> I used the original because it had a minimal odor.</li>
            <li> Just wondering if your marketing people have ever heard of New Coke?</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve decided to give this new version of Ivory Body Wash another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the NEW FORMULA, not the pre-2015 product.</li>
            <li> I received six 21-oz bottles of the new (un)improved stuff.</li>
            <li> The newly designed bottle is still way too slippery when wet, so I&#x27;m using the original bottle because it&#x27;s easier to handle in the shower and pouring the soap from the new bottle to the old one!</li>
            <li> Ivory Simple Clean Body Wash is obviously not manufactured in the U.S. and P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t want you to know where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different body washes...cheap ones from the drugstore, expensive ones from the natural foods store, and so many in between the two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several body washes on the market and Ivory is simply the best body wash for sensitive skin, so if you have sensitive skin like myself, you will not go wrong with this product .</li>
            <li> My only concern is how long will it continue to be available?</li>
            <li> I really love Simple Clean Ivory scent that has been used until the product got &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; in approximately the beginning of 2015.</li>
            <li> Simply stated Ivory is the only thing that I can use on my super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for Ivory now at this point, but whoever it is, please revert back to the old formula!</li>
            <li> It moistens my skin and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying to find the old stuff online</li>
            <li> If I cannot find the old formula online I will cease using Ivory body wash completely and you will i have lost a customer forever.</li>
            <li> I nearly dropped it on my toe, so had to hold onto it with both hands.</li>
            <li> Would have given the old</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;re looking for the old scent/bottle.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find Ivory Body Wash on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This smells and cleans like the Ivory of old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and a smaller bottle of this is $6.00 at the corner drug store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awfully good (or bad for that matter), but nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a way to cut down on our trips to the local unnamed super store.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause my back to break out, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch.</li>
            <li> this is the only baody wash that does not break out my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Barely, but does.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it might have happened in shipping, but there were no loose pieces in the box.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this stuff in stores, but luckily I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> it leaves a clean but subtle scent and not overpowering like some bodywash.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or tight and the scent is not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> So as big as the container is; it&#x27;s not gonna last very long.</li>
            <li> With Subscribe and Save, the bottles are less expensive than any brick and mortar store I can go to, and I automatically get more of it when I run low.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked this little gem up and tried it.  </li>
            <li> My family and I have used Ivory for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, mildly sensitive skin and these are one of the few body washes that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> New and improved, my butt. :\</li>
            <li> I tried couple other brands in between but always went back to Dove.  </li>
            <li> This body wash lasts a very long time as well.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit too dry for dry skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Do not try to tell us there is only a  slight change in the smell.</li>
            <li> This is roughly half the cost and is a giant 24-ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that nice clean scent is gone and has been replaced with a very unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> As a large family, we go through a ton of body wash, especially since we have a kid with sensitive skin who reacts badly to inexpensive bars of soap.  </li>
            <li> Worse yet, it is made of very slippery plastic and is really hard to hold onto in the shower all wet and soapy, especially in these big bottles.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I should have expected that.</li>
            <li> Shop carefully.</li>
            <li> No thanks, folks.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have to have assistance with showering and such.  </li>
            <li> This will turn out to be a total waste.</li>
            <li> use this by our sinks for hand washing.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that have more of a perfumey scent than this product does, but it didn&#x27;t make me react nearly as badly as this product.  </li>
            <li> I was also tired of making trips to a particular store just for this soap.</li>
            <li> We even use it at the sinks around our house for hand soap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like every other slimy body wash on the shelf that takes forever to rinse to me.  </li>
            <li> its got the cleanest scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> use a washcloth)compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that most stores to sell this product anymore.</li>
            <li> and he is extremely picky with scented stuff).</li>
            <li> The new stuff is terrible and has a strong scent</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding it locally, so</li>
            <li> This batch of Ivory Body Wash arrived and I was disappointed to find that its packaging is new, a totally different bottle than the one pictured here, plus the scent and consistency of the soap is a little bit different too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Original Scent&amp;#34; is a slight misnomer - there is a difference, although slight.  </li>
            <li> The texture of this product is oddly runny and watery.  </li>
            <li> One less thing to get at the store</li>
            <li> Current prices on amazon are NOT a good value compared to box store competitors, though.  </li>
            <li> just a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve to 2 little ones at home</li>
            <li> And the Aloe version of this body wash was still a little too &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scented for my tastes.</li>
            <li> However, after a few uses, I realized it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> not as thick as I would like, somewhat runnier than expected.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that there is a slight smell to it but its not overwhelming like alot of those flowery scents.</li>
            <li> It comes in a package of 6 bottles &amp; cheaper than my usual bodywash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had a few skin tags give up and fall off!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to handle and complicates your shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone especially the ones that are stuck on one brand and are afraid to change.  </li>
            <li> Brand name body wash is expensive, and that is typically all the grocery store carries.  </li>
            <li> It leaves you feeling clean--not like it leaves a layer of stuff behind.</li>
            <li> Not happy about the shipping condition.  </li>
            <li> but they do have them may I am getting confused with dove.</li>
            <li> The new formula of the Ivory body wash is terrible.</li>
            <li> This new bottle is simply awful!</li>
            <li> I wrote P&amp;G to tell them that the new formula smells terrible, and I got a response saying they sold Ivory to Unilever.</li>
            <li> For one thing, it&#x27;s just plain ugly.</li>
            <li> Nothing complicated, no shame, no afterthought.  </li>
            <li> i used to use expensive body washes from victoria secret/ bath and body</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> it stinks.</li>
            <li> That was another example of a company making a stupid decision to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; a product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This body wash is so gentle and has a nice fragrance.  I have used this product for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Only Ivory can get you this clean.  Nice size, nice scent.  Great quality package.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised</li>
            <li> This was really a great bargain for a quality product like Ivory.  My family and I have used Ivory for as long as I can remember.  The smell is so fresh and clean without being overpowering like some other body wash brands.  This was definitely a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, mildly sensitive skin and these are one of the few body washes that I can use that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. I love the smell -- lightly floral, clean, and simple. I heard it can be drying for some people but I&#x27;ve had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> This body wash is excellent. It has a light, fresh smell, without that overpowering perfumy smell. It lathers nicely in a wash cloth or a loofah, and leaves skin feeling smooth. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn&#x27;t cause my back to break out, and doesn&#x27;t make me itch. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Very nice find!  We normally use a bath/shower product that costs 3 times the price of i bottle of Ivory Body Wash.  It is all you would expect from Ivory.  Natural, gentle, nice soft Ivory scent, lots of bubbles  AND at an incredible price.  Buy the pack of six.  Great to have on hand.  Also very nice for practical gift giving.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find the large bottles at any stores around me.  Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.  Thanks for offering this at a great price.  It leaves you feeling clean--not like it leaves a layer of stuff behind.</li>
            <li> Super product, super value. Non-irritating and it won&#x27;t dry your skin out. Lots of soft, gentle lather. Beautiful, light, fresh, clean, scent. We even use it at the sinks around our house for hand soap! It&#x27;s always a shame when great value, quality products are phased out. Ivory had a real winner with this one and most people didn&#x27;t even recognize it. Make sure to stock up and order it through the Subscribe and Save option on Amazon. Best price available and shipping is free! My only concern is how long will it continue to be available?</li>
            <li> We tried this as an alternative to spending $15 for Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soap, because it said \\&quot;clean wash\\&quot;. We thought it would rinse easily from the skin and have simpler ingredients. It&#x27;s like every other slimy body wash on the shelf that takes forever to rinse to me.  Now we just leave it out for guests.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this body wash. i can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so thankfully amazon has it! thank you thank you thank you! its got the cleanest scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other one&#x27;s i have tried. its moisturizing as well. i can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> Like bathing in the froth of angel wings or the laugh of a child.  Happy, clean, and fresh.  Nothing complicated, no shame, no afterthought.  Just a pure bottle of hope and salvation.  Who wouldn&#x27;t want to wash their sins away in this kind of bubbly euphoria?</li>
            <li> This body wash was recommended to me by my veterinarian, for my dog&#x27;s skin allergy.  I could not find it at Wal Mart, so decided to order from Amazon. It comes in a package of 6 bottles &amp; cheaper than my usual bodywash so my family uses it now as well as shampooing the dog.  It moistens my skin and leaves it soft.  I like that it leaves a clean but subtle scent and not overpowering like some bodywash.  It has definitely been good for my dog&#x27;s skin condition as it is not dry and flaky like before and he doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.  I will continue using this product and happy that it was recommended to me.  It is as good as the Ivory soap bars that I used for years but not nearly as messy.</li>
            <li> Found this 24oz container at Freddy&#x27;s for about $4.&lt;br /&gt;Well, you definitely  get what you pay for. With this body wash I found that I have to use A LOT to get a good lather(I use a washcloth)compared to other brands. So as big as the container is; it&#x27;s not gonna last very long. Plus, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ivory soap my whole life (I just turned 55) and when I found this Ivory body wash I just had to try it. It&#x27;s as wonderful as the Ivory that saw me through my earliest years and so easy to apply! Had a hard time finding it locally, so the 6-pack was a terrific find and the pricing is exceptional.</li>
            <li> For the last 66 years I have been an ivory baby ;) and love the original scent product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Not happy about the shipping condition.  4 of the containers had cracked lids.  I thought maybe it might have happened in shipping, but there were no loose pieces in the box.  There was leakage from 2 of the bottles though.  I hope 6 bottles hold me over for awhile since the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; has now been changed.</li>
            <li> Wanted pump container in smaller size......my mistake when ordering....</li>
            <li> My back started getting pimples after I started using this body wash.  I&#x27;m Asian and never had pimples on my back before.  So after using about a quarter of it, I switched to another body wash and the acne went away.  Of course the unused portion ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different body washes...cheap ones from the drugstore, expensive ones from the natural foods store, and so many in between the two.  I was so pleasantly surprised when I picked this little gem up and tried it.  It is - far and away - the best body wash I&#x27;ve found.  Just the right amount of suds, just the right amount of a gentle fragrance...and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin either.  I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nothing more but a comment on the smell -  I thought it would smell like the bar soap Ivory, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I even smelled it before bought it.  However, after a few uses, I realized it doesn&#x27;t.  To me, and I&#x27;m probably in the minority on this, but it smells a teeny bit like body odor!</li>
            <li> If you like the clean scent of Ivory and want a body soap that goes a long way then this is the soap for you.  It has a very nice scent and it is nice and thick so just a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Fast efficient - will buy again.  Have this in the shower as well by the sink -  cheaper than it is in the stores</li>
            <li> After reading the bottle I assumed Ivory was all natural minus dies and perfumes but they do have them may I am getting confused with dove. But I was dissapointed in that</li>
            <li> The new formula of the Ivory body wash is terrible. I have been using the original formula for years and liked it very much because I do not like a strong scent on my body wash. The new stuff is terrible and has a strong scent and I will not be using it anymore. I will be trying to find the old stuff online and if I do that&#x27;s what I will use from here on out. I don&#x27;t know why you feel you had to change your product what it was doing so well. If I cannot find the old formula online I will cease using Ivory body wash completely and you will i have lost a customer forever. Why do companies feel They have to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on existing products when they are doing so well and they are absolutely perfect for that purpose. Your marketing people have betrayed you and you have lost a loyal customer. Do not try to tell us there is only a  slight change in the smell. I used the original because it had a minimal odor. I don&#x27; t want to smell like anything after showering. I just want to smell clean. Just wondering if your marketing people have ever heard of New Coke? That was another example of a company making a stupid decision to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; a product. Go back to the original formula and I will return to,using your product.</li>
            <li> This batch of Ivory Body Wash arrived and I was disappointed to find that its packaging is new, a totally different bottle than the one pictured here, plus the scent and consistency of the soap is a little bit different too. I loved the original Simply Ivory Body Wash, it smelled so fresh and was reasonably priced compared to others out there, and had hoped to stock up on it as it was beginning to get \\&quot;hard to find\\&quot; in the usual shopping spots. This new bottle is simply awful! For one thing, it&#x27;s just plain ugly. Worse yet, it is made of very slippery plastic and is really hard to hold onto in the shower all wet and soapy, especially in these big bottles. I nearly dropped it on my toe, so had to hold onto it with both hands. It&#x27;s hard to handle and complicates your shower. And the smell is off, not the same as before. Would have given the old Simply Ivory an easy five stars, but this new Simple Clean stuff is a loser compared to the original. Two stars might be too generous here, but the smell is still sort of similar so it is almost (but not quite) as nice and I have hopes their marketing dept. will maybe resolve these issues. The first generation was so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/29/12&lt;br /&gt;The photo on this item page is now accurate, it no longer shows the white bottle from the original Simply Ivory. Because of the updated image, I&#x27;m changing my rating up to four stars. The newly designed bottle is still way too slippery when wet, so I&#x27;m using the original bottle because it&#x27;s easier to handle in the shower and pouring the soap from the new bottle to the old one! Seems to be working ok, smells nice and is reasonably priced so I&#x27;ve decided to give this new version of Ivory Body Wash another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/14/12&lt;br /&gt;Giving this another try. Just ordered the \\&quot;Pack of Six\\&quot; 24 oz bottles, and will continue pouring the soap into the less-slippery white bottle from the original (and better) Simply Ivory.</li>
            <li> I really love Simple Clean Ivory scent that has been used until the product got &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; in approximately the beginning of 2015. Such a fresh scent and it gently stays with you for the day. At the time of my 6-pack purchase last week, I received the pre-2015 version (Yay!).</li>
            <li> i used to use expensive body washes from victoria secret/ bath and body and i have them in my shower but yet i use the ivory. i lvoe the scent its fresh and clean and rinses away easily and i have no problem getting a great lather with a bath poof. My bf LOVES this! he is actually dissapointed when something different shows up in the shower. so now i keep it stocked.</li>
            <li> This soap is never on the shelf on a consistent basis in my area.  Glad I found this on Amazon, so I&#x27;m set for a while.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit too dry for dry skin and I feel like it doesn&#x27;t really wash; but then it is IVORY and I should have expected that.</li>
            <li> I use the Ivory soap for shower soap.  It cleans my body well for a shower everyday, and the bottle lasts for many showers.</li>
            <li> Great product. The smell is not too overpowering and it helps moisturize the skin. They stop selling this locally . So I am glad I found that amazon carrys this.</li>
            <li> I love the ivory original scent body wash.  Simply stated Ivory is the only thing that I can use on my super sensitive skin.  It has a nice natural fragrance and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a simple soap without anti-bacteria properties.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is a simple as it gets and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came is a bigger container</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of 6 bottles without ever trying it before. I thought it was a good deal, and it was!! The soap smells great-- just clean. It works well for men and women because it is a neutral scent. I will buy more when I run out-- but it could be a while :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ivory bar soap for many years.  I was hoping this would just be the liquid version of the bars.  Unfortunately that nice clean scent is gone and has been replaced with a very unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the size of the bottles and the product itself.  I just wish that Ivory would have the product lather a bit more and smell more like the bars themselves............LOVE the smell of the ivory soap bars!</li>
            <li> The best product with bang for your buck!  I use this as an all around shower soap and it never fails to clean even the muddiest child</li>
            <li> This is the NEW FORMULA, not the pre-2015 product. I received six 21-oz bottles of the new (un)improved stuff. Don&#x27;t purchase this if you&#x27;re looking for the old scent/bottle. The picture and description don&#x27;t match what you ACTUALLY receive.</li>
            <li> To buy in bulk saves money$$$$ great priced product.</li>
            <li> I bought the six pack since I use this regularly.  I like the ivory wash as it&#x27;s not too fragrant.  Compared to the cost at the store 8 months ago this was a good buy and lasted 8 months (on last bottle now).  Current prices on amazon are NOT a good value compared to box store competitors, though.  Shop carefully.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Dove and have used it my entire life.  I tried couple other brands in between but always went back to Dove.  I got my first Ivory shower gel from a friend a year ago and I was in love.  The smell alone will make you fall in love.  it&#x27;s so clean and fresh and the shower gel does feel great on skin and you feel really clean.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone especially the ones that are stuck on one brand and are afraid to change.  I feel that I&#x27;m eligible to write a review on this product since I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and this is an awesome product! You will not regret buying it..</li>
            <li> I wrote P&amp;G to tell them that the new formula smells terrible, and I got a response saying they sold Ivory to Unilever. However, I can&#x27;t find any press coverage on this aside from rumors that were floating around about it last year. I don&#x27;t know who is responsible for Ivory now at this point, but whoever it is, please revert back to the old formula!</li>
            <li> Great smell! Keeps you clean!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and these big bottles are so economical. The light scent is pleasant and is appropriate for men as well as women. I smells clean, but not perfumy. Very gentle on sensitive skin, and lightly moisturizing. This is my favorite body soap for years.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have all of those fragrances. The body wash does not leave that residue like the bar soap. I found it at Family Dollars.</li>
            <li> I was expecting, essentially, Ivory bar soap in a liquid. The smell on this is very overpowering. No thanks, folks.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have to have assistance with showering and such.  The first time I bought this, every person who smelled it and used it, loved it.  These are replacements, so I don&#x27;t run out.  My aide went out and bought some for herself.  She has told her family (all guys) to keep their hands off.  That this was hers.</li>
            <li> I have used Ivory soap since  was a kid. The scent is a bit different but I like it. Family members have bumps on the sides of their arms and for whatever reason Ivory has always helped with keeping them to a minimum. Will continue to buy if the price remains low.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a way to cut down on our trips to the local unnamed super store.  As a large family, we go through a ton of body wash, especially since we have a kid with sensitive skin who reacts badly to inexpensive bars of soap.  Brand name body wash is expensive, and that is typically all the grocery store carries.  As a result, we would go to the super store to buy the in-store brand body wash which was typically about half the price of the comparable name brand.  I was pleasantly surprised to find Ivory Body Wash on Amazon.  With Subscribe and Save, the bottles are less expensive than any brick and mortar store I can go to, and I automatically get more of it when I run low.  Great product, great price, what else can I say?</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Simple Clean Simply Ivory Original Scent Body Wash, 24-Ounce Bottles \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;NOT the original Ivory scent. It is a highly perfumed body wash that in no way reminds me of original Ivory - it stinks. This will turn out to be a total waste. I wonder if anyone will accept it as a give away. My wife bought it and will not use it. Can&#x27;t easily wash off the \\&quot;scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I can&#x27;t find this in local stores. Smells fresh and clean in shower. But fragrance does not linger on.  Good for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Gentle, clean smell and can use with confidence.  Have put this in the shower stall and refilled hand dispensers.  Great for young children as well.</li>
            <li> I use the soap everyday and its light smells great and I will buy another case when it runs out.</li>
            <li> not as thick as I would like, somewhat runnier than expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin smooth.  I&#x27;ve even had a few skin tags give up and fall off!  I&#x27;m buying this in bulk.  Don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Ivory body wash from a different merchant.  It does not smell like the fragrance free soap.  It has a clean, shampoo like smell.  It is not bad.  I just prefer that it not be scented.  It takes too much of the Ivory body wash to get a lather.  Bath and Body Works body washes are much better and a small drop would provide a good lather.  I would rather purchase a ten pack of Ivory soap at Walmart than buy another bottle of Ivory body wash.  I think a ten pack of Ivory soap would last longer and it is around the same price.</li>
            <li> I have always used Dove body wash. One day I went to the store to by my Dove and they didn&#x27;t have any. I saw this Ivory product and smelled it, it smelled very refreshing. I fell in love with this product. The scent is amazing and it gives you a fresh clean feel. I am disappointed that most stores to sell this product anymore. I saw this on amazon and ordered a box of 6. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, this body wash makes me feel nice and clean. Nothing more, nothing fancy, just pure, simple cleanness. It doesn&#x27;t smell awfully good (or bad for that matter), but nice and subtle. It just smells like what a body wash should smell like, not perfume-y or fruity, but just a person who smells clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also washes off quite easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; after use, but it neither makes me feel dry. I feel this is the perfect body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!!!! I&#x27;ve tried several body washes on the market and Ivory is simply the best body wash for sensitive skin, so if you have sensitive skin like myself, you will not go wrong with this product .</li>
            <li> ....another product I use daily that is not always available in stores...I buy in &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; so I never run out...</li>
            <li> It a bit more scented than I would like but I like it better than the bar plus make bathroom easier to clean</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash. My skin is sensitive, so I am happy when I find a body wash that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. This Ivory body wash gives me a clean feeling without too much fragrance. The price is also great!</li>
            <li> use this by our sinks for hand washing.  everyone loves the scent and how well it works.  price and qty can not be beaten along with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Growing up, Ivory soap was the gold standard among moms who wanted to get their kids clean. This smells and cleans like the Ivory of old.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Original Scent&amp;#34; is a slight misnomer - there is a difference, although slight.  Still a great product, tho!</li>
            <li> this is the only baody wash that does not break out my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I live in NYC and a smaller bottle of this is $6.00 at the corner drug store. This is roughly half the cost and is a giant 24-ounce bottle. We keep the extras under the bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle is enough to last a month. I tend to use too much as well. It also says scented, but I don&#x27;t notice anything. It certainly isn&#x27;t perfumed.</li>
            <li> Ivory makes one of the best body washes that there is, it leaves the skin smooth since the body wash rinses off well, there is no residue, and it lathers very easily. I have also noticed that there is a slight smell to it but its not overwhelming like alot of those flowery scents. Its light and airy. This body wash lasts a very long time as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this here because my local store (the only one I could find this at) stopped carrying it. I was also tired of making trips to a particular store just for this soap. I love this and have been using it since I was pregnant and couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of any other body wash or soap. Doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry or tight and the scent is not strong or overwhelming. A little goes a long way so this will last a long time. I really hope they dont stop making it!</li>
            <li> I want to like this product, but the country of origin is purposefully unclear. The label only says, &amp;#34;Distributed by P&amp;G&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Imported for P&amp;G.&amp;#34; Soooo....Is it from Mexico? China? India? Where?? Why hide this information? Ivory Simple Clean Body Wash is obviously not manufactured in the U.S. and P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t want you to know where it&#x27;s from. This is a troubling trend in labeling and one I can&#x27;t support with my dollar, in good conscience. Neither should you.</li>
            <li> One would hope for a liquid verison of the bar.  One would be disapointed.  The texture of this product is oddly runny and watery.  It will fall off your hand before you can even use it to clean yourself because it is so runny.  It is also very very fragrant.  I&#x27;m very allergic to perfumes and I thought that I&#x27;d be ok with this since it&#x27;s Ivory and Ivory makes handsaop and bar soap that works well for me.  I was wrong.  By the time I get out of the shower my eyes are swollen, red and itchy.  It also agrevates my asthma.  I have used other products that have more of a perfumey scent than this product does, but it didn&#x27;t make me react nearly as badly as this product.  Also, since it is so runny, you end up wasting quite a bit as it runs off your hand or lufa before you can use it.  I gave it two starts becauses, inspite of everything, it does function as a body wash.  Barely, but does.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this stuff in stores, but luckily I found it on amazon. I&#x27;m not usually one to buy in bulk, but it sure is nice knowing you have plenty of this body wash on hand. One less thing to get at the store and I am all for that these days, I&#x27;ve to 2 little ones at home so going to the store is not a walk in the park for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything about this body wash: the scent, it is not too girly (even my husband loves this stuff and he is extremely picky with scented stuff). Fresh is the word I would describe it as. It is not too greasy like a lot of body washes out there, does not leave a residue yet it Is still moisturizing. Just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this product is not more popular, I can&#x27;t imagine buying another body wash.</li>
            <li> Meh. It still gets the job done for a good price, but I definitely preferred the scent before reformulation. Smelled simple and clean. I liked the old formula mostly because it did not fall into the girly-flower perfume trap that most big-bottle body washes are in. And the Aloe version of this body wash was still a little too &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; scented for my tastes. The REAL original formula was just right...until they dun goofed it up and brought it into Perfumeland. New and improved, my butt. :\</li>
            <li> great price, great quality and no-frills.</li>
            <li> Gender neutral fragrance! I have sensitive skin and this is wonderful! Feel clean, no filmy feeling upon rinsing off!</li>
