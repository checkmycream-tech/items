            <li>But seems great!</li>

            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>But given that I got it to hydrate my skin, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been very effective at that and without any adverse effects at all.</li>
            <li>very nice good price  and</li>
            <li>This is a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I have always done well with Neutrogena products and their face wash is also a good product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>so glad I made this mistake!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this cleanser, but was pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice face wash</li>
            <li>Thought this was the foaming kind, not the creamy kind.</li>
            <li>Use a wash rag with warm water to remove face &amp; eye make-up.</li>
            <li>Nice product&lt;</li>
            <li>Beautiful just right</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, with rosacia and seb derm, and this is a wonderful cleanser for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful cleanser if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok although I prefer something more on the creamy foamy kind.  </li>
            <li>Great price, large bottle.</li>
            <li>purchased for a gift - giftee was pleased</li>
            <li>Stick with the regular version (which is a wonderful product)</li>
            <li>I will keep using it and see if it makes my many skin problems go away for awhile.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li>Using makeup wipes afterwards seems to take care of the left over residue, but in a perfect world, the cleanser would have gotten rid of that too.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Better than anything your dermatologist will prescribe for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>skin feels better</li>
            <li>My teenagers use it too and love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Combined with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture lotion it is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but wish it lathered more.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much more balanced.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use this in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have makeup to wash off, and it provides a nice, clean, and not stripped-dry surface for sunscreen and makeup application.  </li>
            <li>It is barely fragranced with a mild pleasant scent, gets your face clean without stripping, removes make-up (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup) rinses clean, and your skin feels just perfect.</li>
            <li>Good things first</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm &amp; then cool water.</li>
            <li>If you get dry skin this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is scent free and very light.  </li>
            <li>Good, gentle and perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Oily skin has been a huge problem for me for so many years.</li>
            <li>This is a fragrance free cleanser that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>good, gentle face wash</li>
            <li>I will stick to the foaming formula or the original face bar, which I found is even better.</li>
            <li>Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Clean refreshing feeling afterwards and not to sudsy.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena cleansers because my face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>I use a more natural product for every day use because of my sensitive skin, but on the days I wear makeup, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It foams nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li>This is a good pre- cleanser for makeup, and then followed with foaming cleansing for oily combo or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, works good, has made a positive difference in my face already, need I say more?</li>
            <li>No other products were successful.</li>
            <li>I have seen huge improvements.</li>
            <li>and it is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Seems like a paraben free alternative to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so happy that i finally found one that works.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Nice gentle creamy cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea (I&#x27;m 31) and this is a really gentle, effective product.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but I wish it was better at creating more lather.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the more gentle face wash over the original, so I&#x27;m glad to have accidentally purchased it.</li>
            <li>that tells you how much I like using this product!!!</li>
            <li>So, this one has a bigger container and pump - nice!</li>
            <li>This is the first cleanser that has worked for me since my skin started getting more sensitive/irritable about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>so I have begun to use it for them as well which has helped significantly.</li>
            <li>This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the price is so reasonable!</li>
            <li>I wondered how a soapless wash will clean my face, but it leaves my skin feeling and looking so clean.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather or clean the skin.  </li>
            <li>b/c this product doesn&#x27;t clean the skin, it does nothing.  </li>
            <li>so I have to wash my face 4 times to get my face clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old and have tried many, many &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up when I use it, making my face feel not as clean.</li>
            <li>Will make sure to order the foaming kind next time.</li>
            <li>Clean and Pliable to start the day.  </li>
            <li>Super light fragrance; almost none.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like it kept my skin clean and reduced any acne I had.</li>
            <li>Face feels clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin feeling soft afterwords which is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>Such a shame as I loved how it helped my seb dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I REALLY REGRET BUYING IT, AND ON TOP OF IT A 2 PACK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>It did go away quickly this time.</li>
            <li>I always followup with a cotton pad with a mild aloe astringent and lots of makeup was on the pads.</li>
            <li>I have mild eczema on my hands</li>
            <li>Extremely gentle and easy on my sesnsitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>I purchase this to alternate between my AHA Cleanser, Great for sensitive skin types !  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my skin, no stinging and leaves it feeling soft-not dried out.  </li>
            <li>It has healthy ingredients and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how this product left my skin - smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but it comes in a 5oz tube that was lasting me about a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple yet effective.</li>
            <li>Young or Older persons will love this !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the other version of this Neurtrogena cleanser (Ultra Gentle - but not the Hydrating version) and that worked great.</li>
            <li>After years of trying to find the right face wash</li>
            <li>This may cause you to use more then necessary (as I did) and run out quickly.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again as it is kind to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Not drying and super gentle.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not have a scent.</li>
            <li>It wont remove more than light makeup (I use an oil cleanser to remove mine), but I really think this is worth a try if other cleansers leave your skin stripped of moisture or irritated.</li>
            <li>This is the best face cleanser for my face for these dry, dry New England winters.</li>
            <li>Cleanser is thorough, moisturizes pretty well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer the regular version as opposed to the ultra gentle, which is a creamier formula, but this one is nice and does feel extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how soft, smooth and supple my skin could be after washing.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of trying it one more time but keeping it away from my nose if possible.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more moisture on my face and it eliminated the tiny bumps I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It did not remove make up, it left a creamy film on my skin on top of my make-up that did not wash off.</li>
            <li>2 weeks later though, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It does not throughly clean make up, or for that matter, dirt completely off your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles thinking I would surely love it or at least still use it up even if I didn&#x27;t love it, but both are still sitting in the bottom of the bathroom cabinet.  </li>
            <li>With this cleanser, there is the added benefit of it being more gentle on the skin than what I have used prior.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the Neutrogena version of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser</li>
            <li>The soap at work sucked moisture out of my already dry skin and no amount of lotion seemed to be able to catch up to the damage.</li>
            <li>This removes the surface dirt/oil but leaves the skin feeling smooth, not dry.</li>
            <li>I got it for a good price with Subscribe and Save also, so as long as the price remains low, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to cleanse the face.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 16 fl oz.]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and removes all my makeup.</li>
            <li>Because it really is a hydrating cleanser</li>
            <li>Even the Neutragena ultra gentle foaming cleanser did that,</li>
            <li>Scrubbing defeats the point of gentle.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser tends to give me breakouts, so I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>yes, even from gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this hydrating gentle cleanser for over three months</li>
            <li>It is gentle but removes the makeup</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to control how much comes out.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and very allergy-prone.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really comment on how this cleanser works for removing makeup, because I don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
            <li>This cleanser claims to be Ultra Gentle</li>
            <li>This is the only cleanser I have found that leaves my face feeling moist and comfortable after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is creamy &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li>Rub gently on your face, &amp; eyelids too.</li>
            <li>The foaming formula is gentle as well, but dries my skin out too much</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I think I use a bit too much because there&#x27;s no lather.</li>
            <li>My tween daughter also began to use this on her face and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I have to take an additional step to strip off dirt from my face with a toner, which is what I really want to avoid doing.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin and removes most of my makeup (it removes everything but my waterproof eyeliner, but that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
            <li>My skin tends to dry out easily which causes excess oil production which can lead to breakouts for me.</li>
            <li>bought this at the grocery store and wasnt sure how I felt about it the first few days.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, mature skin and had hoped to love this product since it is Ultra Gentle and made by Neutrogena, but not so much.  </li>
            <li>Not great for removing makeup, but combined with my clarisonic pro, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This is also a clear formula (I prefer products that are clear, not cloudy, pearly, and colored) and it has NO parabens!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if your skin is hyper sensitive because this cleanser really leaves your face feeling clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser takes off all makeup doesn&#x27;t strip my skin or makes it tight feeling.</li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this.</li>
            <li>Gentle, but cleans off makeup and dirt, leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that leaves my face really dry if I use too much of any sort of aftershave, cleanser or shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li>This is one of the first cleansers that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face bright red and feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin feeling very clean and refreshed without all the harsh chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>So I used to have super dry cheeks</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle facial product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very soft now.</li>
            <li>This was gentle and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but didn&#x27;t clean well enough or remove my makeup.</li>
            <li>I started developing rosacea trouble about a year ago and began looking for a very skin friendly cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ridiculous number of face washes, and was using Basis cleaner clean and loved it except it came in a tube, a small tube, and you can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate that it comes with 12 full ounces instead of just a little tube.</li>
            <li>, I got kind of tired of the strong smell and slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and this soap is gentle enough for it.</li>
            <li>and I spend a little extra time on my nose since it tends to be more oily at the end of the day than the rest of my</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even commented on how clear my face has gotten, he is even thinking of trying it out.</li>
            <li>As it clearly says on the label &amp;#34;creamy formula&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and has no irritation.</li>
            <li>My skin is SO sensitive and it really is extra gentle.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a skin cleanser for problematic, sensitive skin that is prone to flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>It has no heavy fragrance and seems to glide over your face.  </li>
            <li>I was using the same neutrogena gentle face wash but the foaming one and accidentally bought this one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to products that claim to be for sensitive skin before.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and simple.  </li>
            <li>(Yes, gentle enough for around eyes!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every sensitive skin product on the market, including Cetaphil and a sensitive skin formula from Arbonne and they all make make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li>I like this facewash, keeps my face soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Definitly washes face well not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Product feels soft almost like nothing.</li>
            <li>I switched to this from a harsher cleanser b/c I am acne prone and thought a more gentle cleanser would be good, and after a week I broke out terribly.</li>
            <li>It rinses off in a snap and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of a film behind.</li>
            <li>and it really seems kinder than the Ponds I usually use…nowhere near as strong acting.</li>
            <li>I thought that skin couldn&#x27;t be clean without feeling tight and squeeky.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cleansers for years and spent ridiculous amounts of money trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li>I usually need a few good squirts to cover my face probably because they don&#x27;t put sodium lauryl sulfate in it to foam up.  </li>
            <li>Really helped with sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very comforting and moisturizing on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans deep but is gentle and no soapy residue that is difficult to get off with a warm wash rag.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>It has a consistency that is kind of a cross between a gel and a cream, and feels thin at first when you aply it to a wet face.</li>
            <li>I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone with even a patch of dry skin or for anyone that wants to use this as a make up remover.</li>
            <li>(like so dry it was flaky) and a really oily nose and chin.</li>
            <li>I tried all the expensive brands (some 100+ per bottle) and this one really does the most for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this the last two months, since I came back from NYC, and it&#x27;s really helped restore moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients list is limited to only what is essential to gently clean the skin without drying it out, unlike other cleansers that have strong fragrances or harsh soaps and yet still claim to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This was my first and last time buying this product because it went straight to the trash after using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li>and i barely breakout</li>
            <li>I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed rosacea in the last couple of years on my cheeks and eyes.</li>
            <li>MAYBE USED FOR PRIVATE SENSITIVE  BODY AREAS</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, sensitive skin, adult acne, etc.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser a week ago after accidentally buying [[ASIN:B0081E6X1W Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser, 12 Ounce]] which was NOT gentle on my skin at all since it had fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but I bought this because my skin tends to dry out during the winter and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t over drying and removed make up.</li>
            <li>Gentle and helps slow down face from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>My skin has calmed down a lot since using it, and it is very non-drying in wintertime.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin to drying cleansers and this works well without making my face too dry.</li>
            <li>After using a big name competitor&#x27;s face wash and suffering from dry skin from habitual use to this product my skin remained clear yet hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome &amp; Systemic Lupus and thus I also have very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a great creamy texture, similar to that of cold cream (but a little thinner), and my face feels moisturized</li>

            <li> But seems great!</li>
            <li> In fact, I read that Neutragena&#x27;s moisturizers are the best in smoothing wrinkles, even though it is not advertised.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the best!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!</li>

            <li> The texture of this product is very nice.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> But given that I got it to hydrate my skin, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been very effective at that and without any adverse effects at all.</li>
            <li> very nice good price  and</li>
            <li> This is a good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I have always done well with Neutrogena products and their face wash is also a good product.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> so glad I made this mistake!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this cleanser, but was pleasantly suprised.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash</li>
            <li> Thought this was the foaming kind, not the creamy kind.</li>
            <li> Use a wash rag with warm water to remove face &amp; eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Nice product&lt;</li>
            <li> Beautiful just right</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with rosacia and seb derm, and this is a wonderful cleanser for me.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok although I prefer something more on the creamy foamy kind.  </li>
            <li> Great price, large bottle.</li>
            <li> purchased for a gift - giftee was pleased</li>
            <li> Stick with the regular version (which is a wonderful product)</li>
            <li> I will keep using it and see if it makes my many skin problems go away for awhile.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> Using makeup wipes afterwards seems to take care of the left over residue, but in a perfect world, the cleanser would have gotten rid of that too.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Better than anything your dermatologist will prescribe for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> skin feels better</li>
            <li> My teenagers use it too and love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Combined with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture lotion it is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> but wish it lathered more.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much more balanced.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have makeup to wash off, and it provides a nice, clean, and not stripped-dry surface for sunscreen and makeup application.  </li>
            <li> It is barely fragranced with a mild pleasant scent, gets your face clean without stripping, removes make-up (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup) rinses clean, and your skin feels just perfect.</li>
            <li> Good things first</li>
            <li> Rinse with warm &amp; then cool water.</li>
            <li> If you get dry skin this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is scent free and very light.  </li>
            <li> Good, gentle and perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Oily skin has been a huge problem for me for so many years.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance free cleanser that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> good, gentle face wash</li>
            <li> I will stick to the foaming formula or the original face bar, which I found is even better.</li>
            <li> Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Clean refreshing feeling afterwards and not to sudsy.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena cleansers because my face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> I use a more natural product for every day use because of my sensitive skin, but on the days I wear makeup, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It foams nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I use it.</li>
            <li> This is a good pre- cleanser for makeup, and then followed with foaming cleansing for oily combo or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, works good, has made a positive difference in my face already, need I say more?</li>
            <li> No other products were successful.</li>
            <li> I have seen huge improvements.</li>
            <li> and it is truly fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Seems like a paraben free alternative to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy that i finally found one that works.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle creamy cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea (I&#x27;m 31) and this is a really gentle, effective product.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but I wish it was better at creating more lather.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the more gentle face wash over the original, so I&#x27;m glad to have accidentally purchased it.</li>
            <li> that tells you how much I like using this product!!!</li>
            <li> So, this one has a bigger container and pump - nice!</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser that has worked for me since my skin started getting more sensitive/irritable about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> so I have begun to use it for them as well which has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the price is so reasonable!</li>
            <li> I wondered how a soapless wash will clean my face, but it leaves my skin feeling and looking so clean.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather or clean the skin.  </li>
            <li> b/c this product doesn&#x27;t clean the skin, it does nothing.  </li>
            <li> so I have to wash my face 4 times to get my face clean.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and have tried many, many &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up when I use it, making my face feel not as clean.</li>
            <li> Will make sure to order the foaming kind next time.</li>
            <li> Clean and Pliable to start the day.  </li>
            <li> Super light fragrance; almost none.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it kept my skin clean and reduced any acne I had.</li>
            <li> Face feels clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin feeling soft afterwords which is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> Such a shame as I loved how it helped my seb dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I REALLY REGRET BUYING IT, AND ON TOP OF IT A 2 PACK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> It did go away quickly this time.</li>
            <li> I always followup with a cotton pad with a mild aloe astringent and lots of makeup was on the pads.</li>
            <li> I have mild eczema on my hands</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle and easy on my sesnsitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> I purchase this to alternate between my AHA Cleanser, Great for sensitive skin types !  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning my skin, no stinging and leaves it feeling soft-not dried out.  </li>
            <li> It has healthy ingredients and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how this product left my skin - smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but it comes in a 5oz tube that was lasting me about a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple yet effective.</li>
            <li> Young or Older persons will love this !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the other version of this Neurtrogena cleanser (Ultra Gentle - but not the Hydrating version) and that worked great.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to find the right face wash</li>
            <li> This may cause you to use more then necessary (as I did) and run out quickly.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again as it is kind to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Not drying and super gentle.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not have a scent.</li>
            <li> It wont remove more than light makeup (I use an oil cleanser to remove mine), but I really think this is worth a try if other cleansers leave your skin stripped of moisture or irritated.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser for my face for these dry, dry New England winters.</li>
            <li> Cleanser is thorough, moisturizes pretty well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the regular version as opposed to the ultra gentle, which is a creamier formula, but this one is nice and does feel extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how soft, smooth and supple my skin could be after washing.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of trying it one more time but keeping it away from my nose if possible.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more moisture on my face and it eliminated the tiny bumps I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It did not remove make up, it left a creamy film on my skin on top of my make-up that did not wash off.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks later though, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It does not throughly clean make up, or for that matter, dirt completely off your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles thinking I would surely love it or at least still use it up even if I didn&#x27;t love it, but both are still sitting in the bottom of the bathroom cabinet.  </li>
            <li> With this cleanser, there is the added benefit of it being more gentle on the skin than what I have used prior.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the Neutrogena version of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser</li>
            <li> The soap at work sucked moisture out of my already dry skin and no amount of lotion seemed to be able to catch up to the damage.</li>
            <li> This removes the surface dirt/oil but leaves the skin feeling smooth, not dry.</li>
            <li> I got it for a good price with Subscribe and Save also, so as long as the price remains low, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to cleanse the face.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 16 fl oz.]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and removes all my makeup.</li>
            <li> Because it really is a hydrating cleanser</li>
            <li> Even the Neutragena ultra gentle foaming cleanser did that,</li>
            <li> Scrubbing defeats the point of gentle.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser tends to give me breakouts, so I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> yes, even from gentle cleansers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this hydrating gentle cleanser for over three months</li>
            <li> It is gentle but removes the makeup</li>
            <li> It makes it much easier to control how much comes out.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and very allergy-prone.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on how this cleanser works for removing makeup, because I don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
            <li> This cleanser claims to be Ultra Gentle</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I have found that leaves my face feeling moist and comfortable after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser is creamy &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li> Rub gently on your face, &amp; eyelids too.</li>
            <li> The foaming formula is gentle as well, but dries my skin out too much</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I think I use a bit too much because there&#x27;s no lather.</li>
            <li> My tween daughter also began to use this on her face and she really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I have to take an additional step to strip off dirt from my face with a toner, which is what I really want to avoid doing.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin and removes most of my makeup (it removes everything but my waterproof eyeliner, but that&#x27;s to be expected).</li>
            <li> My skin tends to dry out easily which causes excess oil production which can lead to breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> bought this at the grocery store and wasnt sure how I felt about it the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, mature skin and had hoped to love this product since it is Ultra Gentle and made by Neutrogena, but not so much.  </li>
            <li> Not great for removing makeup, but combined with my clarisonic pro, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is also a clear formula (I prefer products that are clear, not cloudy, pearly, and colored) and it has NO parabens!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if your skin is hyper sensitive because this cleanser really leaves your face feeling clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser takes off all makeup doesn&#x27;t strip my skin or makes it tight feeling.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but cleans off makeup and dirt, leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that leaves my face really dry if I use too much of any sort of aftershave, cleanser or shaving cream on my face.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first cleansers that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face bright red and feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin feeling very clean and refreshed without all the harsh chemicals and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> So I used to have super dry cheeks</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle facial product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very soft now.</li>
            <li> This was gentle and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but didn&#x27;t clean well enough or remove my makeup.</li>
            <li> I started developing rosacea trouble about a year ago and began looking for a very skin friendly cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ridiculous number of face washes, and was using Basis cleaner clean and loved it except it came in a tube, a small tube, and you can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I also really appreciate that it comes with 12 full ounces instead of just a little tube.</li>
            <li> , I got kind of tired of the strong smell and slight burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and this soap is gentle enough for it.</li>
            <li> and I spend a little extra time on my nose since it tends to be more oily at the end of the day than the rest of my</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even commented on how clear my face has gotten, he is even thinking of trying it out.</li>
            <li> As it clearly says on the label &amp;#34;creamy formula&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and has no irritation.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO sensitive and it really is extra gentle.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a skin cleanser for problematic, sensitive skin that is prone to flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It has no heavy fragrance and seems to glide over your face.  </li>
            <li> I was using the same neutrogena gentle face wash but the foaming one and accidentally bought this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to products that claim to be for sensitive skin before.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and simple.  </li>
            <li> (Yes, gentle enough for around eyes!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every sensitive skin product on the market, including Cetaphil and a sensitive skin formula from Arbonne and they all make make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I like this facewash, keeps my face soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Definitly washes face well not harsh at all.</li>
            <li> Product feels soft almost like nothing.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from a harsher cleanser b/c I am acne prone and thought a more gentle cleanser would be good, and after a week I broke out terribly.</li>
            <li> It rinses off in a snap and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of a film behind.</li>
            <li> and it really seems kinder than the Ponds I usually use…nowhere near as strong acting.</li>
            <li> I thought that skin couldn&#x27;t be clean without feeling tight and squeeky.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cleansers for years and spent ridiculous amounts of money trying to find the right one.</li>
            <li> I usually need a few good squirts to cover my face probably because they don&#x27;t put sodium lauryl sulfate in it to foam up.  </li>
            <li> Really helped with sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very comforting and moisturizing on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans deep but is gentle and no soapy residue that is difficult to get off with a warm wash rag.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> It has a consistency that is kind of a cross between a gel and a cream, and feels thin at first when you aply it to a wet face.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone with even a patch of dry skin or for anyone that wants to use this as a make up remover.</li>
            <li> (like so dry it was flaky) and a really oily nose and chin.</li>
            <li> I tried all the expensive brands (some 100+ per bottle) and this one really does the most for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this the last two months, since I came back from NYC, and it&#x27;s really helped restore moisture to my skin.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is limited to only what is essential to gently clean the skin without drying it out, unlike other cleansers that have strong fragrances or harsh soaps and yet still claim to be for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first and last time buying this product because it went straight to the trash after using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and i barely breakout</li>
            <li> I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed rosacea in the last couple of years on my cheeks and eyes.</li>
            <li> MAYBE USED FOR PRIVATE SENSITIVE  BODY AREAS</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, sensitive skin, adult acne, etc.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser a week ago after accidentally buying [[ASIN:B0081E6X1W Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser, 12 Ounce]] which was NOT gentle on my skin at all since it had fragrance in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but I bought this because my skin tends to dry out during the winter and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t over drying and removed make up.</li>
            <li> Gentle and helps slow down face from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> My skin has calmed down a lot since using it, and it is very non-drying in wintertime.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin to drying cleansers and this works well without making my face too dry.</li>
            <li> After using a big name competitor&#x27;s face wash and suffering from dry skin from habitual use to this product my skin remained clear yet hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome &amp; Systemic Lupus and thus I also have very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a great creamy texture, similar to that of cold cream (but a little thinner), and my face feels moisturized</li>
            <li> When my face is sensitive due to sun or exfoliation</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other products burning my face; so far this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have that issue.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only cream cleansers I could find that is gentle and does not contain parabens, and is also less expensive than most other brands.</li>
            <li> i realized it was because of the harsh face cleaners i was using that made my skin so dry which then lead to it producing so much oil to make up for it.</li>
            <li> I have used the ultra gentle foaming formula in the past and thought there was no difference.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a little apprehensive about trying new things in my face.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially alongside my nose (I also have eczema, so that&#x27;s probably why).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that cleans and unclogs pores without leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li> However, it helps a lot with my dry skin without making me oily (which is a big problem with face wash for me).</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive in the winter (about 8 months long here in Wisconsin) and this is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and make it feel tight.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam much, which was a little bit odd</li>
            <li> I also like that you get 12 oz of product rather than 5 or 6 oz like other facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> However, it is not foaming at all, so it feels really different than other soaps.</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all after using.  </li>
            <li> Gift to my mother, who is in her 80&#x27;s and has dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The dry skin was gone, and it stayed gone.  </li>
            <li> Also using as a bath soap and it has reduced my dry skin\itching.</li>
            <li> However, my skin is still dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my face dry.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have dry sking and this cleanser cleans my make perfectrly and leaves my skin</li>
            <li> It removes my make up and does not leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The claim of &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; is a bit misleading, as it adds no moisture to the skin; rather, it just doesn&#x27;t strip it dry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like foaming cleansers as they seem to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Dry.</li>
            <li> Dry out my skin</li>
            <li> cleansers that tend to dry out your skin to varying degrees.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> THE CREAMY TEXTURE LEAVES MY SKIN DRY, LIKE</li>
            <li> My skin became extremely dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> No one wants to stand there wasting water while you go through extra unnecessary steps.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive product that works as well as the high end cleansers--at least for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that you&#x27;d have to exfoliate regularly since this is not a deep cleanser.</li>
            <li> When my skin is having issues, it calms it down and brings back some of the moisture.</li>
            <li> Every other cleanser makes my skin worse, but this one really helps with dry patches and red skin -</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> Similar to Cetaphil but slightly richer formulation.</li>
            <li> I have very, very dry skin that often looks flaky when I wear foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Its lead to acne and blackheads leaving my face one big mess.</li>
            <li> This cleanser made my face so silky soft and the flaky patches hardly noticeable .</li>
            <li> This is not as hydrating as expected.</li>
            <li> but it is not gentle.</li>
            <li> It actually made my skin and lips dryer after using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I never really know how my skin is going to react.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried Cetaphil and this is very similar but it feels less watered down then Cetaphil</li>
            <li> Ever since i started using this cleanser three months ago, my face has never felt dry or tight after cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> and then my skin would start getting irritated by some ingredient or tight and dry -</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical when i read soap-free.</li>
            <li> (Why in the world do they always put face wash in such small containers anyway?)</li>
            <li> greasy and does little for dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesnt lather like the average face wash</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product until everything quieted down</li>
            <li> It is not super sudsy but cleans well.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like a typical face wash.  </li>
            <li> Although I get a slightly medicinal smell sometimes.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, since using this, I have had much less trouble with those pesky kurtosis pots that continue to bother me on my bald pate and face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d travelled to NYC in December and the cold really did a number on my face.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I washed my face 3 times with it, taking a few minutes each time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cleanser I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> My face does not feel dried out afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not gentle, because it dries my face so much I&#x27;m forced to use it in pea sized amounts once every week or so</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out after getting out of a shower as it used to with this cleanser either.</li>
            <li> Now i have very little oil on my face</li>
            <li> It is not your usual hand sanitizer</li>
            <li> No odor not sure why others think so?</li>
            <li> hard to find</li>
            <li> I follow up with a thick Neutrogena unscented lotion (not specifically meant for the face) to keep my skin from flaking and peeling.  </li>
            <li> Seriously need to try to pawn them off on someone, I guess.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I guess it leaves a film on the skin and what ever the chemicals it leaves behind they  </li>
            <li> I LIKE THE NORMAL FORMULA, BUT THIS IS TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> The pump doesnt work so the lotion is useless</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t lather at all, and so is rather useless if you have a beard.  </li>
            <li> Ill be using this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice that until having this cleanser beyond it&#x27;s return date.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was a disaster for my dormant acne rosacea pustules on my nose.</li>
            <li> and I suspect it is a fake product.</li>
            <li> A terrible choice if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Rinse off and my skin still felt &#x27;dirty&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful, just awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good, gentle face wash</li>
            <li> Great morning cleanser. Does not remove makeup well so I don&#x27;t use it at night. Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd bottle and I love it..!!</li>
            <li> Really helped with sensitive, dry skin. You can definitely feel the difference, even hours after use. I use it when I wake up and when I go to bed. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Good things first: It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it is truly fragrance free. Negatives: made my skin look like &amp;#34;orange peel&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t cleanse deeply enough so I got blackheads and it doesn&#x27;t remove makeup thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is not as hydrating as expected. My face stings after use</li>
            <li> Very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The pump doesnt work so the lotion is useless</li>
            <li> Cleanser is thorough, moisturizes pretty well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosacea-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle and helps slow down face from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> purchased for a gift - giftee was pleased</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, with rosacia and seb derm, and this is a wonderful cleanser for me.  Every other cleanser makes my skin worse, but this one really helps with dry patches and red skin - but I only use it once a day.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all after using.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a skin cleanser for problematic, sensitive skin that is prone to flare-ups.  It&#x27;s helped me a great deal.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser if you have sensitive skin. The ingredients list is limited to only what is essential to gently clean the skin without drying it out, unlike other cleansers that have strong fragrances or harsh soaps and yet still claim to be for sensitive skin. It has a consistency that is kind of a cross between a gel and a cream, and feels thin at first when you aply it to a wet face. It wont remove more than light makeup (I use an oil cleanser to remove mine), but I really think this is worth a try if other cleansers leave your skin stripped of moisture or irritated.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Oops - should have paid attention.  I prefer the foaming formula to the creamy formula.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this. Seems like a paraben free alternative to Cetaphil. My skin has calmed down a lot since using it, and it is very non-drying in wintertime.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t lather at all, and so is rather useless if you have a beard.  Stick with the regular version (which is a wonderful product) - this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it if you require lather.</li>
            <li> Gift to my mother, who is in her 80&#x27;s and has dry skin.  She says it has reduced her skin dryness.</li>
            <li> This left a funky-feeling film on my skin. I switched back to my Olay face wash.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. Not too harsh.</li>
            <li> I face turned red after an hour. It did go away quickly this time. The texture of this product is very nice. I will keep using it and see if it makes my many skin problems go away for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok although I prefer something more on the creamy foamy kind.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Oily skin has been a huge problem for me for so many years. Its lead to acne and blackheads leaving my face one big mess. i realized it was because of the harsh face cleaners i was using that made my skin so dry which then lead to it producing so much oil to make up for it. I tried even using moisturizers after washing to help stop the oily from producing but it never helped. Ever since i started using this cleanser three months ago, my face has never felt dry or tight after cleaning it.  Now i have very little oil on my face and i barely breakout anymore and i don&#x27;t even have to bother with moisturizers. At first i was skeptical when i read soap-free. I wondered how a soapless wash will clean my face, but it leaves my skin feeling and looking so clean. After years of trying to find the right face wash i&#x27;m so happy that i finally found one that works. Ill be using this product for years to come. My boyfriend even commented on how clear my face has gotten, he is even thinking of trying it out.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but cleans off makeup and dirt, leaving skin soft.  Non-irritating.</li>
            <li> A terrible choice if you have dry skin. I should have read the ingredients before buying it. It dried my skin out like crazy.</li>
            <li> As it clearly says on the label &amp;#34;creamy formula&amp;#34;. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t notice that until having this cleanser beyond it&#x27;s return date. It doesn&#x27;t lather or make any suds. It&#x27;s like trying to wash your face with dollar store hand lotion. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Finally a fix to my problem. I have problems with dry skin on my face, especially alongside my nose (I also have eczema, so that&#x27;s probably why).  Anyway, I noticed an immediate difference using this in combination with Dove Men+Care Face Lotion, Hydrate+.  The dry skin was gone, and it stayed gone.  I had a bit of redness in a couple of those dry skin areas (which was red before, as well) after the first day of using this, but after day 2 it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to cleanse the face.  A great face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser takes off all makeup doesn&#x27;t strip my skin or makes it tight feeling. Beautiful just right</li>
            <li> I prefer the regular version as opposed to the ultra gentle, which is a creamier formula, but this one is nice and does feel extremely gentle. When my face is sensitive due to sun or exfoliation I do prefer the more gentle face wash over the original, so I&#x27;m glad to have accidentally purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.  My skin looks so much better since I have been using this.  I have very, very dry skin that often looks flaky when I wear foundation.  Since using this product, I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> Like it. Works well for me.</li>
            <li> I used to use [[ASIN:B000FFT8KS Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser 16 fl oz.]] when my doctor said that it might not be getting rid of my acne because it can be used for skin and is not specifically for your face. So, she recommended Neutrogena. I bought this cleanser a week ago after accidentally buying [[ASIN:B0081E6X1W Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser, 12 Ounce]] which was NOT gentle on my skin at all since it had fragrance in it. So I went back to the drugstore and found this. It does leave my skin feeling soft afterwords which is a nice plus. I also put [[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]] on after using this product. I have had issues with other products burning my face; so far this one doesn&#x27;t seem to have that issue. I will update if I have any problems.. but so far so good. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awful, just awful.  It doesn&#x27;t lather or clean the skin.  I switched to this from a harsher cleanser b/c I am acne prone and thought a more gentle cleanser would be good, and after a week I broke out terribly. This wasn&#x27;t purging, it was breaking out b/c this product doesn&#x27;t clean the skin, it does nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle facial product.  It has no heavy fragrance and seems to glide over your face.  I would buy it again as it is kind to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best face cleanser for my face for these dry, dry New England winters. It helps noticeably.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I tried this cleanser what a non-drying cleanser actually meant.. I didn&#x27;t realize how soft, smooth and supple my skin could be after washing. I thought that skin couldn&#x27;t be clean without feeling tight and squeeky. This cleanser has changed my mind. However, I still end up with eye makeup residue on my face after using it. Using makeup wipes afterwards seems to take care of the left over residue, but in a perfect world, the cleanser would have gotten rid of that too. Oh well. My skin feels great from using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to detail, this is the &amp;#34;Creamy Formula&amp;#34; I wanted the &amp;#34;Foaming Formula&amp;#34; because it removes eye make up, this one (creamy) does not remove makeup well. I use this in the morning in the shower and the foaming formula at night to wash off my makeup. It has healthy ingredients and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It&#x27;s gentle and removes all my makeup.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter at her dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. She says it&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> The soap at work sucked moisture out of my already dry skin and no amount of lotion seemed to be able to catch up to the damage. This cleanser is so gentle and leaves my skin feeling soft and comfortable. It is not super sudsy but cleans well. Defnitely a keeper for my hands!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to dry out easily which causes excess oil production which can lead to breakouts for me. Not with this face wash! Because it really is a hydrating cleanser. I don&#x27;t even need to apply moisturizer after using it. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that cleans and unclogs pores without leaving my skin dry. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I can&#x27;t believe how well it leaves my skin. I use it with my clarisonic cleaner. It works great with it! I have acne and combo skin.  This stuff cleans and doesn&#x27;t such the life out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month or so and it really seems kinder than the Ponds I usually use…nowhere near as strong acting. This removes the surface dirt/oil but leaves the skin feeling smooth, not dry. Furthermore, since using this, I have had much less trouble with those pesky kurtosis pots that continue to bother me on my bald pate and face. I think I will keep using this…we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This cleanser made my face so silky soft and the flaky patches hardly noticeable . Unfortunately it was a disaster for my dormant acne rosacea pustules on my nose. Within 2 days my nose blew up with sores. I stopped using this product until everything quieted down but same thing happened the second time I tried again. Such a shame as I loved how it helped my seb dermatitis. I guess it leaves a film on the skin and what ever the chemicals it leaves behind they  bring on the pustules. I was so hopeful:(. I am thinking of trying it one more time but keeping it away from my nose if possible. Will report back if that works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this cleanser, but was pleasantly suprised.  It does a great job of cleaning my skin, no stinging and leaves it feeling soft-not dried out.  It doesn&#x27;t foam much, which was a little bit odd but that isn&#x27;t a problem for me.  It does a great job and that is all I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is one of the first cleansers that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face bright red and feeling dry and tight. Even the Neutragena ultra gentle foaming cleanser did that, so I was a bit hesitant to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day, either alone or to remove excess oil after oil cleansing. It has a great creamy texture, similar to that of cold cream (but a little thinner), and my face feels moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ridiculous number of face washes, and was using Basis cleaner clean and loved it except it came in a tube, a small tube, and you can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. (Why in the world do they always put face wash in such small containers anyway?) And pumps are the only way to go in the shower. No one wants to stand there wasting water while you go through extra unnecessary steps. So, this one has a bigger container and pump - nice! This also happens to be an incredible face wash. It is barely fragranced with a mild pleasant scent, gets your face clean without stripping, removes make-up (I don&#x27;t wear waterproof makeup) rinses clean, and your skin feels just perfect. This is also a clear formula (I prefer products that are clear, not cloudy, pearly, and colored) and it has NO parabens!!!! Yay!! Reasonable price, too!</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cleans deep but is gentle and no soapy residue that is difficult to get off with a warm wash rag.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin.  Also using as a bath soap and it has reduced my dry skin\itching. One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used the ultra gentle foaming formula in the past and thought there was no difference. THERE IS!! This creamy formula doesn&#x27;t get through my makeup so I have to wash my face 4 times to get my face clean. I have to use my Olay brush or a washcloth to get all of the makeup off. Then the brush disk is gummed up with makeup. Scrubbing defeats the point of gentle.  I will stick to the foaming formula or the original face bar, which I found is even better.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!!  Very comforting and moisturizing on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great price, large bottle. The cleanser tends to give me breakouts, so I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed. This cleanser does not remove makeup. I washed my face 3 times with it, taking a few minutes each time. Rinse off and my skin still felt &#x27;dirty&#x27;. I always followup with a cotton pad with a mild aloe astringent and lots of makeup was on the pads. I used 4 pads and still the makeup was coming off. I just bought 4 bottles of this stuff and I know I won&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve used the other version of this Neurtrogena cleanser (Ultra Gentle - but not the Hydrating version) and that worked great. What a pain! Anybody want these unused bottles of this stuff?</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner. Gentle on the skin and removes most of my makeup (it removes everything but my waterproof eyeliner, but that&#x27;s to be expected). I use a more natural product for every day use because of my sensitive skin, but on the days I wear makeup, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I was using the same neutrogena gentle face wash but the foaming one and accidentally bought this one but so glad I made this mistake! If you get dry skin this is perfect. I&#x27;ve had more moisture on my face and it eliminated the tiny bumps I had on my forehead. Will continue to buy this one instead!</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance free cleanser that I absolutely love. It removes eye makeup without burning and that eliminates an eye makeup remover. My skin feels clean after use. I also use this to wash my hands. It is not your usual hand sanitizer but it cleans and hydrates my hands without all the soap suds. This is an inexpensive product that works as well as the high end cleansers--at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and this soap is gentle enough for it. However, my skin is still dry so it&#x27;s not as hydrating as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that leaves my face really dry if I use too much of any sort of aftershave, cleanser or shaving cream on my face. I decided to purchase this after reading others reviews and I must say I am extremely happy with this cleanser. I highly recommend if your skin is hyper sensitive because this cleanser really leaves your face feeling clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It didn&#x27;t make my face dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, mature skin and had hoped to love this product since it is Ultra Gentle and made by Neutrogena, but not so much.  It doesn&#x27;t lather, so it just feels like applying a lotion to your face, but the downside of that &#x27;lotion feel&#x27; is that is greasy.  I bought 2 bottles thinking I would surely love it or at least still use it up even if I didn&#x27;t love it, but both are still sitting in the bottom of the bathroom cabinet.  Seriously need to try to pawn them off on someone, I guess.</li>
            <li> no parabens....hard to find</li>
            <li> Better than anything your dermatologist will prescribe for a fraction of the price.  If you have dry skin, sensitive skin, adult acne, etc.  this will not irritate or cause redness or dryness.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleanser that has worked for me since my skin started getting more sensitive/irritable about 10 years ago. I am 39 years old and have tried many, many &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleansers. All of them would work for about a week or two and then my skin would start getting irritated by some ingredient or tight and dry - yes, even from gentle cleansers. And I have combo skin (oily in T-zone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this hydrating gentle cleanser for over three months and it&#x27;s worked perfectly. It removes my makeup, dissolves excess oil accumulation, and leaves me with moisture. My skin has never felt so balanced! It&#x27;s clear and has no irritation.</li>
            <li> very nice good price  and skin feels better</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and rosacea. I&#x27;m pleased with how this product left my skin - smooth and silky. Not great for removing makeup, but combined with my clarisonic pro, it&#x27;s amazing! No stinging</li>
            <li> After using a big name competitor&#x27;s face wash and suffering from dry skin from habitual use to this product my skin remained clear yet hydrated.  I also prefer the scent differences between the two. This does not smell like a typical face wash.  I also like the smoother consistency of this product making it easier to spread the wash on my face.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good pre- cleanser for makeup, and then followed with foaming cleansing for oily combo or sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I have dry sking and this cleanser cleans my make perfectrly and leaves my skin moisterize.&lt;br /&gt;¡Me encantó! Tengo piel seca y este limpiador me limpia el maquillaje perfectamente y me deja la piel humectada.</li>
            <li> Not drying and super gentle.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the foaming kind, not the creamy kind. It doesn&#x27;t foam up when I use it, making my face feel not as clean. Seems to do the job though. Will make sure to order the foaming kind next time.</li>
            <li> a repeat for this product. that tells you how much I like using this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good bargain for the price. It is cheaper than Costco. It is gentle but removes the makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin, but I bought this because my skin tends to dry out during the winter and wanted something that wasn&#x27;t over drying and removed make up. This is pretty much the Neutrogena version of Cetaphil&#x27;s cleanser but it is not gentle. It did not remove make up, it left a creamy film on my skin on top of my make-up that did not wash off. It actually made my skin and lips dryer after using it for a few weeks. I think it&#x27;s because it has alcohol in the cleanser. This was my first and last time buying this product because it went straight to the trash after using it a few weeks. I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone with even a patch of dry skin or for anyone that wants to use this as a make up remover. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome &amp; Systemic Lupus and thus I also have very dry sensitive skin.  This cleanser works (removes all dirt and make up) and never irritates my skin, even when I am in a flare and have a malar rash all over my face.  My teenagers use it too and love it.</li>
            <li> Not creamy and I suspect it is a fake product.</li>
            <li> I had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cleanser with Cotton Extract. I liked it, but it comes in a 5oz tube that was lasting me about a month. It was also $9.99. I was wondering around Target and saw this product. It&#x27;s $8.99 for a 12 oz tube. I also like that has a pump rather than a squeeze tube. It makes it much easier to control how much comes out. My skin is very oily and very allergy-prone. I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to products that claim to be for sensitive skin before. So I&#x27;m a little apprehensive about trying new things in my face. I never really know how my skin is going to react.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on how this cleanser works for removing makeup, because I don&#x27;t use it for that. I use it to cleanse my face in the shower. This cleanser claims to be Ultra Gentle and it definitely is. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause any type of allergic reaction. It rinses off in a snap and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of a film behind. It foams nicely and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh after I use it. I also like that you get 12 oz of product rather than 5 or 6 oz like other facial cleansers. I have no complaints whatsoever about this product and will continue to buy and use it.</li>
            <li> Clean and Pliable to start the day.  No filmy residue. Super light fragrance; almost none.  I am glad I bought it. Also like the bottle design; it&#x27;s convenient to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use foaming cleansers, bar soaps, or anything with salicylic acid because it dries my skin out and/or makes me break out. I was using Noxzema, and although it does work well and keeps my skin looking great, I got kind of tired of the strong smell and slight burning sensation. This is one of the only cream cleansers I could find that is gentle and does not contain parabens, and is also less expensive than most other brands. I also really appreciate that it comes with 12 full ounces instead of just a little tube. It is very gentle and does not have a scent. It removes my make up and does not leave my skin feeling dry. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. My skin is SO sensitive and it really is extra gentle. It does not burn or strip away moisture, it actually moisturizes your skin. Combined with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisture lotion it is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> greasy and does little for dry skin</li>
            <li> This was gentle and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but didn&#x27;t clean well enough or remove my makeup. It left me with clogged pores and pimples.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use it yet. But seems great!</li>
            <li> Good product but wish it lathered more.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and simple.  I use this in the mornings when I don&#x27;t have makeup to wash off, and it provides a nice, clean, and not stripped-dry surface for sunscreen and makeup application.  The claim of &amp;#34;hydrating&amp;#34; is a bit misleading, as it adds no moisture to the skin; rather, it just doesn&#x27;t strip it dry.  I haven&#x27;t used this for makeup removal at night, so I can&#x27;t recommend it for that, but I suspect it&#x27;ll be your go-to for your morning routine.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommend this face wash. After switching to it, I will never buy another. I tried all the expensive brands (some 100+ per bottle) and this one really does the most for my skin. I have seen huge improvements.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I have found that leaves my face feeling moist and comfortable after cleansing.  I have mild eczema on my hands so I have begun to use it for them as well which has helped significantly.</li>
            <li> Felt a burning sensation after I washed it off.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive in the winter (about 8 months long here in Wisconsin) and this is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and make it feel tight.  I follow up with a thick Neutrogena unscented lotion (not specifically meant for the face) to keep my skin from flaking and peeling.  Then sunscreen and makeup.  Took me about 47 years to find a routine that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is not foaming. I don&#x27;t like foaming cleansers as they seem to dry out my skin. This cleanser is creamy &amp; gentle. Rub gently on your face, &amp; eyelids too. (Yes, gentle enough for around eyes!) Use a wash rag with warm water to remove face &amp; eye make-up. Rinse with warm &amp; then cool water. Dry. Use any of Neutragena&#x27;s moisturizers after. It&#x27;s simple yet effective. I love it!  In fact, I read that Neutragena&#x27;s moisturizers are the best in smoothing wrinkles, even though it is not advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed rosacea in the last couple of years on my cheeks and eyes. I&#x27;ve tried every sensitive skin product on the market, including Cetaphil and a sensitive skin formula from Arbonne and they all make make my skin breakout. This is the ONLY cleanser I can use that doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse. The foaming formula is gentle as well, but dries my skin out too much and I end up breaking out. Now if I could just find a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work for rosatia as the container says.I have been using this product for about a year. No other products were successful.</li>
            <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t Dry out my skin&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; cleansers that tend to dry out your skin to varying degrees.&lt;br /&gt;This one is &amp;#34;Hydrating&amp;#34;.  Doesn&#x27;t foam, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is the best!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cleansers for years and spent ridiculous amounts of money trying to find the right one. My dermatologist gave me a sample of this and I fell in love. You don&#x27;t have to spend $40 on a cleanser. This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the price is so reasonable!</li>
            <li> THE CREAMY TEXTURE LEAVES MY SKIN DRY, LIKE THE SOAP ISNT CLEANSING AT ALL. I LIKE THE NORMAL FORMULA, BUT THIS IS TERRIBLE. I REALLY REGRET BUYING IT, AND ON TOP OF IT A 2 PACK.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> I like this facewash, keeps my face soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it kept my skin clean and reduced any acne I had. However, it is not foaming at all, so it feels really different than other soaps. This may cause you to use more then necessary (as I did) and run out quickly. I prefer something that foams.</li>
            <li> I have always done well with Neutrogena products and their face wash is also a good product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I bought this to help even it out. It works very well. I wish it were a bit scented (though I understand why it isn&#x27;t) and I wish it had a lather. I think I use a bit too much because there&#x27;s no lather. However, it helps a lot with my dry skin without making me oily (which is a big problem with face wash for me). My skin is very soft now.</li>
            <li> I purchase this to alternate between my AHA Cleanser, Great for sensitive skin types !  Young or Older persons will love this !  Great alternative  for AHA Formula  (Alpha Hydroxy).&lt;br /&gt;Can also be a permanent replacement for &amp;#34;SOAPS&amp;#34; !!! MAYBE USED FOR PRIVATE SENSITIVE  BODY AREAS AS WELL !</li>
            <li> So I used to have super dry cheeks (like so dry it was flaky) and a really oily nose and chin. I would try to even it out with lotion and stuff but it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at the grocery store and wasnt sure how I felt about it the first few days. 2 weeks later though, I LOVE it. My face feels so much more balanced. I dont wear makeup and I dont feel like I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt lather like the average face wash and I spend a little extra time on my nose since it tends to be more oily at the end of the day than the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill definitely be sticking with this one for awhile.</li>
            <li> Good, gentle and perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Similar to Cetaphil but slightly richer formulation. Also fragrance-free like Cetaphil. Although I get a slightly medicinal smell sometimes. I&#x27;d travelled to NYC in December and the cold really did a number on my face. My skin became extremely dry and chapped. I&#x27;ve been using this the last two months, since I came back from NYC, and it&#x27;s really helped restore moisture to my skin. My only complaint would be that you&#x27;d have to exfoliate regularly since this is not a deep cleanser. But given that I got it to hydrate my skin, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been very effective at that and without any adverse effects at all.</li>
            <li> Gentle, but I wish it was better at creating more lather. It feels like it disappears from my face as soon as it touches it.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleaner.  It is scent free and very light.  My face does not feel dried out afterwards.  My tween daughter also began to use this on her face and she really likes it.  Clean refreshing feeling afterwards and not to sudsy.</li>
            <li> I do not like this cleanser. It does not throughly clean make up, or for that matter, dirt completely off your skin. I have to take an additional step to strip off dirt from my face with a toner, which is what I really want to avoid doing. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. When my skin is having issues, it calms it down and brings back some of the moisture. Face feels clean without being stripped.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a year ago. It&#x27;s not gentle, because it dries my face so much I&#x27;m forced to use it in pea sized amounts once every week or so, otherwise my face is dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend/ will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle creamy cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Extremely gentle and easy on my sesnsitive skin. No odor not sure why others think so? Definitly washes face well not harsh at all. Product feels soft almost like nothing. Recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea (I&#x27;m 31) and this is a really gentle, effective product.  I started developing rosacea trouble about a year ago and began looking for a very skin friendly cleanser.  I have tried Cetaphil and this is very similar but it feels less watered down then Cetaphil, it&#x27;s thicker.  I usually need a few good squirts to cover my face probably because they don&#x27;t put sodium lauryl sulfate in it to foam up.  It does leave my skin feeling very clean and refreshed without all the harsh chemicals and perfumes.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out after getting out of a shower as it used to with this cleanser either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this because my dermatologist recommended it! It&#x27;s reasonably priced, works good, has made a positive difference in my face already, need I say more?</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena cleansers because my face feels clean after use. With this cleanser, there is the added benefit of it being more gentle on the skin than what I have used prior. I got it for a good price with Subscribe and Save also, so as long as the price remains low, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin to drying cleansers and this works well without making my face too dry.</li>
