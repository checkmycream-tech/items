            <li>This is so worth it to me.</li>

            <li>Most of the drugstore moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t work well enough to keep my skin soft, so I decided I&#x27;d spend a little more for something that might work better for the long run.</li>
            <li>People are using words like vibrant and radiant for my look.  </li>
            <li>well, I have increased skin clarity and noticed less fine wrinkles.</li>

            <li> Great product - really makes my skin look  better!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought this (plus a few other Epicura products) and absolutely loved it. I don&#x27;t know much about these types of products, but she has spent an ungodly amount on anti-aging serums and creams in the past, and I&#x27;ve never heard her praise a product like she has this Quench stuff. She just raves about how it feels on her skin, how it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue behind like so many of the other anti-aging serums she&#x27;s tried, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, she loves it and her skin has never looked better. Not gonna lie....I tried it too, and it feels pretty awesome hah.</li>
            <li> My mother has been using the Quench Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a while and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed her skin becoming more smooth and refreshing. I bought it and a few other similar products from the same company as a gift and I think she&#x27;s really enjoyed them. If you&#x27;re thinking of getting them, I would definitely recommend you do.</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd bottle now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I started noticing results after 4 days.  My coworkers were commenting how good I looked.  That felt really great!  I lost weight recently so I had some lines on my face, cheeks and forehead.  This serum really smoothed them out.  People are using words like vibrant and radiant for my look.  It really makes me feel good.  This is so worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised at how well Quench makes my skin feel. It is so soft and toned. I&#x27;m using it daily for best results.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! Its not oily and greasy and it doesn&#x27;t breakout my skin either.  Very good product!</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my skin by using this product for a month. I sent it back for a refund. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight and absorbs quickly.  My face looks healthier and more hydrated immediately after using it.  It seems to plump out my fine lines, so I would recommend it to anyone.  The size they give you is very generous, too, so I thought it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product, but once I began to use it...I realize that it leaves my skin dry regardless....I have to but moisturizer after applying it because it just feels like you didn&#x27;t but nothing at all in your skin.  Don&#x27;t take me wrong it feels good when you apply it but once it dries is a different story.</li>
            <li> Quench Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Epicura Skin helps to enhance your skin&#x27;s collagen levels. The serum absorbs into your skin without leaving it greasy. The products makes your skin look younger and healthier. And the serum is easy to use! It fades blemishes and reduces the signs of aging with vitamin C and  natural oils like lavender and aloe. Great product to improve your skin&#x27;s overall health and appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a product to keep your face from dryness.  It  softens lines and hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Quench Hyaluronic Acid Serum. This product works so great on my skin and it work on all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I let myself run out what a mistake!! I saw the difference in my skin instantly. Well I rushed to hurry up and ordered my second bottle. I wish that I could send a photo to show you all, but take my word for it I am 51 and my skin looks like that I of a 30 year old. People who haven&#x27;t seen me and awhile ask me what am I doing different. I tell everyone about Quench!</li>
            <li> I actually got all of the facial creams in this line and decided to wait at least 6 weeks before reviewing&lt;br /&gt;All of these work well, I have increased skin clarity and noticed less fine wrinkles. My skin appears brighter and as a result any makeup I use looks better and I use less. The moisture level is much better in my face and appears almost radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have some breakouts with skin products but not with this line, will continue to use as my skin gets better over time</li>
            <li> I have use this product for 2 months and my skin looks smoother. I really see the difference in how moist looks.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out even though I&#x27;m not too worried about aging yet. But with all the years I&#x27;ve spent in the sun and salt water due to sailing, I figure my skin will probably age a little faster than normal. Most of the drugstore moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t work well enough to keep my skin soft, so I decided I&#x27;d spend a little more for something that might work better for the long run. This serum is really light and it works really fast; absorbed in my skin almost as soon as I finish applying it. My skin looks and feels A LOT better now.</li>
            <li> Excellent product even though it feels drying on skin, I just put a layer of other moisturizer to fix it!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the very best products I have ever used. It works best after a shower. I put it on my face and neck  when I get out. My skin tightens in about thirty seconds. It&#x27; takes away those deep wrinkles. It&#x27;s amazing. This is better than the  $82.00 face moisturizer that I was using. It is actually shows results. My husband took before and after pictures. That&#x27;s all I needed. I would highly recommend this to everyone !!</li>
            <li> My partner loves these products and said I should try some for the fine lines and wrinkles that I have from age. I&#x27;m not one for botox or fillers, so I was always willing to try this out. I used it for about a week or so before I could definitely see a difference in the wrinkles on my face and I&#x27;m so happy I found this product because now it&#x27;s my must have product! I&#x27;m sure that if I keep using this, I might end up looking like a teenager soon! No but in all seriousness, this is definitely on of those products that work without a doubt and is for everyone out there that needs to look and feel younger and youthful.</li>
            <li> You can actually see it peeling the dead skin from your face.  It is feels refreshing while it does magic for your skin.</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle in a bottle! I have gotten so many compliments on how soft &amp; supple my skin looks. It&#x27;s a serum so your skin just soaks it right up, and it&#x27;s much lighter than a cream. I use it twice daily, after I get out of the shower, but before I put make up on. And at night after I wash my face I put some on and when I wake up my skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite products from the Epicure Skin range. I could easily and very quickly notice a difference in the plumpness and the firmness of my skin, and I felt youthful so quickly. I also noticed such a difference in the fine lines and the wrinkles on the face and around my eyes - even those stubborn crows feet were diminishing and going away. This is by far a product that every woman needs to invest in and use all the time! It really restores the youthful skin you want a product to do!</li>
            <li> wonderful.... seems to work much better than anything else I have used... even la mar which I have used since forever.</li>
