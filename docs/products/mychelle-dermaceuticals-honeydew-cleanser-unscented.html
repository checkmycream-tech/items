    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Honeydew cleanser is perfect.</li>
            <li>, that is how impressed I was.</li>
            <li>I use it with John Masters SPF 30 moisturizer for day and Almay&#x27;s Regenerist Resurfacing Elixir at night, and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>MyChelle moisturizers, serums, and eye treatments work beautifully for me, so when my REN No. 1 purity balm seemed close to running out, I gave the MyChelle honeydew cleanser a shot.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job cleaning, including removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Happily, I have not had a problem since I contacted them.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say my experience with this product has been great.  </li>
            <li>Paul Begoun has listed this as a pick on her &amp;#34;Beautypedia&amp;#34; website, and EWG gives it good marks for chemical safety.</li>
            <li>Good balance of cleaning and moisture.</li>
            <li>most of the MyChelle skincare line, I loved it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all the great MyChelle products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for two years and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I both use it and love it!</li>
            <li>I like the scented version but the unscented doesn&#x27;t smell nice and it burns my skin.</li>
            <li>I believe they are also gluten-free, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is also wonderful for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel timeless, young and vibrant, but smooth is the best adjective that I can use to best describe it.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you that squeaky clean feeling, but that isn&#x27;t good for our skin, even if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, but seems to do a great job of getting the day&#x27;s residue off my skin.</li>
            <li>Folks who love bubbles, be warned: this cleanser does not foam.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft, and it looks great, but the cleanser took off none of the mascara or concealer.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is a great gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Fantastic experience!</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>So pleased.</li>
            <li>They said this product is more for taking off eye makeup which I don&#x27;t wear and not face make up or creams.</li>
            <li>She feels like this is the most effective way to clean and freshen her oily</li>
            <li>The honeydew cleanser is perfect for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.</li>
            <li>A pea-sized dollop will clean face, ears, and neck!</li>
            <li>Great for people with sensitive skin or acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>My skin always feels incredibly refreshed, not only to the touch, but from the inside!</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so this cleanser is perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want cancer-causing ingredients in my skin products, yet I want great results for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MyChelle seems to be a great all natural product that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is great for my super sensitive skin (no vitamin C, allergic to almost every eye cream, get eczema easily, etc), which is balanced, but easily clogs.</li>
            <li>I should do more, but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle much more than that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this MyChelle product for almost a year and find it very easy on my skin while cleansing pretty thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I need something that&#x27;s gentle to not irritate but effective at getting makeup off to prevent the milia.</li>
            <li>MyChelle Honeydew Cleanser smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean away makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks brilliantly clean.</li>
            <li>I have actually pretty much entirely switched my skincare to MyChelle and have been really happy with it.</li>
            <li>also really like MyChelle&#x27;s C Serum, and Amazon offers a good auto-ship price on that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it is unscented with additives, it has its own subtle natural scent, which I find very pleasant.</li>
            <li>BEWARE of this product if your skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate Coconut Oil very well!!</li>
            <li>It will leave your skin feeling soft, healthy, and un-irritated.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural alternative to Cetaphil, but contains none of the parabens, etc that Cetaphil has.</li>
            <li>To me, that scent evokes the feeling of knowing my face is clean and refreshed and ready to smile the day away.</li>
            <li>This wash makes my face feel so soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I love and trust MyChelle products.</li>
            <li>I notice that with both Cetaphil and the MyChelle Honeydew cleanser that I like to use an alcohol free toner sometimes, more when I am feeling a need for a little bit of a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>It takes my makeup off, but it super gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be good for sensitive skin, but ended up breaking out in red bumps all over.</li>
            <li>This product cleans gently with all natural, safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Honeydew cleanser is creamy and very gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and soothing, and unscented!</li>
            <li>It is the first truly no sting cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Because I suffer from rosacea on my face I had to really search for an effective and gentle, but thorough - because my skin&#x27;s oily too), facial cleanser that would not burn my face, or cause it to crack and itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It remains soft and free of itching from a soap or cleanser that just can&#x27;t be rinsed off.</li>
            <li>saleslady once shared that she spreads the cleanser on her face when she first arises in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love this line for my red, ensitive, and Rosacea</li>
            <li>and this is my new favorite for nearly a year now.</li>
            <li>I used to use super expensive face wash (by Arcona, which is a great company), but I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced and well rated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it by smoothing about 1 Tablespoonful onto the fingers of both hands, gently massaging the lotion into my face.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup very well and leaves skin feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks much brighter and I use together with the fruit enzyme scrub every morning.</li>
            <li>It feels more soft, my pores are smaller, and I feel like I have a healthier glow.</li>
            <li>This is a big red flag for me if a company refuses to refund you for a product that doesn&#x27;t work effectively regardless of whether you purchased it from them or not.  </li>
            <li>I love all mychelle products for my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m 48 and currently live in the desert, so I would rather be as gentle as I can with</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin that is easily upset by even &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34;, these products have been the exception.</li>
            <li>You only need a little dime size amount to wash your whole face effectively.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years -- always think will try something new but do not want to give up results.</li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is very soft, does not smell and</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t look to repeat buy anything, but I have been so pleased with this product that I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skins soft and cleans without drying.</li>
            <li>Soothing and natural.</li>
            <li>I could say I loved it, but unfortunately it made me break out</li>
            <li>I guess this would be a gentle facial wash on naked skin with no makeup or natural sunscreen to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.</li>
            <li>and I have normal skin, with occasional stress breakouts and propensity for rosacea and milia on my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and any time I try something new I always end up coming back to this.</li>
            <li>MyChelle also listened to and apparently took my suggestion to ensure the plastic squeeze bottle is made with softer plastic.  </li>

            <li> MyChelle also listened to and apparently took my suggestion to ensure the plastic squeeze bottle is made with softer plastic.  </li>
            <li> I breakout far less often since I&#x27;ve started using this line of products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to search any further to find any other facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I use a toner because the cotton pad was filthy afterward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to REN for my cleanser, but I&#x27;ll continue to use my other MyChelle products.</li>
            <li> and my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s no added scent, but it definitely has a scent which is not good for sensitive</li>
            <li> Feels luscious when applying on wet skin, washes off well.</li>
            <li> As with every MyChelle product I&#x27;ve tried, although they are on the pricey side, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The one problem - and I assume it has to do with the plant based ingredients is that there are some bottles where the cleanser can become watered down half way through using the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The Pumpkin one is even less astringent and when I started having some breakouts this summer, I put that bottle in the fridge and bought the Honeydew.</li>
            <li> It never leaves me dried out.</li>
            <li> I wear very little makeup, and what makeup I do wear consists of concealer around my eyes and mascara.</li>
            <li> I have already gone through 3 or 4 bottles of this in the past year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MyChelle is a product I&#x27;ve used for years, without negative reaction.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how poorly this cleanser works in taking off my mineral fusion spf 40 facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I called them after getting one bottle where the plastic was so hard it made it difficult to squeeze the product out to use it.  </li>

My skin is nice and soft, and it looks great, but the cleanser took off none of the mascara or concealer. It&#x27;s a good thing I use a toner because the cotton pad was filthy afterward. I used a Clarisonic, so my skin was prepped for deep cleansing, but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t cut the dirt. I&#x27;m going back to REN for my cleanser, but I&#x27;ll continue to use my other MyChelle products.</li>
            <li> I used to use super expensive face wash (by Arcona, which is a great company), but I couldn&#x27;t keep up with the cost. I switched to this cream cleanser from MyChelle and I LOVE it. It&#x27;s very gentle, but seems to do a great job of getting the day&#x27;s residue off my skin. I&#x27;ve never had a breakout from it, or felt like it wasn&#x27;t cleansing enough. I have actually pretty much entirely switched my skincare to MyChelle and have been really happy with it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean away makeup. And it irritate my skin. It totally didn&#x27;t give me what I want.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all the great MyChelle products. It takes my makeup off, but it super gentle on my skin. I have very very sensitive skin and it does not irrate. It leaves my skins soft and cleans without drying.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now. It is great for my super sensitive skin (no vitamin C, allergic to almost every eye cream, get eczema easily, etc), which is balanced, but easily clogs. I love that it is a natural alternative to Cetaphil, but contains none of the parabens, etc that Cetaphil has. The Honeydew cleanser is perfect. It cleans your skin, but doesn&#x27;t strip away. It won&#x27;t give you that squeaky clean feeling, but that isn&#x27;t good for our skin, even if you have oily skin. I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and haven&#x27;t gone back to Cetaphil once. I notice that with both Cetaphil and the MyChelle Honeydew cleanser that I like to use an alcohol free toner sometimes, more when I am feeling a need for a little bit of a deeper clean. I exfoliate once every couple of weeks. I should do more, but my sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle much more than that!</li>
            <li> This is a great gentle cleanser. It&#x27;s also moisturizing and gets the job done. I have already gone through 3 or 4 bottles of this in the past year.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job cleaning, including removing makeup.  It is also wonderful for sensitive skin.  Both my daughter and I both use it and love it!</li>
            <li> I love all mychelle products for my dry sensitive skin.  The honeydew cleanser is perfect for dry skin.  It never leaves me dried out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin. Feels luscious when applying on wet skin, washes off well. My skin always feels incredibly refreshed, not only to the touch, but from the inside! Fantastic experience! As with every MyChelle product I&#x27;ve tried, although they are on the pricey side, a little goes a long way! A pea-sized dollop will clean face, ears, and neck!</li>
            <li> I like the scented version but the unscented doesn&#x27;t smell nice and it burns my skin. They must have changed something.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s gentle and soothing, and unscented!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be good for sensitive skin, but ended up breaking out in red bumps all over. BEWARE of this product if your skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate Coconut Oil very well!!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so this cleanser is perfect. I breakout far less often since I&#x27;ve started using this line of products.</li>
            <li> MyChelle Honeydew Cleanser smells fantastic. It is the first truly no sting cleanser I have ever used. It is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Because I suffer from rosacea on my face I had to really search for an effective and gentle, but thorough - because my skin&#x27;s oily too), facial cleanser that would not burn my face, or cause it to crack and itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MyChelle is a product I&#x27;ve used for years, without negative reaction. My skin feels and looks brilliantly clean. It remains soft and free of itching from a soap or cleanser that just can&#x27;t be rinsed off. I use it by smoothing about 1 Tablespoonful onto the fingers of both hands, gently massaging the lotion into my face. Then I rinse it off, using handfuls of tepid water, ensuring that I&#x27;ve removed all the soil and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A saleslady once shared that she spreads the cleanser on her face when she first arises in the morning. Then she lets it soften her skin, and massages it into foam in her shower and rinses it off. She feels like this is the most effective way to clean and freshen her oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is unscented with additives, it has its own subtle natural scent, which I find very pleasant. To me, that scent evokes the feeling of knowing my face is clean and refreshed and ready to smile the day away. I don&#x27;t need to search any further to find any other facial cleanser. MyChelle Honeydew is the cleanser for me.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years -- always think will try something new but do not want to give up results.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is just what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t want cancer-causing ingredients in my skin products, yet I want great results for my sensitive skin. This product cleans gently with all natural, safe ingredients.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month now, I have noticed a change in my skin. It feels more soft, my pores are smaller, and I feel like I have a healthier glow. You only need a little dime size amount to wash your whole face effectively. It removes makeup very well and leaves skin feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MyChelle seems to be a great all natural product that I&#x27;m comfortable using on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they can call this unscented when it has a definite scent. Maybe there&#x27;s no added scent, but it definitely has a scent which is not good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could say I loved it, but unfortunately it made me break out and my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both MyChelle&#x27;s Honeydew and Pumpkin cleaners. The Pumpkin one is even less astringent and when I started having some breakouts this summer, I put that bottle in the fridge and bought the Honeydew. I&#x27;ve wondered if the product is cleansing enough but I&#x27;m 48 and currently live in the desert, so I would rather be as gentle as I can with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like MyChelle&#x27;s C Serum, and Amazon offers a good auto-ship price on that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I love and trust MyChelle products. I believe they are also gluten-free, which is nice. I&#x27;ve had some trouble absorbing Vitamin D3 so I&#x27;m going to have a Celiac test soon.</li>
            <li> Soothing and natural. I love this line for my red, ensitive, and Rosacea prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust the ingredients and this is my new favorite for nearly a year now.</li>
            <li> MyChelle products that I have had the pleasure of trying have met an exceeded,my expectations! I have sensitive dry skin that is easily upset by even &amp;#34;natural fragrance&amp;#34;, these products have been the exception. So pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for two years and am very pleased with it.  The one problem - and I assume it has to do with the plant based ingredients is that there are some bottles where the cleanser can become watered down half way through using the bottle.  It is not every bottle which is why I just continue to use it until it is used up.  MyChelle also listened to and apparently took my suggestion to ensure the plastic squeeze bottle is made with softer plastic.  I called them after getting one bottle where the plastic was so hard it made it difficult to squeeze the product out to use it.  Happily, I have not had a problem since I contacted them.</li>
            <li> I looove this product. It is very soft, does not smell and it does what is says it does. My skin looks much brighter and I use together with the fruit enzyme scrub every morning. It has a low rating on EWG skin deep database which means fewer harmful chemicals. I will use it again and again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in how poorly this cleanser works in taking off my mineral fusion spf 40 facial moisturizer. After I finished washing with it the moisturizer was still left on my face. It left it smeared on my skin. The sunscreens in it are zinc and titanium dioxide so perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t remove those.  I had to use a harsher cleanser to remove it.  Then I also tried to remove a tinted moisturizer from sanre organics, but when checking to see if it had been removed with a cotton pad,  the pad had color on it. I guess this would be a gentle facial wash on naked skin with no makeup or natural sunscreen to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update. Today I called MyChelle on the phone to tell them my problem. They said this product is more for taking off eye makeup which I don&#x27;t wear and not face make up or creams. I inquired if I could return the product to them even though I did not buy it from them, but they refused. I did not save my receipt where I bought it. This is a big red flag for me if a company refuses to refund you for a product that doesn&#x27;t work effectively regardless of whether you purchased it from them or not.  Lowered to 1 star now.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say my experience with this product has been great.  I usually don&#x27;t look to repeat buy anything, but I have been so pleased with this product that I will continue to use it.  Makes my face feel timeless, young and vibrant, but smooth is the best adjective that I can use to best describe it.  I bought it for Christmas for my daughters and daughter in-law, that is how impressed I was.</li>
            <li> This wash makes my face feel so soft and clean!  I was using Obaji, and I feel like this works just as well at a lower price.  I don&#x27;t use the term &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; often, but I think if I did, I would use that to describe my complexion when I use this product.</li>
