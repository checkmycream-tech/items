            <li>I am very satisfied</li>

            <li>It looks better in person than it does online.  </li>
            <li>I wanted it to fit on the stand!  </li>
            <li>I have seen better brushes.  </li>
            <li>I may have to spend more.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy another one for sure.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad brush, its just that there are some better brushes here in the similar price range (EJ Best Badger).    </li>
            <li>PRICE &amp; BRUSH QUALITY OVERALL IS VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush to own whether it&#x27;s your first brush or replacing an old one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaving brush to those wanting something inexpensive and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in my hand and is also just the right size to hang properly on my shaving stand.  </li>
            <li>It holds an amazing amount of hot water and produces clouds of shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Read the enclosed instruction to get the longest use and benefits of this fine brush.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, it is as advertised a very good shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>Applying the the lather to my face with this brush feels great, and it&#x27;s part of what makes my wet shaving experience so enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I noticed that some posters said this is cheap plastic, but it seems to be acrylic as stated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic brush.</li>
            <li>spend a few dollars more for an exceptional shave!</li>
            <li>This badger is worth the &amp;#34; entry &amp;#34; fee!</li>
            <li>Great soft brush that lathers up all soaps or creams very well; have been using now for 1-2 years and bristles very rarely come out of handle.</li>
            <li>Nice brush, very soft.  </li>
            <li>Pure badger shaving brush is excellent and at a fraction of the cost at other websites.</li>
            <li>The handle on the brush I got looks like a cheap imitation of something out of the Great Gatsby or a Paris Hilton porn video.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this Omega brush for almost ten years and it is as good as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>It lathers my soap well and feels a heck of a lot better than my grandfather&#x27;s horsehair brush and has a reasonable price to match.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews when I was searching, and they were true, this brush is just what I was looking for in my price range.</li>
            <li>This item was as described and at a fair price, a must have for those people who do not use pig hair brushes, and my husband uses his daily.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced well, has a great size (not too big or small), and looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can spend considerably more and, quite possibly, the quality of the fur, the way it&#x27;s mounted might be somewhat better but the bottom line is that for an inexpensive Pure Badge Brush, this is just fine.</li>
            <li>At 60 yrs of age I have learned something new and  better....</li>
            <li>This is the third shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned and I love it!  </li>
            <li>VERY GOOD QUALITY, A LITTLE PINCH GIVES LOTS OF FLAVOR, THE REAL DEAL FOR PAELLA A LA VALENCINA, WILL BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li>doing a lot of research, I&#x27;ve found that this brush is great for first-timers and veterans alike, and placed an order, along with a green rubber shaving mug.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t go into detail about this brush, but to put it in simple words, its is amazing.</li>
            <li>It holds the moisture and the warm shaving medium, doesn&#x27;t drip, and is supple allowing one to press foam into all necessary places.</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It seems fresh and well packaged</li>
            <li>The brush itself is nice enough and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>A great little brush!  </li>
            <li>Squirting a small amount of Proraso shaving cream into the mug, I lathered up with the brush, and it felt great.  </li>
            <li>To be fair I only shave once a week, and it is mostly around my beard, not my whole face, but 3 years of use is still a long time.  </li>
            <li>The first one was taken by my son, and I am so grateful he took it.  </li>
            <li>Not much flavor but adds nice color.  </li>
            <li>It lost two hairs on my first shave but hasn&#x27;t lost any since.  </li>
            <li>This Omega 63171 most definitely for fills the &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft shaving package!!</li>
            <li>I bought this with my first &#x27;real&#x27; shaving supplies and haven&#x27;t been dissatisfied with it yet.</li>
            <li>I prefer more pungent spices, but I suppose this is meant to be more subtle.</li>
            <li>Any true affection ado appreciates a close shave: that requires a good razor and a shaving lather applied by a brush not too hard and yet not too soft.</li>
            <li>That was actually my main concern in purchasing my first brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before, but since I&#x27;m quite the hairy fellow and shave quite often, lathering with a real brush piqued my interest.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I have no idea how much money I&#x27;ve saved since I have forgotten how much shaving cream in a can and fancy blades cost, but I can guarantee it is quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute steal for the price.</li>
            <li>however, I doubt anyone would ever really notice when applying shave cream to ones face.</li>
            <li>Was used to using a much cheaper brush and was hesitant to purchase this.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft, sturdy hairs; lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The hairs stiffen over time, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first brush as I am new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>Simple and clean.  </li>
            <li>Sure there are more expensive, fancier brushes around</li>
            <li>I received a lot more of the product compared to what I received for the same price locally.</li>
            <li>I own a silver tip badger shaving brush from Omega which I like, and when I ordered this brush (which I keep in my summer home), I expected the same softness of the &amp;#34;silver tip&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>The brush pictured has a nice simple handle that looks like a plastic imitation of ivory.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra couple bucks for this quality.</li>
            <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles that lather the soap well.</li>
            <li>But I heard that&#x27;s normal since it is, after all, real badger hair, and wet animal fur isn&#x27;t exactly pleasing to the nostrils.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dang, it is really soft!</li>
            <li>The grip is a bit small for my large hands, but it makes sense as any larger will likely be too large for most soap dishes.</li>
            <li>brush comes with a little plastic stand that is used to keep the brush facing down to let it dry out after use, and the only issue I&#x27;ve found is that some hairs go astray after use, but that seems to be normal and can easily be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;Not applying too much pressure, the brush is very soft against the skin, and I can already tell my skin feels a lot better after using this.</li>
            <li>To the purist, the only way to prepare one&#x27;s face is with a pure Badger bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I learned that I have to use circular motions, and was also surprised to find an odious aroma seeping from the brush.  </li>
            <li>I placed an old 4 dollar boar hair brush in it, and it now lives in my travel bag.</li>
            <li>It is simple black with a giant clear plastic nob mounted on the top.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are quite prickly which surprised me as none of my other pure badger brushes had prickly bristles.  </li>
            <li>Its also quite floppy though that maybe due to the large loft size.  </li>
            <li>I am returning this item because it was just barely less soft than the $55 one they sell at the fancey shaving store in the mall, but my dad is really picky and he wanted the pricier one</li>
            <li>Wet shaving with one of these and a double edged shaver is really the way to go.  </li>
            <li>Hairs may come loose in the first week or so of use, but this is to be expected since you&#x27;re still breaking it in.</li>
            <li>The brush was a bit stiff at first.  </li>

            <li> Was used to using a much cheaper brush and was hesitant to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft, sturdy hairs; lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The hairs stiffen over time, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first brush as I am new to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> Simple and clean.  </li>
            <li> Sure there are more expensive, fancier brushes around</li>
            <li> I received a lot more of the product compared to what I received for the same price locally.</li>
            <li> I own a silver tip badger shaving brush from Omega which I like, and when I ordered this brush (which I keep in my summer home), I expected the same softness of the &amp;#34;silver tip&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> The brush pictured has a nice simple handle that looks like a plastic imitation of ivory.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra couple bucks for this quality.</li>
            <li> and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles that lather the soap well.</li>
            <li> But I heard that&#x27;s normal since it is, after all, real badger hair, and wet animal fur isn&#x27;t exactly pleasing to the nostrils.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dang, it is really soft!</li>
            <li> The grip is a bit small for my large hands, but it makes sense as any larger will likely be too large for most soap dishes.</li>
            <li> brush comes with a little plastic stand that is used to keep the brush facing down to let it dry out after use, and the only issue I&#x27;ve found is that some hairs go astray after use, but that seems to be normal and can easily be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;Not applying too much pressure, the brush is very soft against the skin, and I can already tell my skin feels a lot better after using this.</li>
            <li> To the purist, the only way to prepare one&#x27;s face is with a pure Badger bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I learned that I have to use circular motions, and was also surprised to find an odious aroma seeping from the brush.  </li>
            <li> I placed an old 4 dollar boar hair brush in it, and it now lives in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> It is simple black with a giant clear plastic nob mounted on the top.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are quite prickly which surprised me as none of my other pure badger brushes had prickly bristles.  </li>
            <li> Its also quite floppy though that maybe due to the large loft size.  </li>
            <li> I am returning this item because it was just barely less soft than the $55 one they sell at the fancey shaving store in the mall, but my dad is really picky and he wanted the pricier one</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with one of these and a double edged shaver is really the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Hairs may come loose in the first week or so of use, but this is to be expected since you&#x27;re still breaking it in.</li>
            <li> The brush was a bit stiff at first.  </li>
            <li> It looks very sharp on my chrome shaving stand next to my new Merkur long handled razor.  </li>
            <li> Usually I pass the brush through hot running water and smear a dab of shaving cream onto the wet brush.</li>
            <li> Stand was very cheap, that was disappointing but brush does need to be hung to dry</li>
            <li> The hairs are sturdy on the handle, so I never have to worry about being gentle while I work up a thick lather.</li>
            <li> next time I spend a few extra $$$ to get a softer brush.</li>
            <li> (I have a deep cleft in my chin and, oddly, the brush does what my fingers can&#x27;t seem to do; get it covered on all sides and</li>
            <li> Like they were made for each other.  </li>
            <li> If I where to complain about anything is that the base that comes with the brush is very cheap.</li>
            <li> The package contains a brush, brush stand for proper drying, and hard plastic tube for travel.</li>
            <li> After using it about half a dozen times, the knot came out of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have less razor burn and irritation using this.  </li>
            <li> It gets my face plenty covered up in just a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> A bit stiff for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Also, the handle is way too small for me.</li>
            <li> The large plastic bags are unnecessary and awkward.</li>
            <li> After 30-40 seconds of lathering, the bowl and brush are covered in a thick creamy lather.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for Omega, I bought this along with a couple of other brushes.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a faux onyx/marble type and unfortunately does not fit into my existing stand.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, it&#x27;s a bit stiff and tends to &amp;#34;jab&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong for brush around thirty bucks.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I had a similarly priced item from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn for 12 years that was a delight to use. I didn&#x27;t treat it as well as I should have and it fell apart. I like Omega&#x27;s shave cream so thought I&#x27;d give the brush a try. I don&#x27;t know if mine is a fluke, but it&#x27;s like using a wire brush to apply the cream. No matter what touch I use, my face feels pierced in multiple spots. Nothing like the C&amp;E described above. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you read up on the best ways to shave your face you&#x27;ll quickly realize that authors spit on electric razors and disdain two, three and four bladed razors that one purches as well as shaving foam that comes in a can. To the purist, the only way to prepare one&#x27;s face is with a pure Badger bristle brush. It will deliver the best foam from, of course, a cake of shaving soap or, in a pinch, a tube of shaving cream. It holds the moisture and the warm shaving medium, doesn&#x27;t drip, and is supple allowing one to press foam into all necessary places. (I have a deep cleft in my chin and, oddly, the brush does what my fingers can&#x27;t seem to do; get it covered on all sides and depths.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend considerably more and, quite possibly, the quality of the fur, the way it&#x27;s mounted might be somewhat better but the bottom line is that for an inexpensive Pure Badge Brush, this is just fine. It&#x27;s the sort of thing that will, eventually, get left somewhere and you won&#x27;t go into withdrawal symptoms remembering what it cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mine for several months and it dries well, has lost none of the fluffiness you want in a brush and is altogether a satisfactory shaving addtion.</li>
            <li> My husband was needing a replacement brush. I chose this one as a birthday gift this last year. He says it is great. Very soft bristles that lather the soap well. Looks like it will last longer than the others. Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good product. The large plastic bags are unnecessary and awkward. But good saffron. Makes very good risotto.</li>
            <li> Everyone else has already said it, this thing is a good value and a great brush.  Love this thing.  Worth the extra couple bucks for this quality.</li>
            <li> Purchased in 2008.  Used daily.  Still in great condition.</li>
            <li> What a grand bargain!!!! This brush is super soft shaving package!! The package contains a brush, brush stand for proper drying, and hard plastic tube for travel. Read the enclosed instruction to get the longest use and benefits of this fine brush.</li>
            <li> About a year or so ago, I purchased this Omega badger brush on amazon. After using it about half a dozen times, the knot came out of the handle. I am very disappointed with the quality of Omega brushes. The knot should never come out of the handle. I guess Italian products are not what they used to be. Also, the handle is way too small for me.</li>
            <li> This is the second shaving brush for me.  The first one was taken by my son, and I am so grateful he took it.  This brush is excellent both for the price and quality of the brush.  It holds an amazing amount of hot water and produces clouds of shaving soap.  I highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before, but since I&#x27;m quite the hairy fellow and shave quite often, lathering with a real brush piqued my interest.&lt;br /&gt;After doing a lot of research, I&#x27;ve found that this brush is great for first-timers and veterans alike, and placed an order, along with a green rubber shaving mug.  Squirting a small amount of Proraso shaving cream into the mug, I lathered up with the brush, and it felt great.  I learned that I have to use circular motions, and was also surprised to find an odious aroma seeping from the brush.  But I heard that&#x27;s normal since it is, after all, real badger hair, and wet animal fur isn&#x27;t exactly pleasing to the nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with a little plastic stand that is used to keep the brush facing down to let it dry out after use, and the only issue I&#x27;ve found is that some hairs go astray after use, but that seems to be normal and can easily be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;Not applying too much pressure, the brush is very soft against the skin, and I can already tell my skin feels a lot better after using this.</li>
            <li> Pure badger shaving brush is excellent and at a fraction of the cost at other websites.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this new spice, but I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.  Not much flavor but adds nice color.  I prefer more pungent spices, but I suppose this is meant to be more subtle.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t go into detail about this brush, but to put it in simple words, its is amazing. coming from a walmart $5 brush.. i have used it for about 5 times and have no issues with it. worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Omega brush for almost ten years and it is as good as the day I got it. Amazing quality.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it is as advertised a very good shaving brush.  Not bad for the money.  I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, very soft.  Great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 2010 and have had zero problems with it.  Sure there are more expensive, fancier brushes around but this just gets the job done.  It gets my face plenty covered up in just a few seconds.  To be fair I only shave once a week, and it is mostly around my beard, not my whole face, but 3 years of use is still a long time.  Wet shaving with one of these and a double edged shaver is really the way to go.  I have no idea how much money I&#x27;ve saved since I have forgotten how much shaving cream in a can and fancy blades cost, but I can guarantee it is quite a bit.  Great shaves!</li>
            <li> This is a really good value for Saffron. I received a lot more of the product compared to what I received for the same price locally. It seems fresh and well packaged so it doesn&#x27;t break up in shipping.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with brush.  Stand is useable but very light plastic.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great soft brush that lathers up all soaps or creams very well; have been using now for 1-2 years and bristles very rarely come out of handle.</li>
            <li> It surpassed my expectations.  I love it and plan on getting another like it if the time comes where I have to replace it.  I highly recommend this shaving brush to those wanting something inexpensive and of good quality.  I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> This is the third shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned and I love it!  It&#x27;s an absolute steal for the price. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this with my first &#x27;real&#x27; shaving supplies and haven&#x27;t been dissatisfied with it yet. Hairs may come loose in the first week or so of use, but this is to be expected since you&#x27;re still breaking it in. It lathers my soap well and feels a heck of a lot better than my grandfather&#x27;s horsehair brush and has a reasonable price to match.</li>
            <li> I bought this in my search for the perfect brush.  This is not a bad brush, its just that there are some better brushes here in the similar price range (EJ Best Badger).    The bristles are quite prickly which surprised me as none of my other pure badger brushes had prickly bristles.  Its also quite floppy though that maybe due to the large loft size.  It makes a good amount of lather.  The bristles also still smell, despite several shave soap/cream washing, including an overnight shampoo.      The handle is a faux onyx/marble type and unfortunately does not fit into my existing stand.  The brush comes with its own travel case and stand though.    Unfortunately for Omega, I bought this along with a couple of other brushes.  I would recommend shavers check out the EJ brush.  There is a world of difference:  [...]</li>
            <li> The brush itself is nice enough and well worth the price.  I am not so happy with the handle.  The brush pictured has a nice simple handle that looks like a plastic imitation of ivory.  Simple and clean.  That is what I wanted.  The handle on the brush I got looks like a cheap imitation of something out of the Great Gatsby or a Paris Hilton porn video.  It is simple black with a giant clear plastic nob mounted on the top.  I have no doubt that if Annie followed the Mona Lisa all the way to the bathroom we would have seen the Hope Diamond (only slightly smaller than the faux bling on this monstrosity) mounted on a shaving brush that looked something like the one I received.  I considered sending it back for that reason but ultimately couldn&#x27;t be bothered.  On another note, the plastic case in which it came is perfect for using as a travel case.  I placed an old 4 dollar boar hair brush in it, and it now lives in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews when I was searching, and they were true, this brush is just what I was looking for in my price range.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a recommendation to help with shaving.  It does help prepare your face for the shave.  I have less razor burn and irritation using this.  I have had it for a year and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> I have a very expensive The Art of shaving Silvertip badger brush, a cheaper boar brush and this one, this one is my daily brush. It performs well with shaving creams and soaps. It&#x27;s priced well, has a great size (not too big or small), and looks great. If I where to complain about anything is that the base that comes with the brush is very cheap. If you are looking for a good brush this one will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Ive tried multiple types of brushes and this one is still the best brush. I recommend this one to anyone. Its Perfect!</li>
            <li> NEVER SHAVED WITH A BRUSH BEFORE. I LOVE IT! EXCELLENT PRODUCT FOR PRICE. I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW ANYONE CAN SHAVE WITHOUT A BRUSH. OMEGA 63171 IS EXCELLENT STARTER BRUSH AND WILL IN THE FUTURE LOOK OUT FOR THEIR. STAND IS CHINCY BUT PRICE &amp; BRUSH QUALITY OVERALL IS VERY GOOD. SHIPPED QUICKLY BY THIS SELLER AND RECEIVED IN GOOD FORM. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY, A LITTLE PINCH GIVES LOTS OF FLAVOR, THE REAL DEAL FOR PAELLA A LA VALENCINA, WILL BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush as I am new to DE shaving.  It looks better in person than it does online.  I noticed that some posters said this is cheap plastic, but it seems to be acrylic as stated.  It looks very sharp on my chrome shaving stand next to my new Merkur long handled razor.  It fits perfectly in my hand and is also just the right size to hang properly on my shaving stand.  That was actually my main concern in purchasing my first brush.  I wanted it to fit on the stand!  I bought The Escali Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand and it fits perfectly.  Like they were made for each other.  It lost two hairs on my first shave but hasn&#x27;t lost any since.  I am very happy with this purchase.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong for brush around thirty bucks.</li>
            <li> I am returning this item because it was just barely less soft than the $55 one they sell at the fancey shaving store in the mall, but my dad is really picky and he wanted the pricier one however, I doubt anyone would ever really notice when applying shave cream to ones face.</li>
            <li> This item was as described and at a fair price, a must have for those people who do not use pig hair brushes, and my husband uses his daily.</li>
            <li> A great little brush!  Well put-together and gets the job done.  The grip is a bit small for my large hands, but it makes sense as any larger will likely be too large for most soap dishes.</li>
            <li> I have seen better brushes.  It is a good entry level brush.  A bit stiff for my liking.  I may have to spend more.</li>
            <li> Dang, it is really soft!</li>
            <li> I own a silver tip badger shaving brush from Omega which I like, and when I ordered this brush (which I keep in my summer home), I expected the same softness of the &amp;#34;silver tip&amp;#34;.  Sorry, it&#x27;s a bit stiff and tends to &amp;#34;jab&amp;#34; the skin if not held correctly.  Thought I was getting the same quality...but didn&#x27;t....next time I spend a few extra $$$ to get a softer brush.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice. Was used to using a much cheaper brush and was hesitant to purchase this. Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Soft, sturdy hairs; lasts for years.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The hairs stiffen over time, but it doesn&#x27;t really affect the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic brush. The hairs are sturdy on the handle, so I never have to worry about being gentle while I work up a thick lather. In the three years I&#x27;ve owned this brush, I&#x27;ve seen a hair fall off maybe once or twice. The hairs have stiffened over time, but the brush still performs wonderfully. Usually I pass the brush through hot running water and smear a dab of shaving cream onto the wet brush. After 30-40 seconds of lathering, the bowl and brush are covered in a thick creamy lather. Applying the the lather to my face with this brush feels great, and it&#x27;s part of what makes my wet shaving experience so enjoyable. This is a great brush to own whether it&#x27;s your first brush or replacing an old one.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it although I though it was a bit pricey.  Works well.  Stand was very cheap, that was disappointing but brush does need to be hung to dry so it&#x27;s necessary.</li>
            <li> Any true affection ado appreciates a close shave: that requires a good razor and a shaving lather applied by a brush not too hard and yet not too soft. This Omega 63171 most definitely for fills the &amp;#34; brush &amp;#34; aspect.  At 60 yrs of age I have learned something new and  better....spend a few dollars more for an exceptional shave! This badger is worth the &amp;#34; entry &amp;#34; fee!</li>
            <li> The brush was a bit stiff at first.  It has softened with use.  Works up a very good lather and has not lost one bristle.  I&#x27;d buy another one for sure.</li>
