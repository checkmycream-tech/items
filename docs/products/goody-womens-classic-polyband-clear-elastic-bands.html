            <li>Perfect for tying up tulips.  </li>
            <li>perfect for all the braided hairstyles, and pony tails, too.</li>
            <li>These are a great deal on here and they work perfect.</li>
            <li>They are great.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly, just like many Goody products.</li>
            <li>Also good for under ribbons.</li>
            <li>Thats the good news...</li>
            <li>I reuse them often, surprisingly they don&#x27;t lose their stretch and hold well after many uses!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>And to top off that great fact, it does not pull or break the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Goody bands are so much better than Scunci!</li>
            <li>The seller was very good and got the product to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I read another review that said these were the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; kind of rubber bands that did not break.  </li>
            <li>These are nice and strong, they don&#x27;t break, and they don&#x27;t pull your hair out!</li>
            <li>They got tangled in my hair very easily</li>
            <li>These are very strong and colorless.  </li>
            <li>The old ones were the best thing ever!  </li>
            <li>They are the BEST, because they are strong, yet gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>and so many I have bought were insufficient.</li>
            <li>But if you drop it you&#x27;ll never find it again :)</li>
            <li>So cheaply made!  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use each one more than once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better ones that can be used repeatedly, but can&#x27;t remember the brand.  </li>
            <li>These elastic bands are ok.</li>
            <li>....so people would have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>These are so good for fun styles without being too bulky or showy.</li>
            <li>Will order more.  </li>
            <li>but I have found I prefer the snag proof elastic better.</li>
            <li>They are simply the perfect hair tie.</li>
            <li>I used to get a zillion wears from these and the reason I needed to order more was because I lost them all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can order Goody&#x27;s on line.</li>
            <li>love these, you cannot see them and they hold up well.</li>
            <li>I love these for flower arranging.</li>
            <li>So glad they are available online.</li>
            <li>and they break easily.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that they don&#x27;t snag my hair and are easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Now, they snap and break easily.</li>
            <li>I wear these for work and they easily come on and off.</li>
            <li>They can be \\&quot;layered\\&quot; under a more decorative ponytail holder that frankly doesn&#x27;t hold, or worn alone as a clean look for the gym or the office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I found them easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li>These hold well, and are strong - won&#x27;t break on you.</li>
            <li>They hold my daughter&#x27;s fine hair in place.</li>
            <li>These little elastic bands are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes use them to secure my hair, then use a decorative clip over them, if I want a dressier</li>
            <li>I used to have keep redoing my hair because the clip wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair securely.  </li>
            <li>All I want are the original elastics I&#x27;ve used forever!!&lt;br /&gt;Side</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this size works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving these one star because I used to love these so so much.  </li>
            <li>They look so much better than the old kind and hold the hair really well.  </li>
            <li>a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I found scunnci brand to have a thicker/more bully silicone elastic that is very good so far!</li>
            <li>Flimsy, break really easy, exactly what I was trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li>Other companies make the clear ones, but Goody makes the best ones!!</li>
            <li>However, after wearing it for half a day I realize that it is a great improvement from the scunci ones I got from Walgreens.</li>
            <li>and I am still using the original 4 that I got out of the package when I first got them.  </li>
            <li>Also, clear is not the best look against my black hair.</li>
            <li>I have also found that if I need to hold just a tiny bit of hair, they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love these clear plastic bands.  </li>
            <li>These are worth the logistical hassle of buying online.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made no attempt to make the situation right or even try to defend their products.</li>
            <li>After seeing so many cute hairstyles on Pinterest that have fishtail braids, water fall braids, over under braids, and so on, most of the tutorials all use these small clear rubberbands.</li>
            <li>Not the old style, flimsy and stretch out easily</li>
            <li>Recently they changed how they were made and now they break super easily.</li>
            <li>They do exactly what you would expect them to.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It stretches out the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>These are the only elastics I&#x27;ve ever been able to use in her hair.</li>
            <li>These hair bands are amazing...strong and durable for a tiny piece of elastic plastic :)  </li>
            <li>Some of the bands will stretch to hold a lot more than the 3/8\\&quot;, as I stated earlier.  </li>
            <li>I mean we couldn&#x27;t possibly have a product that would work and be good quality out there!!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty much disposable.</li>
            <li>These are good for incorporating into updos because they are small</li>
            <li>they do not break easily like traditional hair rubber bands.  </li>
            <li>They used to be sooo good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very durable for up to 4 uses under these conditions, but eventually they do stretch and break.  </li>
            <li>These elastic bands work really well.</li>
            <li>They are also very flexible and I have had yet to have one break.</li>
            <li>it shouldn&#x27;t be too much work to get them out.</li>
            <li>Nice firm hold, too.</li>
            <li>Only downside is they are easy to lose as they are clear.  </li>
            <li>and right now I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>I would just avoid this line in particular.)</li>
            <li>submitted this review on the goody website for this particular product and they emailed me saying the review dos not meet their guidelines and would not be published!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend using</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if they were just a little bit more flexible.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money until the company decides to quit being so cheap and go back to the old formula.  </li>
            <li>It has now been over a year since I wrote the last review on these amazing little bands.  </li>
            <li>Nope, these are the new ones that break in your hair, after one use, etc.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and very thick, so I really doubted that they would hold it, but they&#x27;re amazing!  </li>
            <li>, they donâ€™t stretch very far but that was ok with me because i had a small amount of hair i needed to &#x27;wrap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>ive used clear ones and multi colored ones in all various sizes, all have been amazing and a single package seemed like it was lasting forever.</li>
            <li>I can re-use them if I can manage to get them out of my hair without cutting them, but I cut them most of the time because I&#x27;m too tired after work (seam rippers work the best).</li>
            <li>I wish I could find the old ones somewhere!</li>
            <li>These bands felt stiff and I wasn&#x27;t sure I could double them around my ponytail, but they hold up very well...</li>
            <li>They are too tiny, just big enough to fit over my whole braid.</li>
            <li>I bought these clear bands probably 10 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find new ones to replace.</li>
            <li>Clear shows quite clearly!</li>
            <li>What a disappointing change in a formerly great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for high-quality, clear hair elastics (comparable to the ones Sephora used to sell) and will update this review if I find any.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they are clear</li>
            <li>These are clear plastic bands for ponytails.</li>
            <li>Nothing like the old ones.</li>
            <li>I use them with curled hair to make soft side buns, and with those hair donut things that look like sea urchins.</li>
            <li>The bands break frequently and I will not buy again</li>
            <li>They do the job very well, and I have not had any luck finding them in stores- only on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Each time I use it I expect it to break, but so far....</li>
            <li>It has NOTHING to do with the thickness of your hair because they break on my 4 year old daughters hair too</li>
            <li>I even contacted goody with all this information and was completely ignored.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or your money</li>
            <li>These last much longer than the Scunci bands; and they don&#x27;t break either when I am swimming in the ocean or in a pool.</li>
            <li>Most of them break as I&#x27;m trying to use it for the second time ever, and a few of them have snapped off as I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for so many years now and the last few times I&#x27;ve bought them they break the minute you put them in your hair.  </li>
            <li>They did the trick but be careful as they snap somewhat easily when stretched too far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that they all may not last as long as the one I&#x27;m presently using, but if each one just lasts a few nights I will be delighted.</li>
            <li>Those, while not always the most comfortable, at least tended to last a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they are slick so on a person with smooth shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li>Same junk Goody clear rubberbands that you find in the stores!</li>
            <li>No slipping!  </li>
            <li>and she barely has any.  </li>
            <li>Holds flowers in place a barely visible.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very dark hair, and these clear bands are more visible than when I wear a solid black, wrapped comfort hair band.</li>
            <li>I like these bands because they are linguine-shaped (flat not round) and don&#x27;t pull like &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34</li>
            <li>However, if you give them a good hard pull, they will stretch to at least twice that size, but they almost never break.</li>
            <li>With this clear ones, my hair can stay in pretty well for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzing</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stretch enough to work on a large hank of hair, but if you need to band a hank of 3/8\\&quot; or less, they will work well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far they seem to hold up over several wearings.</li>
            <li>Stretch out too much and don&#x27;t stay tight.</li>
            <li>There were several slightly negative ratings about them not being east to stretch, being too small, etc, but they are just short of amazing.  </li>

            <li> love these, you cannot see them and they hold up well.</li>
            <li> I love these for flower arranging.</li>
            <li> So glad they are available online.</li>
            <li> and they break easily.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that they don&#x27;t snag my hair and are easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Now, they snap and break easily.</li>
            <li> I wear these for work and they easily come on and off.</li>
            <li> They can be \\&quot;layered\\&quot; under a more decorative ponytail holder that frankly doesn&#x27;t hold, or worn alone as a clean look for the gym or the office.&lt;br</li>

            <li> They look so much better than the old kind and hold the hair really well.  </li>
            <li> a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I found scunnci brand to have a thicker/more bully silicone elastic that is very good so far!</li>
            <li> Flimsy, break really easy, exactly what I was trying to avoid.  </li>
            <li> Other companies make the clear ones, but Goody makes the best ones!!</li>
            <li> However, after wearing it for half a day I realize that it is a great improvement from the scunci ones I got from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> and I am still using the original 4 that I got out of the package when I first got them.  </li>
            <li> Also, clear is not the best look against my black hair.</li>
            <li> I have also found that if I need to hold just a tiny bit of hair, they are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love these clear plastic bands.  </li>
            <li> These are worth the logistical hassle of buying online.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made no attempt to make the situation right or even try to defend their products.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping as well!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It stretches out the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> These are the only elastics I&#x27;ve ever been able to use in her hair.</li>
            <li> These hair bands are amazing...strong and durable for a tiny piece of elastic plastic :)  </li>
            <li> Some of the bands will stretch to hold a lot more than the 3/8\\&quot;, as I stated earlier.  </li>

            <li> They used to be sooo good and last a long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very durable for up to 4 uses under these conditions, but eventually they do stretch and break.  </li>
            <li> These elastic bands work really well.</li>
            <li> They are also very flexible and I have had yet to have one break.</li>
            <li> it shouldn&#x27;t be too much work to get them out.</li>
            <li> Nice firm hold, too.</li>
            <li> Only downside is they are easy to lose as they are clear.  </li>
            <li> and right now I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> I would just avoid this line in particular.)</li>
            <li> submitted this review on the goody website for this particular product and they emailed me saying the review dos not meet their guidelines and would not be published!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend using</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if they were just a little bit more flexible.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money until the company decides to quit being so cheap and go back to the old formula.  </li>
            <li> It has now been over a year since I wrote the last review on these amazing little bands.  </li>
            <li> Nope, these are the new ones that break in your hair, after one use, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and very thick, so I really doubted that they would hold it, but they&#x27;re amazing!  </li>
            <li> , they donâ€™t stretch very far but that was ok with me because i had a small amount of hair i needed to &#x27;wrap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> ive used clear ones and multi colored ones in all various sizes, all have been amazing and a single package seemed like it was lasting forever.</li>
            <li> I can re-use them if I can manage to get them out of my hair without cutting them, but I cut them most of the time because I&#x27;m too tired after work (seam rippers work the best).</li>
            <li> I wish I could find the old ones somewhere!</li>
            <li> These bands felt stiff and I wasn&#x27;t sure I could double them around my ponytail, but they hold up very well...</li>
            <li> They are too tiny, just big enough to fit over my whole braid.</li>
            <li> I bought these clear bands probably 10 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find new ones to replace.</li>
            <li> Clear shows quite clearly!</li>
            <li> What a disappointing change in a formerly great product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for high-quality, clear hair elastics (comparable to the ones Sephora used to sell) and will update this review if I find any.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are clear</li>
            <li> These are clear plastic bands for ponytails.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the old ones.</li>
            <li> I use them with curled hair to make soft side buns, and with those hair donut things that look like sea urchins.</li>
            <li> The bands break frequently and I will not buy again</li>
            <li> They do the job very well, and I have not had any luck finding them in stores- only on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it I expect it to break, but so far....</li>
            <li> It has NOTHING to do with the thickness of your hair because they break on my 4 year old daughters hair too</li>
            <li> I even contacted goody with all this information and was completely ignored.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or your money</li>
            <li> These last much longer than the Scunci bands; and they don&#x27;t break either when I am swimming in the ocean or in a pool.</li>
            <li> Most of them break as I&#x27;m trying to use it for the second time ever, and a few of them have snapped off as I&#x27;m out and about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for so many years now and the last few times I&#x27;ve bought them they break the minute you put them in your hair.  </li>
            <li> They did the trick but be careful as they snap somewhat easily when stretched too far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that they all may not last as long as the one I&#x27;m presently using, but if each one just lasts a few nights I will be delighted.</li>
            <li> Those, while not always the most comfortable, at least tended to last a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, they are slick so on a person with smooth shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> Same junk Goody clear rubberbands that you find in the stores!</li>
            <li> No slipping!  </li>
            <li> and she barely has any.  </li>
            <li> Holds flowers in place a barely visible.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very dark hair, and these clear bands are more visible than when I wear a solid black, wrapped comfort hair band.</li>
            <li> I like these bands because they are linguine-shaped (flat not round) and don&#x27;t pull like &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34</li>
            <li> However, if you give them a good hard pull, they will stretch to at least twice that size, but they almost never break.</li>
            <li> With this clear ones, my hair can stay in pretty well for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzing</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stretch enough to work on a large hank of hair, but if you need to band a hank of 3/8\\&quot; or less, they will work well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far they seem to hold up over several wearings.</li>
            <li> Stretch out too much and don&#x27;t stay tight.</li>
            <li> There were several slightly negative ratings about them not being east to stretch, being too small, etc, but they are just short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have a 7 yr old girl with super thick hair down to her bottom.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, so I wish I bend them 3 times around my ponytail for a better hold.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands of clear elastics, these Goody bands do not cause hair breakage, or get tangled into hair when trying to remove the elastic at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> They work on ponytails large and small.</li>
            <li> I have not made a purchase with such negativity in a long time.</li>
            <li> A long, long time ago, I used actual rubber bands to tie my hair together.</li>
            <li> Only problem (?) is that they are nearly invisible which could be a plus for some, but for those of us with aging eyesight, they are hard to see outside of the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them 3 times in one week and every single time they snap while in my hair for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> So I thought it was a bad package and bought more at a different store with the very same problem.</li>
            <li> I hate having a bright hair tie in my hair and hear you can&#x27;t notice .</li>
            <li> These are a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I use these in my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found one that will stretch to hold my whole ponytail, but I have really thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought black ones too just to try something different with the same problem.</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair rubber bands but these will last for weeks/months.</li>
            <li> They would eventually get excessively stretched out and yet they would just keep going and never break!</li>
            <li> elastic bands were dry rotted they all popped while on my hair</li>
            <li> Where I live its hard to find this type of band.  </li>
            <li> this is much less of a pull than say a regular rubber band - but it still does pull a bit.</li>
            <li> the Goody Clear Elastic Bands, the material is thin, easily tangled (and difficult to untangle), and extremely limited in stretchability.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to get a secure, lasting hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the bad reviews because my  pack came earlier than I expected, a little less than a week, and work fantastic for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been making tiny little braids with these.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, so I&#x27;m not sure how they would work with thick or course hair because they are small.</li>
            <li> All I can do with my daughters hair is a single long braid and even then they don&#x27;t survive even a half school day.</li>
            <li> and I often have to painfully pull them out (with many hairs attached).  </li>
            <li> and I have only had a few of them break on me over the course of three years (purchased in 2012).</li>
            <li> Just be careful taking them out bc they can pull at your hair.</li>
            <li> There is not much stretch in them</li>
            <li> I finally ran out and bought a package a few months ago.......</li>
            <li> On the plus side, they don&#x27;t pull her hair out, on the minus side, they fall out.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have thin hair, this will work okay, but for me, it&#x27;s worse than rubber</li>
            <li> Now that I have used these a little longer, I have found out that all of the bands are not exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and I&#x27;ve used other Goody bands with success, so it&#x27;s not like my hair is impossible to curtail in general.</li>
            <li> I use these on my horse&#x27;s very thick heavy mane, to keep it off his neck during the hot summer months.  </li>
            <li> I put my hair in a pony tail each night for sleep, and I have been using the same little band every night for 23 nights!  </li>
            <li> I use these to make my buns look neater (by gathering my loose ends with a band before bobby pinning it down... as opposed to just pinning the ends down).</li>
            <li> I cannot even use these in my mid length thin hair for a simple pony tail.</li>
            <li> and they loose elasticity in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I first got it in the mail because the band does not feel very elastic and it feels very thin.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Stretch too far, and also too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them a couple of months now, and wear one almost every day, and so far not one has broken.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t stand her hair down</li>
            <li> Also, if you have darker brown hair, I would recommend getting the black ones.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they break while in my hair, and they&#x27;re not even being pulled that tightly.</li>
            <li> They do stretch out a little bit as you use them, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The usual reason I have to get out a new one is that I lose them, they are tiny and nearly impossible to see if you drop them.</li>
            <li> Bands were too big for thin hair.</li>
            <li> heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years, but just started having trouble finding them in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I have owned them several weeks now and none have broken yet.  </li>
            <li> so I use these to tame it while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality - they stretch out immediately and break very easily.</li>
            <li> Not much more i can say about these...</li>
            <li> I like to make small braids in my hair with these</li>
            <li> Not much more to say about a rubber</li>
            <li> - they&#x27;re just breaking randomly in the middle of the day!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they are hard to get out</li>
            <li> However, I found putting it on a little hard, as the band stretches to be so thin that it hurts my fingers.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Unable to reuse and have tight for my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> so I felt it a little difficult to get around my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these to grab the hair that would get in my eyes into bunches and band these behind my ears.</li>
            <li> Goody decreased quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them about a year and not one has broken.  </li>
            <li> Alas, it&#x27;s been about 10 years, so I&#x27;m not counting on that.</li>
            <li> I have others that eventually snap or get so stretched they are worthless.  </li>
            <li> However, it must be terribly difficult to make these so poorly.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> (sorry, I&#x27;m so pissed because I&#x27;ve had 5 of them break on my hair and</li>
            <li> Every day Ill be sitting at my computer at work</li>
            <li> and Ill feel it snap</li>
            <li> On a bad day though, if I&#x27;m really tired and don&#x27;t feel like working it out of my ponytail, i just cut it out.</li>
            <li> Partly it is because scunci ones are just terrible: hair keep slipping out from side</li>
            <li> so we end up cutting them to make life easier.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these!  They are so comfortable.  Have never had one break...ever:0)  I have thick hair and this size works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the old ones. I bought these clear bands probably 10 years ago and couldn&#x27;t find new ones to replace. Bought these and they break easily. Used 3 already and they all broke. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I love these! I use them over and over again and I have only had a few of them break on me over the course of three years (purchased in 2012). The usual reason I have to get out a new one is that I lose them, they are tiny and nearly impossible to see if you drop them. They do stretch out a little bit as you use them, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me. I appreciate that they don&#x27;t snag my hair and are easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Stretch too far, and also too thin.</li>
            <li> I need to keep my hair back when I garden. I use these to grab the hair that would get in my eyes into bunches and band these behind my ears. I like these bands because they are linguine-shaped (flat not round) and don&#x27;t pull like &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; bands. No pain IS a gain in this case. I haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far they seem to hold up over several wearings. Only problem (?) is that they are nearly invisible which could be a plus for some, but for those of us with aging eyesight, they are hard to see outside of the package.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what you would expect them to. I can re-use them if I can manage to get them out of my hair without cutting them, but I cut them most of the time because I&#x27;m too tired after work (seam rippers work the best). I use these to make my buns look neater (by gathering my loose ends with a band before bobby pinning it down... as opposed to just pinning the ends down). Also good for under ribbons. Ever tried tying your hair with just a ribbon? It&#x27;s impossible to get a secure, lasting hold. These make it possible. I would say it&#x27;s an essential hair tool for anyone doing buns or working with bows/ribbons.</li>
            <li> Bands were too big for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere and so many I have bought were insufficient. Fast shipping as well!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> After only using them once they break.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of these for quite some time. They work on ponytails large and small. The best part is they don&#x27;t pull my hair when I&#x27;m taking them out. Big Fan!</li>
            <li> I have bought other hair rubber bands but these will last for weeks/months. I have had others that will break after 1 use.</li>
            <li> For updos. Why didn&#x27;t i buy these before? They don&#x27;t even snap when I double loop them. I use them with curled hair to make soft side buns, and with those hair donut things that look like sea urchins. Ace! But if you drop it you&#x27;ll never find it again :)</li>
            <li> Goody decreased quality of this product.  The bands break frequently and I will not buy again</li>
            <li> So cheaply made!  It stretches out the first time you use it.  Sometimes, it breaks while in use.  Can&#x27;t use each one more than once.  I&#x27;ve had better ones that can be used repeatedly, but can&#x27;t remember the brand.  These are a complete waste of money.  I&#x27;d give it ZERO stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality - they stretch out immediately and break very easily. I&#x27;ve been searching for high-quality, clear hair elastics (comparable to the ones Sephora used to sell) and will update this review if I find any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years. Recently they changed how they were made and now they break super easily. They are one-time use at best. Sometimes they break while in my hair, and they&#x27;re not even being pulled that tightly.</li>
            <li> These bands felt stiff and I wasn&#x27;t sure I could double them around my ponytail, but they hold up very well...and they don&#x27;t pull</li>
            <li> Flimsy, break really easy, exactly what I was trying to avoid.  Same junk Goody clear rubberbands that you find in the stores!</li>
            <li> I use these on my horse&#x27;s very thick heavy mane, to keep it off his neck during the hot summer months.  They&#x27;re very durable for up to 4 uses under these conditions, but eventually they do stretch and break.  I imagine they would last longer used on human hair in cleaner conditions.</li>
            <li> Stretch out too much and don&#x27;t stay tight. Unable to reuse and have tight for my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at all the bad reviews because my  pack came earlier than I expected, a little less than a week, and work fantastic for my hair. They don&#x27;t snap and they don&#x27;t hurt when you take them out. I ordered the 52 pack but I ended up getting sent the 75 pack. Definitely not complaining; a mistake I can actually appreciate. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this elsewhere and tried it today. 1st: I cannot get 2 fingers in one band in order to put it in my hair. Finally, I manage do get one on. 1hour later it was not there. I have not made a purchase with such negativity in a long time. I expect this on products made in THAT communist country. However, it must be terribly difficult to make these so poorly.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when I first got it in the mail because the band does not feel very elastic and it feels very thin. However, after wearing it for half a day I realize that it is a great improvement from the scunci ones I got from Walgreens. Partly it is because scunci ones are just terrible: hair keep slipping out from side and soon I look like a homeless and they loose elasticity in just a few days. With this clear ones, my hair can stay in pretty well for at least a couple hours. However, I found putting it on a little hard, as the band stretches to be so thin that it hurts my fingers. Also, clear is not the best look against my black hair.</li>
            <li> These are the best! The scunci ones always snap but these never do! I wish they were easier to find</li>
            <li> these work well, they donâ€™t stretch very far but that was ok with me because i had a small amount of hair i needed to &#x27;wrap&#x27;.  they do not break easily like traditional hair rubber bands.  heavy duty.  they state they shouldn&#x27;t pull hair when you remove them, but hair does get wrapped around them and still will pull.  this is much less of a pull than say a regular rubber band - but it still does pull a bit.</li>
            <li> 5 stars.  Everyone should get five stars.  I have been making tiny little braids with these.  They are great.  They never break.</li>
            <li> These elastic bands work really well. They hold my daughter&#x27;s fine hair in place. Sometimes they are hard to get out so we end up cutting them to make life easier.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are negative reviews.  These elastics are meant for styles when you don&#x27;t want your ponytail holder to show.  They do the job very well, and I have not had any luck finding them in stores- only on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These little elastic bands are wonderful.  There were several slightly negative ratings about them not being east to stretch, being too small, etc, but they are just short of amazing.  I put my hair in a pony tail each night for sleep, and I have been using the same little band every night for 23 nights!  Each time I use it I expect it to break, but so far....not!  And to top off that great fact, it does not pull or break the hair.  I&#x27;m guessing that they all may not last as long as the one I&#x27;m presently using, but if each one just lasts a few nights I will be delighted. 5-14-15 It has now been over a year since I wrote the last review on these amazing little bands.  I use a band in my hair just about every day and every night.   I braid it and put it up during the day, braid it at night.  I have just used the last band.  You can see I get about a week&#x27;s use out of one band - and that is twice a day!  My hair is fine, so I&#x27;m not sure how they would work with thick or course hair because they are small. After a while they lose their stretch but I have not yet had one break.  I am so very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These are awesome bc I hate having a bright hair tie in my hair and hear you can&#x27;t notice . Just be careful taking them out bc they can pull at your hair.</li>
            <li> A long, long time ago, I used actual rubber bands to tie my hair together. Those, while not always the most comfortable, at least tended to last a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Goody Clear Elastic Bands, the material is thin, easily tangled (and difficult to untangle), and extremely limited in stretchability. Most of them break as I&#x27;m trying to use it for the second time ever, and a few of them have snapped off as I&#x27;m out and about. Maybe if you have thin hair, this will work okay, but for me, it&#x27;s worse than rubber bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and I&#x27;ve used other Goody bands with success, so it&#x27;s not like my hair is impossible to curtail in general. I would just avoid this line in particular.)</li>
            <li> What happened to Goody&#x27;s elastics? They used to be sooo good and last a long time. Now, they snap and break easily. They are the same quality as dollar store ones so I guess I&#x27;ll just pick up a box for a buck instead of $4 or $5 for Goodies. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> These elastic bands are ok. There is not much stretch in them so I felt it a little difficult to get around my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these one star because I used to love these so so much.  I&#x27;ve been using these for so many years now and the last few times I&#x27;ve bought them they break the minute you put them in your hair.  It has NOTHING to do with the thickness of your hair because they break on my 4 year old daughters hair too and she barely has any.  SO  frusterating.  Do not waste your money until the company decides to quit being so cheap and go back to the old formula.  The old ones were the best thing ever!  You could use and reuse them over and over, couldn&#x27;t see them in your hair, didn&#x27;t get caught in your hair.....come to think of it I imagine that&#x27;s why they changed the formula....so people would have to buy more.  I mean we couldn&#x27;t possibly have a product that would work and be good quality out there!!  (sorry, I&#x27;m so pissed because I&#x27;ve had 5 of them break on my hair and 2 on my daughters hair just this morning!!)</li>
            <li> I like these because they are durable and they blend in no matter what color I am wearing and they are lightweight when I have a headache.  I have others that eventually snap or get so stretched they are worthless.  Only downside is they are easy to lose as they are clear.  Still five stars anyways.</li>
            <li> I love these!  My hair is long and very thick, so I really doubted that they would hold it, but they&#x27;re amazing!  I&#x27;ve had them a couple of months now, and wear one almost every day, and so far not one has broken.  Nice firm hold, too.</li>
            <li> The seller was very good and got the product to me quickly.  Thats the good news...However, these bands just don&#x27;t work for my hair.  They got tangled in my hair very easily and I often have to painfully pull them out (with many hairs attached).  I would not recommend these bands to anyone.  Also, I have very dark hair, and these clear bands are more visible than when I wear a solid black, wrapped comfort hair band.</li>
            <li> I wear these for work and they easily come on and off. Not much more i can say about these... I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> just wha5 I needed for up do</li>
            <li> No longer the best elastics!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these goody elastics since I was probably a teenager and I&#x27;m now 30. I have a 7 yr old girl with super thick hair down to her bottom. These are the only elastics I&#x27;ve ever been able to use in her hair. ive used clear ones and multi colored ones in all various sizes, all have been amazing and a single package seemed like it was lasting forever. They would eventually get excessively stretched out and yet they would just keep going and never break! I finally ran out and bought a package a few months ago.......they are nothing like they were. I can&#x27;t even wrap them around my daughters hair twice before they snap. So I thought it was a bad package and bought more at a different store with the very same problem. I bought black ones too just to try something different with the same problem. All I can do with my daughters hair is a single long braid and even then they don&#x27;t survive even a half school day. She can&#x27;t stand her hair down and right now I have no other choice. I cannot even use these in my mid length thin hair for a simple pony tail. I&#x27;ve tried them 3 times in one week and every single time they snap while in my hair for no apparent reason. I even contacted goody with all this information and was completely ignored. They&#x27;ve made no attempt to make the situation right or even try to defend their products. Very disappointed!! All I want are the original elastics I&#x27;ve used forever!!&lt;br /&gt;Side note to this review:&lt;br /&gt;I submitted this review on the goody website for this particular product and they emailed me saying the review dos not meet their guidelines and would not be published!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using a different product.&lt;br /&gt;I found scunnci brand to have a thicker/more bully silicone elastic that is very good so far!</li>
            <li> I love these clear plastic bands.  They look so much better than the old kind and hold the hair really well.  Plus they don&#x27;t damage your hair.  Other companies make the clear ones, but Goody makes the best ones!! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands of clear elastics, these Goody bands do not cause hair breakage, or get tangled into hair when trying to remove the elastic at the end of the night. These hold well, and are strong - won&#x27;t break on you.</li>
            <li> These hair bands are amazing...strong and durable for a tiny piece of elastic plastic :)  I&#x27;ve had them about a year and not one has broken.  52 bands in pack should last just short of forever!</li>
            <li> I like these because of the minimalist look. I would give it 5 stars if they were just a little bit more flexible. I have very thin hair, so I wish I bend them 3 times around my ponytail for a better hold. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years, but just started having trouble finding them in the stores.  They are the BEST, because they are strong, yet gentle on the hair.  They can be \\&quot;layered\\&quot; under a more decorative ponytail holder that frankly doesn&#x27;t hold, or worn alone as a clean look for the gym or the office.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a couple of lesser brands now that I can&#x27;t find these in the stores, and they break as I&#x27;m pulling them to make that second wrap around the pony.  Talk about ouch!  These are worth the logistical hassle of buying online.  Try &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> I like to make small braids in my hair with these &#x3D;) They work well.</li>
            <li> These are so good for fun styles without being too bulky or showy. Also I found them easy to use and remove.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I had some similar rubberbands that kept breaking.  These are nice and strong, they don&#x27;t break, and they don&#x27;t pull your hair out!</li>
            <li> I use these in my long hair.  They grip well and stay in place.  I have owned them several weeks now and none have broken yet.  They don&#x27;t stretch enough to work on a large hank of hair, but if you need to band a hank of 3/8\\&quot; or less, they will work well. I sometimes use them to secure my hair, then use a decorative clip over them, if I want a dressier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4-25-13  Now that I have used these a little longer, I have found out that all of the bands are not exactly the same.  Some will stretch farther than others.  Therefore, I must amend part of my statement.  Some of the bands will stretch to hold a lot more than the 3/8\\&quot;, as I stated earlier.  I still haven&#x27;t found one that will stretch to hold my whole ponytail, but I have really thick hair.  Also, I have found that they last longer than I thought they might.  To date, I have not had one break and I am still using the original 4 that I got out of the package when I first got them.  I have also found that if I need to hold just a tiny bit of hair, they are amazing.  I used to have keep redoing my hair because the clip wouldn&#x27;t hold my hair securely.  Now I just use a band then put the clip over it, and wala!  No slipping!  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> After seeing so many cute hairstyles on Pinterest that have fishtail braids, water fall braids, over under braids, and so on, most of the tutorials all use these small clear rubberbands. These are a great deal on here and they work perfect. They are too tiny, just big enough to fit over my whole braid. They are also very flexible and I have had yet to have one break. I reuse them often, surprisingly they don&#x27;t lose their stretch and hold well after many uses!</li>
            <li> Where I live its hard to find this type of band.  These are very strong and colorless.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and too stretchy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for tying up tulips.  Will order more.  Not much more to say about a rubber and. I liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they are clear and I had been told they don&#x27;t snag. While they get the job done, I have to say that they snag my hair. Also, if you have darker brown hair, I would recommend getting the black ones. Clear shows quite clearly! These are good for incorporating into updos because they are small but I have found I prefer the snag proof elastic better. Also, these elastics stretch out of shape after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> These stretch out and break immediately, even when you double them up. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these at any store. They are simply the perfect hair tie. So glad they are available online.</li>
            <li> EDITED 3/5/2015: I am astounded at the drastic change in the quality of these bands. Every day Ill be sitting at my computer at work and Ill feel it snap - they&#x27;re just breaking randomly in the middle of the day! I used to get a zillion wears from these and the reason I needed to order more was because I lost them all. What a disappointing change in a formerly great product.  MY PRIOR 5 - STAR REVIEW: I wear these almost every day. I have super thick hair that&#x27;s prone to frizzing so I use these to tame it while I&#x27;m at work. As they come, they are about an inch in diameter. However, if you give them a good hard pull, they will stretch to at least twice that size, but they almost never break. Also, they are slick so on a person with smooth shoulder-length hair it shouldn&#x27;t be too much work to get them out. On a bad day though, if I&#x27;m really tired and don&#x27;t feel like working it out of my ponytail, i just cut it out. They&#x27;re pretty much disposable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stretch them enough to loop them around my daughter&#x27;s hair. On the plus side, they don&#x27;t pull her hair out, on the minus side, they fall out.</li>
            <li> Not the old style, flimsy and stretch out easily</li>
            <li> Each one breaks after second use.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment. elastic bands were dry rotted they all popped while on my hair or when I  tried to put them on my hair.  Do not waste your time or your money</li>
            <li> I read another review that said these were the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; kind of rubber bands that did not break.  Nope, these are the new ones that break in your hair, after one use, etc.  I wish I could find the old ones somewhere!</li>
            <li> Goody bands are so much better than Scunci! These are clear plastic bands for ponytails. I loathe Scunci products and wish my local CVS and Rite-Aid stores would carry Goody again. Alas, it&#x27;s been about 10 years, so I&#x27;m not counting on that. I&#x27;m glad I can order Goody&#x27;s on line. These last much longer than the Scunci bands; and they don&#x27;t break either when I am swimming in the ocean or in a pool. They work perfectly, just like many Goody products. Scunci must be paying someone to peddle their inferior wares...it&#x27;s a shame. I do wish that these were made in the USA.</li>
            <li> They did the trick but be careful as they snap somewhat easily when stretched too far.</li>
            <li> love these, you cannot see them and they hold up well. perfect for all the braided hairstyles, and pony tails, too.</li>
            <li> I love these for flower arranging. Holds flowers in place a barely visible.</li>
