            <li>/&gt;Tip: Have this product delivered in time for your gown&#x27;s first or second fitting, that way in case the color or the beading don&#x27;t match with the dress, you can still return it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this veil to those who are interested in this style.  </li>

            <li>: it comes very wrinkled, but looks like a new product after you leave it in the bathroom while you shower.</li>
            <li>I bought my veil in Amazon because the other bridal salons were charging more than $100 for the same product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a finger tip length veil with multiple layers, but didn&#x27;t want to spend several hundred dollars on one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Just what the bride to be expected.</li>
            <li> Complete cheap piece of crap.  Looks ridiculously hideous..  I would be embarrassed to wear this at my wedding.  You get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful veil and it is worth the buy....the color is amazing and it matches my ivory dress perfectly. The beading looks amazing as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go with my vintage style dress.  It was absolutely perfect! Great value for the money and the beading around the edges were a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Beautiful alternative to buying from David&#x27;s Bridal. Beading is wonderful and well made, stayed intact, and got many compliments!</li>
            <li> Beautiful veil! I have tried on quite a few at bridal shops from Texas to Virginia and it would take a trained eye to see the imperfections, if any, in this veil. The embellishments on the bottom are nice. No missing beads or inconsistencies. The scalloping is a nice touch as well. The comb is a little flat and wide but stays put. I did not feel that it looked too poofy on the top and I tried it several different ways. I definitely recommend this veil! Wish I could post a picture!</li>
