            <li>The seller was awesome, I returned the remaining boxes (I ordered 6) and was promptly issued a refund.</li>
            <li>and they worked great for picking up all the henna that WILL fall all around you while coloring.  </li>
            <li>Great color that lasts.</li>
            <li>when you put it in but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s really a great product, I will keep using it.</li>

            <li>I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of gray hair and don&#x27;t like to use chemicals of any kind, on anything!  </li>
            <li>I used this product for 5 plus years before and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The light mountain brown henna turned out beautifully!</li>
            <li>But, it is completely safe, healthier, and produces great shine, body, and manageability.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>The color is accurate and it leaves hair in beautiful condition.  </li>
            <li>Using this was an amazing hair experience for me.</li>
            <li>My hair has been chemical free, including shampoos and styling products, for two years and is in great condition.</li>
            <li>I let it cure for about 3-4 hours in a warm (200 degree)</li>
            <li>I rinsed with warm water.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - thanks!!</li>
            <li>Well, the Light Mountain hair color and conditioner had good reviews at Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I now use the no poo method to help mend my hair, but after reading directions that came in this box I made sure to wash my hair with shampoo before I colored my hair.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>The heat is a catalyst and the henna seems to bond better with the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The longer you leave it on, the better the coverage.  </li>
            <li>(looks more natural!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>more hint:</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have 1 more box.</li>
            <li>This was the messiest most time-consuming hair coloring product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My medium brown hair becomes warm coppery brown and my gray turns to coppery hightlights (w/ Light Brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also enjoyed mixing</li>
            <li>i get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>i love the brand of henna.</li>
            <li>The results were great, it didn&#x27;t cover the gray as much as I wanted it</li>
            <li>I have a bill for it or more postage and bother to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My gray highlights turn reddish-blonde and the rest of my hair is a rich warm brown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and organic, contains no chemicals, colors hair beautifully, and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and it turned the greys a lovely light brown shade.</li>
            <li>So if you use this product, make sure you do the strand test FIRST!!</li>
            <li>pros: I found this to be easy on my hair.</li>
            <li>Henna is more time consuming, for sure, but if you understand why and how it works, it is worth the time.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use Light Mountain.</li>
            <li>So, I tried Light Mountain (Light Brown</li>
            <li>I plan to use Light Mountain henna products from now on.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to go a tad darker in light brown.</li>
            <li>Now my streaks and highlights are gray, but I still use the Light Mountain Henna and NOT the \\&quot;Color</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair with some gray.</li>
            <li>and I got the light brown color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing was a pain but use a lot of cheap conditioner and it rinsed out in about 15 Minutes.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>I used the light brown and the color was nice and my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really full and thicker now too</li>
            <li>however I think I will use the gray product next time as reviews are good on it too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is lingering but not bad, just like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(Anything that can change your hair color so quickly now makes me wonder</li>
            <li>I bought this henna product at my Whole Foods but thought I would write a review since I had such a great experience.</li>
            <li>I sealed the color with an application of cream rinse for colored hair (didnt rinse super well) and let my hair air</li>
            <li>My gray is slightly more golden, but the rest of my hair is a rich light brown that is not overtly red.  </li>
            <li>Keep extra gloves and the cheap color caps that gather on the edge (they work better than the cap that comes in the box.)</li>
            <li>I mixed this powder formula with warm chamomile tea, lemon juice, and olive oil.</li>
            <li>but SO worth it.</li>
            <li>This did not work like fresh henna.</li>
            <li>so I tried this more natural dye.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a reaction worth the patch test</li>
            <li>But the results wee well worth it.</li>
            <li>I do this pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, Light Mountain was the first henna that actually changed it light brown!  </li>
            <li>If I remember right, this product lasted longer than store&lt;br /&gt;bought</li>
            <li>My color is about a reddish chestnut hue right now.</li>
            <li>oz of hot water to get the right consistency&lt;</li>
            <li>Have used other henna products, but Light Mountain is my favorite.</li>
            <li>--what exactly is IN that box?  </li>
            <li>The time goes by fast if you watch a movie!</li>
            <li>These things are inexpensive and will last throughout many colorings.</li>
            <li>use blow dryer to get head hot, over the bag.  </li>
            <li>Sit with hot henna head for another 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I left it on for 2 hours and ended up with more of a gloss than color.</li>
            <li>So my hair is pretty virgin.</li>
            <li>However, the results - long, shiny healthy hair is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>stain,&amp;#34; that is, unless she first uses a costly treatment to remove it.</li>
            <li>red is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I found henna listed on the skin deep website with a rating of 1 ( 10 is the most toxic).  </li>
            <li>I scoured reviews looking for what henna to use as a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time.</li>
            <li>must mix this stuff up, let it cure for an hour, put it on my hair, hot iron it</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and shiny, and full of bounce.  </li>
            <li>It also made my hair feel more coarse than normal.</li>
            <li>hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>As it grew and every six weeks since then, I have been using Light Mountain Henna only.</li>
            <li>I mix light and medium brown with light red and add neutral for extra shine.</li>
            <li>Very manageable.</li>
            <li>Very wavy (didnt loosen the waves</li>
            <li>and you know she sees high maintenance hair all the time!</li>
            <li>but it fades and looks great - soft, shiny, covers my small amount of gray in a way that looks like natural highlights.</li>
            <li>The overall color was nice but the process is long and involved.  </li>
            <li>henna is so much better for your hair then conventional dyes.</li>
            <li>Once you get a system down for using it, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply, and the results are consistent.</li>
            <li>Been using Light Mtn for 3 years now - my hair is long, shiny and gets lots of compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li>With this natural dye, I questioned it over and over at first bc</li>
            <li>; Don&#x27;t know if this is true, but she said she cannot use my regular organic color my hair now because I used this &amp;#34;henna</li>
            <li>when i used this particular color, my hair did come out darker.</li>
            <li>I also suggest blow-drying your hair on high heat for a couple minutes every 20 minutes or so while the henna is on.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>ONLY WORTH IT</li>
            <li>Yes, it is more time consuming and messy than chemical coloring.</li>
            <li>This is the first time in about ten years I colored my hair.</li>
            <li>(okay, there was one small one...), and no major time spent on the couch hoping for better times with no henna on my head.  </li>
            <li>My box of LM was already two years old and opened from a previous dyeing, it turned out fine.  </li>
            <li>I did not cure it, kept it on one hour, and it was pretty dark that first week</li>
            <li>what if there was a mess, a hay field smell, and a huge time commitment?</li>
            <li>That said, the Light Mountain hair color did leave my hair quite shiny and definitely not as dry as other hair coloring products do.</li>
            <li>I grew up on chemical hair dyes from the box and by my early 30&#x27;s, my hair looked and felt like straw.  </li>
            <li>A friend suggested I try henna, as she heard my hair may benefit from it&#x27;s natural properties, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It smells so much like alfalfa that I would not recommend standing next to a herd of hungry rabbits for a week after use.  </li>
            <li>it looked so natural.</li>
            <li>, my husband likes it, gets rid of the greys, and looks completely natural unlike store bought dyes.</li>
            <li>The henna highlights the streaks and highlights that grow naturally from my head, so the look is never that paintbrush</li>
            <li>Follow directions, use gloves, wear an old shirt, and put your head in a shower cap.</li>
            <li>Cover hair with an old shower cap ($1)</li>
            <li>Remove henna in shower using cheap organic conditioner - conditioner softens and loosens the dried paste on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>It completely covers my gray hair.</li>
            <li>On natural hair it would act differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Organic, all natural, so</li>
            <li>About a month and a half at half the cost and without the hazardous chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a dark blond/light brown with natural highlights and after a week or two of using this, that is exactly what I have!</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit messy, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li>I grew my hair back down to mid-back and it stayed full of body, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The only real problem has been the color -- I&#x27;m not a red person, but I&#x27;ve had to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Doing this, I have very little wasted time, a nice color, and almost no mess.  </li>
            <li>My starter color was highly bleached ashy blonde with some hints of gaga yellow.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this step, if you have any natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li>I have darkish brown hair and it didnt darken my hair too much, it covered some of the orangish red i had from the regular red henna</li>
            <li>And although the package says it washes out in six weeks or so, my hair is still red (although much lighter red)  six months later.</li>
            <li>I placed it on my freshly washed, but not conditioned, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is conditioned nicely and the length has a faint henna sheen</li>
            <li>Clean up of my rinse area was a chore, and I ruined at least one towel.</li>
            <li>I have used henna before...not a pre-boxed kit, just plain old actual real henna.</li>
            <li>The over the counter or salon dye usually looks very drastic and dark right away.</li>
            <li>every time i use henna-my hair comes out super shiny and thick.</li>

            <li> My hair was soft and shiny, and full of bounce.  </li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel more coarse than normal.</li>
            <li> hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> As it grew and every six weeks since then, I have been using Light Mountain Henna only.</li>
            <li> I mix light and medium brown with light red and add neutral for extra shine.</li>
            <li> Very manageable.</li>
            <li> Very wavy (didnt loosen the waves</li>
            <li> and you know she sees high maintenance hair all the time!</li>
            <li> but it fades and looks great - soft, shiny, covers my small amount of gray in a way that looks like natural highlights.</li>
            <li> The overall color was nice but the process is long and involved.  </li>
            <li> henna is so much better for your hair then conventional dyes.</li>
            <li> Once you get a system down for using it, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply, and the results are consistent.</li>
            <li> Been using Light Mtn for 3 years now - my hair is long, shiny and gets lots of compliments on the color.  </li>
            <li> With this natural dye, I questioned it over and over at first bc</li>
            <li> ; Don&#x27;t know if this is true, but she said she cannot use my regular organic color my hair now because I used this &amp;#34;henna</li>
            <li> when i used this particular color, my hair did come out darker.</li>
            <li> I also suggest blow-drying your hair on high heat for a couple minutes every 20 minutes or so while the henna is on.  </li>
            <li> My hair stays very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> ONLY WORTH IT</li>
            <li> Yes, it is more time consuming and messy than chemical coloring.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in about ten years I colored my hair.</li>
            <li> (okay, there was one small one...), and no major time spent on the couch hoping for better times with no henna on my head.  </li>
            <li> My box of LM was already two years old and opened from a previous dyeing, it turned out fine.  </li>
            <li> I did not cure it, kept it on one hour, and it was pretty dark that first week</li>
            <li> what if there was a mess, a hay field smell, and a huge time commitment?</li>
            <li> That said, the Light Mountain hair color did leave my hair quite shiny and definitely not as dry as other hair coloring products do.</li>
            <li> I grew up on chemical hair dyes from the box and by my early 30&#x27;s, my hair looked and felt like straw.  </li>
            <li> A friend suggested I try henna, as she heard my hair may benefit from it&#x27;s natural properties, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li> It smells so much like alfalfa that I would not recommend standing next to a herd of hungry rabbits for a week after use.  </li>
            <li> it looked so natural.</li>
            <li> , my husband likes it, gets rid of the greys, and looks completely natural unlike store bought dyes.</li>
            <li> The henna highlights the streaks and highlights that grow naturally from my head, so the look is never that paintbrush</li>
            <li> Follow directions, use gloves, wear an old shirt, and put your head in a shower cap.</li>
            <li> Cover hair with an old shower cap ($1)</li>
            <li> Remove henna in shower using cheap organic conditioner - conditioner softens and loosens the dried paste on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> It completely covers my gray hair.</li>
            <li> On natural hair it would act differently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Organic, all natural, so</li>
            <li> About a month and a half at half the cost and without the hazardous chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a dark blond/light brown with natural highlights and after a week or two of using this, that is exactly what I have!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit messy, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li> I grew my hair back down to mid-back and it stayed full of body, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The only real problem has been the color -- I&#x27;m not a red person, but I&#x27;ve had to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Doing this, I have very little wasted time, a nice color, and almost no mess.  </li>
            <li> My starter color was highly bleached ashy blonde with some hints of gaga yellow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this step, if you have any natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li> I have darkish brown hair and it didnt darken my hair too much, it covered some of the orangish red i had from the regular red henna</li>
            <li> And although the package says it washes out in six weeks or so, my hair is still red (although much lighter red)  six months later.</li>
            <li> I placed it on my freshly washed, but not conditioned, towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is conditioned nicely and the length has a faint henna sheen</li>
            <li> Clean up of my rinse area was a chore, and I ruined at least one towel.</li>
            <li> I have used henna before...not a pre-boxed kit, just plain old actual real henna.</li>
            <li> The over the counter or salon dye usually looks very drastic and dark right away.</li>
            <li> every time i use henna-my hair comes out super shiny and thick.</li>
            <li> I followed another reviewer&#x27;s tips and added a bit of vinegar, about a quarter cup of plain yogurt, and cinnamon (although it didn&#x27;t really cover smell, and devoted a day to doing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to have gone through the whole process to end up with nothing more than what I did.</li>
            <li> and I am a natural dark</li>
            <li> method:&lt;br /&gt;used 8 oz day old dark coffee boiling</li>
            <li> long wait time</li>
            <li> Six years ago I ruined my long hair with chemical dye.</li>
            <li> When all of my hair goes grey</li>
            <li> roots were orange for about 6 hours then toned down to a deep red brown.</li>
            <li> This turned my hair dark red.</li>
            <li> I stopped when I retired and got tired of the monthly upkeep since I was getting pretty gray by then.  </li>
            <li> Wet hair with a squirt bottle, put on a zip-front shirt, and put on latex gloves (I have a box of them just for this).  </li>
            <li> I wanted to switch over to a chemilcal-free lifestyle - especially toxic and harsh hair dye.</li>
            <li> A few days later I got a compliment at my dermatologist/plastic surgeon&#x27;s office from a nurse</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not be trapped by all this green alternatives, all natural ingredients etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is messy and takes some time to do but your hair will thank you in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I just wet them down a bit and they picked up the henna and did not stain the towels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly not anything I want to be putting on my head, down my drain or inhaling.  </li>
            <li> Buy rubber latex gloves from grocery store ($2), the loose plastic gloves in kit are a little cumbersome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is dark brown</li>
            <li> It makes hair shiny, thick, and it covers my gray / white hair into looking like highlights (I have been getting quite a bit of white hair lately).  </li>
            <li> It takes extra preperation (boiling water, creating the paste, applying thick and sticky paste to hair, waiting for it to STAIN your hair - 1-3 hrs - depending on product choice.)  </li>
            <li> After years of professional highlights I was too blond and tired of the upkeep and expense.</li>
            <li> cons:  When you use it, it smells bad, takes time and is messy, plus it turned my hair reddish (was hoping for light brown).</li>
            <li> half the labor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dark green</li>
            <li> Smells a little like grass and cooked spinach...</li>
            <li> Despite having very thick, shoulder length hair, I had mixture left over.</li>
            <li> Despite the cons I would use this product again, instead of harsh dyes.    </li>
            <li> Color washed off after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is messy, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, although for me the smell is tolerable.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Stopped coloring my hair 5 years ago with harsh permanent salon color.</li>
            <li> It was a bit messy to rinse out</li>
            <li> When I decided to go green, I thought I had to accept going gray as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saving about a third of the box, although I know from using colorless henna that it could be frozen, since I hate to waste so much product.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair with 10% gray and usually brown hennas change my hair into a reddish brown.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> But I was tired of the dirty blonde, gray color, because it made me look old and tired.</li>
            <li> This henna either very old or is bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly a problem with the product itself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dirty blonde</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shampoo for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because of ongoing smell but at least I am not allergic</li>
            <li> Then covered with a beanie and a thick towel.</li>
            <li> I also gave up shampoo a few months ago in an effort to stop putting dangerous chemicals on my body and down the drain.</li>
            <li> Then I found this product -- seriously, who knew?</li>
            <li> Difficult to spread on hair with mud-like consistency.</li>
            <li> Weird texture</li>
            <li> Nothing scary chemical-wise.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was amazed at how my hair was after using this.  My hair was soft and shiny, and full of bounce.  I used to use the chemical hair color and although it covered the gray, it did a lot of damage.  I will continue to use Light Mountain.</li>
            <li> I found that if I put shampoos, or dyes with chemicals in my hair, my hair would get split ends, be brittle and fall out. I now use the no poo method to help mend my hair, but after reading directions that came in this box I made sure to wash my hair with shampoo before I colored my hair. Despite the cons I would use this product again, instead of harsh dyes.    pros: I found this to be easy on my hair. Color lasts if you use a no poo, or co-wash method of cleaning your hair after coloring your hair (It&#x27;s still keeping the color after four months).     cons:  When you use it, it smells bad, takes time and is messy, plus it turned my hair reddish (was hoping for light brown).</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 plus years before and loved it.  I only stopped when I wanted to go back to blond colors.&lt;br /&gt;It is messy and takes some time to do but your hair will thank you in the long run.  I am thinking of going back to&lt;br /&gt;this product because it is healthier for me and my hair.  If I remember right, this product lasted longer than store&lt;br /&gt;bought hair dyes.  About a month and a half at half the cost and without the hazardous chemicals.  It is also neat that&lt;br /&gt;you can add lemon juice, coffee, teas, ect to the product for different effects.</li>
            <li> Difficult to spread on hair with mud-like consistency. Very messy. Clumps off everywhere. Smells like spinach. Color washed off after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I grew up on chemical hair dyes from the box and by my early 30&#x27;s, my hair looked and felt like straw.  A friend suggested I try henna, as she heard my hair may benefit from it&#x27;s natural properties, so I tried it.  I will never go back to the chemical box.    Henna is more time consuming, for sure, but if you understand why and how it works, it is worth the time.  (Anything that can change your hair color so quickly now makes me wonder--what exactly is IN that box?  Certainly not anything I want to be putting on my head, down my drain or inhaling.  Yikes.)    I have medium brown hair with 10% gray and usually brown hennas change my hair into a reddish brown.  However, Light Mountain was the first henna that actually changed it light brown!  :)  My gray is slightly more golden, but the rest of my hair is a rich light brown that is not overtly red.  Very nice.  If you have gray, I suggest leaving the henna on longer, like 2 hours.  I also suggest blow-drying your hair on high heat for a couple minutes every 20 minutes or so while the henna is on.  The heat is a catalyst and the henna seems to bond better with the hair shaft.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABOUT TEN TIMES THE WORK OF THE OVER THE COUNTER HAIR COLORING AT YOUR LOCAL GROCERY STORE....ONLY WORTH IT IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF HOURS TO SPARE !</li>
            <li> The overall color was nice but the process is long and involved.  It also made my hair feel more coarse than normal.</li>
            <li> Very Happy!  I have a lot of gray hair and don&#x27;t like to use chemicals of any kind, on anything!  I also did not want to use the &#x27;color the gray&#x27; with the two step process.  So, I tried Light Mountain (Light Brown and I am a natural dark blonde)and the result was wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer you leave it on, the better the coverage.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit messy, but so worth it!  My hair is thicker, healthier &amp; shinier than it has ever been.  I like a touch of gray in my hair (looks more natural!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the hair dryer during the process.  Don&#x27;t use this step, if you have any natural blonde color.  It will turn it orange/red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also let the mixture sit closer to the 3 hour limit and then let the color sit on my hair for 1 1/2 hours. The time goes by fast if you watch a movie! Keep extra gloves and the cheap color caps that gather on the edge (they work better than the cap that comes in the box.) I use bar mops (towels) in my home instead of paper towels and they worked great for picking up all the henna that WILL fall all around you while coloring.  I just wet them down a bit and they picked up the henna and did not stain the towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more hint: I used vaseline around my ears &amp; hair line (anywhere you don&#x27;t want the henna to stain) and used the oval cotton pads, which will stick to the vaseline and the cap will cover.  These things are inexpensive and will last throughout many colorings.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  This last time I used it, I mixed it with some Jamila Summer Crop 2008, but it looks about the same without it. My box of LM was already two years old and opened from a previous dyeing, it turned out fine.  I do this pretty quickly.  Here are my steps:  *  Mix LM with red wine or lemon juice and some water till it&#x27;s gloppy.  Let it sit, covered, for 45 minute.  *  Apply Vaseline to hairline and ears.  Wet hair with a squirt bottle, put on a zip-front shirt, and put on latex gloves (I have a box of them just for this).  *  Put henna in a ziplock and cut off bottom corner.  Squirt on head and smash around.  *  Cut the handle strip open on a grocery bag and tie bag around head.  use blow dryer to get head hot, over the bag.  Don&#x27;t melt bag!  Cover head with a towel.  *  20 minutes later, unwrap towel and use blow dryer again. Sit with hot henna head for another 40 minutes.  Read a magazine.  *  Get in shower, rinse out.  Shampoo.  Condition.  Doing this, I have very little wasted time, a nice color, and almost no mess.  No stains, no glops all over the floor (okay, there was one small one...), and no major time spent on the couch hoping for better times with no henna on my head.  I love this stuff.  It makes hair shiny, thick, and it covers my gray / white hair into looking like highlights (I have been getting quite a bit of white hair lately).  The only con to this is the smell and the appearance.  It looks like goose poop on your head under a plastic bag.  It smells so much like alfalfa that I would not recommend standing next to a herd of hungry rabbits for a week after use.  I like the smell, but I guess some don&#x27;t.  The texture and smell are the same for all henna, though, not just this brand.  It&#x27;s hardly a problem with the product itself.  Otherwise, all around awesomeness.  Hope this works for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and organic, contains no chemicals, colors hair beautifully, and is inexpensive. Once you get a system down for using it, it&#x27;s quite easy to apply, and the results are consistent. I plan to use Light Mountain henna products from now on.</li>
            <li> Using this was an amazing hair experience for me. Yes, it is more time consuming and messy than chemical coloring. But, it is completely safe, healthier, and produces great shine, body, and manageability. I mixed this powder formula with warm chamomile tea, lemon juice, and olive oil. I let it cure for about 3-4 hours in a warm (200 degree) oven. I placed it on my freshly washed, but not conditioned, towel dried hair. I placed plastic over my head and wrapped it in a towel. I left it on for about three hours. I rinsed with warm water. I finished with conditioning my hair to help remove the excess henna goop. I wait 48 hours before I wash my hair. The results are excellent. The leftover mix can be frozen and reused. The henna can be reapplied without damage to hair or scalp. You can mix several different formulas to create different shades. I would not recommend that to the beginner though. I would start out with the neutral (cassia) to get a feel for how henna works.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like grass and cooked spinach...but I love this stuff. Weird texture long wait time but SO worth it. Great color that lasts. Nothing scary chemical-wise.</li>
            <li> I have used henna before...not a pre-boxed kit, just plain old actual real henna. This did not work like fresh henna. I left it on for 2 hours and ended up with more of a gloss than color. My hair is conditioned nicely and the length has a faint henna sheen but my roots didnt change at all. I&#x27;m disappointed to have gone through the whole process to end up with nothing more than what I did. I have 1 more box. When I get around to using it I&#x27;ll leave it on longer and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Turned my hair red instead of brown. On their behalf, I did not do the RECOMMENDED hair strand test. So if you use this product, make sure you do the strand test FIRST!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time in about ten years I colored my hair. So my hair is pretty virgin. It&#x27;s a dirty blonde and I wanted to go a tad darker in light brown. The over the counter or salon dye usually looks very drastic and dark right away. With this natural dye, I questioned it over and over at first bc it looked so natural. It is messy, I didn&#x27;t care for the smell, although for me the smell is tolerable. It smelled like essiac tea, or swamp water! But I cured it for two hours, kept in my hair for three hours, just got things done around the house in the meantime. I used dr Bronnors organic conditioner to wash it out. I like it, my husband likes it, gets rid of the greys, and looks completely natural unlike store bought dyes. I&#x27;m going to keep at it. My hair feels really full and thicker now too</li>
            <li> This was the messiest most time-consuming hair coloring product I have ever used. It also had a &amp;#34;dirty, earthy&amp;#34; smell to it. I felt like I was putting mud on my hair. And it did not cover my grays at all.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  The color is accurate and it leaves hair in beautiful condition.  Have used other henna products, but Light Mountain is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Six years ago I ruined my long hair with chemical dye. It turned to straw and I had it all cut off. As it grew and every six weeks since then, I have been using Light Mountain Henna only. The product does not burn or itch my scalp. My hair stays very shiny and soft. The henna highlights the streaks and highlights that grow naturally from my head, so the look is never that paintbrush matte or patchwork look I used to get with chemical color. I grew my hair back down to mid-back and it stayed full of body, soft and shiny. Now my streaks and highlights are gray, but I still use the Light Mountain Henna and NOT the \\&quot;Color the Gray\\&quot; product, which I do not like at all. I mix light and medium brown with light red and add neutral for extra shine. My gray highlights turn reddish-blonde and the rest of my hair is a rich warm brown. Yes, it&#x27;s messy. Follow directions, use gloves, wear an old shirt, and put your head in a shower cap. Rinse (and rinse and rinse) out after 30-60 minutes (I keep on for an hour). Don&#x27;t shampoo for at least 24 hours. Great stuff - thanks!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch over to a chemilcal-free lifestyle - especially toxic and harsh hair dye. Been using Light Mtn for 3 years now - my hair is long, shiny and gets lots of compliments on the color.  My medium brown hair becomes warm coppery brown and my gray turns to coppery hightlights (w/ Light Brown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HENNA IS A COMMITMENT. It takes extra preperation (boiling water, creating the paste, applying thick and sticky paste to hair, waiting for it to STAIN your hair - 1-3 hrs - depending on product choice.)  However, the results - long, shiny healthy hair is worth it to me. I&#x27;ve also enjoyed mixing colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips to make your life easier:&lt;br /&gt;+ Buy rubber latex gloves from grocery store ($2), the loose plastic gloves in kit are a little cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;+ Cover hair with an old shower cap ($1) so drying henna does not drop everywhere during the staining period (1-3 hrs).&lt;br /&gt;+ Remove henna in shower using cheap organic conditioner - conditioner softens and loosens the dried paste on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;+ If staying with the same color, only apply henna ONLY to your roots &#x3D; half the labor.&lt;br /&gt;*Some of the products, like the mahogany, recommend henna on hair for 3 hrs -- I will take a nap or rent a couple movies to pass the time.</li>
            <li> The light mountain brown henna turned out beautifully! I have darkish brown hair and it didnt darken my hair too much, it covered some of the orangish red i had from the regular red henna and it turned the greys a lovely light brown shade. When all of my hair goes grey this will be my go-to color!</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair with some gray. This turned my hair dark red. And although the package says it washes out in six weeks or so, my hair is still red (although much lighter red)  six months later. My hair stylist called it a &amp;#34;henna stain.&amp;#34; Don&#x27;t know if this is true, but she said she cannot use my regular organic color my hair now because I used this &amp;#34;henna stain,&amp;#34; that is, unless she first uses a costly treatment to remove it. That said, the Light Mountain hair color did leave my hair quite shiny and definitely not as dry as other hair coloring products do. In fact, I actually don&#x27;t have to use conditioner. The only real problem has been the color -- I&#x27;m not a red person, but I&#x27;ve had to get used to it.</li>
            <li> After years of professional highlights I was too blond and tired of the upkeep and expense. I also gave up shampoo a few months ago in an effort to stop putting dangerous chemicals on my body and down the drain. I wanted a dark blond/light brown with natural highlights and after a week or two of using this, that is exactly what I have! I did not cure it, kept it on one hour, and it was pretty dark that first week but it fades and looks great - soft, shiny, covers my small amount of gray in a way that looks like natural highlights. Smells like hay but not offensive. Dark green when you put it in but don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s really a great product, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> i swear-Light Mountain henna has drastically improved my hair. follow the directions in the box. i would definitely let the henna mixture sit overnight then use it the following day. every time i use henna-my hair comes out super shiny and thick. i get so many compliments on it. i love the brand of henna. i have chocolate brown hair. when i used this particular color, my hair did come out darker. that&#x27;s the only downfall for me. i have tried the majority of the colors. red is my favorite. definitely give this brand a chance. henna is so much better for your hair then conventional dyes.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to chemicals in otc dyes so I tried this more natural dye. I didn&#x27;t have a reaction worth the patch test but I did have a reaction with the actual application. The seller was awesome, I returned the remaining boxes (I ordered 6) and was promptly issued a refund.</li>
            <li> I used henna for over 2 yrs and found it worked rather well. I stopped when I retired and got tired of the monthly upkeep since I was getting pretty gray by then.  I would recommend the product as it did a lot for shine and body on my hair when I did use it</li>
            <li> Stopped coloring my hair 5 years ago with harsh permanent salon color. I found henna listed on the skin deep website with a rating of 1 ( 10 is the most toxic).  Henna works great on salt and pepper hair. It completely covers my gray hair. I am extremely happy with it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Well, the Light Mountain hair color and conditioner had good reviews at Amazon.com so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark brown and I got the light brown color. Did everything according to their instructions and my hair...turned green!&lt;br /&gt;My advice: stay away from this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Do not be trapped by all this green alternatives, all natural ingredients etc.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll ruin your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Never again!</li>
            <li> I bought this henna product at my Whole Foods but thought I would write a review since I had such a great experience. I scoured reviews looking for what henna to use as a first timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method:&lt;br /&gt;used 8 oz day old dark coffee boiling&lt;br /&gt;4 oz of rooibos tea boiling&lt;br /&gt;4 oz of hot water to get the right consistency&lt;br /&gt;I mixed it all up and let sit for 5 minutes. Added a 1/4 c. Of cinnamon for smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glopped it on my hair. Wrapped in saran wrap. Shot it with hair dryer for 10 min. Then covered with a beanie and a thick towel. I left it in for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing was a pain but use a lot of cheap conditioner and it rinsed out in about 15 Minutes. I sealed the color with an application of cream rinse for colored hair (didnt rinse super well) and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my roots were orange for about 6 hours then toned down to a deep red brown. My color is about a reddish chestnut hue right now. My starter color was highly bleached ashy blonde with some hints of gaga yellow. I was definitely expecting a red hue from all the damaged hair. On natural hair it would act differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is super soft. Very manageable. Very wavy (didnt loosen the waves I had)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is lingering but not bad, just like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars for the difficulty rinsing. Overall great product</li>
            <li> 4 stars because of ongoing smell but at least I am not allergic</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time. The results were great, it didn&#x27;t cover the gray as much as I wanted it to however I think I will use the gray product next time as reviews are good on it too. It was a bit messy to rinse out but I just kept rinsing and working my fingers through the hair and scalp areas and eventually it all came out. I used Say Yes to Carrots organic leave in conditioner to help the comb out and it worked great. I will use this product again, for the price and the result you can&#x27;t beat it.  I used the light brown and the color was nice and my hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I looked at this item, chose another instead and when checking out, this item came up and accidentally ordered.!? I canceled the order immediately but they sent it anyway. I have a bill for it or more postage and bother to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I must mix this stuff up, let it cure for an hour, put it on my hair, hot iron it and then let it set for 45 minutes. Gads.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money! This henna either very old or is bad cause it&#x27;s not working as it&#x27;s supposed to, it doesn&#x27;t cover white hair at all, though I applied it three time during two months! Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> When I decided to go green, I thought I had to accept going gray as well. My hair has been chemical free, including shampoos and styling products, for two years and is in great condition. But I was tired of the dirty blonde, gray color, because it made me look old and tired. Then I found this product -- seriously, who knew? Organic, all natural, so what if there was a mess, a hay field smell, and a huge time commitment? I followed another reviewer&#x27;s tips and added a bit of vinegar, about a quarter cup of plain yogurt, and cinnamon (although it didn&#x27;t really cover smell, and devoted a day to doing it. An hour for mix to blend, for hours on my hair, and application and rinse time. Despite having very thick, shoulder length hair, I had mixture left over. Clean up of my rinse area was a chore, and I ruined at least one towel. But the results wee well worth it. A few days later I got a compliment at my dermatologist/plastic surgeon&#x27;s office from a nurse and you know she sees high maintenance hair all the time! It&#x27;s been six weeks and the color is just starting to fade so it&#x27;s spa day again. That&#x27;s despite the fact that I wash with a baking soda mixture followed by vinegar rinse, which plays he&#x27;ll on commercial coloring jobs. I&#x27;m saving about a third of the box, although I know from using colorless henna that it could be frozen, since I hate to waste so much product. Plan to use this stuff indefinitely.</li>
