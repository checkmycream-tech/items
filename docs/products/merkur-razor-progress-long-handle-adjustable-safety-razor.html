    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The weight and length are perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am continuously impressed with how close a shave this razor gives.</li>
            <li>I switched to DE blades about a year ago and have, like may others, been looking for the perfect razor ever since.</li>
            <li>Mine had a flawless chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent Product,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent quality razor!</li>
            <li>and this razor is the best!</li>
            <li>The adjustability provides you with the means to give you the best DE shave you will ever have.</li>
            <li>The Merkur Progress Safety Razor is the best DE Razor I ever used.  </li>
            <li>A perfect combo!</li>
            <li>That one had EXCELLENT chrome plating, totally flawless.</li>
            <li>Excellent razor.</li>
            <li>This razor does a great Job !</li>
            <li>The finish on the razor is in excellent shape.</li>
            <li>I teamed it with a Feather Blade for one incredible close shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor works great, but for the price I expect it to be aesthetically perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>IT is a great addition to your razor collection.</li>
            <li>With the head on this razor being adjustable, I don&#x27;t understand how it could not give a great shave.</li>
            <li>And it does a great job also, but it can&#x27;t compete with this razor because of it being adjustable .</li>
            <li>I am happy with the value of it.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Very nice razor .</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it it adjustable, and it is perfectly calibrated (which I guess was or is an issue with these razors).</li>
            <li>Great Finnish quality and most of all a Great shave .</li>
            <li>I tried growing a beard, and it looked fairly good, but once Summer came around, I couldn&#x27;t bear the heat because it was so thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be fair, I should have gone through the blade selection process again instead of sticking with the feathers that worked so well in my 32c.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>You have got to have a good blade to accompany also.</li>
            <li>very pleased I chose this Merkur Model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great to be able to adjust blade angle depending upon brand of blade.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor and a razor anyone can use and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Nice weight and good looking.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur blades are not that great, and the shave I got today was pretty damn good !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that there&#x27;s a vendor that has a chrome replacement for it, but, it would be nice as an out-of-box option.</li>
            <li>Feather and Astra Platinum blades  perform the best so far in this razor.</li>
            <li>Gives a very comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is enjoyable, it feels great, and I get a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pleased with the Merkur and the Personna blades I have used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I found #2 is best for starting.</li>
            <li>I love that you can adjust it to your stubble growth.  </li>
            <li>if anything happened to this razor I would surely purchase another asap.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I would recommend looking for something better than this for the price.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>If you can afford to buy this razor , I am sure it will pay for itself with the ability to buy cheaper blades alone.</li>
            <li>Excellent weight and the handle is plenty long.</li>
            <li>Not only have I freed myself from razor burn, but shaving is actually enjoyable again, something I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was a teenager (I remember being so proud of those patches of facial hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I would have liked a more textured handle but no slippage issues so far.</li>
            <li>Blades are ridiculously cheap too, after paying up to $8 for each cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a believer in a razor, being the only reason for a great shave alone.</li>
            <li>Progress Adjustable Safety Razor is the best modern double edge safety  razor I have puchaced.</li>
            <li>all of which are far superior adjustable razors to the Progress.  </li>
            <li>But mostly my original butterfly Gillette.  </li>
            <li>Should really have a better chrome plating job considering the price and being made in Germany.</li>
            <li>far, this Merkur fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good improvement, as I&#x27;d been DE shaving for a couple of years and wanted to take it to the next level.  </li>
            <li>Just like a straight razor I love it</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite razors and my absolute favorite new razor.</li>
            <li>You can set it to be as mild /aggressive as you want - Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Get the Polsilver Super Iridium blades as I have.</li>
            <li>For the cost of this razor, you could pick up a used or new-old-stock Gillette slim adjustable, super adjustable, or fat boy...</li>
            <li>Most highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll not waste even one more shave with</li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as good as Gillette and the adjustment is not real.  </li>
            <li>Changing the blade is not as safe as old Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I could never get it dialed in just right</li>
            <li>Simple to clean and maintain and gives a super smooth 3 pass shave.</li>
            <li>And I have large hands !</li>
            <li>The Progress has a much smaller head, which alleviated all the complaints I had with the Futur.</li>
            <li>but I wanted more weight and especially a longer handle for an easier grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fantastic-my 2nd favorite DE (Futur is no 1)</li>
            <li>I have used many different razors.  </li>
            <li>My first safety razor was the Merkur 34C.</li>
            <li>It seems to be built well enough to last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that one must be very careful with these adjustable razors as they can cut you more easily than a fixed blade.</li>
            <li>It is pure ecstasy.</li>
            <li>It is adjustable and has never broken.  </li>
            <li>Unless your blade is real garbage.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised at the number of pits and flaws in the plating job compared to the first one.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite purchases as far as wet shaving is concerned and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Depending on what brand you get (the sharpness varies), you can get several months worth of blades (100 count) for between $8-$20.  </li>
            <li>Then turn it down for second pass which is nice because that is where I nick myself up.  </li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the new style razors.  </li>
            <li>It is my first and only adjustable de razor.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t throw out the old for new.</li>
            <li>yes, I should be more careful, but still, it wasn&#x27;t not very durable).  </li>
            <li>No matter what I did, my combination of a course beard and sensitive skin doomed me to razor burn</li>
            <li>The head piece completely unscrews from the handle to change the blade (not a butterfly head).</li>
            <li>I also have a 100% stainless steel razor I just bought and have not used yet, as the Merkur progress and it  arrived at the same time.</li>
            <li>I never really got a smooth shave from it and frequently cut myself even on the least aggressive setting (mind you, after several years of problem free shaving with my 32c).  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on how hard it is to fit under your nose, etc.</li>
            <li>I thought I would treat myself to the new and much more expensive world of Merkur.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a new Merkur which has to be handled carefully</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I have only had one shave with it so far, and I used The single Mekur blade it came with.</li>

            <li> I thought I would treat myself to the new and much more expensive world of Merkur.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a new Merkur which has to be handled carefully</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I have only had one shave with it so far, and I used The single Mekur blade it came with.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish they had the same case for the long handle as they do for the short.</li>
            <li> I use the long handle daily and the short handle for travel.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure, barring some tragic accident, this will be the last safety razor I buy for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I like the weight as I prefer long handle compared to short.</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor from another listing, but received the short handled version instead of the long as the listing stated that it was.</li>
            <li> I have both the long and short handle.</li>
            <li> I also read one review (here) that said the handle wasn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> The handle is plenty long enough for me,.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands, and spent tons of money.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up saving lots of money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an Edwin Jager and a Mekur 29 long handle</li>
            <li> The Merkur Progress Adjustable Safety Razor has a longer handle which is what i was looking for,even though the description of this Merkur product says long handle</li>
            <li> This may not be a suggested razor for the newbie to the double edge wet shaving world, but I have found that the Merkur Long Handled</li>
            <li> The handle is about 3,3/4\\&quot; long , overall razor is about 4,1/8 in long with the blade tightened down.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long enough, it&#x27;s length is less than my inherited</li>
            <li> Otherwise the split ring inside the handle will drop down and then it&#x27;s a hassle putting the pieces back together again</li>
            <li> Did exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> (my face was red for a few hours every morning) and even ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> only downside is that shaving takes about twice as long, since you often have to go over the same place a few times for a close shave, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with de blade for over 55 years.</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough that the razor does the work for you.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the Progress is an evolution of the Futur or the opposite.</li>
            <li> other review - Merkur Progress Adjustable Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> , so if you are looking forward to it ,you need to order from one of the other</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the faux ivory tip.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t drop down.</li>
            <li> Also the head is much thicker and difficult to handle in tight spots.  </li>
            <li> little warning though</li>

            <li> I purchased this after I returned a Merkur Futur razor. The Progress has a much smaller head, which alleviated all the complaints I had with the Futur. It moves under my nose and around the dimple in my chin with out cuts. I am not sure if the Progress is an evolution of the Futur or the opposite. The weight and length are perfect.  If you remember the Gillette Fatboy adjustable the Progress is similar. I use the nr. 3 setting which  eliminates the need for multiple passes. My only complaint is the numbers are difficult to read. Keep in mind that one must be very careful with these adjustable razors as they can cut you more easily than a fixed blade. I am continuously impressed with how close a shave this razor gives. I use Wilkinson blades and brush shave cream.</li>
            <li> Did exactly as expected.You can set it to be as mild /aggressive as you want - Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;A little warning though when undoing the bar  keep the razor upright and support the adjustment knob so it doesn&#x27;t drop down.Otherwise the split ring inside the handle will drop down and then it&#x27;s a hassle putting the pieces back together again</li>
            <li> Gives a very comfortable close shave. Should really have a better chrome plating job considering the price and being made in Germany.</li>
            <li> as it said and on time still it will cut you</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve dealt with razor burn with my cartridge razors.  I&#x27;ve tried different brands, and spent tons of money.  No matter what I did, my combination of a course beard and sensitive skin doomed me to razor burn (my face was red for a few hours every morning) and even ingrown hairs.  I tried growing a beard, and it looked fairly good, but once Summer came around, I couldn&#x27;t bear the heat because it was so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read about safety razors.  I did research for a week, and this model had nothing but praise.  The price was daunting, especially with my low salary, but I decided to take a chance.  It was definitely worth it.  Not only have I freed myself from razor burn, but shaving is actually enjoyable again, something I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was a teenager (I remember being so proud of those patches of facial hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is enjoyable, it feels great, and I get a very close shave.  Blades are ridiculously cheap too, after paying up to $8 for each cartridge.  Depending on what brand you get (the sharpness varies), you can get several months worth of blades (100 count) for between $8-$20.  You&#x27;ll end up saving lots of money in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that shaving takes about twice as long, since you often have to go over the same place a few times for a close shave, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I switched to DE blades about a year ago and have, like may others, been looking for the perfect razor ever since. I like adjustables and have been using a reconditioned Gillette with a butterfly head. It&#x27;s a great product but I wanted more weight and especially a longer handle for an easier grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this Merkur fits the bill nicely. Excellent weight and the handle is plenty long. The handle clicks reliably into each adjustment setting. Mine had a flawless chrome finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - I would have liked a more textured handle but no slippage issues so far. The head piece completely unscrews from the handle to change the blade (not a butterfly head). The alignment markings on the head piece and handle are a faint, but once I found them I haven&#x27;t gotten anything installed backwards (I don&#x27;t know why it would matter which way the head screws in, but there an alignment mark to match up with the handle piece).</li>
            <li> This may not be a suggested razor for the newbie to the double edge wet shaving world, but I have found that the Merkur Long Handled Progress Adjustable Safety Razor is the best modern double edge safety  razor I have puchaced.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased I chose this Merkur Model.&lt;br /&gt;It has some heft to it which helps with the overall control.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m pleased with the Merkur and the Personna blades I have used in this product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality razor! Great to be able to adjust blade angle depending upon brand of blade. Feather and Astra Platinum blades  perform the best so far in this razor.</li>
            <li> Buy this razor. I have an Edwin Jager and a Mekur 29 long handle and this razor is the best! The adjustability provides you with the means to give you the best DE shave you will ever have.</li>
            <li> Since I never used an adjustable one I found myself unsure as to what setting to use. I found #2 is best for starting. I like the weight as I prefer long handle compared to short. The only thing is I wish they had the same case for the long handle as they do for the short.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.  The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the new style razors.  My neck always got nicked too and I only had it set on #2.  I donated it to the Goodwill.</li>
            <li> The Merkur Progress Adjustable Safety Razor has a longer handle which is what i was looking for,even though the description of this Merkur product says long handle it wasn&#x27;t long enough, it&#x27;s length is less than my inherited Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it BUT I did use and replace it with the Merkur Progress Adjustable Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;see other review - Merkur Progress Adjustable Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> fantastic-my 2nd favorite DE (Futur is no 1)</li>
            <li> The Merkur Progress Safety Razor is the best DE Razor I ever used.  I teamed it with a Feather Blade for one incredible close shave.  I love that you can adjust it to your stubble growth.  Then turn it down for second pass which is nice because that is where I nick myself up.  I retired my Merkur Slant Razor after shaving with Merkur&#x27;s Progressive Razor.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and a razor anyone can use and enjoy! I have researched it and Merkur has produced this type of razor since the 1950&#x27;s. It is one of my favorite razors and my absolute favorite new razor. Simple to clean and maintain and gives a super smooth 3 pass shave. It is one of my favorite purchases as far as wet shaving is concerned and if anything happened to this razor I would surely purchase another asap. If you buy one I don&#x27;t think you will regret it. Get the Polsilver Super Iridium blades as I have. A perfect combo!</li>
            <li> I ordered this razor from another listing, but received the short handled version instead of the long as the listing stated that it was. That one had EXCELLENT chrome plating, totally flawless. When I had to send that back so I could get the correct handle length, and ordered from this listing, I was surprised at the number of pits and flaws in the plating job compared to the first one. It&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t made at the same factory, or maybe it&#x27;s a factory &amp;#34;2nd&amp;#34;. It does have a #2 stamped on the underside of the blade retainer, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a model code or a &amp;#34;2nd&amp;#34; specification. The razor works great, but for the price I expect it to be aesthetically perfect.</li>
            <li> Most highly recommend it. I have both the long and short handle. I use the long handle daily and the short handle for travel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  Nice weight and good looking.  My only complaint is the faux ivory tip.  I&#x27;ve heard that there&#x27;s a vendor that has a chrome replacement for it, but, it would be nice as an out-of-box option.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just OK. Handle and adjustment knob are up to neither the price bracklet nor the Merkur logo and product reputation.</li>
            <li> A wonderfull device. It helps to make a razor securelly!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my three-piece Merkur broke (the head broke off when I dropped it -- yes, I should be more careful, but still, it wasn&#x27;t not very durable).  I thought this would be a good improvement, as I&#x27;d been DE shaving for a couple of years and wanted to take it to the next level.  I could never get it dialed in just right and the razor was so heavy that it felt awkward in my hand.  I never really got a smooth shave from it and frequently cut myself even on the least aggressive setting (mind you, after several years of problem free shaving with my 32c).  To be fair, I should have gone through the blade selection process again instead of sticking with the feathers that worked so well in my 32c.  At any rate, it sits in my drawer and I&#x27;ll not waste even one more shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately decided to go vintage and haven&#x27;t used this since.  For the cost of this razor, you could pick up a used or new-old-stock Gillette slim adjustable, super adjustable, or fat boy... all of which are far superior adjustable razors to the Progress.  I paid $1 for my super-adjustable at an estate sale and would take it any day over this... I guess they aren&#x27;t made like they used to be.  I would recommend looking for something better than this for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving with de blade for over 55 years. I thought I would treat myself to the new and much more expensive world of Merkur.  I have used many different razors.  But mostly my original butterfly Gillette.  It is adjustable and has never broken.  Now I have a new Merkur which has to be handled carefully otherwise it comes apart.  The shave isn&#x27;t as good as Gillette and the adjustment is not real.  Also the head is much thicker and difficult to handle in tight spots.  Changing the blade is not as safe as old Gillette.  I am glade I didn&#x27;t throw out the old for new.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving. My first safety razor was the Merkur 34C. I loved it. Then I got this one. It is pure ecstasy. Some people don&#x27;t like the weight of it. I love it. It is heavy enough that the razor does the work for you. As for the size, I shave my head with it so I can&#x27;t comment on how hard it is to fit under your nose, etc. I love the fact that it it adjustable, and it is perfectly calibrated (which I guess was or is an issue with these razors). I am pretty sure, barring some tragic accident, this will be the last safety razor I buy for a long, long time. Treat yourself and take the plunge. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This razor is built like a Sherman Tank. Very HEAVY and CHROMED! Do not let the nylon adjustment knob take away from the looks. The shave is as close or not depending on the user. It is my first and only adjustable de razor. IT is a great addition to your razor collection.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Very nice razor . I like the weight and feel in my hand . Great Finnish quality and most of all a Great shave .</li>
            <li> This razor does a great Job ! I have only had one shave with it so far, and I used The single Mekur blade it came with. I&#x27;m not a believer in a razor, being the only reason for a great shave alone. You have got to have a good blade to accompany also. From what I have read in review&#x27;s. The Merkur blades are not that great, and the shave I got today was pretty damn good ! With the head on this razor being adjustable, I don&#x27;t understand how it could not give a great shave. Unless your blade is real garbage. This razor did not come with the plastic case., so if you are looking forward to it ,you need to order from one of the other&#x27;s that show it in the description. The finish on the razor is in excellent shape. I also read one review (here) that said the handle wasn&#x27;t long enough. The handle is about 3,3/4\\&quot; long , overall razor is about 4,1/8 in long with the blade tightened down. The handle is plenty long enough for me,. And I have large hands ! I would recommend this razor ! This is my fifth double edge razor. I have bought two that were in the $10 to $15 range They don&#x27;t compare to this razor at all. I also have a Edwin jagger de89. And it does a great job also, but it can&#x27;t compete with this razor because of it being adjustable . with the Edwin jagger you need to find the wright  blade to match, you and the razor. With this razor you can just about use any blade you want. I also have a 100% stainless steel razor I just bought and have not used yet, as the Merkur progress and it  arrived at the same time. If you can afford to buy this razor , I am sure it will pay for itself with the ability to buy cheaper blades alone. It seems to be built well enough to last a good amount of time. I would recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> It was just as described!</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using the expensive disposables and chose this razor for its adjustability. Did not disappoint. I am happy with the value of it.</li>
            <li> Just like a straight razor I love it</li>
