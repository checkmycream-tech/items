            <li>These provide a very smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my dad and he said he has never used a better razor.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re obviously not the best</li>
            <li>(let alone better).  </li>
            <li>If there are better shaves out there please give me your suggestions.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion the latest in men&#x27;s (and</li>
            <li>Better quality at a more affordable price.  </li>
            <li>Better quality at a more affordable price.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely the best disposable razor that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors at the moment, and have been since they were released onto the market.</li>
            <li>Soooo much better than Schick</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and works great.</li>
            <li>Love these blades</li>
            <li>Ok razors.</li>
            <li>more cheaper than buying just the razor head</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to pull one off and place it onto a Fusion ProGlide Power handle I picked up years ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good razor and worth a try.</li>
            <li>Great disposable razors I highly recommend them if you like Fusion.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and the blade is good.  </li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts just a very clean close shave.</li>
            <li>Best razor I have tried, close shave and long life.</li>
            <li>razors are top quality easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are without a doubt my favorite razors available.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly the monthly subscription makes it easily affordable.</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, well product.</li>
            <li>I can easily get away with shaving every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>far as the razors themselves, it&#x27;s a nice razor that provides a nice shave.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve always worked fine.</li>
            <li>When it did the Schick Krona was a better razor than the Gillette Super Speed.  </li>
            <li>My face came out smooth and free of irritation.</li>
            <li>I received a free razor from Gillette to try out.</li>
            <li>and they really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as close to as baby smooth as I can get without waxing.</li>
            <li>cheap, zhencheap  </li>
            <li>I got this razor free with a can of Edge shaving gel and took it on a two week trip.</li>
            <li>so I shave an area almost four ways which can eventually leads to razor burn and skin irritation sooner and more consistently</li>
            <li>Good and sharp, good for face and those more sensitive areas that require hair removal.  </li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle gave me a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>razor is very flimsy and very cheap quality, blades don&#x27;t detach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light, but it is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The quality and performance is as good as the traditional fusion.</li>
            <li>Not only are they excellent for my daily stubble</li>
            <li>Hell, in the days of the D/E blade Schick made a better double edged blade and didn&#x27;t even make a D/E razor most of it&#x27;s history.  </li>
            <li>the razor since there is a single blade on the top that will very easily cut you.</li>
            <li>I use these on my sensitive face and they feel the best only problem is they don&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>If not then the Schick does a great job, no stubble, no cuts or nicks and never any irritation for less money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li>The blade is provided to be used for close-up places, such as immediately under your nose, which is a nice concept.</li>
            <li>but I can just easily (if not awkwardly) use the five blades to shave under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I rarely get cuts/nicks.</li>
            <li>This is after having no trouble with using Mach 3 blades for many years.</li>
            <li>These feel very smooth while shaving, and have a slightly better grip than the non disposable razors, due to how lightweight they are.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a contentious debate about the effectiveness of using more than two blades for general shaving and come from the camp that bounces from brand to brand, going wherever the discount coupons take me.</li>
            <li>I had a very large cut on my chin resulting from the first use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend, even for those who like the Mr. Clean look.</li>
            <li>My beard is coarse, and multi-blade razors that I try easily get full of whiskers.</li>
            <li>These are cheaply made and are not the same product as the original Gillette Fusion I have.</li>
            <li>Like most new razors, a new fusion razor cuts effortless through three or four days of stubble with ease and does so for about two or three months when I just won&#x27;t put up with the hair pulling and razor burn.</li>
            <li>Each one lasts at least a month and still does a great job.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you want out of your razors.</li>
            <li>When I actually started to use, I was almost convinced that these multi-blade razors with the trimmer was more than just a marketing</li>
            <li>You can purchase this exact item at Wal-Mart for under $8.00 walmart.com</li>
            <li>... glad to be back with Gilette!  </li>
            <li>I am using the first of the two razors now, and they&lt;br /&gt;work as well as the non-disposable ones, except for</li>
            <li>This is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used, I shaved with an electric for 20 years.</li>
            <li>As a Mexican-American male (or maybe it is just the genetics of my family) with healthy skin, I can grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li>These are as good as the solid, permenant handle versions and will last for 20</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, that this razor will save you a bundle in bandages.  </li>
            <li>aware: I used the new blade out of the box and ripped all my hair off instead of shaving it off !</li>
            <li>Shaves very close and haven&#x27;t had an issue with any nicks at all.  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable, and the shave is so close, that these are the only razors I use anymore.  </li>
            <li>I think they are a reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li>I cannot say much about trimmer blade though</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I never really felt confident about holding it correctly, compounded by having holding the handle contrary to its ergonomic design (which maybe contributed to why I felt the skin</li>
            <li>and I never really felt confident about holding it correctly, compounded by having holding the handle contrary to its ergonomic design (which maybe contributed to why I felt the skin irritation).    </li>
            <li>This set does not seem to be a real Gillette razor, rather a mock off.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>fact that the handle is much much lighter, making</li>
            <li>The whole process takes me about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Seems to have the same blades as the standard fusion, and is a far superior shave to the Mach 3, and also lasts much longer, I average more than a month on one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to ditch my scruffy look, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle will definitely be considered if I need a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li>Dorco, other disposables and the return of the D/E is doing better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>(slightly better qual shave than any other disposable razors, tho).</li>
            <li>Also, the added single black trimmer works great for getting under the nose as that&#x27;s an issue with these multi blade razors.</li>
            <li>In general Gillette products are rip off, but the sharpener and you can get your money&#x27;s worth by using it 10 times longer.</li>
            <li>Schick has a better product sold for less.  </li>
            <li>The same product is $3 more at my local market.</li>
            <li>The shutter design of cartridge rinses out completely and flexible enough to keep constant contact with skin to all but the most unusual handling.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price as weel, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>this includes a hot towel wrap, a rinse with Nivea sensitive skin face wash, an application of Proraso pre-shave cream, hot-water soaked badger brush shaving soap application (again Proraso red), and shaving with a hot-water soaked Fusion razor, rinsing in a stainless steel bowl of hot water every couple of 1-inch strokes.</li>
            <li>I normally use a Sensor Excel 3 bladed razor.</li>
            <li>I go over my whole face in one direction first, reapply the shaving cream, and go over each region of my face against the grain in each area for a second pass.</li>
            <li>they get a new customer.  </li>
            <li>These disposables are just as good if not better than the single blades.</li>
            <li>They are exactly the same as the blades except on a disposable holder.</li>
            <li>Since they are exactly the same it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>Dorco, other disposables and the return of the D/E is doing better than Gillette.e the switch to Schick and never look back...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review when I finally need to replace my first razor.  </li>
            <li>His face he aaid has never been so smooth and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last as long and don&#x27;t give the 100% smooth shave others do.</li>
            <li>For the same cost I like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.  </li>
            <li>My final step before putting my razor back in the medicine cabinet is to do a quick hand-stropping.</li>
            <li>personal grooming featuring six blades - five for large area shaving and one dedicated for the finer details like maintaining goatee or sideburns.  </li>
            <li>It is a high grade handle and not a cheap plastic throw-a-way like most disposables, a blade that tries to be as high a quality as the carts I buy for either my Schick Hydro3 and 5.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a razor, I generally keep a stubble of a beard.</li>
            <li>But the handle is much lighter than the standard ones.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34; Gillettes blade carts cost too much considering that both Business Week and the WSJ already ran a story about the fact that the Fusion Proglide carts only cost Gillette $0.009 cents a peice to manufacture!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female but prefer men razor&#x27;s mainly because I pretty much just use these for my naughty bits</li>
            <li>Clean shave, doesn&#x27;t dull too fast.</li>
            <li>Gets dull very fast though, but the trimmer on it is worth it</li>
            <li>For my birthday last year, my wife bought me a set of stuff for single blade wet shaving (face wash, pre shave cream, shaving soap, after shave lotion, badger brush, stainless blade handle, a variety pack of many different brands of razors, and a styptic pencil).</li>
            <li>They are always available on amazon as opposed to my local store and they cost less on amazon.</li>
            <li>(Each will last half a can of travel sized shaving cream from gillete comfortably) Recommended.</li>
            <li>Up until shaving literally becomes a pain, the fusion shaves cleanly and consistently, moreso in the tough areas like my chin or under my nose.  </li>
            <li>After trying it out for a few months, studying many forums and YouTube videos for techniques I found that I really liked the ritual of it, but I couldn&#x27;t get away without a crazy amount of irritation and lots of nicks.</li>
            <li>The blades on the front work well on the down stroke, but be very careful as you lift up (return to top of cheek)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care about their new commercial that says &amp;#34;and cost about a buck a week to shave...</li>
            <li>looks similar, well, actually only on the first look and maybe only through the package.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Like the Schick Quattro, the single blade in the back of cartridge was the first irritate my skin</li>
            <li>Like the Schick Quattro, the single blade in the back of cartridge was the first irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I finally replaced my first razor in June- over 7 months of use from a single razor.</li>
            <li>I shave regularly but not everyday.</li>
            <li>but the hardware was much cheaper quality than expected.</li>
            <li>Handle doesnt slip and the strip lasts longer and the shave is much smoother than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>For better or for worse I do not put that much in shaving so when I received a Gillette Fusion in the mail, I could not have cared less.</li>
            <li>Many of them left patches of whiskers behind.</li>
            <li>The refills are little pricey for my taste but you really should not sacrifice quality on something designed to cut things off your body, moreso if your appearance is a major factor in your work.  </li>
            <li>The refills are little pricey for my taste but you really should not sacrifice quality on something designed to cut things off your body, moreso if your appearance is a major factor in your work.  </li>
            <li>you put them next to each other, which i did after I purchased the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion&amp;#34; in store,&lt;br /&gt;the difference is very clear: the real one is much heavier, the handle doesn&#x27;t bend and is made out of at least two different materials.</li>
            <li>The Fusion shaves very close without irritation and lasted about as long as my other razors blades -2 ½ weeks.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin so these are my favorite to get a great shave with no cuts!</li>
            <li> These provide a very smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my dad and he said he has never used a better razor.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously not the best</li>
            <li> (let alone better).  </li>
            <li> If there are better shaves out there please give me your suggestions.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion the latest in men&#x27;s (and</li>
            <li> Better quality at a more affordable price.  </li>
            <li> Better quality at a more affordable price.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely the best disposable razor that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors at the moment, and have been since they were released onto the market.</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than Schick</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works great.</li>
            <li> Love these blades</li>
            <li> Ok razors.</li>
            <li> more cheaper than buying just the razor head</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to pull one off and place it onto a Fusion ProGlide Power handle I picked up years ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good razor and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Great disposable razors I highly recommend them if you like Fusion.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and the blade is good.  </li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts just a very clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have tried, close shave and long life.</li>
            <li> razors are top quality easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt my favorite razors available.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly the monthly subscription makes it easily affordable.</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well product.</li>
            <li> I can easily get away with shaving every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> far as the razors themselves, it&#x27;s a nice razor that provides a nice shave.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve always worked fine.</li>
            <li> When it did the Schick Krona was a better razor than the Gillette Super Speed.  </li>
            <li> My face came out smooth and free of irritation.</li>
            <li> I received a free razor from Gillette to try out.</li>
            <li> and they really fit the bill.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as close to as baby smooth as I can get without waxing.</li>
            <li> cheap, zhencheap  </li>
            <li> I got this razor free with a can of Edge shaving gel and took it on a two week trip.</li>
            <li> so I shave an area almost four ways which can eventually leads to razor burn and skin irritation sooner and more consistently</li>
            <li> Good and sharp, good for face and those more sensitive areas that require hair removal.  </li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle gave me a clean and close shave.</li>
            <li> razor is very flimsy and very cheap quality, blades don&#x27;t detach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very light, but it is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The quality and performance is as good as the traditional fusion.</li>
            <li> Not only are they excellent for my daily stubble</li>
            <li> Hell, in the days of the D/E blade Schick made a better double edged blade and didn&#x27;t even make a D/E razor most of it&#x27;s history.  </li>
            <li> the razor since there is a single blade on the top that will very easily cut you.</li>
            <li> I use these on my sensitive face and they feel the best only problem is they don&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> If not then the Schick does a great job, no stubble, no cuts or nicks and never any irritation for less money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward.</li>
            <li> The blade is provided to be used for close-up places, such as immediately under your nose, which is a nice concept.</li>
            <li> but I can just easily (if not awkwardly) use the five blades to shave under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I rarely get cuts/nicks.</li>
            <li> This is after having no trouble with using Mach 3 blades for many years.</li>
            <li> These feel very smooth while shaving, and have a slightly better grip than the non disposable razors, due to how lightweight they are.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a contentious debate about the effectiveness of using more than two blades for general shaving and come from the camp that bounces from brand to brand, going wherever the discount coupons take me.</li>
            <li> I had a very large cut on my chin resulting from the first use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend, even for those who like the Mr. Clean look.</li>
            <li> My beard is coarse, and multi-blade razors that I try easily get full of whiskers.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and are not the same product as the original Gillette Fusion I have.</li>
            <li> Like most new razors, a new fusion razor cuts effortless through three or four days of stubble with ease and does so for about two or three months when I just won&#x27;t put up with the hair pulling and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Each one lasts at least a month and still does a great job.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you want out of your razors.</li>
            <li> When I actually started to use, I was almost convinced that these multi-blade razors with the trimmer was more than just a marketing</li>
            <li> You can purchase this exact item at Wal-Mart for under $8.00 walmart.com</li>
            <li> ... glad to be back with Gilette!  </li>
            <li> I am using the first of the two razors now, and they&lt;br /&gt;work as well as the non-disposable ones, except for</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used, I shaved with an electric for 20 years.</li>
            <li> As a Mexican-American male (or maybe it is just the genetics of my family) with healthy skin, I can grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> These are as good as the solid, permenant handle versions and will last for 20</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, that this razor will save you a bundle in bandages.  </li>
            <li> aware: I used the new blade out of the box and ripped all my hair off instead of shaving it off !</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and haven&#x27;t had an issue with any nicks at all.  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable, and the shave is so close, that these are the only razors I use anymore.  </li>
            <li> I think they are a reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I cannot say much about trimmer blade though</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> and I never really felt confident about holding it correctly, compounded by having holding the handle contrary to its ergonomic design (which maybe contributed to why I felt the skin</li>
            <li> and I never really felt confident about holding it correctly, compounded by having holding the handle contrary to its ergonomic design (which maybe contributed to why I felt the skin irritation).    </li>
            <li> This set does not seem to be a real Gillette razor, rather a mock off.&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li> fact that the handle is much much lighter, making</li>
            <li> The whole process takes me about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Seems to have the same blades as the standard fusion, and is a far superior shave to the Mach 3, and also lasts much longer, I average more than a month on one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to ditch my scruffy look, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle will definitely be considered if I need a clean shaven look.</li>
            <li> Dorco, other disposables and the return of the D/E is doing better than Gillette.</li>
            <li> (slightly better qual shave than any other disposable razors, tho).</li>
            <li> Also, the added single black trimmer works great for getting under the nose as that&#x27;s an issue with these multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> In general Gillette products are rip off, but the sharpener and you can get your money&#x27;s worth by using it 10 times longer.</li>
            <li> Schick has a better product sold for less.  </li>
            <li> The same product is $3 more at my local market.</li>
            <li> The shutter design of cartridge rinses out completely and flexible enough to keep constant contact with skin to all but the most unusual handling.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price as weel, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this includes a hot towel wrap, a rinse with Nivea sensitive skin face wash, an application of Proraso pre-shave cream, hot-water soaked badger brush shaving soap application (again Proraso red), and shaving with a hot-water soaked Fusion razor, rinsing in a stainless steel bowl of hot water every couple of 1-inch strokes.</li>
            <li> I normally use a Sensor Excel 3 bladed razor.</li>
            <li> I go over my whole face in one direction first, reapply the shaving cream, and go over each region of my face against the grain in each area for a second pass.</li>
            <li> they get a new customer.  </li>
            <li> These disposables are just as good if not better than the single blades.</li>
            <li> They are exactly the same as the blades except on a disposable holder.</li>
            <li> Since they are exactly the same it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Dorco, other disposables and the return of the D/E is doing better than Gillette.e the switch to Schick and never look back...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review when I finally need to replace my first razor.  </li>
            <li> His face he aaid has never been so smooth and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long and don&#x27;t give the 100% smooth shave others do.</li>
            <li> For the same cost I like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.  </li>
            <li> My final step before putting my razor back in the medicine cabinet is to do a quick hand-stropping.</li>
            <li> personal grooming featuring six blades - five for large area shaving and one dedicated for the finer details like maintaining goatee or sideburns.  </li>
            <li> It is a high grade handle and not a cheap plastic throw-a-way like most disposables, a blade that tries to be as high a quality as the carts I buy for either my Schick Hydro3 and 5.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a razor, I generally keep a stubble of a beard.</li>
            <li> But the handle is much lighter than the standard ones.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34; Gillettes blade carts cost too much considering that both Business Week and the WSJ already ran a story about the fact that the Fusion Proglide carts only cost Gillette $0.009 cents a peice to manufacture!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female but prefer men razor&#x27;s mainly because I pretty much just use these for my naughty bits</li>
            <li> Clean shave, doesn&#x27;t dull too fast.</li>
            <li> Gets dull very fast though, but the trimmer on it is worth it</li>
            <li> For my birthday last year, my wife bought me a set of stuff for single blade wet shaving (face wash, pre shave cream, shaving soap, after shave lotion, badger brush, stainless blade handle, a variety pack of many different brands of razors, and a styptic pencil).</li>
            <li> They are always available on amazon as opposed to my local store and they cost less on amazon.</li>
            <li> (Each will last half a can of travel sized shaving cream from gillete comfortably) Recommended.</li>
            <li> Up until shaving literally becomes a pain, the fusion shaves cleanly and consistently, moreso in the tough areas like my chin or under my nose.  </li>
            <li> After trying it out for a few months, studying many forums and YouTube videos for techniques I found that I really liked the ritual of it, but I couldn&#x27;t get away without a crazy amount of irritation and lots of nicks.</li>
            <li> The blades on the front work well on the down stroke, but be very careful as you lift up (return to top of cheek)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care about their new commercial that says &amp;#34;and cost about a buck a week to shave...</li>
            <li> looks similar, well, actually only on the first look and maybe only through the package.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Like the Schick Quattro, the single blade in the back of cartridge was the first irritate my skin</li>
            <li> Like the Schick Quattro, the single blade in the back of cartridge was the first irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I finally replaced my first razor in June- over 7 months of use from a single razor.</li>
            <li> I shave regularly but not everyday.</li>
            <li> but the hardware was much cheaper quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Handle doesnt slip and the strip lasts longer and the shave is much smoother than other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> For better or for worse I do not put that much in shaving so when I received a Gillette Fusion in the mail, I could not have cared less.</li>
            <li> Many of them left patches of whiskers behind.</li>
            <li> The refills are little pricey for my taste but you really should not sacrifice quality on something designed to cut things off your body, moreso if your appearance is a major factor in your work.  </li>
            <li> The refills are little pricey for my taste but you really should not sacrifice quality on something designed to cut things off your body, moreso if your appearance is a major factor in your work.  </li>
            <li> you put them next to each other, which i did after I purchased the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion&amp;#34; in store,&lt;br /&gt;the difference is very clear: the real one is much heavier, the handle doesn&#x27;t bend and is made out of at least two different materials.</li>
            <li> The Fusion shaves very close without irritation and lasted about as long as my other razors blades -2 ½ weeks.</li>
            <li> most razors bite me at least once during a shave (Seriously, do you</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> Dangerous blade on the top pointed the opposite direction as the other blades.</li>
            <li> Not like other razors where you only get one shave.</li>
            <li> What the single blade experience taught me was a technique-</li>
            <li> I decided to keep the rest of the ritual that I had picked up with the single blade technique-</li>
            <li> (dunno if that&#x27;s fast for it to start getting dull or not) ... for about almost 3.50 each if you break it down</li>
            <li> I like these as they stay sharp for a long period of time and provide a close shave</li>
            <li> They sell it on Amazon and it keeps it sharp for a very long time</li>
            <li> I have learned to be careful using it, but I prefer another multi-blade brand I use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are also by far the most expensive razors I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> With this technique, I&#x27;ve been using the same razor with absolutely no irritation for over 4-months now (no more need for the styptic pencil either).</li>
            <li> but this was a problem with other razors.  </li>
            <li> To help extend the life of the blades, I use a few shots of my compressed air keyboard/printer can to clean-out and dry the shaving</li>
            <li> In the past, I have had trouble finding a razor that would shave close enough.</li>
            <li> At least they last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> *NOT* nearly as sharp/close-shave as the usual non-disposable versions, not worth it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you feel that you need to push down</li>
            <li> The disposable version is slightly lighter than carrying the non-disposable razor with a couple blades.</li>
            <li> but the handle was a lower quality plastic than previous purchases.</li>
            <li> So the pass fail will be based on how long these last per razor.</li>
            <li> Plus I find myself using the little trimmer blade on the backside to do the area around my nose.</li>
            <li> I always use a fusion at home, so I got a few of these to take with me on trips</li>
            <li> I did have some trouble with the razor clogging up.</li>
            <li> I only shave twice a week because I just got tired of shaving every day.</li>
            <li> , I still like the heavy metal handle for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The handles are lite plastic cheap crap</li>
            <li> how hard it is to balance on one leg while bracing the other on the shower wall to shave?</li>
            <li> , after a few uses, you will get the handle on how hard you&lt;br /&gt;need</li>
            <li> - if I ever use it, it&#x27;s usually to maintain sideburns or under my nose</li>
            <li> I usually use it every two days, i shave my head and face</li>
            <li> I use them about twice a week for a month, maybe 5 weeks each before they start to dull</li>
            <li> Finally, rinse with cold water and and apply the Nivea post-shave balm, or some witch hazel lotion.</li>
            <li> Less than a penny a piece!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously-</li>
            <li> With the single-blade razor, (using the same outlined technique) I was replacing the razors with every shave and still getting horrible razor burn (tried Feather, Astra, Gillette, Derby, others), and needing to shave every day because they only cut the hair off at the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li> However I found it to be difficult to use under my nose and hard to position for sideburn cutoff because of the style of the head.  </li>
            <li> However, it is dangerous since it is also in cutting position when you are removing the razor from your face to prepare for the next stroke.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t leave my handle behind (again).</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it would be difficult to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> If this fails (and it sounds like it will)</li>
            <li> If this fails (and it sounds like it will)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit pricey but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always shocked at the price of disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Terrible razors cut and gave me a rash.</li>

            <li> These are the only razors my husband uses.</li>
            <li> Probably the best razor out there1</li>
            <li> Best razor I have tried, close shave and long life.</li>
            <li> I have not used the blade, maybe next week.</li>
            <li> The same product is $3 more at my local market. The quality and performance is as good as the traditional fusion.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I use this razor to shave my face and head. These provide a very smooth close shave. No stumbles. Great product.</li>
            <li> Dangerous blade on the top pointed the opposite direction as the other blades. I had a very large cut on my chin resulting from the first use.  The blades on the front work well on the down stroke, but be very careful as you lift up (return to top of cheek) the razor since there is a single blade on the top that will very easily cut you.

            <li> I bought these for my dad and he said he has never used a better razor. His face he aaid has never been so smooth and they last a long time. Not like other razors where you only get one shave.</li>
            <li> WYSIWYG ITEM....IDEAL FOR TRAVEL BAG</li>
            <li> Always a great shave!</li>
            <li> Terrible razors cut and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I always use a fusion at home, so I got a few of these to take with me on trips so I don&#x27;t leave my handle behind (again). Seems to have the same blades as the standard fusion, and is a far superior shave to the Mach 3, and also lasts much longer, I average more than a month on one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a razor, I generally keep a stubble of a beard. In the past, I have had trouble finding a razor that would shave close enough. Many of them left patches of whiskers behind. The Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle gave me a clean and close shave. I didn&#x27;t have patches left on my face that I had to go back over and get. My face came out smooth and free of irritation. I did have some trouble with the razor clogging up. My beard is coarse, and multi-blade razors that I try easily get full of whiskers. This one, though I hoped it would be different, did too. I imagine that is going to be the way things are. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready to ditch my scruffy look, but the Gillette Fusion Proglide with Flexball handle will definitely be considered if I need a clean shaven look. I received a free razor from Gillette to try out.</li>
            <li> These work quite well, close shave with good handling.</li>
            <li> These are without a doubt my favorite razors available.  Not only are they excellent for my daily stubble but I also use to shave my head (although that&#x27;s a smaller job each day it seems). Shaves very close and haven&#x27;t had an issue with any nicks at all.  Also, the added single black trimmer works great for getting under the nose as that&#x27;s an issue with these multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item for my husband as this is the only razor he will use. He says they are excellent! They are always available on amazon as opposed to my local store and they cost less on amazon.</li>
            <li> 5 star rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razors are top quality easy to use. Most importantly the monthly subscription makes it easily affordable. Finding these at a local retailer store would cost you double the price of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive. Disposable. Pretty straightforward. I&#x27;ve purchases these several times and they&#x27;ve always worked fine. They&#x27;re obviously not the best but they get the job done. A good buy!</li>
            <li> Bought them instead of the blade replacements because they where on sale and cheaper per blade. They are exactly the same as the blades except on a disposable holder. If they are cheaper then buying blades get them. If you don&#x27;t have a fusion razor get them. Since they are exactly the same it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I think these are the absolute best razors! Each one lasts at least a month and still does a great job.</li>
            <li> I only shave occasionally, but when I do I prefer to let fusion disposable razors for men. Stay scruffy my friends.</li>
            <li> I only shave twice a week because I just got tired of shaving every day. I have to say that this razor gives me the best shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  The close shave and lack of irritation to the skin are amazing.  Unfortunately, they are also by far the most expensive razors I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  At least they last quite a while.  Otherwise, it would be difficult to justify the cost.  They are so comfortable, and the shave is so close, that these are the only razors I use anymore.  I&#x27;m broke, but my face looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling, camping, motorhome or motel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always shocked at the price of disposable razors. I get these delivered once a month and they really fit the bill. I think they are a reasonable price for what you get.</li>
            <li> I use these on my sensitive face and they feel the best only problem is they don&#x27;t last more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> No comparison with the non-disposable version.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I don&#x27;t want to take my home razor on the road...I forget it...damage the existing blades, etc. These are as good as the solid, permenant handle versions and will last for 20 - 30 shaves easy!</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and the blade is good.  But the handle is much lighter than the standard ones.  All the the blade cannot be detached from the handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female but prefer men razor&#x27;s mainly because I pretty much just use these for my naughty bits and it&#x27;s as close to as baby smooth as I can get without waxing. Yet to find a women&#x27;s 5-blade that&#x27;s just as good (let alone better).  I use them about twice a week for a month, maybe 5 weeks each before they start to dull (dunno if that&#x27;s fast for it to start getting dull or not) ... for about almost 3.50 each if you break it down it&#x27;s a bit pricey but not too bad.  If there are better shaves out there please give me your suggestions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, well product.</li>
            <li> The Dollar Shave Club equivalent of this blade is $6/mo and if you add this to your Subscribe and Save it&#x27;s $6.77 (at time of post) for 2 razors a month instead of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the razors themselves, it&#x27;s a nice razor that provides a nice shave. Exactly what you want out of your razors.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so these are my favorite to get a great shave with no cuts!</li>
            <li> work perfectly, good for traveling</li>
            <li> cheap, zhencheap  [...]</li>
            <li> Nice to have delivered to our door. My husband likes the 5 blades and prefers this razor to others he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> The five blades give excellent performance. The disposable version is slightly lighter than carrying the non-disposable razor with a couple blades. Has a cover to protect the blade.</li>
            <li> Works great, that should say it all, will always use this product.Nothing compares to this. No nicks or cuts just a very clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Gets dull very fast though, but the trimmer on it is worth it</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Seriously- most razors bite me at least once during a shave (Seriously, do you _know_ how hard it is to balance on one leg while bracing the other on the shower wall to shave? Trick-sy!), but not this one!  I&#x27;m fairly certain if you&#x27;re as uncoordinated as I am, that this razor will save you a bundle in bandages.  Truth.</li>
            <li> For better or for worse I do not put that much in shaving so when I received a Gillette Fusion in the mail, I could not have cared less. When I actually started to use, I was almost convinced that these multi-blade razors with the trimmer was more than just a marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion the latest in men&#x27;s (and [[ASIN:B0039LMT9M women&#x27;s]]) personal grooming featuring six blades - five for large area shaving and one dedicated for the finer details like maintaining goatee or sideburns.  It&#x27;s a contentious debate about the effectiveness of using more than two blades for general shaving and come from the camp that bounces from brand to brand, going wherever the discount coupons take me. As a Mexican-American male (or maybe it is just the genetics of my family) with healthy skin, I can grow large patches of stubble on my cheeks with denser patches and thicker hairs growing under my nose and chin.  I shave regularly but not everyday. Like most new razors, a new fusion razor cuts effortless through three or four days of stubble with ease and does so for about two or three months when I just won&#x27;t put up with the hair pulling and razor burn. The shutter design of cartridge rinses out completely and flexible enough to keep constant contact with skin to all but the most unusual handling.  I cannot say much about trimmer blade though - if I ever use it, it&#x27;s usually to maintain sideburns or under my nose but I can just easily (if not awkwardly) use the five blades to shave under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up until I used the [[ASIN:B0056GOHN4 Schick Quattro]], I had settled on the Fusion. When I shave, I go with and against the grain so I shave an area almost four ways which can eventually leads to razor burn and skin irritation sooner and more consistently but this was a problem with other razors.  Up until shaving literally becomes a pain, the fusion shaves cleanly and consistently, moreso in the tough areas like my chin or under my nose.  I really like it.  About the only flaw that immediately comes to mind is the trimmer blade. Like the Schick Quattro, the single blade in the back of cartridge was the first irritate my skin and I never really felt confident about holding it correctly, compounded by having holding the handle contrary to its ergonomic design (which maybe contributed to why I felt the skin irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the Fusion is an awesome razor.  The refills are little pricey for my taste but you really should not sacrifice quality on something designed to cut things off your body, moreso if your appearance is a major factor in your work.  The disposable fusion gives you what you need - a wonderful, almost effortless shave without the sticker shock.aw that immediately comes to mind is the trimmer blade.

            <li> This set does not seem to be a real Gillette razor, rather a mock off.&lt;br /&gt;Be aware: I used the new blade out of the box and ripped all my hair off instead of shaving it off ! painful!&lt;br /&gt;The razor is very flimsy and very cheap quality, blades don&#x27;t detach.&lt;br /&gt;It truly is missleading that this product here is called &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;There is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Gillette razor you can buy in-store, that&#x27;s called &amp;#34;FUSION&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;which looks similar, well, actually only on the first look and maybe only through the package.&lt;br /&gt;When you put them next to each other, which i did after I purchased the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Gillette Fusion&amp;#34; in store,&lt;br /&gt;the difference is very clear: the real one is much heavier, the handle doesn&#x27;t bend and is made out of at least two different materials. The blade can be detached for a replacement blade.&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away and Amazon was so Nice and reimbursed me.</li>
            <li> they came in a timely manner and i have no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I swore I would never buy this Gillette product just because of the price and I don&#x27;t care about their new commercial that says &amp;#34;and cost about a buck a week to shave...&amp;#34; Gillettes blade carts cost too much considering that both Business Week and the WSJ already ran a story about the fact that the Fusion Proglide carts only cost Gillette $0.009 cents a peice to manufacture!  That&#x27;s right: Less than a penny a piece!!! I get the R&amp;D recovery cost, but the price is B.S. for that as well!&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have to say that this razor (the disposable version) is almost as good as the Schick Hydro 3 I&#x27;d been using.  It is a high grade handle and not a cheap plastic throw-a-way like most disposables, a blade that tries to be as high a quality as the carts I buy for either my Schick Hydro3 and 5.  But...I can buy four Schick Hydro 3 carts for $9.99 (today on sale at my grocery store for $7.99) and I got a twin pack of this Gillette for $7.99 for two razors.  So the pass fail will be based on how long these last per razor. My Schick&#x27;s last for about 8 - 10 shaves per cart, and I have gotten 14 consecutive shaves in a row from one Schick cart. Never with any thing Gillette makes..so IF this Gillette product can outlast my Hydro 3 they get a new customer.  If not then the Schick does a great job, no stubble, no cuts or nicks and never any irritation for less money.&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t think the Gillette will cut it.  Bottom line: Schick has a better product sold for less.  Gillette is not competitive in quality or price and never has been. Hell, in the days of the D/E blade Schick made a better double edged blade and didn&#x27;t even make a D/E razor most of it&#x27;s history.  When it did the Schick Krona was a better razor than the Gillette Super Speed.  It took me years to make the change final but now that I have I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  So &#x27;Good Luck&#x27; Gillette.  Your increasing prices and decreasing quality is what made this Gillette user of 40 years make the switch to Schick and never look back...but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.  To those who like to say &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;  Schick.  Better quality at a more affordable price.  So with Schick you are right:)&lt;br /&gt;On a final note; I think this is Gillette&#x27;s last stand.  If this fails (and it sounds like it will) what&#x27;s left?  Good News and the disposable market I guess.  Dorco, other disposables and the return of the D/E is doing better than Gillette.e the switch to Schick and never look back...but I&#x27;ll give this new good and really expensive razor a chance.

            <li> It is definitely the best disposable razor that I have ever used.  It is very light, but it is also very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These disposables are just as good if not better than the single blades. For the same cost I like having a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> Hey these are great.  Perfect for when your out on vacation trip.  These match the same quality of permanent manual Fusion shavers.</li>
            <li> With out a doubt, I have had the smoothest, cleanest shave ever with these razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend, even for those who like the Mr. Clean look.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion pro-life. You can purchase this exact item at Wal-Mart for under $8.00 walmart.com it&#x27;s definitely the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I usually use it every two days, i shave my head and face and im very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price as weel, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Shave close without nicks, cuts or burns</li>
            <li> Very good, but pricey.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing and cuts close to my skin.  Now my wife does not have to endure whisker burns any longer.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors at the moment, and have been since they were released onto the market.</li>
            <li> I got this razor free with a can of Edge shaving gel and took it on a two week trip. I normally use a Sensor Excel 3 bladed razor. The Fusion shaves very close without irritation and lasted about as long as my other razors blades -2 ½ weeks. However I found it to be difficult to use under my nose and hard to position for sideburn cutoff because of the style of the head.  I will not be switching.</li>
            <li> Soooo much better than Schick... glad to be back with Gilette!  Handle doesnt slip and the strip lasts longer and the shave is much smoother than other brands I have tried.  Wish I had never left gilette.</li>
            <li> These are cheaply made and are not the same product as the original Gillette Fusion I have.</li>
            <li> I am using the first of the two razors now, and they&lt;br /&gt;work as well as the non-disposable ones, except for&lt;br /&gt;the fact that the handle is much much lighter, making&lt;br /&gt;you feel that you need to push down harder.&lt;br /&gt;And when you do that, it feels like the handle might break.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a few uses, you will get the handle on how hard you&lt;br /&gt;need to press.&lt;br /&gt;The razors are great for traveling, or to keep and use in your gym&lt;br /&gt;bag.&lt;br /&gt;But, I still like the heavy metal handle for everyday use.</li>
            <li> For travel. I use the handle, will try it on my travels. Should work the same</li>
            <li> The gel strip fell off both of them after 2 uses. The handles are lite plastic cheap crap too yeah.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works great. Love these blades</li>
            <li> Clean shave, doesn&#x27;t dull too fast.</li>
            <li> Good and sharp, good for face and those more sensitive areas that require hair removal.  No nicks cuts or burns.</li>
            <li> These feel very smooth while shaving, and have a slightly better grip than the non disposable razors, due to how lightweight they are. They also stay usable quite a while. (Each will last half a can of travel sized shaving cream from gillete comfortably) Recommended.</li>
            <li> In general Gillette products are rip off, but the sharpener and you can get your money&#x27;s worth by using it 10 times longer. They sell it on Amazon and it keeps it sharp for a very long time</li>
            <li> *NOT* nearly as sharp/close-shave as the usual non-disposable versions, not worth it.  (slightly better qual shave than any other disposable razors, tho).</li>
            <li> Ok razors. Don&#x27;t last as long and don&#x27;t give the 100% smooth shave others do. Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I&#x27;ve ever used, I shaved with an electric for 20 years. I like these as they stay sharp for a long period of time and provide a close shave, I rarely get cuts/nicks. Plus I find myself using the little trimmer blade on the backside to do the area around my nose. Good product, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> more cheaper than buying just the razor head</li>
            <li> Love this product. It gives me the best shave on my head.</li>
            <li> They work well but the hardware was much cheaper quality than expected. The razor blade itself is great but the handle was a lower quality plastic than previous purchases.</li>
            <li> good shave for the price</li>
            <li> For my birthday last year, my wife bought me a set of stuff for single blade wet shaving (face wash, pre shave cream, shaving soap, after shave lotion, badger brush, stainless blade handle, a variety pack of many different brands of razors, and a styptic pencil). After trying it out for a few months, studying many forums and YouTube videos for techniques I found that I really liked the ritual of it, but I couldn&#x27;t get away without a crazy amount of irritation and lots of nicks. This is after having no trouble with using Mach 3 blades for many years. What the single blade experience taught me was a technique- something I hadn&#x27;t learned before (I think I learned to shave from watching shaving commercials decades ago). I only decided to buy this pack of Gillette Fusion razors just because they were on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s when I went in looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t leave my face in pain.  I decided to keep the rest of the ritual that I had picked up with the single blade technique- this includes a hot towel wrap, a rinse with Nivea sensitive skin face wash, an application of Proraso pre-shave cream, hot-water soaked badger brush shaving soap application (again Proraso red), and shaving with a hot-water soaked Fusion razor, rinsing in a stainless steel bowl of hot water every couple of 1-inch strokes. I go over my whole face in one direction first, reapply the shaving cream, and go over each region of my face against the grain in each area for a second pass. Finally, rinse with cold water and and apply the Nivea post-shave balm, or some witch hazel lotion. My final step before putting my razor back in the medicine cabinet is to do a quick hand-stropping. The whole process takes me about 10 minutes.  With this technique, I&#x27;ve been using the same razor with absolutely no irritation for over 4-months now (no more need for the styptic pencil either). I can easily get away with shaving every 2-3 days. With the single-blade razor, (using the same outlined technique) I was replacing the razors with every shave and still getting horrible razor burn (tried Feather, Astra, Gillette, Derby, others), and needing to shave every day because they only cut the hair off at the surface of the skin.  Another note: These blades will come off of the disposable handles if you pull them off with enough force- I was able to pull one off and place it onto a Fusion ProGlide Power handle I picked up years ago. I&#x27;ll update this review when I finally need to replace my first razor.  Edit: I finally replaced my first razor in June- over 7 months of use from a single razor. Not bad!</li>
            <li> Great disposable razors I highly recommend them if you like Fusion.  They are a bit cheaper I think then replacement razor blades as these tend to last for several weeks then toss it and start again</li>
            <li> A great disposable with dependable results. To help extend the life of the blades, I use a few shots of my compressed air keyboard/printer can to clean-out and dry the shaving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good razor and worth a try.</li>
