    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>being said, the gel does perform wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the best version for my friend&#x27;s bumps from ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.</li>
            <li>The gel creates wonderful razor glide and softens up the hair nicely.</li>
            <li>If you can handle the stink, it&#x27;s a great gel.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to perfumes of all sorts and have been using this great product since I discovered it years ago.  </li>
            <li>Fair price and quality product</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>do a good job moisturizing</li>
            <li>I cannot risk using a scented product that is hazardous to my health.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great gel and gives a pretty darn good shave.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Sensitive Edge shaving gel was the perfect product before so-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; perfumes were added.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many many years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about a buck more than the Edge brand, but you won&#x27;t hear me/us complaining.</li>
            <li>Have used the unimproved version of this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>surely you are kidding.  </li>
            <li>I used this for many years until the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version came out, which smelled like bug spray.</li>
            <li>used to be my favorite shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It was fragrance free, but it smelled like warm oatmeal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Can complain at all for the cheap price which included free shipping!</li>
            <li>Got a version that does not have a strong smell that folks are complaining about.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The two good reviews here were written before they released the \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and the new improved version is just as good.  </li>
            <li>And by the way, I have two unused cans of the new stuff looking for a good home.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for years and loved it, but the new formula has a scent.  </li>
            <li>it is not but the smell is like tea tree oil which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>I switched to a fragrance free Target brand and it smells almost as good as the old stuff -</li>
            <li>On what planet do you put the Lavender fragrance into to a “Fragrance Free” product?</li>
            <li>How is this Fragrance Free (as still promoted on the front of the container) in any way?</li>
            <li>I ordered fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free?</li>
            <li>Fragrance Free ....</li>
            <li>looking for a soap free one.</li>
            <li>I was trying to save a dollar and it was worth it for many years until the Edge formula changed.</li>
            <li>Okay, so first off let me address the number one beef people seem to have with this shave gel.</li>
            <li>I may try the Target brand mentioned in another review; they have been good with generic perfume free products.  </li>
            <li>Strong smells can aggravate my allergies when in season, but I just kind of prefer grooming products not to have strong odors or perfumes, regardless of whether they are technically called a fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The OLD formula smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>After having picked up a can despite the reviews just to give it a whirl, I can say that these issues are, in fact, 100% true.</li>
            <li>it smells like lavender, bug spray, and something sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>Sure wish I had known the new improved fragrance free formula was scented.</li>
            <li>Although this has been my favorite shaving gel for years, my latest purchase was marked New Improved Formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This:  Closest shave, ultimate lubrication, amazing smell, no burning what</li>
            <li>Well, I grew up rural, and I honestly think it smells like the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that was used to impregnate cows.</li>
            <li>I have used the original formula version of this for a few years and loved it.</li>
            <li>One reviewer put it right</li>
            <li>My can shipped from somewhere in NY that isn&#x27;t an Amazon warehouse, so I think it got drop-shipped right from the manufacturer...</li>
            <li>would vouch though, that this gel is great if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on; it&#x27;s pretty gnarly.</li>
            <li>&quot; principle here, but companies are always trying to be on top and the only way to do that is to continuously strive to improve a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what you sent me was ultra sensitive does not say fragrance free?</li>
            <li>and I used it for the first time today....and almost gagged.</li>
            <li>I never used the original formula but wanted to get a shave gel for sensitive skin that didn&#x27;t cost close to five bucks.</li>
            <li>Edge had a pretty good reputation in the past</li>
            <li>I have shaved with it a few times and they have been some of the most comfortable</li>
            <li>The company claims they are going back to the original formula this summer and it will be clearly marked \\&quot;Original Formula\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see why theres so many bad reviews, this works great.</li>
            <li>This gel works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>and the whole can&#x27;s contents are in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so ever, very controllable dispenser.  </li>
            <li>We shall see if they really do it.</li>
            <li>Ordered directly from Amazon and got a can marked \\&quot;Original Formula\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>If adding some nice ingredients such as Eucalyptus and Lavendar Oil for the comfort of the shave make it a little smelly, I think that&#x27;s a worthy trade off.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is nice and doesn&#x27;t have that issue some cans have where you press down, nothing, a little more, nothing, a little more</li>
            <li>The new improved formula has a very offensive odor.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe find a stash of the older formula somewhere.</li>
            <li>I will search the shelves for the old stuff in more remote stores and hope this company regains its senses before I run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; anymore, and does have a very mild smell (from the benzaldehyde, I think, but other reviewers note that&#x27;s always been included.)</li>
            <li>This really shows that the leadership at the company is completely out of touch with the needs and desires of its customers.</li>
            <li>If any of the other reviewers who&#x27;ve had to abandon this product can recommend a genuinely fragrance-free replacement, I&#x27;m obviously in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After searching high and low, I&#x27;m now using Aveeno Active Naturals Therapeutic Shave Gel with good results.</li>
            <li>is my new shaving cream until air is considered shave cream.</li>
            <li>But their \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot; formula means that I will be looking for a new brand of shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to find a new shave cream as a result.</li>
            <li>It seems they realized the \\&quot;new and improved\\</li>
            <li>I just purchased a can of \\&quot;New and Improved</li>
            <li>Was I ever surprised when the new stuff smelled like vomit!</li>
            <li>but if my theory is correct that&#x27;s a natural odor not artificial; so in the technical sense it is \\&quot;Frangrance free\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to perfume, and I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I choose because no smell and very soft, so I recommended to every body who has a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It had a faint, pleasant \\&quot;oatmeal-like\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated as it far too often does when the razor is dragged across my face which makes me believe the skin soothing agents in the gel are doing their job.</li>
            <li>Used Edge Sensitive, burned my face.  </li>
            <li>I get this stuff anywhere near my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At that time, I completely agreed with what they wrote.</li>
            <li>They sent me a letter and a few coupons for some free stuff.  </li>
            <li>I cannot get this stuff near my face without gagging.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t put it on or near your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They admit to using lavender and eucalyptus and claim they can still call it FF because they are natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Addendum:  I have discovered and purchased a total 11 cans of the good stuff from behind the new and improved at 2 local stores.  </li>
            <li>The eucalyptus and lavender (particularly the latter) make we want to sneeze.</li>
            <li>Recently my local grocery store only had the \\&quot;New</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The eucalyptus and lavender (particularly the latter) make we want to sneeze.</li>
            <li> Recently my local grocery store only had the \\&quot;New</li>
            <li> &quot; version was a New Coke-type mistake, and have indeed gone back to the old formula (approximately.)</li>
            <li> Has anyone noticed how defensive perfume people get when you call them out on a fake perfume free claim?</li>
            <li> The ingredients are about the same as currently listed on the page, just reordered slightly, so they changed the proportions around a bit.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says, it was a great fragrance-free product for years until they totally ruined it with a horrible scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad, really, because the old formula was perfection.</li>
            <li> To label this \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula as \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; because its fragrance comes from a garden rather than a chemistry lab is at best, idiocy, and at worst, dishonest.</li>
            <li> Lavender and eucalyptus have been aded as new ingredients to our formula, however, though they have a scent, they are not fragrances.\\&quot;  Seriously?  </li>
            <li> Tried Nivea Sensitive, less burn, but was extremely thick and wouldn&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be returning the other 5 cans.  </li>
            <li> so I figured why not, even if it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li> Started shaving a little while ago.  </li>
            <li> I’m very allergic to fragrances and this new formula caused a very bad allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I hate it when a corporation changes an item so much yet still sells it under the same name.</li>
            <li> Yes, the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the worst, most god-awful stench I have ever smelled from a shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better and I have zero problem with the scent...which I never even noticed.  </li>
            <li> What I will tell you is that the manufacturer of Edge was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I think some of the new ingredients just create an unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> I can hardly even stand the smell.</li>
            <li> They dismissed my complaints when I wrote to them in a rude and condescending way, telling me that it there is a difference between &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, and the product was always &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but never &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and thus I didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about...</li>

            <li> After using it and finding it extremely unpleasant, I read the ingredients and find that they&#x27;ve added Eucalyptus and Lavender oils.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am allergic to perfume, and I have very sensitive skin.  This gel works very well for me.  I don&#x27;t end up with the nasty razor burn I was getting before.</li>
            <li> Fair price and quality product</li>
            <li> I’m very allergic to fragrances and this new formula caused a very bad allergic reaction. On what planet do you put the Lavender fragrance into to a “Fragrance Free” product? This really shows that the leadership at the company is completely out of touch with the needs and desires of its customers.</li>
            <li> Okay, so first off let me address the number one beef people seem to have with this shave gel. The smell. After having picked up a can despite the reviews just to give it a whirl, I can say that these issues are, in fact, 100% true. This stuff smells awful. One reviewer put it right it smells like lavender, bug spray, and something sweet I can&#x27;t put my finger on; it&#x27;s pretty gnarly. I never used the original formula but wanted to get a shave gel for sensitive skin that didn&#x27;t cost close to five bucks. Edge had a pretty good reputation in the past so I figured why not, even if it&#x27;s a little stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would vouch though, that this gel is great if you can get past the smell. Toughen up gentlemen. If adding some nice ingredients such as Eucalyptus and Lavendar Oil for the comfort of the shave make it a little smelly, I think that&#x27;s a worthy trade off. I understand there&#x27;s some \\&quot;why fix what isn&#x27;t broken\\&quot; principle here, but companies are always trying to be on top and the only way to do that is to continuously strive to improve a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the gel does perform wonderfully. I have shaved with it a few times and they have been some of the most comfortable shaves I&#x27;ve had to date. The gel creates wonderful razor glide and softens up the hair nicely. Not only that, but my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated as it far too often does when the razor is dragged across my face which makes me believe the skin soothing agents in the gel are doing their job. The dispenser is nice and doesn&#x27;t have that issue some cans have where you press down, nothing, a little more, nothing, a little more and the whole can&#x27;s contents are in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay in stores, it&#x27;s a great gel and gives a pretty darn good shave. Yes, the smell is pretty bad. Something tells me though this isn&#x27;t an added fragrance as \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; itself isn&#x27;t in the ingredients. I think some of the new ingredients just create an unpleasant odor but if my theory is correct that&#x27;s a natural odor not artificial; so in the technical sense it is \\&quot;Frangrance free\\&quot;. I can see why the smell would be a turn off though. If you can handle the stink, it&#x27;s a great gel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why theres so many bad reviews, this works great. Unscented it is not but the smell is like tea tree oil which is fine with me. Actually these oils have antiparastic and antimicrobial functions so they help from getting razor burn. Can complain at all for the cheap price which included free shipping!</li>
            <li> Started shaving a little while ago.  Used Edge Sensitive, burned my face.  Tried Nivea Sensitive, less burn, but was extremely thick and wouldn&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This:  Closest shave, ultimate lubrication, amazing smell, no burning what so ever, very controllable dispenser.  You need nothing of this to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new shaving cream until air is considered shave cream.</li>
            <li> Although this has been my favorite shaving gel for years, my latest purchase was marked New Improved Formula. After using it and finding it extremely unpleasant, I read the ingredients and find that they&#x27;ve added Eucalyptus and Lavender oils. How is this Fragrance Free (as still promoted on the front of the container) in any way? I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I hate it when a corporation changes an item so much yet still sells it under the same name.</li>
            <li> Like everyone says, it was a great fragrance-free product for years until they totally ruined it with a horrible scent.</li>
            <li> this is not what i recived.I ordered fragrance free. what you sent me was ultra sensitive does not say fragrance free?</li>
            <li> I have used the original formula version of this for a few years and loved it. It had a faint, pleasant \\&quot;oatmeal-like\\&quot; scent. Recently my local grocery store only had the \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; can in stock, and I used it for the first time today....and almost gagged. That&#x27;s the worst, most god-awful stench I have ever smelled from a shaving cream. Even the regular scented shaving creams don&#x27;t smell as horrible as this one, and this is supposed to be \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot;. Now I have to search for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and loved it. But their \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot; formula means that I will be looking for a new brand of shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have added eucalyptus oil and lavender oil, giving it a horrendous sent, but they still call it \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot;. I want to gag everytime I get this stuff anywhere near my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two good reviews here were written before they released the \\&quot;New Improved\\&quot; version. At that time, I completely agreed with what they wrote. But unless they get rid of that vomitous scent I wil never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I choose because no smell and very soft, so I recommended to every body who has a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus and lavender (particularly the latter) make we want to sneeze. Moreover, I don&#x27;t want to smell like lavender. Fragrance free? What are they talking about? I&#x27;ve been using this for years and now some fool decides to change it. I need to find a new shave cream as a result. Or maybe find a stash of the older formula somewhere.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and the new improved version is just as good.  It&#x27;s not better and I have zero problem with the scent...which I never even noticed.  I do not work for the company and have no financial interest in the company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how they can even market this. This \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; shaving gel smells horrible. I tried to use it a couple of times, but I literally had to hold my breath for the duration of the shave. One reviewer said it smells like bad breath; another said it smells like bug spray. Well, I grew up rural, and I honestly think it smells like the \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that was used to impregnate cows. Having it on my face makes me want to throw up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many many years.  I also ended up buying a couple cans of the \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; which now has a very unpleasant chemical smell.  I thought there must be some mistake, and called them, only to find that yes, they have changed the formula.  They sent me a letter and a few coupons for some free stuff.  Get this, the letter says, I am not making this up \\&quot;Our Edge Ultra-Sensitive remains fragrance-free. Fragrances are synthetic chemical compounds created for the sole purpose of creating a scent.  Lavender and eucalyptus have been aded as new ingredients to our formula, however, though they have a scent, they are not fragrances.\\&quot;  Seriously?  The sole reason I was buying the fragrance-free product is to avoid smelly stuff.  Strong smells can aggravate my allergies when in season, but I just kind of prefer grooming products not to have strong odors or perfumes, regardless of whether they are technically called a fragrance.  The customer service person did tell me that they will be re-introducing an \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; product this summer.</li>
            <li> Got a version that does not have a strong smell that folks are complaining about.  This is the best version for my friend&#x27;s bumps from ingrown hair.  Simply doesn&#x27;t happen anymore!</li>
            <li> Ordered directly from Amazon and got a can marked \\&quot;Original Formula\\&quot;. It seems they realized the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; version was a New Coke-type mistake, and have indeed gone back to the old formula (approximately.) My can shipped from somewhere in NY that isn&#x27;t an Amazon warehouse, so I think it got drop-shipped right from the manufacturer...so I imagine this is the newest stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say \\&quot;Fragrance Free\\&quot; anymore, and does have a very mild smell (from the benzaldehyde, I think, but other reviewers note that&#x27;s always been included.) The ingredients are about the same as currently listed on the page, just reordered slightly, so they changed the proportions around a bit. From the label on my can: Water, Palmitic Acid, Triethanolamine, Stearic Acid, Sunflower Seed Oil Glyceride, Isopentane, Sorbitol, Isobutane, Benzyl Alcohol, Lauryl Alcohol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Glycerin, Allantoin, Benzaldehyde, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Flour, Triclosan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be wary about ordering from third-party sellers for the moment, since I imagine some of them still have the so-called \\&quot;improved\\&quot; formula in stock. Not to mention, they&#x27;re all significantly more expensive than the $2.44 I paid with Prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and doesn&#x27;t upset my allergies. Just how I like it.</li>
            <li> I have atopic dermatitis, which essentially causes me to develop lesions whenever anything fragranced touches my skin. This includes fragrances from nature--like, oh, say, flowers (lavender oil) and plants (eucalyptus oil). To label this \\&quot;new improved\\&quot; formula as \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; because its fragrance comes from a garden rather than a chemistry lab is at best, idiocy, and at worst, dishonest. It&#x27;s sad, really, because the old formula was perfection. This version smells like pig-stink and gave me a bikini rash that looks like a venereal disease. Even my husband (who is allergy-free and doesn&#x27;t give a moment&#x27;s thought to his skin-care products) won&#x27;t use this stuff anymore, because it smells \\&quot;God-awful.\\&quot; If any of the other reviewers who&#x27;ve had to abandon this product can recommend a genuinely fragrance-free replacement, I&#x27;m obviously in the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After searching high and low, I&#x27;m now using Aveeno Active Naturals Therapeutic Shave Gel with good results. It&#x27;s about a buck more than the Edge brand, but you won&#x27;t hear me/us complaining.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a can of \\&quot;New and Improved Formula\\&quot; before I left on vacation.  I am allergic to perfumes of all sorts and have been using this great product since I discovered it years ago.  Was I ever surprised when the new stuff smelled like vomit! I gave up shaving for a week. I cannot get this stuff near my face without gagging.  I will search the shelves for the old stuff in more remote stores and hope this company regains its senses before I run out. Call it \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; and chalk it up experience.  And hire some non-perfume addicts to test these products. Otherwise I will go back to homemade bar soap and a shaving brush and mug! The Ultra Sensitive Edge shaving gel was the perfect product before so-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; perfumes were added. And by the way, I have two unused cans of the new stuff looking for a good home.  Just don&#x27;t put it on or near your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  I have discovered and purchased a total 11 cans of the good stuff from behind the new and improved at 2 local stores.  This will last me for several years.  I may try the Target brand mentioned in another review; they have been good with generic perfume free products.  Has anyone noticed how defensive perfume people get when you call them out on a fake perfume free claim?</li>
            <li> I called Energizer Personal Care about formula change written about in earlier reviews.  It&#x27;s true.  They admit to using lavender and eucalyptus and claim they can still call it FF because they are natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I had known the new improved fragrance free formula was scented. Have used the unimproved version of this product for many years.  I have numerous  chemical and environmental allergies.  The new improved formula has a very offensive odor.  In my opinion, it smells like Raid Bug Spray.  Made my eyes water and caused breathing problems.  Fragrance Free .... surely you are kidding.  I will be returning the other 5 cans.  I cannot risk using a scented product that is hazardous to my health.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do a good job moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;My skin looked worn out after using once!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s the soap in it.. looking for a soap free one.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell whether or not they&#x27;ve gone back--I&#x27;ve just moved on to Aveeno instead. What I will tell you is that the manufacturer of Edge was unbelievable. They dismissed my complaints when I wrote to them in a rude and condescending way, telling me that it there is a difference between &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;, and the product was always &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; but never &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; and thus I didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about...they don&#x27;t deserve my business.</li>
            <li> I used this product for years and loved it, but the new formula has a scent.  The company claims they are going back to the original formula this summer and it will be clearly marked \\&quot;Original Formula\\&quot;.  We shall see if they really do it.</li>
            <li> I used this for many years until the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version came out, which smelled like bug spray. I went back &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; to Aveeno. I was trying to save a dollar and it was worth it for many years until the Edge formula changed.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this two stars because it still performs the same, but the smell has been ruined to the point that I cannot even use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This used to be my favorite shaving cream. I must have gone through ten bottles before it was ruined. The OLD formula smelled amazing. It was fragrance free, but it smelled like warm oatmeal. The \\&quot;improved formula\\&quot; smells like bad breath. That&#x27;s the best way I can describe it. I can hardly even stand the smell. I&#x27;m SO GLAD I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle. I switched to a fragrance free Target brand and it smells almost as good as the old stuff - and it&#x27;s cheaper. I&#x27;ll stick with that.</li>
