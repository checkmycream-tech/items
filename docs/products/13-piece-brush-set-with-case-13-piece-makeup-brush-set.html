            <li>This set has a good value for the price, but the brushes aren&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>I just make sure to put the brushes that rest in the crease of the case in an area where it won&#x27;t affect the brush&#x27;s form :D</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are great, the powder brushes are not that good.</li>

            <li>Brushes are not that good.</li>
            <li>it is a good value.</li>
            <li>but coastal sounded good</li>

            <li>If you are looking for good brushes, don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not too great, but OK, I was using the blush brush, and some of hairs from the brush were on my FACE, but blending is a good brush...</li>
            <li>Sooo glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>I can purchas make up brushes from a discounted store and get better quality!</li>
            <li>The only brush I could have done without was the eyeshadow applicator threw that one out the Foundation brush applies beautifully and the the fan blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how well made they are for just 18 bucks.</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t amazing, but it protects the brushes.</li>
            <li>I recommend it completely amazing price just 6.20 and</li>
            <li>and they all work amazing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I really liked the powder, fan, and taklon concealer brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice.  </li>
            <li>Even so, they are still nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are nice</li>
            <li>This brushes are not even better than good....</li>
            <li>My wife has liked a lot.</li>
            <li>the brush roll is actually nice...</li>
            <li>kind of like painted wood.</li>
            <li>It comes with 12 brushes of each kind and a bag to have them in.</li>
            <li>just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I DO MY OWN MAKE UP</li>
            <li>No broken handles, no shedding hairs, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably not AS GOOD as higher end products (like MAC brushes), but they work great for me.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great quality and the stylish carrier rolls together and buttons for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>They also pick a lot of product and makes everything very easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I love coastal scents and I&#x27;m glad that i chose these brushes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not real big on makeup but from what I&#x27;m told, read, and felt, these brushes are very good and at a great price :3</li>
            <li>This is by far the best brush kit available!</li>
            <li>cons, the handles are very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>The carrying bag is very cheap.  </li>
            <li>the brushes are also very easy to clean and are helpful when having a tickle fight!</li>

            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>and I love that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for them.</li>
            <li>I do not know how to use all of the brushes (I am doing a research to learn more about them)</li>
            <li>Purchased these a year ago and still love them today.</li>
            <li>My girls love playing with the eyelash comb and it has held up.</li>
            <li>i just wish there were more than i would be satisfied</li>
            <li>This item should not cost $12, $8 is more like it.</li>
            <li>For the price, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier.  </li>
            <li>is many ways : )</li>
            <li>I love love love it!bought</li>
            <li>my money!!!will buy again for gifts! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>so i recieved this pallet only 4 days after ordering it, that was impressive.</li>
            <li>i have used most of them, and they serve there purpose.</li>
            <li>hope my review helped :) :) :)</li>
            <li>, I love the case and the brushes, though I haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased to have received them looking as they do in the picture both in softness, sturdyiness and usefulness.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are okay.  </li>
            <li>Overall these are great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li>this was for my daughter, the product is okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE BRUSHES.</li>
            <li>it had more shadow brushes and a kabuki face brush.</li>
            <li>is pretty good, but</li>
            <li>For $16.95 though, it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the other reviews, I purchased it my self and found this product to be incredible useful and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>good selection of brushes, good for the price, does not shed hair, all necessary brushes in set.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased and this is a good set for the price!</li>
            <li>Overall, very good.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve bougth cheap brushes that are better .</li>
            <li>Not only are they great brushes, but they&#x27;re also at such a great price!!!</li>
            <li>Other then that,awesome!,definitely helps me to distribute my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li>Even after all of that it still feels and works as good as new!  </li>
            <li>This product was well represented and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The bristles tend to fall out, and they get gummed up really easily</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that would all bundle together for easy packing.</li>
            <li>AND THESE ARE VERY ADEQUATE FOR ME</li>
            <li>However, the brushes and bag had a strong odor upon arrival.</li>
            <li>The blush brushes work fine</li>
            <li>But, the rest work fine.</li>
            <li>The blush brush seems fine for now though.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really cheap and cheaply made up.</li>
            <li>Bag is cheap.</li>
            <li>i know this are cheap</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>they are rather cheap looking...</li>
            <li>Def paid more than they were worth after tax aaand shipping ;( lesson learned</li>
            <li>I washed the brushes because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to use them without doing so.  </li>
            <li>These are just too cheap</li>
            <li>these brushes are straight-up fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them every day for a couple of months and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re light brown.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package I noticed that the brushes smelled like bug spray from the cheap case - I threw the case away.</li>
            <li>These brushes are cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I do own MAC and SIGMA brushes and I found a couple of the flatter brushes in this set that weren&#x27;t sold thru make that I really like.</li>
            <li>it included all the brushes needed but the quality was kinda cheap</li>
            <li>When I ordered this brush set online, I was really excited because I read a lot of good reviews about coastal scents products in general.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush was the fan brush which at first look</li>
            <li>even the 5.95 shipping price was worth it!</li>
            <li>If you need something quick and cheap...</li>
            <li>You can clean the brushes with a creme rinse and re shape them.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and feel nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>But I should not have expected a great quality of brushes for the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li>but, the basic ones has a good quality and my make-up</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Also, there is a clear plastic protector which the brushes kind of fold into.</li>
            <li>The brushes are good enough quality for day to day use.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that because the case folds some of the hair in the brushes are bent as well, but the quality is still good and its nothing that a quick wash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>and i can put it in my carry-on or purse for use if i need to retouch my make up or need to do a quick day-to-night look.  </li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I was really exited!!</li>
            <li>and i really enjyed the variety of sizes and types made available.</li>
            <li>You get a nice array of well-performing brushes for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these brushes are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly worth waiting and paying for shipping.</li>
            <li>The entire set fits into her make-up case so they are always handy when she&#x27;s applying make-up.</li>
            <li>The shadow/liner brush/brushes are a nice back up.</li>
            <li>but it is useful</li>
            <li>Elf has one really cheap and it&#x27;s even better than the $30 Kabuki brush I had at my last cosmetics job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.    </li>
            <li>This makes sure there is no mess and the brushes are protected in the pouch.</li>
            <li>Overall good brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li>When you first buy them they feel nice when applying makeup but within 6 months you will have to toss because they physically started scratching my face.  </li>
            <li>The case is pretty handy too, my only issue is I with</li>
            <li>spend a little more on better one .</li>
            <li>they are definitely professional quality and using them is like putting on make-up while bathing in a thousand soft and adorable puppies with ryan gossling whispering sweet nothings in your ear.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good little deal.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a budget and need brushes, I totally recommend these :)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m constantly cleaning them (which causes even more bristles to fall out).  </li>
            <li>One is because the case smells funny, not the brushes as some reviewers might say.</li>
            <li>The overall quality of the actual brushes is good - but for the price they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>the shipping cost more than the actual brushes??</li>
            <li>which makes things SO much easier!  </li>
            <li>The bristles shed everywhere and the whole set smells of industry!</li>
            <li>i washed the brushes and they have a funny smell, but maybe with a stronger smelling shampoo it will go away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that the brush I use the most would be the liner brush since I use it as a back up and NOW use it every day on my brows.</li>
            <li>as well as getting this set as a back up, hehe : )</li>
            <li>and I have to say all the brushes are so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like the brushes they are very soft and easy to wash and drys quickly i really do recemend these brushes</li>
            <li>so I am wondering if the other brushes would have been nice too.  </li>
            <li>This is my first real brush set.</li>
            <li>one problem i had was that the brushes did shed a little, but i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be at high quality standards, but they are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out when you try to wash them.</li>
            <li>as for the bag it does have a strong plastic smell to it, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li>It also brings its little case where every brush has it&#x27;s own place to go which is a plus</li>
            <li>I have really put that thing through its paces, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle is very \\&quot;steady\\&quot; and I feel like it&#x27;s never gonna break or fall apart.</li>
            <li>i dont used the brushes as much as i wanted too</li>
            <li>You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I also have a Mac brush and they are very alike.</li>
            <li>Has all your basics and stands up very well.</li>
            <li>Also works really well with stage make up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommed!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a very plastick-y scent.</li>
            <li>package arrived fast.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t hold that much product in or on them nor does it apply well.</li>
            <li>The brushes looked promising in the picture</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to be a makeup artist you can use it for halloween or anything really.  </li>
            <li>I am a male who purchased this brush set with the shanay 120 color eye shadow and she loved it, this product compliments my other purchase, i was looking for affordability and items and brand</li>
            <li>Not too many, but it is a little annoying sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would STILL strongly recommend this set if you are like me, who doesn&#x27;t like/want/have a lot of money to spend with big brands (look at all these other things I can buy with the extra $20 bucks I&#x27;m saving :P), but still want nice things and look good everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case can be wiped clean and the brush wash well with simple dish soap.</li>
            <li>you really get a decent array of brushes for what you pay for, here.</li>
            <li>Definitely not professional quality but overall a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li>The crease brush turned out to be smaller than I expected, and it makes certain make up applications look kind of akward.</li>
            <li>I really liked the brushes i was looking for something soft enough, but at a low price.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i wanted they are soft comparable to drug store brands.</li>
            <li>i wash them every 3-4 days and their just as new!</li>
            <li>it is a decent starter set.</li>
            <li>The handles are really sturdy, and look very professional.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the brushes are high quality and they satisfy me.</li>
            <li>high recommended, case included which is compact</li>
            <li>Nice little soft black pouch which makes things easy to pack up and store.</li>
            <li>They are softer than I expected for cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>for the total of 12 dollars i paid for this set, i believe it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they work really really well so far.</li>
            <li>I use them for everything makeup related because they are such a great and cheap alternative to the expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>While using a few of the larger brushes, they lost some hairs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is normal.</li>
            <li>The rest of the smaller brushes are fine and I especially like the angled liner brush.</li>
            <li>The one brush I have left is the large blush brush and that is blown out and really should be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup and this serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and none of the hairs fell out for me.</li>
            <li>From small liner brushes to huge powder brushes and everything in between!</li>
            <li>The brushes are great, mine didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell that the other poster complained of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really glad that I bought this small set of brushes instead.</li>
            <li>Only a few bristles fall out initially but the ones that are in are in for good.</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;silk sponge\\&quot; listed in the product list is a small eyeshadow puff like you get in cheap eye shadow kits, except it&#x27;s \\&quot;silk\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t really believe it&#x27;s silk.</li>
            <li>The blush brush in particular barely picks up any product</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a few brushes that work just fine which is why I had gotten the kset to begin with.</li>
            <li>I deeply recommend this product to anyone who wants professional make-up artist brushes, at drug store make-up price.</li>
            <li>If you use this variety of brushes and that variety of color on a daily basis, you should really think about being a makeup artist professionally.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li>but the one thing i dont like about the brushes is that they are way too soft and they come out....</li>
            <li>I purchased this set for my 14 year old stepdaughter as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;TOO FACED Natural Look\\&quot; make-up palette and an evening look make-up palette as well</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>This had to be aired out for two days.</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on this set.</li>
            <li>A PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and the don&#x27;t lose their form.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this set for nearly 5 years now and all the brushes are still intact and are used FREQUENTLY.</li>
            <li>I was quite skeptical to order these brushes because I wanted a good set.  </li>
            <li>kept doing that 4 times until I have a clear suds, now this brushes are not dark brown</li>
            <li>The two main reasons I purchased this set was for the crease and the regular shader eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>overall, still a decent set for the price.</li>
            <li>The other thing about the case is that if you flip it, half of the brushes will fall out of it (one more reason to dislike the case).</li>
            <li>Anyhow, there is a strong icky smell from the bag.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;d think that with brushes that soft it would not hold things such as mineral powder and blush very well and not much would transfer from the make-up container to the face, but it does.</li>
            <li>These i would buy for my 13 year old sister who&#x27;s just starting to wear make up.</li>
            <li>I spent 13 for the whole set.</li>
            <li>I do add that from reading several other reviews that the case does indeed have a smell when you first receive it,but taking out all the brushes and allowing it to air out does eliminate the odor.</li>
            <li>some of the brushes are a little better than others, and i&#x27;ve had some trouble with shedding, even after washing with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>Very fine quality brushes, some say the case smelled weird</li>
            <li>Also, the blush brushes are rough, therefore I am already searching for a new set.     </li>
            <li>I expected something for maybe a &#x27;new case smell&#x27; if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li>I must say a lot of the brushes look exactly the same ( flat &amp; stiff)</li>
            <li>I was really reluctant to order because so many brush sets had bad reviews of hair falling off the brushes.  </li>

            <li> This set has a good value for the price, but the brushes aren&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> I just make sure to put the brushes that rest in the crease of the case in an area where it won&#x27;t affect the brush&#x27;s form :D</li>

            <li> Sooo glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I can purchas make up brushes from a discounted store and get better quality!</li>
            <li> The only brush I could have done without was the eyeshadow applicator threw that one out the Foundation brush applies beautifully and the the fan blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how well made they are for just 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t amazing, but it protects the brushes.</li>
            <li> I recommend it completely amazing price just 6.20 and</li>
            <li> and they all work amazing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I really liked the powder, fan, and taklon concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice.  </li>
            <li> Even so, they are still nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are nice</li>
            <li> This brushes are not even better than good....</li>

            <li> the brush roll is actually nice...</li>
            <li> kind of like painted wood.</li>

            <li> just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I DO MY OWN MAKE UP</li>
            <li> No broken handles, no shedding hairs, they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably not AS GOOD as higher end products (like MAC brushes), but they work great for me.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality and the stylish carrier rolls together and buttons for easy storage.  </li>
            <li> They also pick a lot of product and makes everything very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I love coastal scents and I&#x27;m glad that i chose these brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not real big on makeup but from what I&#x27;m told, read, and felt, these brushes are very good and at a great price :3</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush kit available!</li>
            <li> cons, the handles are very cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> The carrying bag is very cheap.  </li>
            <li> the brushes are also very easy to clean and are helpful when having a tickle fight!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> the ones for the eyeshadows are ok.</li>

            <li> These brushes are OK...</li>
            <li> Well it works OK</li>

            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> and I love that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for them.</li>
            <li> I do not know how to use all of the brushes (I am doing a research to learn more about them)</li>
            <li> Purchased these a year ago and still love them today.</li>
            <li> My girls love playing with the eyelash comb and it has held up.</li>
            <li> i just wish there were more than i would be satisfied</li>
            <li> This item should not cost $12, $8 is more like it.</li>
            <li> For the price, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier.  </li>
            <li> is many ways : )</li>
            <li> I love love love it!bought</li>
            <li> my money!!!will buy again for gifts! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> so i recieved this pallet only 4 days after ordering it, that was impressive.</li>
            <li> i have used most of them, and they serve there purpose.</li>
            <li> hope my review helped :) :) :)</li>
            <li> , I love the case and the brushes, though I haven&#x27;t used them yet</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased to have received them looking as they do in the picture both in softness, sturdyiness and usefulness.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are okay.  </li>
            <li> Overall these are great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter, the product is okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES.</li>
            <li> it had more shadow brushes and a kabuki face brush.</li>
            <li> is pretty good, but</li>
            <li> For $16.95 though, it&#x27;s a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the other reviews, I purchased it my self and found this product to be incredible useful and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> good selection of brushes, good for the price, does not shed hair, all necessary brushes in set.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased and this is a good set for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve bougth cheap brushes that are better .</li>
            <li> Not only are they great brushes, but they&#x27;re also at such a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Other then that,awesome!,definitely helps me to distribute my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> Even after all of that it still feels and works as good as new!  </li>
            <li> This product was well represented and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The bristles tend to fall out, and they get gummed up really easily</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that would all bundle together for easy packing.</li>
            <li> AND THESE ARE VERY ADEQUATE FOR ME</li>
            <li> However, the brushes and bag had a strong odor upon arrival.</li>
            <li> The blush brushes work fine</li>
            <li> But, the rest work fine.</li>
            <li> The blush brush seems fine for now though.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really cheap and cheaply made up.</li>
            <li> Bag is cheap.</li>
            <li> i know this are cheap</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> they are rather cheap looking...</li>
            <li> Def paid more than they were worth after tax aaand shipping ;( lesson learned</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to use them without doing so.  </li>
            <li> These are just too cheap</li>
            <li> these brushes are straight-up fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them every day for a couple of months and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re light brown.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I noticed that the brushes smelled like bug spray from the cheap case - I threw the case away.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I do own MAC and SIGMA brushes and I found a couple of the flatter brushes in this set that weren&#x27;t sold thru make that I really like.</li>
            <li> it included all the brushes needed but the quality was kinda cheap</li>
            <li> When I ordered this brush set online, I was really excited because I read a lot of good reviews about coastal scents products in general.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush was the fan brush which at first look</li>
            <li> even the 5.95 shipping price was worth it!</li>
            <li> If you need something quick and cheap...</li>
            <li> You can clean the brushes with a creme rinse and re shape them.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and feel nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> But I should not have expected a great quality of brushes for the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li> but, the basic ones has a good quality and my make-up</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Also, there is a clear plastic protector which the brushes kind of fold into.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good enough quality for day to day use.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is that because the case folds some of the hair in the brushes are bent as well, but the quality is still good and its nothing that a quick wash can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> and i can put it in my carry-on or purse for use if i need to retouch my make up or need to do a quick day-to-night look.  </li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I was really exited!!</li>
            <li> and i really enjyed the variety of sizes and types made available.</li>
            <li> You get a nice array of well-performing brushes for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these brushes are pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly worth waiting and paying for shipping.</li>
            <li> The entire set fits into her make-up case so they are always handy when she&#x27;s applying make-up.</li>
            <li> The shadow/liner brush/brushes are a nice back up.</li>
            <li> but it is useful</li>
            <li> Elf has one really cheap and it&#x27;s even better than the $30 Kabuki brush I had at my last cosmetics job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.    </li>
            <li> This makes sure there is no mess and the brushes are protected in the pouch.</li>
            <li> Overall good brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li> When you first buy them they feel nice when applying makeup but within 6 months you will have to toss because they physically started scratching my face.  </li>
            <li> The case is pretty handy too, my only issue is I with</li>
            <li> spend a little more on better one .</li>
            <li> they are definitely professional quality and using them is like putting on make-up while bathing in a thousand soft and adorable puppies with ryan gossling whispering sweet nothings in your ear.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little deal.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a budget and need brushes, I totally recommend these :)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m constantly cleaning them (which causes even more bristles to fall out).  </li>
            <li> One is because the case smells funny, not the brushes as some reviewers might say.</li>
            <li> The overall quality of the actual brushes is good - but for the price they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> the shipping cost more than the actual brushes??</li>
            <li> which makes things SO much easier!  </li>
            <li> The bristles shed everywhere and the whole set smells of industry!</li>
            <li> i washed the brushes and they have a funny smell, but maybe with a stronger smelling shampoo it will go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that the brush I use the most would be the liner brush since I use it as a back up and NOW use it every day on my brows.</li>
            <li> as well as getting this set as a back up, hehe : )</li>
            <li> and I have to say all the brushes are so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes they are very soft and easy to wash and drys quickly i really do recemend these brushes</li>
            <li> so I am wondering if the other brushes would have been nice too.  </li>
            <li> This is my first real brush set.</li>
            <li> one problem i had was that the brushes did shed a little, but i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be at high quality standards, but they are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out when you try to wash them.</li>
            <li> as for the bag it does have a strong plastic smell to it, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> It also brings its little case where every brush has it&#x27;s own place to go which is a plus</li>
            <li> I have really put that thing through its paces, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is very \\&quot;steady\\&quot; and I feel like it&#x27;s never gonna break or fall apart.</li>
            <li> i dont used the brushes as much as i wanted too</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I also have a Mac brush and they are very alike.</li>
            <li> Has all your basics and stands up very well.</li>
            <li> Also works really well with stage make up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommed!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely a very plastick-y scent.</li>
            <li> package arrived fast.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t hold that much product in or on them nor does it apply well.</li>
            <li> The brushes looked promising in the picture</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to be a makeup artist you can use it for halloween or anything really.  </li>
            <li> I am a male who purchased this brush set with the shanay 120 color eye shadow and she loved it, this product compliments my other purchase, i was looking for affordability and items and brand</li>
            <li> Not too many, but it is a little annoying sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would STILL strongly recommend this set if you are like me, who doesn&#x27;t like/want/have a lot of money to spend with big brands (look at all these other things I can buy with the extra $20 bucks I&#x27;m saving :P), but still want nice things and look good everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case can be wiped clean and the brush wash well with simple dish soap.</li>
            <li> you really get a decent array of brushes for what you pay for, here.</li>
            <li> Definitely not professional quality but overall a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li> The crease brush turned out to be smaller than I expected, and it makes certain make up applications look kind of akward.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes i was looking for something soft enough, but at a low price.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i wanted they are soft comparable to drug store brands.</li>
            <li> i wash them every 3-4 days and their just as new!</li>
            <li> it is a decent starter set.</li>
            <li> The handles are really sturdy, and look very professional.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the brushes are high quality and they satisfy me.</li>
            <li> high recommended, case included which is compact</li>
            <li> Nice little soft black pouch which makes things easy to pack up and store.</li>
            <li> They are softer than I expected for cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> for the total of 12 dollars i paid for this set, i believe it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they work really really well so far.</li>
            <li> I use them for everything makeup related because they are such a great and cheap alternative to the expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> While using a few of the larger brushes, they lost some hairs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is normal.</li>
            <li> The rest of the smaller brushes are fine and I especially like the angled liner brush.</li>
            <li> The one brush I have left is the large blush brush and that is blown out and really should be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup and this serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and none of the hairs fell out for me.</li>
            <li> From small liner brushes to huge powder brushes and everything in between!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, mine didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell that the other poster complained of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just really glad that I bought this small set of brushes instead.</li>
            <li> Only a few bristles fall out initially but the ones that are in are in for good.</li>
            <li> And the \\&quot;silk sponge\\&quot; listed in the product list is a small eyeshadow puff like you get in cheap eye shadow kits, except it&#x27;s \\&quot;silk\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t really believe it&#x27;s silk.</li>
            <li> The blush brush in particular barely picks up any product</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few brushes that work just fine which is why I had gotten the kset to begin with.</li>
            <li> I deeply recommend this product to anyone who wants professional make-up artist brushes, at drug store make-up price.</li>
            <li> If you use this variety of brushes and that variety of color on a daily basis, you should really think about being a makeup artist professionally.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.</li>
            <li> but the one thing i dont like about the brushes is that they are way too soft and they come out....</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my 14 year old stepdaughter as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;TOO FACED Natural Look\\&quot; make-up palette and an evening look make-up palette as well</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This had to be aired out for two days.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on this set.</li>
            <li> A PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and the don&#x27;t lose their form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for nearly 5 years now and all the brushes are still intact and are used FREQUENTLY.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical to order these brushes because I wanted a good set.  </li>
            <li> kept doing that 4 times until I have a clear suds, now this brushes are not dark brown</li>
            <li> The two main reasons I purchased this set was for the crease and the regular shader eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> overall, still a decent set for the price.</li>
            <li> The other thing about the case is that if you flip it, half of the brushes will fall out of it (one more reason to dislike the case).</li>
            <li> Anyhow, there is a strong icky smell from the bag.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;d think that with brushes that soft it would not hold things such as mineral powder and blush very well and not much would transfer from the make-up container to the face, but it does.</li>
            <li> These i would buy for my 13 year old sister who&#x27;s just starting to wear make up.</li>
            <li> I spent 13 for the whole set.</li>
            <li> I do add that from reading several other reviews that the case does indeed have a smell when you first receive it,but taking out all the brushes and allowing it to air out does eliminate the odor.</li>
            <li> some of the brushes are a little better than others, and i&#x27;ve had some trouble with shedding, even after washing with brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> Very fine quality brushes, some say the case smelled weird</li>
            <li> Also, the blush brushes are rough, therefore I am already searching for a new set.     </li>
            <li> I expected something for maybe a &#x27;new case smell&#x27; if that makes any sense.  </li>
            <li> I must say a lot of the brushes look exactly the same ( flat &amp; stiff)</li>
            <li> I was really reluctant to order because so many brush sets had bad reviews of hair falling off the brushes.  </li>
            <li> but you will be buying a new set 6months to 1 year down the road.</li>
            <li> No major shedding.</li>
            <li> Another downside was the plastic wrapers on the brushes, didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very soft</li>
            <li> I attemepted to brush them on my skin and they were not very soft and arm started to smell like the packaging</li>
            <li> another problem was that the blending brush is very small, but i guess it does the job slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> I would tap dry the brushes and lay them flat to</li>
            <li> Throw away the case they came in--the stink never goes away no matter how long you air it out.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not soft</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna use these brushes everyday, go the extra mile and pay for the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> However, I knew that upon purchasing this a long time ago, you can just tell by looking at the picture</li>
            <li> I would personally go and spend a few dollars per brush at a local store or buy online but do not get the Make Up Geek (makeupgeek.com) brushes because they are the same brushes as this</li>
            <li> Next time I buy makeup brushes I will definitely spend a few dollars per brush either in a local store or online.</li>
            <li> I mean it will do if you don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money on brushes from MAC or sephora...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brush set; unfortunately, the pouch smells like moth-balls!  </li>
            <li> The case does smell a bit due to the manufacturing process, but it is not a big issue.</li>
            <li> Overall as long as you like a few of the brushes (which I did)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other brushes other than those listed above.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday and that might be why they&#x27;ve lasted so long, but I wear it often enough where I should see wear and tear by now.</li>
            <li> The Handles are not very attractive, I mean even an ordinary art paint brushes look and feel better.     </li>
            <li> , a little bit of hair came out of the bigger brushes.</li>
            <li> The other reason why it lost a star is very minor</li>
            <li> But it seems that you have to put a lot of lipstick on the brush for it to actually transfer to your lips, which seems like a waste.    </li>
            <li> i didnt smell what some of the other reviewers were talking about...</li>
            <li> and I guess it&#x27;s expected (look at the price tag again!)</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that .....</li>
            <li> The shadow brushes are not that bad, they work just fine.</li>
            <li> The crease brush was really not what i expected, it was so small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> I wiped down the pouch with furniture polish, and still it smelled.  </li>
            <li> i havent used half of them yet, but i know i will eventually.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month and a half ago, and it survived severl washes, applacations, and travealing in my purse.</li>
            <li> It did have the smell as previous reviews mentioned, but it wore off in a two weeks.</li>
            <li> it did dissipate after awhile, but has never full gone away.</li>
            <li> The case was cumbersome with a little plastic bit that held the brushes together and if that gets bent your brushes will slide out.</li>
            <li> My point, they&#x27;re not worth buying!</li>
            <li> so they hurt my skin a little.</li>
            <li> but the fan and the two big ones for foundation and powder are not as soft and the bristles look bad ..</li>
            <li> I bought a canvas pencil case from the dollar store for the few times I need to carry my brushes with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they have kept their shape and have not shed.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brush was also not as fluffy as I was expecting, so it doesn&#x27;t shade and pick up color as well as I would like.</li>
            <li> I never use them when I&#x27;m at home since I already have the brushes I use everyday sitting on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that like sto have a make-up set to bring with me for an everyday use like</li>
            <li> After it dried the bristles are sticking out, it lost it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times and they are still very fluffy.</li>
            <li> Well I have owned these for a little over a year and all but 1 brush has survived!  </li>
            <li> i recieved this product and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is from the dye or if it&#x27;s been used.  </li>
            <li> Some of the tools i found pointless was the wand for the mascara, the eyebrow and eyelash comb (i never use it), and the sponge applicator that usually comes with eye shadows.</li>
            <li> brush quality was ok, but the case spelled awful.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the horrilble way the brushes and the packages smelled.</li>
            <li> it is not as soft like what others said, they do smell like rubber or that very fake leather smell, my room smelled like it every time I walked in.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush was my only disappointment.</li>
            <li> Take the brushes out of the case they come in quickly and the awful smell will go away from the brushes.</li>
            <li> The case didn&#x27;t smell bad and it had slots for each individual brush.</li>
            <li> Anyways the brushes don&#x27;t smell bad its the actual case.</li>
            <li> Besides these cons, the case actually doesn&#x27;t look bad itself.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The larger lip brush sheds really badly, leaving hairs in your lipstick and on your lips embedded in the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Its a frustrating brush.</li>
            <li> No need for the really expensive brand name stuff when you have these (or at least</li>
            <li> I have no complaint with the brushes, it is the case, IT SMELLS BAD!!!!</li>
            <li> The case is a little ugly</li>
            <li> I opened the package and all I could smell was this weird stench.</li>
            <li> Ill prob just throw the case out.</li>
            <li> Brushes are difficult to order on the internet.</li>
            <li> a very thin glue ball was hanging off and i was pissed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine how dirty it is coming out of the factory.    </li>
            <li> Bristles came out like crazy.</li>
            <li> and I HATE packing and worse</li>
            <li> Well i got this brush set for the price and because i needed a not so expensive crease, and shadow brush!</li>
            <li> , i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unpleasant</li>
            <li> also had a very weird smell to the case and brushes...</li>
            <li> The lip liner brush is not too bad.</li>
            <li> But over all the brushes are not that bad .</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed w the quality of the brushes themselves, let alone</li>
            <li> The case is awful, stretchy pleather, and smells like oil/plastic.  </li>
            <li> Beyond Horrible.</li>
            <li> So all in all, do not buy these brushes unless you want to spend $2 per brush and get nasty brushes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was well represented and arrived very quickly.  The product is a great value.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. You get a nice array of well-performing brushes for a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only warning is that the blush brush can tend to shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushes had no odor upon opening the shipment and they all looked to be in pristine shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angle liner brush, as well, has performed admirably. I have really put that thing through its paces, and it&#x27;s still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend for the fashionista on a budget!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really cheap and cheaply made up. But I should not have expected a great quality of brushes for the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived, and their quality is very nice. While using a few of the larger brushes, they lost some hairs, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is normal. Great quality and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Brushes are not that good. Nowhere on the brushes or the bag does it say Coastal Scents. Bag is cheap. Ripp off!!</li>
            <li> i know this are cheap but i&#x27;ve bougth cheap brushes that are better . the ones for the eyeshadows are ok. but the fan and the two big ones for foundation and powder are not as soft and the bristles look bad .. I do not recomend this . spend a little more on better one . evn the drugs store brushes are 10 tmes better</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re super soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out when you try to wash them. If you&#x27;re on a budget and need brushes, I totally recommend these :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay... they definitley arent what I thought they would be... They shed quite a bit! I feel like I could have purchased similar brushes from Wal-mart and achieved the same goal! That&#x27;s my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Well I have owned these for a little over a year and all but 1 brush has survived!  The case was cumbersome with a little plastic bit that held the brushes together and if that gets bent your brushes will slide out. The one brush I have left is the large blush brush and that is blown out and really should be replaced.  When you first buy them they feel nice when applying makeup but within 6 months you will have to toss because they physically started scratching my face.  If you need something quick and cheap...sure but you will be buying a new set 6months to 1 year down the road.</li>
            <li> This set has a good value for the price, but the brushes aren&#x27;t great.  The bristles tend to fall out, and they get gummed up really easily so I&#x27;m constantly cleaning them (which causes even more bristles to fall out).  The case is awful, stretchy pleather, and smells like oil/plastic.  I just threw it away and keep my brushes in acrylic holders.</li>
            <li> these brushes are pretty sweet. i havent used half of them yet, but i know i will eventually. i didnt smell what some of the other reviewers were talking about...overall, i&#x27;d definitely buy from them again and i definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, especially for the price. There is a very good variety of brushes. Occasionally, a hair will fall out of the brush, but I have the same problem with some of my more expensive brushes.     Take the brushes out of the case they come in quickly and the awful smell will go away from the brushes. Throw away the case they came in--the stink never goes away no matter how long you air it out. I bought a canvas pencil case from the dollar store for the few times I need to carry my brushes with me.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as promised. Like the variety of colors, can find something to go with every outfit!</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are awesome.  The case didn&#x27;t smell bad and it had slots for each individual brush. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they have kept their shape and have not shed. The brushes have maintained their softness.</li>
            <li> I have no complaint with the brushes, it is the case, IT SMELLS BAD!!!! still waiting for the smell to air out!! Otherwise, the brushes are high quality and they satisfy me. A+++++++ (except for the smelly case)</li>
            <li> These brushes are OK...they are rather cheap looking...also had a very weird smell to the case and brushes...I did wash them with brush cleaner/shampoo. I mean it will do if you don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money on brushes from MAC or sephora...definitely won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> Well i got this brush set for the price and because i needed a not so expensive crease, and shadow brush! Well it works OK they&#x27;re not soft i get poked by these brushes when using them. Let me just say they&#x27;re not for make up pros!!! These i would buy for my 13 year old sister who&#x27;s just starting to wear make up. The crease brush was really not what i expected, it was so small. My point, they&#x27;re not worth buying! The blush brushes work fine but if you&#x27;re wanting to put on eyeshadow and gel liner, blending and mixing shadows, they wont work well for that.</li>
            <li> I opened the package and all I could smell was this weird stench. I just finished washing my brushes (I was not going to use them on my face w.o washing them... esp w that smell). Anyways the brushes don&#x27;t smell bad its the actual case. Ill prob just throw the case out. As for the brushes I&#x27;m def no makeup guru but i guess i like these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have bought better brushes from Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them this morning and they were already shedding and I had to throw the fan brush away. The brush roll that it comes in is pretty good, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s exactly worth waiting and paying for shipping.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this brush set online, I was really excited because I read a lot of good reviews about coastal scents products in general. The two main reasons I purchased this set was for the crease and the regular shader eye shadow brushes. The crease brush turned out to be smaller than I expected, and it makes certain make up applications look kind of akward. The eye shadow brush was also not as fluffy as I was expecting, so it doesn&#x27;t shade and pick up color as well as I would like. For $16.95 though, it&#x27;s a pretty good value. I really liked the powder, fan, and taklon concealer brushes. The case is a little ugly but it serves its purpose of holding the brushes. Overall as long as you like a few of the brushes (which I did) it is a good value.</li>
            <li> I am a male who purchased this brush set with the shanay 120 color eye shadow and she loved it, this product compliments my other purchase, i was looking for affordability and items and brand now i do not know anything about brands for make up but coastal sounded good would recommend as a gift to compliment another and for women who just want brushes for good price</li>
            <li> This is my first real brush set. I&#x27;m new to makeup and this serves the purpose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. I&#x27;ve been using them over a month now practically daily and they aren&#x27;t falling apart. Good Deal</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are very soft and feel nice on my skin. They also pick a lot of product and makes everything very easy to blend. I&#x27;ve cleaned it a few times and they are still very fluffy. It&#x27;s amazing how well made they are for just 18 bucks. The handle is very \\&quot;steady\\&quot; and I feel like it&#x27;s never gonna break or fall apart. It lost a star for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- One is because the case smells funny, not the brushes as some reviewers might say. It doesn&#x27;t bother me greatly, and I found out that if you take the brushes out of it, the smell leaves them. The other thing about the case is that if you flip it, half of the brushes will fall out of it (one more reason to dislike the case). Besides these cons, the case actually doesn&#x27;t look bad itself.&lt;br /&gt;- The other reason why it lost a star is very minor and I guess it&#x27;s expected (look at the price tag again!), a little bit of hair came out of the bigger brushes. Not too many, but it is a little annoying sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would STILL strongly recommend this set if you are like me, who doesn&#x27;t like/want/have a lot of money to spend with big brands (look at all these other things I can buy with the extra $20 bucks I&#x27;m saving :P), but still want nice things and look good everyday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set because I do a fair amount of traveling throughout the year and I wanted something that would all bundle together for easy packing. I was not disappointed!  The brushes are great quality and the stylish carrier rolls together and buttons for easy storage.  It&#x27;s wonderful not to have to dig through drawers of make up in order to find the correct brush.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not too great, but OK, I was using the blush brush, and some of hairs from the brush were on my FACE, but blending is a good brush...</li>
            <li> i dont used the brushes as much as i wanted too but the one thing i dont like about the brushes is that they are way too soft and they come out....if im not cleaning my eyeshadow of my face...then im cleaning the brushes that fell off onto my face</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my 14 year old stepdaughter as a Christmas gift. She loves the set and has used almost every brush already. The best part is the carrying case. The entire set fits into her make-up case so they are always handy when she&#x27;s applying make-up. The overall quality of the actual brushes is good - but for the price they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> soy de Venezuela compre este set de de 12 brochas de verdad sin ninguna expectativa pero de verdad que me gusto mucho cuando llegaron las brochas se ven de buena calidad y esta muy bien, si quieren comprar este producto haganlo! les gustara</li>
            <li> If ur looking for a beginners set then this is for u, I personally don&#x27;t like to compare to bigger name companies bc I&#x27;m all about the under dog.....but I was disappointed w the quality of the brushes themselves, let alone the shipping cost more than the actual brushes?? Def paid more than they were worth after tax aaand shipping ;( lesson learned</li>
            <li> i recieved this product and use it everyday! i wash them every 3-4 days and their just as new! perfect, and dont have the hair falling out yet. All the brushes are amzing</li>
            <li> I travel a lot around the country and sometimes internationally and I HATE packing and worse seeing what make up to bring and if I&#x27;ll need all my brushes to come with or not. I&#x27;m just really glad that I bought this small set of brushes instead. I never use them when I&#x27;m at home since I already have the brushes I use everyday sitting on my bathroom counter. The 12 piece set its perfect for when I fly out! I&#x27;m the type that like sto have a make-up set to bring with me for an everyday use like the \\&quot;TOO FACED Natural Look\\&quot; make-up palette and an evening look make-up palette as well which makes things SO much easier!  It also brings its little case where every brush has it&#x27;s own place to go which is a plus and i can put it in my carry-on or purse for use if i need to retouch my make up or need to do a quick day-to-night look.  Sooo glad I bought this! I totally recommend it to anyone. The only problem with it is that because the case folds some of the hair in the brushes are bent as well, but the quality is still good and its nothing that a quick wash can&#x27;t fix. I just make sure to put the brushes that rest in the crease of the case in an area where it won&#x27;t affect the brush&#x27;s form :D</li>
            <li> Beyond Horrible. The bristles shed everywhere and the whole set smells of industry!</li>
            <li> Well I ordered these brushes about a month ago.  They were supposed to be at my house from a week to 12 days.  I was really exited!! But when my 12 days were here and gone I still didn&#x27;t have my brushes! AND to this day I still DO NOT have them!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice.  I just got them today.  They do not look like they are of \\&quot;goat&#x27; hair as advertised.  Even so, they are still nice.  No hair falling off or anything.  I was really reluctant to order because so many brush sets had bad reviews of hair falling off the brushes.  I looked at several and finally decided on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are nice so I am wondering if the other brushes would have been nice too.  Anyhow, there is a strong icky smell from the bag.  I am going to let it air out and hopefully the smell dissipates.  I washed the brushes because I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable to use them without doing so.  I would recommend washing because there were some murky colors coming out when I washed them.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is from the dye or if it&#x27;s been used.  I would tap dry the brushes and lay them flat to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are not wood, but of some plastic material.  Overall, I am pleased and this is a good set for the price!</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, mine didn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell that the other poster complained of. The brushes are very soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they work really really well so far. I love them and I love that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for them. They&#x27;re probably not AS GOOD as higher end products (like MAC brushes), but they work great for me.</li>
            <li> I do not know how to use all of the brushes (I am doing a research to learn more about them) but, the basic ones has a good quality and my make-up feels wonderful!  Eu ainda nao usei todos os pinceis, muitos nem sei a utilidade mas, fiquei surpresa com a qualidade. Eles sao muito bons, os tracos ficam lindos! Recomendo usa-los com alguns videos de maquiagem disponiveis na internet para ter um resultado surpreendente. Ah, o case e fantastico, eles vem embalados um a um nao correndo o risco de amassar.</li>
            <li> You really do get what you pay for. If you&#x27;re gonna use these brushes everyday, go the extra mile and pay for the more expensive ones. These are just too cheap</li>
            <li> I love it!! Product was neatly packaged, unbroken, and it arrived at a descent time frame after order was placed!!</li>
            <li> these brushes are straight-up fantastic. they are definitely professional quality and using them is like putting on make-up while bathing in a thousand soft and adorable puppies with ryan gossling whispering sweet nothings in your ear. you&#x27;d think that with brushes that soft it would not hold things such as mineral powder and blush very well and not much would transfer from the make-up container to the face, but it does. the brushes are also very easy to clean and are helpful when having a tickle fight! yay tickle fight!</li>
            <li> Mine just came today. When I opened the case, the brushes had chemical scents. However the brushes are great! I also have a Mac brush and they are very alike. Very soft and nice. For a $16.00 sets, I think these brushes are great!</li>
            <li> Purchased these a year ago and still love them today. They wash well and apply beautifully. The only brush I could have done without was the eyeshadow applicator threw that one out the Foundation brush applies beautifully and the the fan blends perfectly. My girls love playing with the eyelash comb and it has held up. The case can be wiped clean and the brush wash well with simple dish soap. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a standard make up application set. Has all your basics and stands up very well. *Also works really well with stage make up.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes a whole lot. I use them for everything makeup related because they are such a great and cheap alternative to the expensive name brand brushes. They are the same quality for a fraction of the price. So what they don&#x27;t have a designer name up the side? They still work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought brushes before, but this collection is wonderful. I&#x27;ve used them every day for a couple of months and they are fantastic. The case isn&#x27;t amazing, but it protects the brushes. Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> love these brushes they are for a good price and they are good quality. i just wish there were more than i would be satisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month and a half ago, and it survived severl washes, applacations, and travealing in my purse. Even after all of that it still feels and works as good as new!  It did have the smell as previous reviews mentioned, but it wore off in a two weeks. Another downside was the plastic wrapers on the brushes, didn&#x27;t last very long and I ended up throwing them away soon after I bought the brushes.  I deeply recommend this product to anyone who wants professional make-up artist brushes, at drug store make-up price.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brush kit available! From small liner brushes to huge powder brushes and everything in between! Highly recommed!</li>
            <li> Where can I start... This brushes are not even better than good.... it is not as soft like what others said, they do smell like rubber or that very fake leather smell, my room smelled like it every time I walked in. They are cheaply made. The Handles are not very attractive, I mean even an ordinary art paint brushes look and feel better.     WARNING: Please don&#x27;t buy this item if you know brushes, When I got mine, I had to use my scissor to even out the brushes because they are not cut evenly. Its a frustrating brush. I washed my brushes when I got it because I cant handle the smell also I can&#x27;t even imagine how dirty it is coming out of the factory.    When I washed it, The color from the brushes started coming off and I have a MAC Cleanser, kept doing that 4 times until I have a clear suds, now this brushes are not dark brown they&#x27;re light brown. After it dried the bristles are sticking out, it lost it&#x27;s shape. I haven&#x27;t even used it yet. This item should not cost $12, $8 is more like it. I will have a review about this brushes on youtube soon. So people can see it closer and think twice bout purchasing this item.     All and all I can deal with the smell cause you can wash it away eventually, but I can&#x27;t handle the brushes itself.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a wonder set of make up brushes. Once products were received and package open, it smelled like a chemical set. Don&#x27;t know if it was from the package or combination of both. I can purchas make up brushes from a discounted store and get better quality! [[ASIN:B002WEBTPW Coastal Scents 12 Piece Brush Set With Case]]</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, Coastal Scents 12 Piece Brush Set with case. My wife has liked a lot.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical to order these brushes because I wanted a good set.  For the price, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier.  The brushes of are good quality and the brush case is nice.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> you really get a decent array of brushes for what you pay for, here. some of the brushes are a little better than others, and i&#x27;ve had some trouble with shedding, even after washing with brush cleaner. the case also does smell, i wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unpleasant but it&#x27;s definitely a very plastick-y scent. it did dissipate after awhile, but has never full gone away. overall, still a decent set for the price. but if you&#x27;re looking for high-quality, spend the extra money and get something else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brush set; unfortunately, the pouch smells like moth-balls!  I wiped down the pouch with furniture polish, and still it smelled.  Then I sprayed the pouch with Lysol--the smell remained.  I placed the pouch in the freezer for several hours.  The same result.  \\&quot;Time\\&quot; did the trick.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good little deal. Nice little soft black pouch which makes things easy to pack up and store. Also, there is a clear plastic protector which the brushes kind of fold into. This makes sure there is no mess and the brushes are protected in the pouch. The foundation brush was my only disappointment. Bristles came out like crazy. So, I have replaced that brush. But, the rest work fine. A good deal and I recommend for a beginner to get set up on a budget.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes i was looking for something soft enough, but at a low price. this is exactly what i wanted they are soft comparable to drug store brands. as for the bag it does have a strong plastic smell to it, but not a big deal. one problem i had was that the brushes did shed a little, but i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be at high quality standards, but they are good quality for the price. i washed the brushes and they have a funny smell, but maybe with a stronger smelling shampoo it will go away. another problem was that the blending brush is very small, but i guess it does the job slowly but surely.Some of the tools i found pointless was the wand for the mascara, the eyebrow and eyelash comb (i never use it), and the sponge applicator that usually comes with eye shadows. So... if your looking for a set of brushes at a GOOD QUALITY for a good PRICE this is the PRODUCT you want.</li>
            <li> Bought this set from Amazon in January. Came in quickly, great set. I use it everyday. Very fine quality brushes, some say the case smelled weird but mine didn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> These brushes do not smell like chemicals the case does. You can clean the brushes with a creme rinse and re shape them. If you know how to care for brushes these are great. If you&#x27;re a novice at brush care don&#x27;t bother, you&#x27;ll just throw them out. Overall good brushes for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Awesome makeup brushes, very smooth! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommmend this set. Not only are they great brushes, but they&#x27;re also at such a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was a great set for a beginner like myself. package arrived fast. before i can even use the powder brush it fell off the handle. a very thin glue ball was hanging off and i was pissed. i had just taken out the brush felt the bristles and off  it went. DONT BUY IT. I suggest e.l.f dollar brushes instead of these</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I noticed that the brushes smelled like bug spray from the cheap case - I threw the case away. I had to wash the brushes about three times to get the smell out of them. They&#x27;re not very soft so they hurt my skin a little. The blush brush in particular barely picks up any product so I have to go over my cheeks a bunch of times with a scratchy brush. The rest of the smaller brushes are fine and I especially like the angled liner brush. I prefer the drug store eco-tools over these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are cheap and you get what you pay for. The foundation brush is flimsy it really doesn&#x27;t hold that much product in or on them nor does it apply well. However, I knew that upon purchasing this a long time ago, you can just tell by looking at the picture lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few brushes that work just fine which is why I had gotten the kset to begin with. The shadow brushes are not that bad, they work just fine. I&#x27;d say that the brush I use the most would be the liner brush since I use it as a back up and NOW use it every day on my brows. The shadow/liner brush/brushes are a nice back up. So if you need an extra back up set don&#x27;t sell this set short just yet but it is useful is many ways : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you need an excellent foundation brush guys, get a kabuki brush. You will never go back I promise you that. Elf has one really cheap and it&#x27;s even better than the $30 Kabuki brush I had at my last cosmetics job! So get one! as well as getting this set as a back up, hehe : )</li>
            <li> I love love love it!bought it with 120 eye make up shadow palette!worth my money!!!will buy again for gifts! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> brush quality was ok, but the case spelled awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas. I could not get past the horrilble way the brushes and the packages smelled. I attemepted to brush them on my skin and they were not very soft and arm started to smell like the packaging so I just ended up throwing the brush set in the trash.</li>
            <li> Both these brushes from Coastal Scent. Affordable and quality brushes. Actually I bought a set with the Eyeshadow palettes and sold to my co-workers.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is real nice to have a good variety of tools in one compact case. The brushes are good enough quality for day to day use. Definitely not professional quality but overall a nice set for the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the eye shadow brushes, which are very good indeed. However, the brushes and bag had a strong odor upon arrival. This had to be aired out for two days. Also, the blush brushes are rough, therefore I am already searching for a new set.     I would not waste my money on this set.</li>
            <li> This set is great for home and travel.</li>
            <li> so i recieved this pallet only 4 days after ordering it, that was impressive. for the total of 12 dollars i paid for this set, i believe it was worth it. it is a decent starter set. not a pro set. it did have a funky smell. currently airing them out. so well see. i have used most of them, and they serve there purpose. the brush roll is actually nice...cons, the handles are very cheap feeling. kind of like painted wood. i have a some shedding. hope my review helped :) :) :)</li>
            <li> The collection is great for its price. The case does smell a bit due to the manufacturing process, but it is not a big issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read others&#x27; comments on the smell of their brushes or the case they came in and mine does smell like paint and something else, but it isn&#x27;t a smell that bothers me.  I expected something for maybe a &#x27;new case smell&#x27; if that makes any sense.  Other than that, I love the case and the brushes, though I haven&#x27;t used them yet (so I should probably leave this review after using them but I think they&#x27;ll be just fine) and when my mother was taking a look at them she was impressed.  The brushes looked promising in the picture and I&#x27;m quite pleased to have received them looking as they do in the picture both in softness, sturdyiness and usefulness.  I&#x27;m still not real big on makeup but from what I&#x27;m told, read, and felt, these brushes are very good and at a great price :3 No need for the really expensive brand name stuff when you have these (or at least, that&#x27;s how I feel about it.)</li>
            <li> Got this kit with the E.L.F. Ultimate Eyeshadow Palette.  If you don&#x27;t know what that is, I suggest you look it up.  This kit has every brush and the palette has every color.  So combined, this is the ultimate makeup artists kit!  If you don&#x27;t want to be a makeup artist you can use it for halloween or anything really.  If you use this variety of brushes and that variety of color on a daily basis, you should really think about being a makeup artist professionally.  This kit is a great start.  Only a few bristles fall out initially but the ones that are in are in for good.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the other reviews, I purchased it my self and found this product to be incredible useful and a great bargain for the price. I do add that from reading several other reviews that the case does indeed have a smell when you first receive it,but taking out all the brushes and allowing it to air out does eliminate the odor. Other then that,awesome!,definitely helps me to distribute my makeup perfectly.</li>
            <li> I loved all the brushes in this set! The handles are really sturdy, and look very professional. My favorite brush was the fan brush which at first look I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like at all but for blush its absolutely perfect I don&#x27;t use anything else for it!     I recommend it completely amazing price just 6.20 and even the 5.95 shipping price was worth it!</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes! They are very soft and none of the hairs fell out for me. The package does stink a bit but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for good brushes, don&#x27;t buy this set. The larger lip brush sheds really badly, leaving hairs in your lipstick and on your lips embedded in the lipstick. The blush brush seems fine for now though. No major shedding. They are softer than I expected for cheap brushes. The lip liner brush is not too bad. It does it&#x27;s job without shedding. But it seems that you have to put a lot of lipstick on the brush for it to actually transfer to your lips, which seems like a waste.    I haven&#x27;t used the other brushes other than those listed above. And the \\&quot;silk sponge\\&quot; listed in the product list is a small eyeshadow puff like you get in cheap eye shadow kits, except it&#x27;s \\&quot;silk\\&quot; and I don&#x27;t really believe it&#x27;s silk. Not at all. I would personally go and spend a few dollars per brush at a local store or buy online but do not get the Make Up Geek (makeupgeek.com) brushes because they are the same brushes as this so I&#x27;ve heard.    Next time I buy makeup brushes I will definitely spend a few dollars per brush either in a local store or online. It&#x27;s worth it.    So all in all, do not buy these brushes unless you want to spend $2 per brush and get nasty brushes. It&#x27;s just not worth it. ($2 per brush &#x3D; price of set plus shipping divided by 12 brushes.)</li>
            <li> The carrying bag is very cheap.  The brushes are okay.  You get what you pay for?!?  The eyeshadow brushes are great, the powder brushes are not that good.</li>
            <li> There were some problems with this order, intrinsic to the brushes&#x27; case. Amazon customer service was great about improving the situation for me. Brushes are difficult to order on the internet.</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes they are very soft and easy to wash and drys quickly i really do recemend these brushes</li>
            <li> Value, an understatement. I received the case and 13 brushes for the face, eyes and made the perfect gift choice says my friend. would recommend as a great starter or travel kit to have.</li>
            <li> When I order this item I was kinda of thinking the brushes may break but I ordered it and I have to say all the brushes are so soft!!!! It comes with 12 brushes of each kind and a bag to have them in. Its a good set for a good price!!!</li>
            <li> good selection of brushes, good for the price, does not shed hair, all necessary brushes in set. high recommended, case included which is compact</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! I spent 13 for the whole set. I love the way they work and they are good quality! I do own MAC and SIGMA brushes and I found a couple of the flatter brushes in this set that weren&#x27;t sold thru make that I really like. Overall these are great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> all the brushes are in there like said and they all work amazing. the case is so convenient and makes life easier</li>
            <li> Once I received the brushes TWO of them broke instantly!!!! There&#x27;s no blending brush !! But over all the brushes are not that bad . I must say a lot of the brushes look exactly the same ( flat &amp; stiff) I think this brush set is good for putting on concealer &amp; blush. Other than that ..... Not worth it</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter, the product is okay. the quality of the product is not the best, but i guess you get what you pay for. it included all the brushes needed but the quality was kinda cheap</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES. THE VARIETY DOES WHAT I NEED, SINCE IM NOT A PROFESSIONAL. I DO MY OWN MAKE UP AND THESE ARE VERY ADEQUATE FOR ME</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes are very good. The brushes are soft, and the don&#x27;t lose their form. The shipment was on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes over a year ago and they are in excellent condition! No broken handles, no shedding hairs, they&#x27;re great! I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday and that might be why they&#x27;ve lasted so long, but I wear it often enough where I should see wear and tear by now. I love coastal scents and I&#x27;m glad that i chose these brushes!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to see that this product was everything I&#x27;ve hoped. Very good quality and very great price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of great quality and i really enjyed the variety of sizes and types made available. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for nearly 5 years now and all the brushes are still intact and are used FREQUENTLY. The case is pretty handy too, my only issue is I with it had more shadow brushes and a kabuki face brush.</li>
