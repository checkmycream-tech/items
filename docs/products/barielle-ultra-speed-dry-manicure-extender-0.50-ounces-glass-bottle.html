            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years with great success.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>After my manicure, I always use this top coat when I get home for added protection and shine.</li>
            <li>I love Barielle products.</li>
            <li>I recommend purchasing in store instead so you are able to take a look at it or return it without any hassles.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I can usually go a full 7 days with no chipping!  </li>
            <li>Great speed dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>Dries quick and really lasts.</li>
            <li>I really like this product; it is quick drying and does indeed extend a manicure.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased one bottle - after trying it a few times I bought 6 more!   </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, but I think they may have changed their formula more recently.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Barielle seems to be the best kept secret in nail health!</li>
            <li>and so I pretty much gave up on having pretty nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not goopy and dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this speed dry as I already use the gel top coat.  </li>
            <li>Drys fast and shiny and extends the manicure just as it says.  </li>
            <li>I work a very hands-on job</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this topcoat!</li>
            <li>This quick dry does exactly what it promises.  </li>
            <li>It gives your polished nails new shine that lasts for days!   </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm and keeps my color fresh until my next appointment.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quite fast, but it&#x27;s extra shiny, and best of all it is dries quite hard.</li>
            <li>I heard about this top coat through a friend of a friend and ordered it desperate for a better manicure protector.</li>
            <li>so much I usually never bother with painting them, I read up about this product and figured I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>This polish is suppose to be clear as I have purchased it at a store before.  </li>
            <li>I guess I recieved an old one.</li>
            <li>This quick dry product actually works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;ve used for the past 2 months</li>
            <li>I feel like it really does help my manicures last longer, especially because I&#x27;m prone to picking a peeling.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is suppose to be clear but has a yellow tint.</li>
            <li>Only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as you&#x27;d think.</li>

            <li> Probably my favorite top coat! It&#x27;s not goopy and dries pretty fast. Wonderful coverage and a great shine! Not severely pungent either. I feel like it really does help my manicures last longer, especially because I&#x27;m prone to picking a peeling.</li>
            <li> Not happy with purchase.  This polish is suppose to be clear as I have purchased it at a store before.  The one I received had a pink tint to it. This is not a inexpensive polish so I will not purchase from this buyer again.</li>

            <li> I apply this on my nails two or three days after my manicure. It has a great shine and dries quickly. This truly keeps my at home manicure lasting longer.</li>
